      <title>Can we learn from matter creation to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $H_{0}$ tension problem is studied in the light of a matter creation mechanism (an effective approach to replacing dark energy), the way to define the matter creation rate being of pure phenomenological nature. Bayesian (probabilistic) Machine Learning is used to learn the constraints on the free parameters of the models, with the learning being based on the generated expansion rate, $H(z)$. Taking advantage of the method, the constraints for three redshift ranges are learned. Namely, for the two redshift ranges: $z\in [0,2]$~(cosmic chronometers) and $z\in [0,2.5]$~(cosmic chronometers + BAO), covering already available $H(z)$ data, to validate the learned results; and for a third redshift interval, $z\in[0,5]$, for forecasting purposes. It is learned that the $3\alpha H_{0}$ term in the creation rate provides options that have the potential to solve the $H_{0}$ tension problem.</description>

      <title>Horndeski speed tests with scalar-photon couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit multi-messenger constraints from neutron star mergers on the speed of propagation of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in Horndeski and beyond Horndeski theories. By considering non-trivial couplings between the dark energy field and the electromagnetic sector, the electromagnetic wave can propagate through the cosmological background at non-unit speed, altering the phenomenological constraints on its gravitational counterpart. In particular, we show that recent models derived from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of higher dimensional Horndeski models fall into a broader class of theories disformally related to those whose gravitational waves propagate with unit speed. This disformal equivalence can, however, be broken by the gravitational couplings to other sectors with interesting phenomenological consequences. We also consider higher order couplings between the scalar and the photon with second order field equations, and show that they are not compatible with constraints coming from multi-messenger speed tests and the decay of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <title>Exceeding the conformal limit inside rotating neutron stars: Implications to modified theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the supranuclear densities achieved inside a neutron star, matter may exhibit extreme properties. In particular, it may be the case that a suitable average of the speed of sound squared exceeds the so-called conformal limit, i.e., $\langle c_s^2 \rangle &gt; 1/3$, a condition that is equivalent to the positiveness of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor at the stellar center. This property, that holds for highly compact neutron stars obeying many (but not any) realistic equations of state, would turn these objects into interesting laboratories for tests of several scalar extensions of general relativity. In this paper, we investigate how rapid rotation influences the superconformality of the averaged speed of sound squared and modified gravity effects that depend thereupon, paying particular attention to scalar-tensor theories prone to the spontaneous scalarization effect.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking as a result of extra dimensions compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider dynamics of a scalar field in compactification scenario of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology. It is shown that if the field is non-minimally coupled to curvature, its asymptotic value under certain conditions may be shifted from the minimum of its potential. This means that due to influence of extra dimensions a scalar field with $\lambda \phi^4$ potential can stabilise away from $\phi=0$ stable point which means an effective symmetry breaking occurs in such a system.</description>

      <title>Automated determination of the end time of junk radiation in binary black hole simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When numerically solving Einstein's equations for the evolution of binary black holes, physical imperfections in the initial data manifest as a transient, high-frequency pulse of ''junk radiation.'' This unphysical signal must be removed before the waveform can be used. Improvements in the efficiency of numerical simulations now allow waveform catalogs containing thousands of waveforms to be produced. Thus, an automated procedure for identifying junk radiation is required. To this end, we present a new algorithm based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) from the Hilbert-Huang transform. This approach allows us to isolate and measure the high-frequency oscillations present in the measured irreducible masses of the black holes. The decay of these oscillations allows us to estimate the time from which the junk radiation can be ignored. To make this procedure more precise, we propose three distinct threshold criteria that specify how small the contribution of junk radiation has to be before it can be considered negligible. We apply this algorithm to 3403 BBH simulations from the SXS catalog to find appropriate values for the thresholds in the three criteria. We find that this approach yields reliable decay time estimates, i.e., when to consider the simulation physical, for over 98.6% of the simulations studied. This demonstrates the efficacy of the EMD as a suitable tool to automatically isolate and characterize junk radiation in the simulation of binary black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Mixmaster Universe in a 2D non-commutative GUP framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the dynamical aspects of the cosmological Mixmaster model within the framework of non-commutative generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) theories. The theory is formulated classically by introducing a well-defined symplectic form that differs from the ordinary one, thereby inducing a general deformation of the Poisson brackets describing a precise class of GUP theories. In this general setting, we first investigate the behavior of the Bianchi I and Bianchi II models using Misner variables. Then, we study the Bianchi IX model in the Mixmaster approximation, which is well-known for accurately reproducing the dynamics of the point-particle Universe approaching the cosmological singularity. We derive the corresponding Belinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) map and then, by selecting a specific GUP model associated with string theory, we explicitly investigate its resulting features shaped by the non-commutative GUP scheme. Our findings reveal that the chaotic and ergodic behavior typically observed in the standard BKL map, which characterizes the point-Universe's approach to the singularity, is replaced by quasi-periodic orbits in the parameter space of the theory. This corresponds to an oscillatory behavior of the Universe's scale factors, dependent on the initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Linear-Quadratic GUP and Thermodynamic Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the statistical mechanics within the Linear-Quadratic GUP (LQGUP, i.e, GUP with linear and quadratic terms in momentum) models in the semiclassical regime. Then, some thermodynamic properties of a system of 3-dimensional harmonic oscillators are investigated by calculating the deformed partition functions. According to the equipartition theorem, we show that the number of accessible microstates decreases sharply in the very high temperatures regime. When the thermal de Broglie wavelength is of the order of the Planck length, three degrees of freedom are frozen in this setup. In other words, it is observed that there is an effective reduction of the degrees of freedom from 6 to 3 for a system of 3D harmonic oscillators in this framework. The calculations are carried out using both approximate analytical and exact numerical methods. The results of the analytical method are also presented in the form of thermal wavelengths for better understanding. Finally, the case of a 2-dimensional harmonic is treated as another example to comprehend the results, leading to a reduction of the degrees of freedom from 4 to 2.</description>

      <title>The Kramers escape rate of phase transitions for the 6-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole with triple phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we obtain specific picture of the phase transitions for the 6-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole with triple phases, using the generalized free energy we constructed and Kramers escape rate in stochastic motion. There are six possible phase transition processes between the three different stable states (small, medium, and large black hole states). During these phase transitions, there are two key temperatures. One is the temperature at which the medium black hole state emerges, and the other is the temperature at which the small black hole state annihilates. Meanwhile, two dynamic equilibrium processes are formed. One is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the medium black hole state to the large black hole state and the transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state. The other is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state and the transition from the medium black hole state to the small black hole state.</description>

      <title>Ray Tracing Through Absorbing Dielectric Media in the Schwarzschild Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity describes the trajectories of light-rays through curved spacetime near a massive object. In addition to gravitational lensing, we include an absorbing dielectric medium given by a complex refractive index known as the Drude model. When absorption is included the eikonal becomes complex, with the imaginary part related to the absorption along a ray between emission and observation points. We extend results from the literature to include dispersion in the index of refraction. The complex Hamiltonian splits into a real part that describes the equations of motion and a constraint equation that governs the momentum loss in the system. We work in coordinates which are fully real, with a real metric in physical spacetime. We assume the dust and plasma distributions of the Drude matter to coincide and vary as a power-law $1/r^h$. We find that transmission requires $h&gt;1$, otherwise exponential absorption occurs along ray paths. We use ray-tracing through strongly absorbing matter near the surface of the compact star, as well as specializing to a point-lens in the weak-field limit with weakly absorbing matter to generate potentially observable light curves for distant observers. In the appropriate limits, our theory reproduces results from the literature.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Study of Bouncing Cosmological Models in $f(Q,T)$ Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this article is to investigate the viability of bouncing cosmological scenarios using different forms of scale factors with perfect matter configuration in the framework of extended symmetric teleparallel theory. This modified proposal is defined by the function $f(Q,T)$, where $Q$ characterizes non-metricity and $T$ denotes the trace of energy-momentum tensor. We investigate the modified field equations of this theory using different parametric values of the Hubble parameter and non-metricity to derive viable solutions. These solutions are relevant in various cosmological bounce models such as symmetric-bounce, super-bounce, oscillatory-bounce, matter-bounce and exponential-bounce models. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of energy density and pressure to analyze the characteristics of dark energy. A comprehensive analysis is also conducted to explore the behavior of the equation of state parameter and deceleration parameter to examine the evolutionary eras of the cosmos. Our findings show that the $f(Q,T)$ gravity describes the cosmic expansion in the vicinity of the bouncing point during the early and late times of cosmic evolution.</description>

      <title>Four $\mathbb{S}\mathbb{T}\mathbb{U}$ Black Holes Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the optical behaviors and thermodynamic phase structures using shadow analysis for four $\mathbb{S}\mathbb{T}\mathbb{U}$ black holes. The study is conducted for four cases of charge configurations on the parameter space $\mathcal{M}\left(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4\right)$. As a matter of fact, both the electric charge as a parameter and the parameter space $\mathcal{M}\left(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4\right)$ affect the geometry of the black hole shadow, particularly the size of the shadow. We also introduce a constraint on the charge of the black hole from the observational results of the M87$^\star$ {\color{black}and Sgr A$^\star$} shadow. Furthermore, we show that the electric charge and the parameter space $\mathcal{M}\left(q_1,q_2,q_3,q_4\right)$ have a non-trivial impact on the variation of the energy emission rate. Interestingly enough, we find novel scenarios in which the evaporation is slower, which causes the lifetime of the black holes to be considerably elongated. On the other side, the phase structure of four $\mathbb{S}\mathbb{T}\mathbb{U}$ black holes is explored for two cases of electric charge configuration. The findings show a perfect correlation between the shadow and event horizon radii. This correlation is, in fact, helpful in discovering the phase transition in terms of the shadow radius. In addition, the microstructure is being analyzed in terms of shadow analysis, providing similar behavior to the ordinary situation of the Ruppeiner formalism.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive areal inequalities for five types of attractive gravity probe surfaces, which were proposed by us in order to characterize the strength of gravity in different ways including weak gravity region, taking into account of contributions of electric and magnetic charges, angular momentum, gravitational waves, and matters. These inequalities are generalizations of the Riemannian Penrose inequality for minimal surfaces, and lead to the concept of extremality for a given surface whose condition is given in terms of the gravitational mass and the electromagnetic charges. This means that the extremality is a characteristic property not only of black hole horizons or minimal surfaces but also of surfaces in weak gravity region. We also derive areal inequalities and extremality conditions for surfaces in asymptotically locally anti-de Sitter spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formulation for scalar model of spontaneous spacetime symmetry violation in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The focus of this article is on a modification of General Relativity (GR) governed by a dynamical scalar field. The latter is able to acquire a nonzero spacetime-dependent vacuum expectation value, which gives rise to a spontaneous violation of spacetime symmetries. Based on the (3+1) decomposition, we demonstrate how to develop the Hamiltonian formulation for this model. Having done so, our primary interest is to understand how spontaneous spacetime symmetry violation manifests itself in such a setting. In particular, we find that the constraint structure of GR is preserved, although the constraints are clearly modified by the scalar background field. These results emphasize the beauty of spontaneous spacetime symmetry violation in gravity from the viewpoint of the Hamiltonian formulation. They may pose the base for further studies of more sophisticated models of vector and higher-rank tensor fields. Moreover, the description developed can bear fruits when applied within phenomenological quests for spacetime symmetry violation in gravity, in particular, at cosmological scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes are crucial in understanding the ringdown phase after a merger. While for Kerr black holes these modes have been known for a long time, their calculation has remained a challenge in alternative theories of gravity. We obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-dilaton theory without resorting to perturbation theory in the coupling constant. Our approach is based on a spectral decomposition of the linear perturbations of the metric and the scalar field. The quasinormal modes approach smoothly the slow rotation and weak coupling limits known from perturbative studies.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition Dynamics of Black Holes Influenced by Kaniadakis and Barrow Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics and frame-by-frame phase transition of the first order in black hole thermodynamics. For our analysis, we will utilize the Kramers escape rate. Our focus is on charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes influenced by Kaniadakis and Barrow statistics. The selection of these black holes aims to examine the effects of entropy variation on the dynamics of phase transition and to demonstrate that the Kramers escape rate, as an efficient tool, can effectively represent the dynamic transition from a small to a large black hole within the domain of first-order phase transitions. It is noteworthy that while the transition from small to large black holes should ostensibly dominate the entire process, our results indicate that the escape rate undergoes changes as it passes through the midpoint of the phase transition, leading to a reverse escape phenomenon. The findings suggest that the dynamic phase transition in charged AdS black holes affected by entropy change bears a significant resemblance to the outcomes of models influenced by Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\cite{23}. This similarity in results could serve as an additional motivation to further explore the potential capabilities of Kaniadakis and Barrow statistics in related cosmological fields. These capabilities could enhance our understanding of other cosmological properties</description>

      <title>Quadrupole formulae with cosmological constant: comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider three different approaches (by Ashtekar, Bonga and Kesavan; Hoque and Virmani; and Dobkowski-Ry\l{}ko and Lewandowski) to investigate gravitational radiation produced by time changing matter source in de Sitter spacetime. All of them lead to generalizations of the quadrupole formula, however, due to different gauge conditions and choices of the hypersurfaces, across which the energy flux is computed, it is nontrivial to see that they all coincide, as one would expect from the symplectic theory. Each of the expressions for the radiated energy in the form of gravitational waves is expressed in terms of the mass and pressure quadrupole moments and written explicitly up to the linear order in $\sqrt{\Lambda}$, or equvalently in Hubble parameter $H$. It is shown that up to the first order all three of the generalizations of the quadrupole formula agree.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point and hysteresis in perturbations of Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the isomonodromic method to study linear scalar massive perturbations of Kerr black holes for generic scalar masses $M\mu$ and generic black hole spins $a/M$. A degeneracy between the longest-living quasinormal mode and the first overtone is found for $(M\mu)_c \simeq 0.3704981$ and $(a/M)_c\simeq 0.9994660$. We show that the longest-living mode and the first overtone change continuously into each other as we vary the parameters around the point of degeneracy, providing evidence for the existence of a geometric phase around an exceptional point. We interpret our findings through a thermodynamic analogy.</description>

      <title>General Relativistic Magneto-Hydrodynamic Simulations with BAM: Implementation and Code Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers are among the most energetic events in our Universe, with magnetic fields significantly impacting their dynamics, particularly after the merger. While numerical-relativity simulations that correctly describe the physics are essential to model their rich phenomenology, the inclusion of magnetic fields is crucial for realistic simulations. For this reason, we have extended the BAM code to enable general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations employing a hyperbolic `divergence cleaning' scheme. We present a large set of standard GRMHD tests and compare the BAM code to other GRMHD codes, SPRITZ, GRaM-X, and SACRA$_{\rm KK22}$, which employ different schemes for the evolution of the magnetic fields. Overall, we find that the BAM code shows a good performance in simple special-relativistic tests. In addition, we find good agreement and consistent results when comparing GRMHD simulation results between BAM and SACRA$_{\rm KK22}$.</description>

      <title>Rates and beaming angles of GRBs associated with compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some, if not all, binary neutron star (BNS) coalescences, and a fraction of neutron - star black hole (NSBH) mergers, are thought to produce sufficient mass-ejection to power Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). However, this fraction, as well as the distribution of beaming angles of BNS-associated GRBs, are poorly constrained from observation. Recent work applied machine learning tools to analyze GRB light curves observed by {\textit{Fermi}}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT. GRBs were segregated into multiple distinct clusters, with the tantalizing possibility that one of them (BNS cluster) could be associated with BNSs and another (NSBH cluster) with NSBHs. As a proof of principle, assuming that all GRBs detected by {\it Fermi}/GBM and {\it Swift}/BAT associated with BNSs (NSBHs) lie in the BNS (NSBH) cluster, we estimate their rates ($\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$). We compare these rates with corresponding BNS and NSBH rates estimated by the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) collaboration from the first three observing runs (O1, O2, O3). We find that the BNS rates are consistent with LVK's rate estimates, assuming a uniform distribution of beaming fractions ($f_b \in [0.01, 0.1]$). Conversely, using the LVK's BNS rate estimates, assuming all BNS mergers produce GRBs, we are able to constrain the beaming angle distribution to $\theta_j \in [0.8^{\circ}, 38.8^{\circ}]$ at $90\%$ confidence. We similarly place a lower limit on the fraction of GRB-Bright NSBHs to $f_B \gtrsim 0.10$ ($f_B \gtrsim 0.022$) with {\it Fermi}/GBM ({\it Swift}/BAT) data.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Spectrum of Near-Extremal Black Holes: semiclassical brane solutions to non-perturbative problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The black hole entropy has been observed to generically turn negative at exponentially low temperatures $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ in the extremal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_0$, a seeming pathology often attributed to missing non-perturbative effects. In fact, we show that this negativity must happen for any effective theory of quantum gravity with an ensemble description. To do so, we identify the usual gravitational entropy as an annealed entropy $S_a$, and prove that this quantity gives $S_0$ at extremality if and only if the ground-state energy is protected by supersymmetry, and diverges negatively otherwise. The actual thermodynamically-behaved quantity is the average or quenched entropy $S_q$, whose calculation is poorly understood in gravity: it involves replica wormholes in a regime where the topological expansion breaks down. Using matrix integrals we find new instanton saddles that dominate gravitational correlators at $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ and are dual to semiclassical wormholes involving dynamical branes. These brane solutions give the leading contribution to any black hole very near extremality, and a duality with matrix ensembles would not make sense without them. In the non-BPS case, they are required to make $S_q$ non-negative and also enhance the negativity of $S_a$, both effects consistent with matrix integrals evaluated exactly. Our instanton results are tested against the on-shell action of D3-branes dual to multiply wrapped Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-YM, and a precise match is found. Our analysis of low-energy random matrix spectra also explains the origin of spectral gaps in supersymmetric theories, not only when there are BPS states at zero energy, but also for purely non-BPS supermultiplets. In the former, our prediction for the gap in terms of the degeneracy of BPS states agrees with the R-charge scaling in gapped multiplets of $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Delayed jet launching in binary neutron star mergers with realistic initial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a long-lived hyper-massive neutron star merger remnant (post-merger lifetime $&gt;250$ ms) that has been obtained via large eddy simulations with a gradient subgrid-scale model. We find a clear helicoidal magnetic field structure that is governed by the toroidal component of the magnetic field. Although no jet emerges during the simulation time, we observe at late times a significant increase of the poloidal component of the magnetic field at all scales. We also compare with the results of several binary neutron star simulations with moderate resolution of $120$~m, that are evolved up to $50$~ms after the merger, which differ in terms of the initial topology and strength of the magnetic field. We find that the best choice is an isotropic small-scale magnetic field distribution that mimics the turbulent state that generically develops during the merger. This initial configuration reaches a closer agreement with our high-resolution simulation results than the purely dipolar large-scale fields that are commonly employed in these type of simulations. This provides a recipe to perform such simulations avoiding the computationally expensive grids required to faithfully capture the amplification of the magnetic field by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr data set: Posterior predictive checks for gravitational-wave detection with pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar-timing-array experiments have reported evidence for a stochastic background of nanohertz gravitational waves consistent with the signal expected from a population of supermassive--black-hole binaries. Those analyses assume power-law spectra for intrinsic pulsar noise and for the background, as well as a Hellings--Downs cross-correlation pattern among the gravitational-wave--induced residuals across pulsars. These assumptions are idealizations that may not be realized in actuality. We test them in the NANOGrav 15 yr data set using Bayesian posterior predictive checks: after fitting our fiducial model to real data, we generate a population of simulated data-set replications, and use them to assess whether the optimal-statistic significance, inter-pulsar correlations, and spectral coefficients assume extreme values for the real data when compared to the replications. We confirm that the NANOGrav 15 yr data set is consistent with power-law and Hellings--Downs assumptions. We also evaluate the evidence for the stochastic background using posterior-predictive versions of the frequentist optimal statistic and of Bayesian model comparison, and find comparable significance (3.2\ $\sigma$ and 3\ $\sigma$ respectively) to what was previously reported for the standard statistics. We conclude with novel visualizations of the reconstructed gravitational waveforms that enter the residuals for each pulsar. Our analysis strengthens confidence in the identification and characterization of the gravitational-wave background as reported by NANOGrav.</description>

      <title>Quantum and thermal pressures from light scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields play a variety of roles in modern physics, especially in cosmology and modified theories of gravity. For this reason, there is a zoo of experiments actively trying to find evidence for many scalar field models that have been proposed in theoretical considerations. Among those are setups in which the pressures expected to be induced by light scalar fields between two parallel plates are studied, for example, Casimir force experiments. While it is known that classical and quantum pressures caused by light scalar fields could have significant impacts on such experiments, in this article, we show that this can also be the case for thermal pressure. More specifically, we derive expressions for the quantum and thermal pressures induced by exchanges of light scalar field fluctuations between two thin parallel plates. As particular examples, we then look at screened scalar fields. For chameleon, symmetron and environment-dependent dilaton models, we find large regions in their parameter spaces that allow for thermal pressures to equal or exceed the quantum pressures. By comparing with earlier constraints from quantum pressure calculations, we conclude that thermal pressures induced by chameleons are actually of experimental significance.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of a 2x2 Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance System with Varying Generalized Chaplygin Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of two balance laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer type with varying generalized Chaplygin gas, which exhibits negative pressure and is a product of a function of time and the inverse of a power of the density. The Chaplygin gas is a fluid designed to accommodate measurements for the early universe and late-time universal expansion while obeying the pressure-density-time relation. We produce an explanation and description of the non-self-similar Riemann solutions, including the non-classical singular solutions. We also find that due to a direct dependence on time, a change in the regions allowing for combinations of classical and non-classical singular solutions occurs, therefore a Riemann solution can have different solutions over several time intervals. Our findings are confirmed numerically using the local Lax-Friederichs scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation contains contributions from a region inside the black hole, which is called islands, implying that the Hawking radiation contains the information of islands. The boundary of the island is given by the quantum extremal surface, whose position is determined so that the entanglement entropy is extremized. In many cases of stationary black holes and a few cases of evaporating black holes, it was already confirmed that the quantum extremal surface is located outside the horizon for stationary black holes and is inside the horizon for evaporating black holes. In this paper, we calculate islands in general black holes and show that the island extends to the outside of the horizon for stationary black holes but is hidden inside the horizon for evaporating black holes independent of details of the black hole.</description>

Abstract: We investigate static cylindrical solutions within an extended theory of modified gravity. By incorporating various coupling functions through a straightforward boost symmetry approach, we establish the equations of motion in a self-consistent manner and subsequently determine the linear scalar field profile. Utilizing analytical methods, we solve the system of equations for the metric functions and the $U(1)$ gauge field, revealing their dependence on Bessel's functions. To comprehend gravito-objects exhibiting cylindrical symmetry, we develop a perturbative framework aimed at identifying all nontrivial solutions for the scalar profiles. Introducing first-order truncated perturbation equations for the gauge field, synchronized with metric gauges and electromagnetic field considerations, we demonstrate their integrability and obtain solutions through quadrature. Our findings suggest the feasibility of obtaining self-gravitating cylindrical structures within the scalar-vector-tensor theory.</description>

      <title>The Lensing Effect of Quantum-Corrected Black Hole and Parameter Constraints from EHT Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum-corrected black hole model demonstrates significant potential in the study of gravitational lensing effects. By incorporating quantum effects, this model addresses the singularity problem in classical black holes. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the quantum correction parameter on the lensing effect based on the quantum corrected black hole model. Using the black holes $M87^*$ and $Sgr A^*$ as our subjects, we explore the influence of the quantum correction parameter on angular position, Einstein ring, and time delay. Additionally, we use data from the Event Horizon Telescope observations of black hole shadows to constrain the quantum correction parameter. Our results indicate that the quantum correction parameter significantly affects the lensing coefficients $\bar{a}$ and $\bar{b}$, as well as the Einstein ring. The position $\theta_{\infty}$ and brightness ratio $S$ of the relativistic image exhibit significant changes,with deviations on the order of magnitude of $\sim 1\mu as$ and $\sim 0.01\mu as$, respectively. The impact of the quantum correction parameter on the time delay $\Delta T_{21}$ is particularly significant in the $M87^*$ black hole, with deviations reaching up to several tens of hours. Using observational data from the Event Horizon Telescope(EHT) of black hole shadows to constrain the quantum correction parameter, the constraint range under the $M87^*$ black hole is $0\le \frac{\alpha}{M^2}\le 1.4087$ and the constraint range under the $Sgr A^*$ black hole is $0.9713\le \frac{\alpha}{M^2}\le 1.6715$ . Although the current resolution of the EHT limits the observation of subtle differences, future high-resolution telescopes are expected to further distinguish between the quantum-corrected black hole and the Schwarzschild black hole, providing new avenues for exploring quantum gravitational effects.</description>

Abstract: We show that it is not possible to concentrate enough light to precipitate the formation of an event horizon. We argue that the dissipative quantum effects coming from the self-interaction of light (such as vacuum polarization) are enough to prevent any meaningful buildup of energy that could create a black hole in any realistic scenario.</description>

      <title>Atom falling into a quantum corrected charged black hole and HBAR entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an earlier analysis \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.085007}{Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 085007}, we have explored the event of acceleration radiation for an atom freely falling into the event horizon of a quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole. We want to explore the acceleration-radiation when the atom is freely falling into the event horizon of a charged quantum-corrected black hole. We consider the quantum effects of the electromagnetic field along with the gravitational field in an asymptotic safety regime. Introducing the quantum improved Reisner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, we have calculated the excitation probability of a two-level atom freely falling into the event horizon of quantum improved charged black hole. Recently, in the case of the braneworld black hole (where the tidal charge has the same dimension as the square of the charge of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole in natural units), we have observed from the form of the transition probability that the temperature will have no contribution in the first order of the tidal charge. We observe that for a quantum corrected Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole, there is a second-order contribution in the charge parameter in the temperature that can be read off from the transition probability. Next, we calculate the HBAR entropy in this thought experiment and show that this entropy has a leading order Bekenstein-Hawking entropy term along with some higher order correction terms involving logarithmic as well as fractional terms of the black hole area due to infalling photons. We have finally investigated the validity of Wien's displacement law and compared the critical value of the field wavelength with the general Schwarzschild black hole and its corresponding quantum-corrected case.</description>

      <title>Generating new gravitational solutions by matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01702</link>

Abstract: Explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories can be obtained, by means of a Riemann-Hilbert approach, from a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices. In this paper we describe other types of factorisation from which solutions can be constructed in a similar way. Our approach is based on an invariance problem, which does not constitute a Riemann-Hilbert problem and allows to construct solutions that could not have been obtained by Wiener-Hopf factorisation of a monodromy matrix. It gives rise to a novel solution generating method based on matrix multiplications. We show, in particular, that new solutions can be obtained by multiplicative deformation of the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation, provided the latter exists, and that one can superpose such solutions. Examples of applications include Kasner, Einstein-Rosen wave and gravitational pulse wave solutions.</description>

      <title>On the degrees of freedom count on singular phase space submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss singular loci in the phase spaces of theories which lack globally well-defined numbers of dynamical modes. This is a topic which appears quite often in the recent literature on modified gravity. In particular, there were discussions about $R^2$ gravity around Minkowski space. It is a relatively simple case, and still there were some confusions. It clearly shows that one should be very accurate when trying to understand a potentially problematic theory through perturbations around a simply looking background. At the same time, many modern teleparallel approaches are laden with even more severe issues. Therefore, it is a topic which is certainly worth carefully thinking about.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Reconstructed Core-Collapse Supernova Gravitational Wave High-Frequency Feature on the Nuclear Equation of State, in Real Interferometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of gravitational wave (GW) predictions from five two-dimensional Core Collapse Supernova (CCSN) simulations that varied only in the Equation of State (EOS) implemented. The GW signals from these simulations are used to produce spectrograms in the absence of noise, and the emergent high-frequency feature (HFF) is found to differ quantitatively between simulations. Below 1 kHz, the HFF is well approximated by a first-order polynomial in time. The resulting slope was found to vary between 10-50% across all models. Further, using real interferometric noise we investigated the current capabilities of GW detectors to resolve these differences in HFF slope for a Galactic CCSN. We find that for distances up to 1 kpc, current detectors can resolve HFF slopes that vary by at least 30%. For further Galactic distances, current detectors are capable of distinguishing the upper and lower bounds of the HFF slope for groupings of our models that varied in EOS. With the higher sensitivity of future GW detectors, and with improved analysis of the HFF, our ability to resolve properties of the HFF will improve for all Galactic distances. This study shows the potential of using the HFF of CCSN produced GWs to provide insight into the physical processes occurring deep within CCSN during collapse, and in particular its potential to further constrain the EOS through GW detection.</description>

      <title>Time transformation between the solar system barycenter and the surfaces of the Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformation of time between the surface of the Earth, the solar system barycenter, and the surface of the Moon involves relativistic corrections. For solar system Barycentric Dynamical Time (TDB), we also require that there be no rate difference between Terrestrial Time (TT) and TDB. The IAU has addressed these transformations with several resolutions. A series of robotic and crewed landings on the Moon are planned. The analogous transformation between TDB and time on the surface of the Moon (TL) needs a review and discussion. In this paper, we compute the rate terms involved in that transformation. We also present the TDB-compatible spatial scale and Lorentz contraction of Moon-centered positional coordinates. These transformations have been implemented in the JPL programs used to generate ephemerides of the Moon and planets. Finally, we provide expressions that can be used to synchronize TT and TL using either TDB or TT. The relevant transformations contain a small secular drift between the two time scales, along with additional small periodic terms that can be numerically evaluated using the solar system and lunar ephemerides.</description>

      <title>The spatial correlations between pulsars for interfering sources in Pulsar Timing Array and evidence for gravitational-wave background in NANOGrav 15-year data set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), aimed at detecting gravitational waves (GWs) in the $1\sim 100$ nHz range, have recently made significant strides. Compelling evidence has emerged for a common spectrum signal spatially correlated among pulsars, following a Hellings-Downs (HD) pattern, which is crucial for detecting a gravitational-wave background (GWB). However, the HD curve is expected for discrete and non-interfering sources, which is unlikely to hold in realistic scenarios with potential interference among numerous GW sources, such as the supermassive black-hole binaries. Incorporating interference was previously expected to introduce an irreducible uncertainty (known as "cosmic variance") in discerning the HD correlation; however, our work reveals how this interference generates measurable frequency-dependent spatial correlations distinct from the HD curve. The spatial correlations for interfering sources (referred to as "ISC") still exhibit contributions in the quadrupole and higher orders, resembling the HD correlation and encoding the nature of GW radiations. We apply these novel correlations to search for a GWB in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. In an optimistic estimation, our findings show a Bayes factor of $33.7\pm 3.2$ comparing ISC to the HD correlation, and an improvement in optimal statistic signal-to-noise ratio from $4.9\pm 1.1$ for the HD correlation to $6.6\pm 1.7$ for the ISC, highlighting the significant enhancement in evidence for detecting a GWB through incorporating interference.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for semilinear waves on asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish precise asymptotic expansions for solutions to semilinear wave equations with power-type nonlinearities on asymptotically flat spacetimes. For cubic nonlinearities $a(t,x)\phi^3$, we prove $\phi(t, x) = 2c t^{-2} + O(t^{-3+})$ in compact spatial regions, with $c$ computable. For $a(t,x)\phi^p$ with $p \geq 4$, we show $\phi(t, x) = d t^{-3} + O(t^{-4+})$, extending Price's law to the nonlinear setting. Our approach combines radiation field analysis with a generalized low-energy resolvent expansion, providing a bridge between spectral and physical space methods. These results sharpen previous decay estimates and yield complete asymptotics across the entire spacetime, including black hole backgrounds.</description>
