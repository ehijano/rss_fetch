      <title>Competing structures in a minimal double-well potential model of condensed matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17901v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The microscopic structure of several amorphous substances often reveals complex patterns such as medium- or long-range order, spatial heterogeneity, and even local polycrystallinity. To capture all these features, models usually incorporate a refined description of the particle interaction that includes an ad hoc design of the inside of the system constituents, and use temperature as a control parameter. We show that all these features can emerge from a minimal athermal two-dimensional model where particles interact isotropically by a double-well potential, which includes an excluded volume and a maximum coordination number. The rich variety of structural patterns shown by this simple geometrical model apply to a wide range of real systems including water, silicon, and different amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical equivalence between resonant translocation of a polymer chain and diversity-induced resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of heterogeneous oscillators are often seen to display collective synchronized oscillations, even when single elements of the network do not oscillate in isolation. It has been found that it is the diversity of the individual elements that drives the phenomenon, possibly leading to the appearance of a resonance in the response. Here we study the way in which heterogeneity acts in producing an oscillatory regime in a network and show that the resonance response is based on the same physics underlying the resonant translocation regime observed in models of polymer diffusion on a substrate potential. Such a mechanical analog provides an alternative viewpoint that is useful to interpret and understand the nature of collective oscillations in heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal oscillator networks learn to solve a classification problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically demonstrate a network of coupled oscillators that can learn to solve a classification task from a set of examples -- performing both training and inference through the nonlinear evolution of the system. We accomplish this by combining three key elements to achieve learning: A long-term memory that stores learned responses, analogous to the synapses in biological brains; a short-term memory that stores the neural activations, similar to the firing patterns of neurons; and an evolution law that updates the synapses in response to novel examples, inspired by synaptic plasticity. Achieving all three elements in wave-based information processors such as metamaterials is a significant challenge. Here, we solve it by leveraging the material multistability to implement long-term memory, and harnessing symmetries and thermal noise to realize the learning rule. Our analysis reveals that the learning mechanism, although inspired by synaptic plasticity, also shares parallelisms with bacterial evolution strategies, where mutation rates increase in the presence of noxious stimuli.</description>

      <title>Integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity stabilizes cooperator-defector coexistence in others-only public goods games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human cooperation persists among strangers in large, well-mixed populations despite theoretical predictions of difficulties, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study public goods games without self-return (often called "others-only" PGGs) with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (ALLC), unconditional defection (ALLD), and an integrated reciprocity strategy combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of ALLD and integrated reciprocators when b/c &gt; 2 in the absence of complexity costs. We analytically derive a critical threshold for complexity costs. If cognitive demands exceed this threshold, the stable equilibrium disappears via a saddle-node bifurcation. Otherwise, within the stable regime, complexity costs counterintuitively stabilize the equilibrium by preventing not only ALLC but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. ALLD serves as "evolutionary shields" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward broadcasting and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.</description>
