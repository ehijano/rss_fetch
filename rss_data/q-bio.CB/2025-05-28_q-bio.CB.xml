      <title>Chemotaxis of branched cells in complex environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell migration in vivo is often guided by chemical signals. Such chemotaxis, such as performed by immune cells migrating to a wound site, is complicated by the complex geometry inside living tissues. In this study, we extend our theoretical model of branched-cell migration on a network by introducing chemokine sources to explore the cellular response. The model predicts a speed-accuracy tradeoff, whereby slow cells are significantly more accurate and able to follow efficiently a weak chemoattractant signal. We then compare the model's predictions with experimental observations of neutrophils migrating to the site of laser-inflicted wound in a zebrafish larva fin, and migrating in-vitro inside a regular lattice of pillars. We find that the model captures the details of the sub-cellular response to the chemokine gradient, as well as the large-scale migration response. This comparison suggests that the neutrophils behave as fast cells, compromising their chemotaxis accuracy, which explains the functionality of these immune cells.</description>

      <title>A mass conserved reaction-diffusion system reveals switching between coexisting polar and oscillatory cell motility states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motile eukaryotic cells display distinct modes of migration that often occur within the same cell type. It remains unclear, however, whether transitions between the migratory modes require changes in external conditions, or whether the different modes are coexisting states that emerge from the underlying signaling network. Using a simplified mass-conserved reaction-diffusion model of small GTPase signaling with F-actin mediated feedback, we uncover a distinct bistable mechanism (involving gradient-like phase-separation and traveling waves) and a regime where a polarized mode of migration coexists with spatiotemporal oscillations; the latter, in larger domains, including in three-dimensional surface geometry, result in disordered patterns even in the absence of noise or shape deformations. Indeed, experimental observations of D. discoideum show that, upon collision with a rigid boundary, cells may switch from polarized to disordered motion.</description>
