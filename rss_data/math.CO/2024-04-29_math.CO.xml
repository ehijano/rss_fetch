      <title>Explicit formulae for generalized Stirling and Eulerian numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we generalize the $q$-difference operator due to Carlitz in order to derive explicit sum formulae for several extensions of Stirling numbers of the second kind, including complete homogeneous symmetric functions, complementary symmetric functions, $r$-Whitney numbers and elliptic analogues of rook, Stirling and Lah numbers. Furthermore, we generalize Carlitz' $q$-Eulerian numbers to a Lagrange polynomial extension. We define them by generalizing Worpitzky's identity appropriately, and derive a recursion and an explicit sum formulae. Special cases include $r$-Whitney Eulerian numbers and elliptic Eulerian numbers.</description>

      <title>Uncommon linear systems of two equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A system of linear equations $L$ is common over $\mathbb{F}_p$ if, as $n\to\infty$, any 2-coloring of $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ gives asymptotically at least as many monochromatic solutions to $L$ as a random 2-coloring. The notion of common linear systems is analogous to that of common graphs, i.e., graphs whose monochromatic density in 2-edge-coloring of cliques is asymptotically minimized by the random coloring. Saad and Wolf initiated a systematic study on identifying common linear systems, built upon the earlier work of Cameron-Cilleruelo-Serra. When $L$ is a single equation, Fox-Pham-Zhao gave a complete characterization of common linear equations. When $L$ consists of two equations, Kam\v{c}ev-Liebenau-Morrison showed that irredundant $2\times 4$ linear systems are always uncommon. In this work, (1) we determine commonness of all $2\times 5$ linear systems up to a small number of cases, and (2) we show that all $2\times k$ linear systems with $k$ even and girth (minimum number of nonzero coefficients of a nonzero equation spanned by the system) $k-1$ are uncommon, answering a question of Kam\v{c}ev-Liebenau-Morrison.</description>

      <title>Evolution of random representable matroids: minors, circuits, connectivity and the critical number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of random matroids represented by the sequence of random matrices over ${\mathbb F}_q$ where columns are added one after the other, and each column vector is a uniformly random vector in ${\mathbb F}_q^n$, independent of each other. We study the appearance of matroid minors, the appearance of circuits, the evolution of the connectivities and the critical number. We settle several open problems in the literature.</description>

      <title>The distance function on Coxeter-like graphs and self-dual codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $SGL_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ be the set of all invertible $n\times n$ symmetric matrices over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$. Let $\Gamma_n$ be the graph with the vertex set $SGL_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ where a pair of matrices $\{A,B\}$ form an edge if and only if $\textrm{rank}(A-B)=1$. In particular, $\Gamma_3$ is the well-known Coxeter graph. The distance function $d(A,B)$ in $\Gamma_n$ is described for all matrices $A,B\in SGL_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$. The diameter of $\Gamma_n$ is computed. For odd $n\geq 3$, it is shown that each matrix $A\in SGL_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ such that $d(A,I)=\frac{n+5}{2}$ and $\textrm{rank}(A-I)=\frac{n+1}{2}$ where $I$ is the identity matrix induces a self-dual code in $\mathbb{F}_2^{n+1}$. Conversely, each self-dual code $C$ induces a family ${\cal F}_C$ of such matrices $A$. The families given by distinct self-dual codes are disjoint. The identification $C\leftrightarrow {\cal F}_C$ provides a graph theoretical description of self-dual codes. A result of Janusz (2007) is reproved and strengthened by showing that the orthogonal group ${\cal O}_n(\mathbb{F}_2)$ acts transitively on the set of all self-dual codes in $\mathbb{F}_2^{n+1}$.</description>

      <title>Gain distance Laplacian matrices for complex unit gain graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex unit gain graph (or a $\mathbb{T}$-gain graph) $\Theta(\Sigma,\varphi)$ is a graph where the unit complex number is assign by a function $\varphi$ to every oriented edge of $\Sigma$ and assign its inverse to the opposite orientation. In this paper, we define the two gain distance Laplacian matrices $DL^{\max}_{&lt;}(\Theta)$ and $DL^{\min}_{&lt;}(\Theta)$ corresponding to the two gain distance matrices $D^{\max}_{&lt;}(\Theta)$ and $D^{\min}_{&lt;}(\Theta)$ defined for $\mathbb{T}$-gain graphs $\Theta(\Sigma,\varphi)$, for any vertex ordering $(V(\Sigma),&lt;)$. Furthermore, we provide the characterization of singularity and find formulas for the rank of those Laplacian matrices. We also establish two types of characterization for balanced in complex unit gain graphs while using the gain distance Lapalcian matrices. Most of the results are derived by proving them more generally for weighted $\mathbb{T}$-gain graphs.</description>

      <title>Edge-connectivity between (edge-)ends of infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In infinite graph theory, the notion of ends, first introduced by Freudenthal and Jung for locally finite graphs, plays an important role when generalizing statements from finite graphs to infinite ones. Nash-Willian's Tree-Packing Theorem and MacLane's Planarity Criteria are examples of results that allow a topological approach, in which ends might be considered as endpoints of rays. In fact, there are extensive works in the literature showing that classical theorems of (vertex-)connectivity for finite graphs can be discussed regarding ends, in a more general context. However, aiming to generalize results of edge-connectivity, this paper recalls the definition of edge-ends in infinite graphs due to Hahn, Laviolette and \v{S}ir\'a\v{n}. In terms of that object, we state an edge version of Menger's Theorem (following a previous work of Polat) and generalize the Lov\'asz-Cherkassky Theorem for infinite graphs with edge-ends (inspired by a paper of Jacobs, Jo\'o, Knappe, Kurkofka and Melcher).</description>

      <title>Topological remarks on end and edge-end spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of ends in an infinite graph $G$ might be modified if we consider them as equivalence classes of infinitely edge-connected rays, rather than equivalence classes of infinitely (vertex-)connected ones. This alternative definition yields to the edge-end space $\Omega_E(G)$ of $G$, in which we can endow a natural (edge-)end topology. For every graph $G$, this paper proves that $\Omega_E(G)$ is homeomorphic to $\Omega(H)$ for some possibly another graph $H$, where $\Omega(H)$ denotes its usual end space. However, we also show that the converse statement does not hold: there is a graph $H$ such that $\Omega(H)$ is not homeomorphic to $\Omega_E(G)$ for any other graph $G$. In other words, as a main result, we conclude that the class of topological spaces $\Omega_E = \{\Omega_E(G) : G \text{ graph}\}$ is strictly contained in $\Omega = \{\Omega(H) : H \text{ graph}\}$.</description>

      <title>A concentration phenomenon for $h$-extra edge-connectivity reliability analysis of enhanced hypercubes Q_{n,2} with exponentially many faulty links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability assessment of interconnection networks is critical to the design and maintenance of multiprocessor systems. The (n, k)-enhanced hypercube Q_{n,k} as a variation of the hypercube Q_{n}, was proposed by Tzeng and Wei in 1991. As an extension of traditional edge-connectivity, h-extra edge-connectivity of a connected graph G, \lambda_h(G), is an essential parameter for evaluating the reliability of interconnection networks. This article intends to study the h-extra edge-connectivity of the (n,2)-enhanced hypercube Q_{n,2}. Suppose that the link malfunction of an interconnection network Q_{n,2} does not isolate any subnetwork with no more than h-1 processors, the minimum number of these possible faulty links concentrate on a constant 2^{n-1} for each integer \lceil\frac{11\times2^{n-1}}{48}\rceil \leq h \leq 2^{n-1} and n\geq 9. That is, for about 77.083 percent values of h\leq2^{n-1}, the corresponding h-extra edge-connectivity of Q_{n,2}, \lambda_h(Q_{n,2}), presents a concentration phenomenon. Moreover, the above lower and upper bounds of h are both tight.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plane rooted tree is called a hipster tree if it has no nontrivial automorphisms. Equivalently, a tree is a hipster tree if no two siblings have isomorphic subtrees. We impose the hipster condition on various classes of rooted trees. By approximating the generating function for the number of such trees, we obtain bounds on their exponential growth rates.</description>

      <title>The evolution of the permutahedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their seminal paper introducing the theory of random graphs, Erd\H{o}s and R\'{e}nyi considered the evolution of the structure of a random subgraph of $K_n$ as the density increases from $0$ to $1$, identifying two key points in this evolution -- the \emph{percolation threshold}, where the order of the largest component seemingly jumps from logarithmic to linear in size, and the \emph{connectivity threshold}, where the subgraph becomes connected. Similar phenomena have been observed in many other random graph models, and in particular, works of Ajtai, Koml\'{o}s and Szemer\'{e}di and of Spencer and Erd\H{o}s determine corresponding thresholds for random subgraphs of the hypercube.
  We study similar questions on the \emph{permutahedron}.
  The permutahedron, like the hypercube, has many different equivalent representations, and arises as a natural object of study in many areas of combinatorics. In particular, as a highly-symmetric simple polytope, like the $n$-simplex and $n$-cube, this percolation model naturally generalises the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph and the percolated hypercube.
  We determine the percolation threshold and the connectivity threshold for random subgraphs of the permutahedron.
  Along the way we develop a novel graph exploration technique which can be used to find exponentially large clusters after percolation in high-dimensional geometric graphs and we initiate the study of the isoperimetric properties of the permutahedron.</description>

      <title>Bipartite powers of some classes of bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph powers are a well-studied concept in graph theory. Analogous to graph powers, Chandran et al.[3] introduced the concept of bipartite powers for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we will demonstrate that some well-known classes of bipartite graphs, namely the interval bigraphs, proper interval bigraphs, and bigraphs of Ferrers dimension 2, are closed under the operation of taking bipartite powers. Finally, we define strongly closed property for bipartite graphs under powers and have shown that the class of chordal bipartite graphs is strongly closed under powers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a short proof that for every apex-forest $X$ on at least two vertices, graphs excluding $X$ as a minor have layered pathwidth at most $2|V(X)|-3$. This improves upon a result by Dujmovi\'c, Eppstein, Joret, Morin, and Wood (SIDMA, 2020). Our main tool is a structural result about graphs excluding a forest as a rooted minor, which is of independent interest. We develop similar tools for treedepth and treewidth. We discuss implications for Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa properties of rooted models of minors in graphs.</description>

Abstract: Rectangulations are decompositions of a square into finitely many axis-aligned rectangles. We describe realizations of (n-1)-dimensional polytopes associated with two combinatorial families of rectangulations composed of n rectangles. They are defined as quotientopes of natural lattice congruences on the weak Bruhat order on permutations in S_n, and their skeleta are flip graphs on rectangulations. We give simple vertex and facet descriptions of these polytopes, in particular elementary formulas for computing the coordinates of the vertex corresponding to each rectangulation, in the spirit of J.-L. Loday's realization of the associahedron.</description>

      <title>Counterexamples to generalizations of the Erd\H{o}s $B+B+t$ problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following their resolution of the Erd\H{o}s $B+B+t$ problem, Kra Moreira, Richter, and Robertson posed a number of questions and conjectures related to infinite configurations in positive density subsets of the integers and other amenable groups. We give a negative answer to several of these questions and conjectures by producing families of counterexamples based on a construction of Ernst Straus.
  Included among our counterexamples, we exhibit, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with multiplicative upper Banach density at least $1 - \varepsilon$ such that $A$ does not contain any dilated product set $\{b_1b_2t : b_1, b_2 \in B, b_1 \ne b_2\}$ for an infinite set $B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $t \in \mathbb{Q}_{&gt;0}$. We also prove the existence of a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ with additive upper Banach density at least $1 - \varepsilon$ such that $A$ does not contain any polynomial configuration $\{b_1^2 + b_2 + t : b_1, b_2 \in B, b_1 &lt; b_2\}$ for an infinite set $B \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ and $t \in \mathbb{Z}$. Counterexamples to some closely related problems are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with identifying among the family of posets associated with Kohnert polynomials, those whose order complex has a certain combinatorial property. In particular, for numerous families of Kohnert polynomials, including key polynomials, we determine when the associated Kohnert posets are (EL-)shellable. Interestingly, under certain diagram restrictions, (EL-)shellability of a Kohnert poset is equivalent to multiplcity freeness of the associated Kohnert polynomial.</description>

      <title>Around the positive graph conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is said to be positive if the homomorphism density $t_H(G)$ is non-negative for all weighted graphs $G$. The positive graph conjecture proposes a characterisation of such graphs, saying that a graph is positive if and only if it is symmetric, in the sense that it is formed by gluing two copies of some subgraph along an independent set. We prove several results relating to this conjecture. First, we make progress towards the conjecture itself by showing that any connected positive graph must have a vertex of even degree. We then make use of this result to identify some new counterexamples to the analogue of Sidorenko's conjecture for hypergraphs. In particular, we show that, for $r$ odd, every $r$-uniform tight cycle is a counterexample, generalising a recent result of Conlon, Lee and Sidorenko that dealt with the case $r=3$. Finally, we relate the positive graph conjecture to the emerging study of graph codes by showing that any positive graph has vanishing graph code density, thereby improving a result of Alon who proved the same result for symmetric graphs. Our proofs make use of a variety of tools and techniques, including the properties of independence polynomials, hypergraph quasirandomness and discrete Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>On the impossibility of certain $({n^2+n+k}_{n+1})$ configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impossibility of certain $({n^2+n+k}_{n+1})$ configurations. Firstly, for $k=2$, the result of \cite{gropp1992non} that $\frac{n^2+n}{2}$ is even and $n+1$ is a perfect square or $\frac{n^2+n}{2}$ is odd and $n-1$ is a perfect square is reproved using the incidence matrix $N$ and analysing the form of $N^TN$. Then, for all $k$, configurations where paralellism is a transitive property are considered. It is then analogously established that if $n\equiv0$ or $n\equiv k-1$ mod $k$ for $k$ even, then $\frac{n^2+n}{k}$ is even and $n+1$ is a perfect square or $\frac{n^2+n}{k}$ is odd and $n-(k-1)$ is a perfect square. Finally, the case $k=3$ is investigated in full generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study half-space separation in the convexity of chordless paths of a graph, i.e., monophonic convexity. In this problem, one is given a graph and two (disjoint) subsets of vertices and asks whether these two sets can be separated by complementary convex sets, called half-spaces. While it is known this problem is $\mathbf{NP}$-complete for geodesic convexity -- the convexity of shortest paths -- we show that it can be solved in polynomial time for monophonic convexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spanning trees are fundamental objects in graph theory. The spanning tree set size of an arbitrary graph can be very large. This limitation discourages its analysis. However interesting patterns can emerge in small cases. In this article we introduce \emph{tinygarden}, a java package for validating hypothesis, testing properties and discovering patterns from the spanning tree set of an arbitrary graph.</description>

      <title>Computational hardness of detecting graph lifts and certifying lift-monotone properties of random regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new conjecture on the computational hardness of detecting random lifts of graphs: we claim that there is no polynomial-time algorithm that can distinguish between a large random $d$-regular graph and a large random lift of a Ramanujan $d$-regular base graph (provided that the lift is corrupted by a small amount of extra noise), and likewise for bipartite random graphs and lifts of bipartite Ramanujan graphs. We give evidence for this conjecture by proving lower bounds against the local statistics hierarchy of hypothesis testing semidefinite programs. We then explore the consequences of this conjecture for the hardness of certifying bounds on numerous functions of random regular graphs, expanding on a direction initiated by Bandeira, Banks, Kunisky, Moore, and Wein (2021). Conditional on this conjecture, we show that no polynomial-time algorithm can certify tight bounds on the maximum cut of random 3- or 4-regular graphs, the maximum independent set of random 3- or 4-regular graphs, or the chromatic number of random 7-regular graphs. We show similar gaps asymptotically for large degree for the maximum independent set and for any degree for the minimum dominating set, finding that naive spectral and combinatorial bounds are optimal among all polynomial-time certificates. Likewise, for small-set vertex and edge expansion in the limit of very small sets, we show that the spectral bounds of Kahale (1995) are optimal among all polynomial-time certificates.</description>

      <title>Two-Source and Affine Non-Malleable Extractors for Small Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-malleable extractors are generalizations and strengthening of standard randomness extractors, that are resilient to adversarial tampering. Such extractors have wide applications in cryptography and explicit construction of extractors. In the well-studied models of two-source and affine non-malleable extractors, the previous best constructions only work for entropy rate $&gt;2/3$ and $1-\gamma$ respectively by Li (FOCS' 23).
  We present explicit constructions of two-source and affine non-malleable extractors that match the state-of-the-art constructions of standard ones for small entropy. Our main results include two-source and affine non-malleable extractors (over $\mathsf{F}_2$) for sources on $n$ bits with min-entropy $k \ge \log^C n$ and polynomially small error, matching the parameters of standard extractors by Chattopadhyay and Zuckerman (STOC' 16, Annals of Mathematics' 19) and Li (FOCS' 16), as well as those with min-entropy $k = O(\log n)$ and constant error, matching the parameters of standard extractors by Li (FOCS' 23).
  Our constructions significantly improve previous results, and the parameters (entropy requirement and error) are the best possible without first improving the constructions of standard extractors. In addition, our improved affine non-malleable extractors give strong lower bounds for a certain kind of read-once linear branching programs, recently introduced by Gryaznov, Pudl\'{a}k, and Talebanfard (CCC' 22) as a generalization of several well-studied computational models. These bounds match the previously best-known average-case hardness results given by Chattopadhyay and Liao (CCC' 23) and Li (FOCS' 23), where the branching program size lower bounds are close to optimal, but the explicit functions we use here are different.\ Our results also suggest a possible deeper connection between non-malleable extractors and standard ones.</description>

      <title>Solving the Graph Burning Problem for Large Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an exact algorithm for the Graph Burning Problem ($\texttt{GBP}$), an NP-hard optimization problem that models the spread of influence on social networks. Given a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$, the objective is to find a sequence of $k$ vertices in $V$, namely, $v_1, v_2, \dots, v_k$, such that $k$ is minimum and $\bigcup_{i = 1}^{k} \{u\! \in\! V\! : d(u, v_i) \leq k - i\} = V$, where $d(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$. We formulate the problem as a set covering integer programming model and design a row generation algorithm for the $\texttt{GBP}$. Our method exploits the fact that a very small number of covering constraints is often sufficient for solving the integer model, allowing the corresponding rows to be generated on demand. To date, the most efficient exact algorithm for the $\texttt{GBP}$, denoted here by $\texttt{GDCA}$, is able to obtain optimal solutions for graphs with up to 14,000 vertices within two hours of execution. In comparison, our algorithm finds provably optimal solutions approximately 236 times faster, on average, than $\texttt{GDCA}$. For larger graphs, memory space becomes a limiting factor for $\texttt{GDCA}$. Our algorithm, however, solves real-world instances with almost 200,000 vertices in less than 35 seconds, increasing the size of graphs for which optimal solutions are known by a factor of 14.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an additive abelian group. A sequence $S = g_1 \cdot \ldots \cdot g_{\ell}$ of terms from $G$ is a plus-minus weighted zero-sum sequence if there are $\varepsilon_1, \ldots, \varepsilon_{\ell} \in \{-1, 1\}$ such that $\varepsilon_1 g_1 + \ldots + \varepsilon_{\ell} g_{\ell}=0$. We study sets of lengths in the monoid $\mathcal B_{\pm} (G)$ of plus-minus weighted zero-sum sequences over $G$. If $G$ is finite, then sets of lengths are highly structured. If $G$ is infinite, then every finite, nonempty subset of $\mathbb N_{\ge 2}$ is the set of lengths of some sequence $S \in \mathcal B_{\pm} (G)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a vertex-transitive graph of superlinear polynomial growth. Given $r&gt;0$, let $G_r$ be the graph on the same vertex set as $G$, with two vertices joined by an edge if and only if they are at graph distance at most $r$ apart in $G$. We show that the critical probability $p_c(G_r)$ for Bernoulli bond percolation on $G_r$ satisfies $p_c(G_r) \sim 1/\mathrm{deg}(G_r)$ as $r\to\infty$. This extends work of Penrose and Bollob\'as-Janson-Riordan, who considered the case $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$.
  Our result provides an important ingredient in parallel work of Georgakopoulos in which he introduces a new notion of dimension in groups. It also verifies a special case of a conjecture of Easo and Hutchcroft.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce notions of dimension of an infinite group, or more generally, a metric space, defined using percolation. Roughly speaking, the percolation dimension $pdim(G)$ of a group $G$ is the fastest rate of decay of a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on $G$, such that Bernoulli percolation on $G$ with connection probabilities proportional to $\mu$ behaves like a Poisson branching process with parameter 1 in a sense made precise below. We show that $pdim(G)$ has several natural properties: it is monotone decreasing with respect to subgroups and quotients, and coincides with the growth rate exponent for several classes of groups.</description>

Abstract: We present a combinatorial analysis of fiber bundles of generalized configuration spaces on connected abelian Lie groups. These bundles are akin to those of Fadell-Neuwirth for configuration spaces, and their existence is detected by a combinatorial property of an associated finite partially ordered set. This is consistent with Terao's fibration theorem connecting bundles of hyperplane arrangements to Stanley's lattice supersolvability. We obtain a combinatorially determined class of K($\pi$,1) toric and elliptic arrangements. Under a stronger combinatorial condition, we prove a factorization of the Poincar\'e polynomial when the Lie group is noncompact. In the case of toric arrangements, this provides an analogue of Falk-Randell's formula relating the Poincar\'e polynomial to the lower central series of the fundamental group.</description>

      <title>Transference for loose Hamilton cycles in random $3$-uniform hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A loose Hamilton cycle in a hypergraph is a cyclic sequence of edges covering all vertices in which only every two consecutive edges intersect and do so in exactly one vertex. With Dirac's theorem in mind, it is natural to ask what minimum $d$-degree condition guarantees the existence of a loose Hamilton cycle in a $k$-uniform hypergraph. For $k=3$ and each $d \in \{1,2\}$, the necessary and sufficient such condition is known precisely. We show that these results adhere to a `transference principle' to their sparse random analogues. The proof combines several ideas from the graph setting and relies on the absorbing method. In particular, we employ a novel approach of Kwan and Ferber for finding absorbers in subgraphs of sparse hypergraphs via a contraction procedure. In the case of $d = 2$, our findings are asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>Two Ramsey problems in blowups of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.12826v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given graphs $G$ and $H$, we say $G \stackrel{r}{\to} H$ if every $r$-colouring of the edges of $G$ contains a monochromatic copy of $H$. Let $H[t]$ denote the $t$-blowup of $H$. The blowup Ramsey number $B(G \stackrel{r}{\to} H;t)$ is the minimum $n$ such that $G[n] \stackrel{r}{\to} H[t]$. Fox, Luo and Wigderson refined an upper bound of Souza, showing that, given $G$, $H$ and $r$ such that $G \stackrel{r}{\to} H$, there exist constants $a=a(G,H,r)$ and $b=b(H,r)$ such that for all $t \in \mathbb{N}$, $B(G \stackrel{r}{\to} H;t) \leq ab^t$. They conjectured that there exist some graphs $H$ for which the constant $a$ depending on $G$ is necessary. We prove this conjecture by showing that the statement is true in the case of $H$ being $3$-chromatically connected, which in particular includes triangles. On the other hand, perhaps surprisingly, we show that for forests $F$, the function $B(G \stackrel{r}{\to} F;t)$ is independent of $G$.
  Second, we show that for any $r,t \in \mathbb{N}$, any sufficiently large $r$-edge coloured complete graph on $n$ vertices with $\Omega(n^{2-1/t})$ edges in each colour contains a member from a certain finite family $\mathcal{F}^r_t$ of $r$-edge coloured complete graphs. This answers a conjecture of Bowen, Hansberg, Montejano and M\"uyesser.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper begins by exploring some old and new results about Ramsey numbers and minimum numbers of monochromatic triangles in $2$-colorings of complete graphs, both in the disjoint and non-disjoint cases. We then extend the theory, by defining line $2$-colorings of configurations of points and lines and considering the minimum number of non-disjoint monochromatic triangles. We compute specific examples for notable symmetric $v_{3}$ configurations before considering a general result regarding the addition or connected sum of configurations through incidence switches. The paper finishes by considering the maximal number of mutually intersecting lines and how this relates to the minimum number of triangles given a line $2$-coloring of a symmetric $v_{3}$ configuration.</description>

Abstract: We study geometric and topological properties of infinite graphs that are quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph excluding a minor is quasi-isometric to a planar graph of bounded degree. We use the result to give a simple proof of the result that finitely generated minor-excluded groups have Assouad-Nagata dimension at most 2 (this is known to hold in greater generality, but all known proofs use significantly deeper tools). We also prove that every locally finite quasi-transitive graph that is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is $k$-planar for some $k$ (i.e. it has a planar drawing with at most $k$ crossings per edge), and discuss a possible approach to prove the converse statement.</description>

Abstract: Positroids are families of matroids introduced by Postnikov in the study of non-negative Grassmannians. Postnikov identified several combinatorial objects in bijections with positroids, among which are bounded affine permutations. On the other hand, the notion of essential sets, introduced for permutations by Fulton, was used by Knutson in the study of the special family of interval rank positroids. We generalize Fulton's essential sets to bounded affine permutations. The bijection of the latter with positroids, allows the study of their relation. From the point of view of positroids, essential sets are maximally dependent cyclic interval. We define connected essential sets and prove that they give a facet description of the positroid polytope, as well as equations defining the positroid variety. We define a subset of essential sets, called core, which contains minimal rank conditions to uniquely recover a positroid. We provide an algorithm to retrieve the positroid satisfying the rank conditions in the core or any compatible rank condition on cyclic intervals.</description>

      <title>Positivity preservers over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve an algebraic version of Schoenberg's celebrated theorem [Duke Math. J., 1942] characterizing entrywise matrix transforms that preserve positive definiteness. Compared to the classical real and complex settings, we consider matrices with entries in a finite field and obtain a complete characterization of such preservers for matrices of a fixed dimension. When the dimension of the matrices is at least $3$, we prove that, surprisingly, the positivity preservers are precisely the positive multiples of the field's automorphisms. Our work makes crucial use of the well-known character-sum bound due to Weil, and of a result of Carlitz [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 1960] that provides a characterization of the automorphisms of Paley graphs.</description>

      <title>On cubic graphs having the maximal coalition number</title>

Abstract: A coalition in a graph $G$ with vertex set $V$ consists of two disjoint sets $V_1, V_2\subset V$ such that neither $V_1$ nor $V_2$ is a dominating set, but the union $V_1\cup V_2$ is a dominating set in $G$. A partition of graph vertices is called a coalition partition $\mathcal{P}$ if every non-dominating set of $\mathcal{P}$ is a member of a coalition and every dominating set is a single-vertex set. The coalition number $C(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the maximum cardinality of its coalition partition. It is known that for cubic graphs $C(G)\le 9$. The existence of cubic graphs with the maximal coalition number is an unsolved problem. In this paper, an infinite family of cubic graphs satisfying $C(G)=9$ is constructed.</description>

Abstract: Given a finite group $G$, a group $X$ is called a dihedral-product group of $G$ if $X=GD$ where $D$ is a finite dihedral group. In particular, it is called a dihedral-skew product group of $G$ if $G\cap D=1$ and $D$ has a trivial core in $X$. In this paper, dihedral-skew product groups of all nonabelian simple groups are classified and dihedral-product groups of all nonabelian simple groups are characterized.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Helfgott on the structure of sets of bounded tripling in bounded rank, which states the following. Let $A$ be a finite symmetric subset of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{F})$ for any field $\mathbf{F}$ such that $|A^3| \leq K|A|$. Then there are subgroups $H \trianglelefteq \Gamma \trianglelefteq \langle A \rangle$ such that $A$ is covered by $K^{O_n(1)}$ cosets of $\Gamma$, $\Gamma/H$ is nilpotent of step at most $n-1$, and $H$ is contained in $A^{O_n(1)}$. This theorem includes the Product Theorem for finite simple groups of bounded rank as a special case. As an application of our methods we also show that the diameter of sufficiently quasirandom finite linear groups is poly-logarithmic.</description>

      <title>The capacity of a finite field matrix channel</title>

Abstract: The Additive-Multiplicative Matrix Channel (AMMC) was introduced by Silva, Kschischang and K\"otter in 2010 to model data transmission using random linear network coding. The input and output of the channel are $n\times m$ matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. On input the matrix $X$, the channel outputs $Y=A(X+W)$ where $A$ is a uniformly chosen $n\times n$ invertible matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and where $W$ is a uniformly chosen $n\times m$ matrix over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of rank $t$.
  Silva \emph{et al} considered the case when $2n\leq m$. They determined the asymptotic capacity of the AMMC when $t$, $n$ and $m$ are fixed and $q\rightarrow\infty$. They also determined the leading term of the capacity when $q$ is fixed, and $t$, $n$ and $m$ grow linearly. We generalise these results, showing that the condition $2n\geq m$ can be removed. (Our formula for the capacity falls into two cases, one of which generalises the $2n\geq m$ case.) We also improve the error term in the case when $q$ is fixed.</description>

      <title>S\'ark\"ozy's Theorem in Various Finite Field Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we strengthen a result by Green about an analogue of Sarkozy's theorem in the setting of polynomial rings $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$. In the integer setting, for a given polynomial $F \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ with constant term zero, (a generalization of) Sarkozy's theorem gives an upper bound on the maximum size of a subset $A \subset \{1, \ldots, n \}$ that does not contain distinct $a_1,a_2 \in A$ satisfying $a_1 - a_2 = F(b)$ for some $ b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Green proved an analogous result with much stronger bounds in the setting of subsets $A \subset \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$, but required the additional condition that the number of roots of the polynomial $F \in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ is coprime to $q$. We generalize Green's result, removing this condition. As an application, we also obtain a version of Sarkozy's theorem with similarly strong bounds for subsets $A \subset \mathbb{F}_q$ for $q = p^n$ for a fixed prime $p$ and large $n$.</description>

      <title>Solving NP-hard Problems on \textsc{GaTEx} Graphs: Linear-Time Algorithms for Perfect Orderings, Cliques, Colorings, and Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The class of $\mathsf{Ga}$lled-$\mathsf{T}$ree $\mathsf{Ex}$plainable ($\mathsf{GaTEx}$) graphs has recently been discovered as a natural generalization of cographs. Cographs are precisely those graphs that can be uniquely represented by a rooted tree where the leaves correspond to the vertices of the graph. As a generalization, $\mathsf{GaTEx}$ graphs are precisely those that can be uniquely represented by a particular rooted acyclic network, called a galled-tree.
  This paper explores the use of galled-trees to solve combinatorial problems on $\mathsf{GaTEx}$ graphs that are, in general, NP-hard. We demonstrate that finding a maximum clique, an optimal vertex coloring, a perfect order, as well as a maximum independent set in $\mathsf{GaTEx}$ graphs can be efficiently done in linear time. The key idea behind the linear-time algorithms is to utilize the galled-trees that explain the $\mathsf{GaTEx}$ graphs as a guide for computing the respective cliques, colorings, perfect orders, or independent sets.</description>

      <title>Predicting Properties of Nodes via Community-Aware Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper shows how information about the network's community structure can be used to define node features with high predictive power for classification tasks. To do so, we define a family of community-aware node features and investigate their properties. Those features are designed to ensure that they can be efficiently computed even for large graphs. We show that community-aware node features contain information that cannot be completely recovered by classical node features or node embeddings (both classical and structural) and bring value in node classification tasks. This is verified for various classification tasks on synthetic and real-life networks.</description>
