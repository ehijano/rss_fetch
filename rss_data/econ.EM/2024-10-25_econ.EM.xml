      <title>On the Existence of One-Sided Representations in the Generalised Dynamic Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the generalised dynamic factor model (GDFM) and assume that the dynamic common component is purely non-deterministic. We show that then the common shocks (and therefore the dynamic common component) can always be represented in terms of current and past observed variables. Hence, we further generalise existing results on the so called One-Sidedness problem of the GDFM. We may conclude that the existence of a one-sided representation that is causally subordinated to the observed variables is in the very nature of the GDFM and the lack of one-sidedness is an artefact of the chosen representation.</description>

      <title>Partially Identified Rankings from Pairwise Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of ranking objects based on their latent merits using data from pairwise interactions. Existing approaches rely on the restrictive assumption that all the interactions are either observed or missed randomly. We investigate what can be inferred about rankings when this assumption is relaxed. First, we demonstrate that in parametric models, such as the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce model, rankings are point-identified if and only if the tournament graph is connected. Second, we show that in nonparametric models based on strong stochastic transitivity, rankings in a connected tournament are only partially identified. Finally, we propose two statistical tests to determine whether a ranking belongs to the identified set. One test is valid in finite samples but computationally intensive, while the other is easy to implement and valid asymptotically. We illustrate our procedure using Brazilian employer-employee data to test whether male and female workers rank firms differently when making job transitions.</description>

      <title>Inference on High Dimensional Selective Labeling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A class of simultaneous equation models arise in the many domains where observed binary outcomes are themselves a consequence of the existing choices of of one of the agents in the model. These models are gaining increasing interest in the computer science and machine learning literatures where they refer the potentially endogenous sample selection as the {\em selective labels} problem. Empirical settings for such models arise in fields as diverse as criminal justice, health care, and insurance. For important recent work in this area, see for example Lakkaruju et al. (2017), Kleinberg et al. (2018), and Coston et al.(2021) where the authors focus on judicial bail decisions, and where one observes the outcome of whether a defendant filed to return for their court appearance only if the judge in the case decides to release the defendant on bail. Identifying and estimating such models can be computationally challenging for two reasons. One is the nonconcavity of the bivariate likelihood function, and the other is the large number of covariates in each equation. Despite these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel distribution free estimation procedure that is computationally friendly in many covariates settings. The new method combines the semiparametric batched gradient descent algorithm introduced in Khan et al.(2023) with a novel sorting algorithms incorporated to control for selection bias. Asymptotic properties of the new procedure are established under increasing dimension conditions in both equations, and its finite sample properties are explored through a simulation study and an application using judicial bail data.</description>

      <title>Detecting Spatial Outliers: the Role of the Local Influence Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the analysis of large spatial datasets, identifying and treating spatial outliers is essential for accurately interpreting geographical phenomena. While spatial correlation measures, particularly Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), are widely used to detect spatial patterns, the presence of abnormal observations frequently distorts the landscape and conceals critical spatial relationships. These outliers can significantly impact analysis due to the inherent spatial dependencies present in the data. Traditional influence function (IF) methodologies, commonly used in statistical analysis to measure the impact of individual observations, are not directly applicable in the spatial context because the influence of an observation is determined not only by its own value but also by its spatial location, its connections with neighboring regions, and the values of those neighboring observations. In this paper, we introduce a local version of the influence function (LIF) that accounts for these spatial dependencies. Through the analysis of both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrate how the LIF provides a more nuanced and accurate detection of spatial outliers compared to traditional LISA measures and local impact assessments, improving our understanding of spatial patterns.</description>

      <title>A Neural Phillips Curve and a Deep Output Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many problems plague empirical Phillips curves (PCs). Among them is the hurdle that the two key components, inflation expectations and the output gap, are both unobserved. Traditional remedies include proxying for the absentees or extracting them via assumptions-heavy filtering procedures. I propose an alternative route: a Hemisphere Neural Network (HNN) whose architecture yields a final layer where components can be interpreted as latent states within a Neural PC. There are benefits. First, HNN conducts the supervised estimation of nonlinearities that arise when translating a high-dimensional set of observed regressors into latent states. Second, forecasts are economically interpretable. Among other findings, the contribution of real activity to inflation appears understated in traditional PCs. In contrast, HNN captures the 2021 upswing in inflation and attributes it to a large positive output gap starting from late 2020. The unique path of HNN's gap comes from dispensing with unemployment and GDP in favor of an amalgam of nonlinearly processed alternative tightness indicators.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation and Inference for Categorical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11954v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there is a rich literature on robust methodologies for contamination in continuously distributed data, contamination in categorical data is largely overlooked. This is regrettable because many datasets are categorical and oftentimes suffer from contamination. Examples include inattentive responding and bot responses in questionnaires or zero-inflated count data. We propose a novel class of contamination-robust estimators of models for categorical data, coined $C$-estimators (``$C$" for categorical). We show that the countable and possibly finite sample space of categorical data results in non-standard theoretical properties. Notably, in contrast to classic robustness theory, $C$-estimators can be simultaneously robust \textit{and} fully efficient at the postulated model. In addition, a certain particularly robust specification fails to be asymptotically Gaussian at the postulated model, but is asymptotically Gaussian in the presence of contamination. We furthermore propose a diagnostic test to identify categorical outliers and demonstrate the enhanced robustness of $C$-estimators in a simulation study.</description>
