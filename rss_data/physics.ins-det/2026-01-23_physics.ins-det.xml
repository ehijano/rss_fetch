      <title>Large-scale real-time signal processing in physics experiments: The ALICE TPC FPGA pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For LHC Run 3, the ALICE Time Projection Chamber was upgraded to operate in continuous readout mode. Interaction rates of up to 50 kHz in Pb-Pb collisions require real-time processing of more than 3 TB/s of raw detector data. This requirement is met by a custom FPGA-based processing pipeline that performs the complete front-end data treatment fully in-stream, including common-mode correction, pedestal subtraction, ion-tail filtering, zero suppression, and dense data packing.
  A central element of the design is a highly parallel common-mode correction algorithm operating directly on the streaming data. It robustly identifies signal-free readout channels on a time-bin basis and applies pad-dependent scaling to compensate for local variations in capacitive coupling in the GEM readout. In combination with pedestal subtraction and ion-tail filtering, this enables accurate baseline restoration under extreme high-occupancy conditions, preventing signal loss while efficiently suppressing noise prior to zero suppression.
  The pipeline operates continuously at the full detector bandwidth and reduces the raw input rate to about 900 GB/s for Pb-Pb collisions at the target interaction rate. Overall, it represents a large-scale FPGA-based real-time signal-processing implementation for high-energy physics detector readout.</description>

      <title>OPTIMA, a board dedicated to Optimized Precision Timing for Multichannel Acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the new era of HL-LHC experiments, fast-timing detectors are emerging as critical tools for background rejection. Typical requirements include a temporal hit resolution of about 50 ps, a spatial resolution of around 12 $\mu$m, and radiation hardness up to $10^{17}$n$_\text{eq}$/cm$^2$. To address these challenges, the development of non-standard sensor designs and advanced fast readout electronics is required. The OPTIMA multichannel board addresses the need for testing small sensor demonstrators when they cannot yet be bonded to dedicated readout ASICs. It provides fast readout of up to 16 channels and can be integrated into various test setups, including test beam environments. This contribution presents the design of the OPTIMA board, its integration in test beams, and the first experimental results.</description>

      <title>Operating a large-diameter dual-phase liquid xenon TPC in the unshielded PANCAKE facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future liquid-xenon (LXe) based observatories for rare processes, such as XLZD, require testing of large components and sub-assemblies in cryogenic liquid or gaseous xenon environments. Here we present results from the stable operation of a shallow dual-phase LXe TPC with an inner diameter of 133.4\,cm and a height of 3.1\,cm in the unshielded PANCAKE platform, without underground suppression of cosmic-ray backgrounds. A total of 340\,kg of xenon was used in the experiment, of which 127\,kg constituted the active TPC mass. Measurements of the LXe purity-dependent electron lifetime and the electron drift velocity in LXe demonstrate that sensitive measurements to characterize the TPC performance are possible in a high-background environment, even with a very basic PMT-based light detection system. Improving this will straightforwardly reduce the TPC threshold, which was observed to be around 15\,keV for electronic recoils in TPC operation.</description>

      <title>Application of zone refining to the development of NaI(Tl) detectors for SABRE North</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SABRE North experiment is developing ultra-high radiopurity NaI(Tl) detectors to investigate dark matter. To achieve this, SABRE North utilizes the technique called zone refining for NaI powder purification. This work details the mathematical model developed to describe the purification process. By comparing this model to the results of the commissioning and production runs conducted prior to crystal growth, the distribution coefficients were determined for various impurities, contained in the powder at the parts-per-billion (ppb) level. Furthermore, the synthesis of data from both zone refining and normal freezing is discussed. These findings can be used to predict the SABRE North detectors background level in the energy region-of-interest for dark matter search and to optimize the production of ultra-high purity crystals through multiple purification strategies.</description>

      <title>Gain-Layer Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gain-layer degradation from exposure to radiation limits the use of Low-Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs) in high energy particle physics detector experiments. Proper understanding of how the gain-layer is destroyed is not available on a defect level. Only measurements for materials with much lower effective doping concentrations are available. The direct study of the gain-layer is not possible with typical defect spectroscopy measurements like Thermally Stimulated Currents (TSC) and Deep-Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS). To combat this problem and gain a better understanding of the processes which degrade LGADs, the Gain-Layer Project was started.
  This project produced 19050 diodes with various Boron, Phosphorus, Oxygen and Carbon concentrations. The material used is low-resistivity p-type Silicon. The effective doping concentrations are in the order of a LGAD gain-layer. These diodes will serve the defect community in the coming years for various studies. This article introduces this project with detailed descriptions of the diodes, their flavours and their processing, and reports on results from I-V, C-V, SIMS and DLTS measurements on unirradiated diodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in accelerator technology have led to significant improvements in the quality of muon beams over the past decades. Investigations of the muon and muonium enable precise measurements of fundamental constants, as well as searching for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, by utilizing muon beams with high intensity and polarization, studies of the dynamics of the muon and muonium within atom level can offer valuable insights into material science. This review presents recent progress and prospects at the frontiers of muon beams and high-precision muonium physics. It also provides an overview of novel methods and detection techniques to achieve high sensitivities in different areas, including particle physics, nuclear physics, materials science and beyond.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Imaging System Combining Hyperspectral and Laser Speckle Imaging for In Vivo Hemodynamic and Metabolic Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development and validation of a novel multimodal optical imaging platform that integrates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) to enable real-time, non-invasive mapping of tissue oxygenation, perfusion and metabolism, via blood flowmetry and targeting of oxy- (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), as well as oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO). The system architecture features a single high-speed camera and dual optical path, with synchronized alternating illumination: a filtered, supercontinuum laser for HSI and a He-Ne laser for LSCI. The system performances were evaluated through in vivo experiments on rat spinal cord under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, revealing coherent physiological changes in hemodynamics, metabolism and relative blood flow index (rBFI). These results demonstrate the potential of the platform for functional tissue imaging and quantitative dynamic monitoring of both oxygen delivery and consumption.</description>

      <title>Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the highest performing photon-counting detectors, making them a critical technology in quantum photonics and photon-starved optical sensing. However, the performance of SNSPDs is limited not by the intrinsic properties of the superconducting film, but by edge-induced current crowding. Despite extensive materials optimization and increasingly demanding fabrication strategies aimed at mitigating this edge-limited behavior, the device edges continue to limit the maximum device operating current, thereby degrading key performance metrics. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from an edge-limited to a bulk-limited regime, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector to suppress current crowding at the edges. We show that activation of the rails reduces the dark count rate by nine orders of magnitude and extends the photon detection plateau at 1550 nm by more than 40%. These results are demonstrated on detectors up to 0.1 mm wide, establishing an entirely new class of ultra-wide strip detectors that we call superconducting strip photon detectors (SSPD). Moreover, the ability to suppress edge current crowding using the rails provides a pathway toward SSPDs with strip widths extending into the mm-scale. Such devices will enable large-area, high efficiency SSPD arrays with infrared sensitivity and open new opportunities in applications ranging from biomedical imaging to deep space optical communication.</description>

      <title>Mid-infrared high-sensitive cavity-free in-situ CO gas sensing based on up-conversion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon monoxide (CO) is a significant indicator gas with considerable application value in atmospheric monitoring, industrial production and medical diagnosis. Its fundamental vibrational band locates around 4.6 $\upmu$m and has larger absorption line strength than that of overtone band, which is more suitable for the precise identification and concentration detection of CO. In this paper, the up-conversion detection is employed to convert the mid-infrared absorption signal obtained by TDLAS to the visible light band, then a silicon-based detector is utilized for detection. By which, we can achieve the highest sensitivity of 79.6 ppb under the condition of cavity-free in-situ with an absorption range length of only 0.14 m. Furthermore, the single-photon level real-time detection of CO concentration after the diffuse reflection is realized by using SPAD. This work demonstrates the merits of the up-conversion detection in terms of its functionality at room temperature and capacity for sensitivity detection. Furthermore, it presents a design and optimization methodology that has the potential to underpin the advancement of the method towards more practical applications, like industrial process monitoring, medical diagnosis and so on.</description>

      <title>Picogram-Level Nanoplastic Analysis with Nanoelectromechanical System Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy: NEMS-FTIR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a photothermal infrared spectroscopy-based approach for the chemical characterization and quantification of nanoplastics. By combining the high sensitivity of nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) with the wide spectral range and ubiquity of commercially available Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, NEMS-FTIR offers a time-efficient and cryogen-free option for the rapid, routine analysis of nanoplastics in aqueous samples. Polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride nanoplastics with nominal diameters ranging from 54 to 262 nm were analyzed by NEMS-FTIR with limits of detection ranging from 101 pg to 353 pg, one order of magnitude lower than values reported for pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of nanoplastics. The absorptance measured by NEMS-FTIR could be further converted to absolute sample mass using the attenuation coefficient, as demonstrated for polystyrene. Thanks to the wide spectral range of NEMS-FTIR, nanoplastic particles from different polymers could be readily identified, even when present in a mixture. The potential of NEMS-FTIR for the analysis of real samples was demonstrated by identifying the presence of nanoplastics released in water during tea brewing. Polyamide leachates in the form of fragments and smaller oligomers could be identified in the brewing water without sample pre-concentration, even in the presence of an organic matrix. Accelerated aging of the nylon teabags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed further release of polyamide over time.</description>

      <title>A low-cost ice melt monitoring system using wind-induced motion of mass-balance stakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Surface ablation measurements of glaciers are critical for understanding mass change over time. Mass-balance stakes are commonly used for localized measurements, with the exposed length typically measured manually at infrequent intervals. This paper presents the design and validation of new instrumentation that automates mass-balance stake readings, thus enabling continuous measurements with high temporal resolution. The instrumentation comprises readout electronics that are mounted on mass-balance stakes to measure wind-induced vibrations. The stake vibrational frequency depends sensitively on the exposed length, and changes in the measured frequency therefore probe glacier surface melt and accumulation. Initial instrumentation field tests conducted at Color Lake on Umingmat Nunaat (Axel Heiberg Island), Nunavut, demonstrate centimeter-level precision on length measurements. The instrumentation can be attached to existing mass-balance stakes and is low-cost (~ $50 USD) in comparison to many other systems that perform automated surface ablation measurements. The accessibility of this instrumentation opens new possibilities for localized, high temporal resolution measurements of glacier surface activity at any locations where mass balance stakes are deployed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate quantitative mapping of gamma-ray sources is critical for applications ranging from radiological emergency response and environmental monitoring to nuclear security and deep space exploration. Here, we show that integrating high-fidelity, platform-dynamic Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian inference with mobile gamma-ray spectrometry enables rapid and accurate quantification of distributed and point-like gamma-ray sources. Validated against laboratory and field assays, our framework quantifies natural and anthropogenic gamma-ray sources that conventional methods cannot resolve in $1\,$s with $\sim\!\!1\,\%$ error. The developed method marks a critical advance in quantitative gamma-ray sensing, enabling improved radiological situational awareness, enhanced terrestrial geophysical and geochemical mapping, as well as more robust constraints on radionuclide abundances on extraterrestrial bodies across the Solar System.</description>

Abstract: Quantum measurements, alongside quantum states and processes, form a cornerstone of quantum information processing. However, unlike states and processes, their efficient characterisation remains relatively unexplored. We resolve this asymmetry by introducing a comprehensive framework for efficient detector estimation that reveals the fundamental limits to extractable parameter information and errors arising in detector analysis - the detector quantum Fisher information. Our development eliminates the need to optimise for the best probe state, while highlighting aspects of detector analysis that fundamentally differ from quantum state estimation. Through proofs, examples and experimental validation, we demonstrate the relevance and robustness of our proposal for current quantum detector technologies. By formalising a dual perspective to state estimation, our framework completes and connects the triad of efficient state, process, and detector tomography, advancing quantum information theory with broader implications for emerging technologies reliant on precisely calibrated measurements.</description>

      <title>Calibration Method of Spacecraft-Inertial Sensor Center-of-Mass Offset for the Taiji Gravitational Wave Detection Mission under Science Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately calibrating the center-of-mass (CoM) offset between the spacecraft (SC) and the inertial sensor test mass (TM) is crucial for space-based gravitational-wave (GW) antennas, such as LISA and Taiji. Current calibration methods require additional spacecraft maneuvers that disrupt science data continuity and inter-satellite links, compromising the coherence of gravitational wave signals. Here, we present a maneuver-free calibration scheme that directly estimates the CoM offset vector using only standard science-mode measurements from inertial sensors, interferometers, and differential wavefront sensors. By embedding the CoM offset induced coupling acceleration as an extended state in a model-based adaptive Kalman filter, we achieve estimation accuracy of 0.01-1.5 mm across all axes with a maximum error below 1%. This approach enables continuous, high-precision calibration during nominal observation runs, ensuring continuous and coherent gravitational wave data collection while maintaining the required precision, and also facilitating advanced DFACS functions such as performance evaluations and fault diagnosis. For LISA-like missions, where data continuity is paramount for detecting faint gravitational wave signals, this method will enhance scientific output and reliability.</description>
