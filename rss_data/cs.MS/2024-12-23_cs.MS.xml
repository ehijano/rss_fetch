      <title>GPS-2-GTFS: A Python package to process and transform raw GPS data of public transit to GTFS format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gps2gtfs package addresses a critical need for converting raw Global Positioning System (GPS) trajectory data from public transit vehicles into the widely used GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) format. This transformation enables various software applications to efficiently utilize real-time transit data for purposes such as tracking, scheduling, and arrival time prediction. Developed in Python, gps2gtfs employs techniques like geo-buffer mapping, parallel processing, and data filtering to manage challenges associated with raw GPS data, including high volume, discontinuities, and localization errors. This open-source package, available on GitHub and PyPI, enhances the development of intelligent transportation solutions and fosters improved public transit systems globally.</description>

      <title>Typical Algorithms for Estimating Hurst Exponent of Time Sequence: A Data Analyst's Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19051v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hurst exponent is a significant metric for characterizing time sequences with long-term memory property and it arises in many fields. The available methods for estimating the Hurst exponent can be categorized into time-domain and spectrum-domain methods. Although there are various estimation methods for the Hurst exponent, there are still some disadvantages that should be overcome: firstly, the estimation methods are mathematics-oriented instead of engineering-oriented; secondly, the accuracy and effectiveness of the estimation algorithms are inadequately assessed; thirdly, the framework of classification for the estimation methods are insufficient; and lastly there is a lack of clear guidance for selecting proper estimation in practical problems involved in data analysis. The contributions of this paper lie in four aspects: 1) the optimal sequence partition method is proposed for designing the estimation algorithms for Hurst exponent; 2) the algorithmic pseudo-codes are adopted to describe the estimation algorithms, which improves the understandability and usability of the estimation methods and also reduces the difficulty of implementation with computer programming languages; 3) the performance assessment is carried for the typical estimation algorithms via the ideal time sequence with given Hurst exponent and the practical time sequence captured in applications; 4) the guidance for selecting proper algorithms for estimating the Hurst exponent is presented and discussed. It is expected that the systematic survey of available estimation algorithms could help the users to understand the principles and the assessment of the various estimation methods could help the users to select, implement and apply the estimation algorithms of interest in practical situations in an easy way.</description>

      <title>The State of Julia for Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Julia has been heralded as a potential successor to Python for scientific machine learning and numerical computing, boasting ergonomic and performance improvements. Since Julia's inception in 2012 and declaration of language goals in 2017, its ecosystem and language-level features have grown tremendously. In this paper, we take a modern look at Julia's features and ecosystem, assess the current state of the language, and discuss its viability and pitfalls as a replacement for Python as the de-facto scientific machine learning language. We call for the community to address Julia's language-level issues that are preventing further adoption.</description>
