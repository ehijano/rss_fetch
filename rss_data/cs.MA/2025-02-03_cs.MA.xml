      <title>Recognize then Resolve: A Hybrid Framework for Understanding Interaction and Cooperative Conflict Resolution in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lack of understanding of interactions and the inability to effectively resolve conflicts continue to impede the progress of Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) in their interactions with Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs). To address this challenge, we propose the Recognize then Resolve (RtR) framework. First, a Bilateral Intention Progression Graph (BIPG) is constructed based on CAV-HDV interaction data to model the evolution of interactions and identify potential HDV intentions. Three typical interaction breakdown scenarios are then categorized, and key moments are defined for triggering cooperative conflict resolution. On this basis, a constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal passage order while accommodating HDV intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RtR framework outperforms other cooperative approaches in terms of safety and efficiency across various penetration rates, achieving results close to consistent cooperation while significantly reducing computational resources. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/FanGShiYuu/RtR-Recognize-then-Resolve/.</description>

      <title>Layered Chain-of-Thought Prompting for Multi-Agent LLM Systems: A Comprehensive Approach to Explainable Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to provide step-by-step rationales, improving performance on complex tasks. Despite its benefits, vanilla CoT often fails to fully verify intermediate inferences and can produce misleading explanations. In this work, we propose Layered Chain-of-Thought (Layered-CoT) Prompting, a novel framework that systematically segments the reasoning process into multiple layers, each subjected to external checks and optional user feedback. We expand on the key concepts, present three scenarios -- medical triage, financial risk assessment, and agile engineering -- and demonstrate how Layered-CoT surpasses vanilla CoT in terms of transparency, correctness, and user engagement. By integrating references from recent arXiv papers on interactive explainability, multi-agent frameworks, and agent-based collaboration, we illustrate how Layered-CoT paves the way for more reliable and grounded explanations in high-stakes domains.</description>

      <title>Distributed Offloading in Multi-Access Edge Computing Systems: A Mean-Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-access edge computing (MEC) technology is a promising solution to assist power-constrained IoT devices by providing additional computing resources for time-sensitive tasks. In this paper, we consider the problem of optimal task offloading in MEC systems with due consideration of the timeliness and scalability issues under two scenarios of equitable and priority access to the edge server (ES). In the first scenario, we consider a MEC system consisting of $N$ devices assisted by one ES, where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES, with equitable access to the ES. In the second scenario, we consider a MEC system consisting of one primary user, $N$ secondary users and one ES. The primary user has priority access to the ES while the secondary users have equitable access to the ES amongst themselves. In both scenarios, due to the power consumption associated with utilizing the local resource and task offloading, the devices must optimize their actions. Additionally, since the ES is a shared resource, other users' offloading activity serves to increase latency incurred by each user. We thus model both scenarios using a non-cooperative game framework. However, the presence of a large number of users makes it nearly impossible to compute the equilibrium offloading policies for each user, which would require a significant information exchange overhead between users. Thus, to alleviate such scalability issues, we invoke the paradigm of mean-field games to compute approximate Nash equilibrium policies for each user using their local information, and further study the trade-offs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption for each user. Using numerical evaluations, we show that our approach can recover the offloading trends displayed under centralized solutions, and provide additional insights into the results obtained.</description>

      <title>Fully Distributed and Quantized Algorithm for MPC-based Autonomous Vehicle Platooning Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems have recently emerged to address the growing interest for safer, more efficient, and sustainable transportation solutions. In this direction, this paper presents distributed algorithms for control and optimization over vehicular networks. First, we formulate the autonomous vehicle platooning framework based on model-predictive-control (MPC) strategies and present its objective optimization as a cooperative quadratic cost function. Then, we propose a distributed algorithm to locally optimize this objective at every vehicle subject to data quantization over the communication network of vehicles. In contrast to most existing literature that assumes ideal communication channels, log-scale data quantization over the network is addressed in this work, which is more realistic and practical. In particular, we show by simulation that the proposed log-quantized algorithm reaches optimal convergence with less residual and optimality gap. This outperforms the existing literature considering uniform quantization which leads to a large optimality gap and residual.</description>

      <title>Distributed Observer Design for Tracking Platoon of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) aim to advance innovative strategies relating to different modes of transport, traffic management, and autonomous vehicles. This paper studies the platoon of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) and proposes a distributed observer to track the state of the CAV dynamics. First, we model the CAV dynamics via an LTI interconnected system. Then, a consensus-based strategy is proposed to infer the state of the CAV dynamics based on local information exchange over the communication network of vehicles. A linear-matrix-inequality (LMI) technique is adopted for the block-diagonal observer gain design such that this gain is associated in a distributed way and locally to every vehicle. The distributed observer error dynamics is then shown to follow the structure of the Kronecker matrix product of the system dynamics and the adjacency matrix of the CAV network. The notions of survivable network design and redundant observer scheme are further discussed in the paper to address resilience to link and node failure. Finally, we verify our theoretical contributions via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Language Games as the Pathway to Artificial Superhuman Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of large language models (LLMs) toward artificial superhuman intelligence (ASI) hinges on data reproduction, a cyclical process in which models generate, curate and retrain on novel data to refine capabilities. Current methods, however, risk getting stuck in a data reproduction trap: optimizing outputs within fixed human-generated distributions in a closed loop leads to stagnation, as models merely recombine existing knowledge rather than explore new frontiers. In this paper, we propose language games as a pathway to expanded data reproduction, breaking this cycle through three mechanisms: (1) \textit{role fluidity}, which enhances data diversity and coverage by enabling multi-agent systems to dynamically shift roles across tasks; (2) \textit{reward variety}, embedding multiple feedback criteria that can drive complex intelligent behaviors; and (3) \textit{rule plasticity}, iteratively evolving interaction constraints to foster learnability, thereby injecting continual novelty. By scaling language games into global sociotechnical ecosystems, human-AI co-evolution generates unbounded data streams that drive open-ended exploration. This framework redefines data reproduction not as a closed loop but as an engine for superhuman intelligence.</description>

      <title>O-MAPL: Offline Multi-agent Preference Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring reward functions from demonstrations is a key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly in multi-agent RL (MARL), where large joint state-action spaces and complex inter-agent interactions complicate the task. While prior single-agent studies have explored recovering reward functions and policies from human preferences, similar work in MARL is limited. Existing methods often involve separate stages of supervised reward learning and MARL algorithms, leading to unstable training. In this work, we introduce a novel end-to-end preference-based learning framework for cooperative MARL, leveraging the underlying connection between reward functions and soft Q-functions. Our approach uses a carefully-designed multi-agent value decomposition strategy to improve training efficiency. Extensive experiments on SMAC and MAMuJoCo benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods across various tasks.</description>

      <title>Enabling Autonomic Microservice Management through Self-Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing complexity of modern software systems necessitates robust autonomic self-management capabilities. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in this domain, they often face challenges in adapting their general knowledge to specific service contexts. To address this limitation, we propose ServiceOdyssey, a self-learning agent system that autonomously manages microservices without requiring prior knowledge of service-specific configurations. By leveraging curriculum learning principles and iterative exploration, ServiceOdyssey progressively develops a deep understanding of operational environments, reducing dependence on human input or static documentation. A prototype built with the Sock Shop microservice demonstrates the potential of this approach for autonomic microservice management.</description>

      <title>Constant-Factor Distortion Mechanisms for $k$-Committee Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the $k$-committee election problem, we wish to aggregate the preferences of $n$ agents over a set of alternatives and select a committee of $k$ alternatives that minimizes the cost incurred by the agents. While we typically assume that agent preferences are captured by a cardinal utility function, in many contexts we only have access to ordinal information, namely the agents' rankings over the outcomes. As preference rankings are not as expressive as cardinal utilities, a loss of efficiency is inevitable, and is quantified by the notion of \emph{distortion}.
  We study the problem of electing a $k$-committee that minimizes the sum of the $\ell$-largest costs incurred by the agents, when agents and candidates are embedded in a metric space. This problem is called the $\ell$-centrum problem and captures both the utilitarian and egalitarian objectives. When $k \geq 2$, it is not possible to compute a bounded-distortion committee using purely ordinal information. We develop the first algorithms (that we call mechanisms) for the $\ell$-centrum problem (when $k \geq 2$), which achieve $O(1)$-distortion while eliciting only a very limited amount of cardinal information via value queries. We obtain two types of query-complexity guarantees: $O(\log k \log n)$ queries \emph{per agent}, and $O(k^2 \log^2 n)$ queries \emph{in total} (while achieving $O(1)$-distortion in both cases). En route, we give a simple adaptive-sampling algorithm for the $\ell$-centrum $k$-clustering problem.</description>

      <title>Implications of zero-growth economics analysed with an agent-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-approaching limits of the Earth's biosphere and the potentially catastrophic consequences caused by climate change have begun to call into question the endless growth of the economy. There is increasing interest in the prospects of zero economic growth from the degrowth and post-growth literature. In particular, the question arises as to whether a zero-growth trajectory in a capitalist system with interest-bearing debt can be economically stable. There have been several answers to this question using macroeconomic models; some find a zero-growth trajectory is stable, while other models show an economic breakdown. However, the capitalist system in a period of growth is not guaranteed to be stable. Hence, a more appropriate methodology is to compare the relative stability between a growth and zero-growth scenario on the same model. Such a question has not yet been answered at any disaggregated level. It's important to investigate the consequences of zero-growth on market share instability and concentration, bankruptcy rates, income distribution, and credit network risk. To answer such questions, we develop a macroeconomic agent-based model incorporating Minskyan financial dynamics. The growth and zero-growth scenarios are accomplished by changing an average productivity growth parameter for the firms in the model. The model results showed that real GDP growth rates were more stable in the zero-growth scenario, there were fewer economic crises, lower unemployment rates, a higher wage share of output for workers, and capital firm and bank market shares were relatively more stable. Some of the consequences of zero-growth were a higher rate of inflation than in the growth scenario, increased market concentration for both firms and banks, and a higher level of financial risk in the credit network.</description>

      <title>Quantized distributed Nash equilibrium seeking under DoS attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking under Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and quantization. The players can only exchange information with their own direct neighbors. The transmitted information is subject to quantization and packet losses induced by malicious DoS attacks. We propose a quantized distributed NE seeking strategy based on the approach of dynamic quantized consensus. To solve the quantizer saturation problem caused by DoS attacks, the quantization mechanism is equipped to have zooming-in and holding capabilities, in which the holding capability is consistent with the results in quantized consensus under DoS. A sufficient condition on the number of quantizer levels is provided, under which the quantizers are free from saturation under DoS attacks. The proposed distributed quantized NE seeking strategy is shown to have the so-called maximum resilience to DoS attacks. Namely, if the bound characterizing the maximum resilience is violated, an attacker can deny all the transmissions and hence distributed NE seeking is impossible.</description>

      <title>Communication- and Computation-Efficient Distributed Submodular Optimization in Robot Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a communication- and computation-efficient method for distributed submodular optimization in robot mesh networks. Submodularity is a property of diminishing returns that arises in active information gathering such as mapping, surveillance, and target tracking. Our method, Resource-Aware distributed Greedy (RAG), introduces a new distributed optimization paradigm that enables scalable and near-optimal action coordination. To this end, RAG requires each robot to make decisions based only on information received from and about their neighbors. In contrast, the current paradigms allow the relay of information about all robots across the network. As a result, RAG's decision-time scales linearly with the network size, while state-of-the-art near-optimal submodular optimization algorithms scale cubically. We also characterize how the designed mesh-network topology affects RAG's approximation performance. Our analysis implies that sparser networks favor scalability without proportionally compromising approximation performance: while RAG's decision time scales linearly with network size, the gain in approximation performance scales sublinearly. We demonstrate RAG's performance in simulated scenarios of area detection with up to 45 robots, simulating realistic robot-to-robot (r2r) communication speeds such as the 0.25 Mbps speed of the Digi XBee 3 Zigbee 3.0. In the simulations, RAG enables real-time planning, up to three orders of magnitude faster than competitive near-optimal algorithms, while also achieving superior mean coverage performance. To enable the simulations, we extend the high-fidelity and photo-realistic simulator AirSim by integrating a scalable collaborative autonomy pipeline to tens of robots and simulating r2r communication delays. Our code is available at https://github.com/UM-iRaL/Resource-Aware-Coordination-AirSim.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Curse of Multiagency in Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are vulnerable to sim-to-real gaps. To address this, distributionally robust Markov games (RMGs) have been proposed to enhance robustness in MARL by optimizing the worst-case performance when game dynamics shift within a prescribed uncertainty set. RMGs remains under-explored, from reasonable problem formulation to the development of sample-efficient algorithms. Two notorious and open challenges are the formulation of the uncertainty set and whether the corresponding RMGs can overcome the curse of multiagency, where the sample complexity scales exponentially with the number of agents. In this work, we propose a natural class of RMGs inspired by behavioral economics, where each agent's uncertainty set is shaped by both the environment and the integrated behavior of other agents. We first establish the well-posedness of this class of RMGs by proving the existence of game-theoretic solutions such as robust Nash equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria (CCE). Assuming access to a generative model, we then introduce a sample-efficient algorithm for learning the CCE whose sample complexity scales polynomially with all relevant parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to break the curse of multiagency for RMGs, regardless of the uncertainty set formulation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.</description>
