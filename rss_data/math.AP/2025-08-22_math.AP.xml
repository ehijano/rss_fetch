      <title>Brezis-Nirenberg type problem for fractional sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show the existence of a weak solution for a fractional sub-Laplace equation involving a term with the critical Sobolev exponent, namely, \begin{align*} (-\Delta_\mathbb{H})^su - \lambda u &amp;= |u|^{Q^*_s -2}u \text{ in } \Omega,\\ u &amp;= 0 \text{ in } \mathbb{H}^N \setminus \Omega, \end{align*} where $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{H}^N$ is bounded and has continuous boundary, $(-\Delta_\mathbb{H})^s$ is the horizontal fractional Laplacian, $s \in (0,1), \lambda &gt; 0,$ and $Q^*_s=\frac{2Q}{Q-2s}$ is the Sobolev critical exponent. This problem is motivated by the celebrated Brezis-Nirenberg problem \cite{brezis1983positive}.</description>

      <title>Optimal Interference Signal for Masking an Acoustic Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an environment where acoustic privacy or deliberate signal obfuscation is desired, it is necessary to mask the acoustic signature generated in essential operations. We consider the problem of masking the effect of an acoustic source in a target region where possible detection sensors are located. Masking is achieved by placing interference signals near the acoustic source. We introduce a theoretical and computational framework for designing such interference signals with the goal of minimizing the residual amplitude in the target region. For the three-dimensional (3D) forced wave equation with spherical symmetry, we derive analytical quasi-steady periodic solutions for several canonical cases. We examine the phenomenon of self-masking where an acoustic source with certain spatial forcing profile masks itself from detection outside its forcing footprint. We then use superposition of spherically symmetric solutions to investigate masking in a given target region. We analyze and optimize the performance of using one or two point-forces deployed near the acoustic source for masking in the target region. For the general case where the spatial forcing profile of the acoustic source lacks spherical symmetry, we develop an efficient numerical method for solving the 3D wave equation. Potential applications of this work include undersea acoustic communication security, undersea vehicles stealth, and protection against acoustic surveillance.</description>

      <title>On the Fermi-Dirac-type Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider kinetic models for Fermi-Dirac-like particles obeying the exclusion principle. A generalized notion of Fisher information, tailored to kinetic equations of Fermi-Dirac-Fokker-Planck type, is introduced via the associated entropy dissipation identity. We show that, subject to a suitable upper bound on the initial data, this quantity decreases along solutions of the Fermi-Dirac-Fokker-Planck equation, while monotonicity can fail in the absence of such a bound. We also discuss the time evolution of this Fermi-Dirac-type Fisher information for the heat equation and the linear-type Landau-Fermi-Dirac equation with Maxwell molecules.</description>

      <title>Non-linear degenerate parabolic flow equations and a finer differential structure on Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define new differential structures on the Wasserstein spaces $\mathcal{W}_p(M)$ for $p &gt; 2$ and a general Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. We consider a very general and possibly degenerate second order partial differential flow equation with measure dependent coefficients to expand the notion of smooth curves and to ensure that the new differential structure is finer than the classical one. Under weak assumptions, we explicitly construct smooth solutions as uniform limits of Average Flow Approximation Series (a variant of explicit Euler--scheme approximations) in $\mathcal{W}_p(M)$ and, thus, prove a generalzed version of the Central Limit Theorem. Under slightly stronger assumptions, we prove that smooth solutions of our newly introduced flow--equation are unique.</description>

      <title>Multiple nodal solutions to a scalar field equation with double-power nonlinearity and zero mass at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear elliptic equation \begin{equation*} -\Delta u + V(x)u = f(u), \qquad u\in D^{1,2}_0(\Omega), \end{equation*} in an exterior domain $\Omega$ of $\mathbb{R}^N$, where $V$ is a scalar potential that decays to zero at infinity and the nonlinearity $f$ is subcritical at infinity and supercritical near the origin. Under weak symmetry assumptions, we provide conditions that guarantee that this problem has a prescribed number of sign-changing solutions. In particular, we show that in dimensions $N\geq 4$ there are numerous examples of exterior domains with finite symmetries in which the problem has a predetermined number of nodal solutions.</description>

      <title>Constructing characteristic initial data for three dimensional compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves the characteristic initial data problem for the three-dimensional compressible Euler equations - an open problem analogous to Christodoulou's characteristic initial value formulation for the vacuum Einstein field equations in general relativity. Within the framework of acoustical geometry, we prove that for any "initial cone" $C_0\subset \mathcal{D}=[0,T]\times\mathbb{R}^3$ with initial data $(\mathring{\rho},\mathring{v},\mathring{s})$ given at $S_{0,0}=C_0\cap \Sigma_0$, arbitrary smooth entropy function and angular velocity determine smooth initial data $(\rho,v,s)$ on $C_0$ that render $C_0$ characteristic. Differing from the intersecting-hypersurface case by Speck-Yu [19] and the symmetric reduction case by Lisibach [11], our vector field method recursively determines all (including $0$-th) order derivatives of the solution along $C_0$ via transport equations and wave equations. This work provides a complete characteristic data construction for admissible hypersurfaces in the 3D compressible Euler system, introducing useful tools and providing novel aspects for studies of the long-time dynamics of the compressible Euler flow.</description>

      <title>On the extremal functions of second order uncertainty principles: symmetry and symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focus on the symmetry and symmetry breaking about the second order Hydrogen Uncertainty Principle. \emph{Firstly}, by choosing a suitable test function, we give a negative answer to the conjecture presented by Cazacu, Flynn and Lam in [\emph{J. Funct. Anal.} \textbf{283} (2022), Paper No. 109659, 37 pp] for $N\in\{2,3\}$, and emphasizing the symmetry breaking phenomenon. \emph{Secondly}, we obtain a family of sharp weighted second order Hydrogen Uncertainty Principle, and prove the extremal functions are radial, which extends the work of Duong and Nguyen [The sharp second order Caffareli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality and stability estimates for the sharp second order uncertainty principle, arXiv:2102.01425].</description>

      <title>Statistical conservation laws for scalar model problems: Hierarchical evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability density functions (PDFs) for the solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation can be represented by a hierarchy of linear equations. This article develops new hierarchical evolution equations for PDFs of a scalar conservation law with random initial data as a model problem. Two frameworks are developed, including multi-point PDFs and single-point higher-order derivative PDFs. These hierarchies capture statistical correlations and guide closure strategies.</description>

      <title>Coupled Vlasov and non-Newtonian fluid dynamics: existence and large-time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a coupled kinetic-non-Newtonian fluid system on the periodic domain ${\mathbb T}^3$, where particles evolve by a Vlasov equation and interact with an incompressible power-law fluid through a drag force. We prove the global existence of weak solutions for all $p &gt; \frac{8}{5}$, where $p &gt; 1$ denotes the power-law exponent of the fluid's stress-strain relation. Under an additional uniform boundedness assumption on the particle density, we also establish large-time decay of a modulated energy functional measuring deviation from velocity alignment. The decay rate is algebraic when $p &gt; 2$ and exponential when $\frac{6}{5} \le p \le 2$, reflecting the role of fluid dissipation in the large-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>A potential theory approach to the capillarity-driven Hele-Shaw problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that potential theory provides a powerful framework for analyzing quasistationary fluid flows in bounded geometries, where the bulk dynamics are governed by elliptic equations with constant coefficients. This approach is illustrated by the two-dimensional Hele-Shaw problem with surface tension, for which we derive local well-posedness and parabolic smoothing in (almost) optimal function spaces. In addition, we establish a generalized principle of linearized stability for a particular class of abstract quasilinear parabolic problems, which enables us to show that the stationary solutions to the Hele-Shaw problem are exponentially stable.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and Rayleigh-Taylor instability of the two-phase periodic quasistationary Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-phase, horizontally periodic, quasistationary Stokes flow in two dimensions driven by surface tension and gravity effects in the general context of fluids with (possibly) different viscosities and densities. The sharp interface which separates the fluids is assumed to be the graph of a periodic function. The mathematical model is then recast as a fully nonlinear and nonlocal evolution equation involving only the function parametrizing the interface. Our main results include well-posedness and a parabolic smoothing property, as well as a study of equilibrium solutions in subcritical Sobolev spaces. In particular, we establish the Rayleigh-Taylor instability of small, finger-shaped equilibria and prove that the stability properties of flat interfaces depend on the sign of a certain parameter.</description>

      <title>Maz'ya-type bounds for sharp constants in fractional Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove estimates for the sharp constants in fractional Poincar\'e-Sobolev inequalities associated to an open set, in terms of a nonlocal capacitary extension of its inradius. This work builds upon previous results obtained in the local case by Maz'ya and Shubin and by the first author and Brasco. We rely on a new Maz'ya-Poincar\'e inequality and, incidentally, we also prove new fractional Poincar\'e-Wirtinger-type estimates. These inequalities display sharp limiting behaviours with respect to the fractional order of differentiability. As a byproduct, we obtain a new criterion for the embedding of the homogeneous Sobolev space $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}_0(\Omega)$ in $L^q(\Omega)$, valid in the subcritical regime and for $p \le q &lt; p^*_s$. Our results are new even for the first eigenvalue of the fractional Laplacian and contain an optimal characterization for the positivity of the fractional Cheeger's constant.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for higher order Schr\"odinger equations with Partial regular initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish refined Strichartz estimates for higher-order Schr\"odinger equations with initial data exhibiting partial regularity. By partial regularity, we mean that the initial data are not required to have full Sobolev regularity but only regularity with respect to a subset of the spatial variables. As an application of these estimates, we investigate the well-posedness of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with power-type nonlinearities. In addition, we extend our analysis to the Dunkl Schr\"odinger equations under partial regularity, defined with respect to two distinct root systems. This extension poses significant challenges, mainly due to the lack of a suitable stationary phase method in the Dunkl setting. To overcome this difficulty, we develop a new result that provides an adaptation of the stationary phase method to the framework of Dunkl analysis.</description>

      <title>Existence of hyperbolic blow-up to the generalized quasi-geostrophic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the blow-up of solutions to the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (gSQG) equation in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$, within the more singular range $\beta\in(1,2)$ for the coupling of the velocity field. This behavior is studied under a hyperbolic setting based on the framework originally introduced by C\'{o}rdoba (1998, Annals of Math. 148, 1135--52) for the classical SQG equation. Assuming that the level sets of the solution contains a hyperbolic saddle, and under suitable conditions on the solution at the origin, we obtain the existence of a time $T^{\ast}\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\cup\{\infty\}$ at which the opening angle of the saddle collapses. Moreover, we derive a lower bound for the blow-up time $T^\ast$. This geometric degeneration leads to the blow-up of the H\"{o}lder norm $\Vert\theta(t)\Vert_{C^{\sigma}}$ as $t\rightarrow T^{\ast}$, for $\sigma\in(0, \beta -1)$, showing the formation of singularity in the H\"{o}lder space at time $T^{\ast}$. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results in the literature to rigorously prove the formation of a singularity, whether in finite or infinite time, for a class of smooth solutions to the gSQG equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p\in(0,\infty)$, $q\in[1,\infty)$, $s\in\mathbb Z_+$, and $W$ be an $A_p$-matrix weight, which in the scalar case is exactly a Muckenhoupt $A_{\max\{1,p\}}$ weight. In this article, by using the reducing operators of $W$, we introduce matrix-weighted Campanato spaces $\mathcal L_{p,q,s,W}$. When $p\in(0,1]$, applying the atomic and the finite atomic characterizations of the matrix-weighted Hardy space $H^p_W$, we prove that the dual space of $H^p_W$ is precisely $\mathcal L_{p,q,s,W}$, which further induces several equivalent characterizations of $\mathcal L_{p,q,s,W}$. In addition, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of modified Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on $\mathcal L_{p,q,s,W}$ with $p\in(0,\infty)$, which, combined with the duality, further gives a necessary and sufficient condition for the boundedness of Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on $H^p_W$ with $p\in(0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Relative periodic solutions in spatial Kepler problem with symmetric perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spatial Kepler problem under a perturbation satisfying both rotational symmetry and reflection symmetry with respect to a plane perpendicular to the rotational axis. By applying recent results from \cite{CHHL23} combined with Franks Theorem, we prove the existence of infinitely many relative periodic solutions contained in compact energy surface when the perturbation is sufficiently small and certain technical conditions hold. In addition, we also demonstrate the existence of a unique $z$-symmetric brake orbit which forms a hopf link with a plane relative periodic solutions contained in compact energy surface only requires the perturbation sufficiently small. Our results apply to the motion of a satellite around an ellipsoid with uniform mass distribution and to the $n$-pyramidal problem with one point mass moving along $z$-axis and other $n$ equal masses forming a regular $n$-gon perpendicular to the $z$-axis at all times.</description>

      <title>Future stability of solutions of the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field system with decelerated expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study solutions to the Einstein equations coupled to a nonlinear scalar field with exponential potential. This system admits Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker solutions undergoing decelerated expansion, with $\mathbb{T}^3$ spatial topology and scale factor $a(t) = t^p$ for $1/3 &lt; p &lt; 1$. For each $p \in (2/3,1)$, we prove that the corresponding FLRW spacetime is future-stable as a solution to the Einstein-nonlinear scalar field system. Given initial data on a spacelike hypersurface that is sufficiently close to the FLRW data, we show the resulting solution is future-causal geodesically complete, and remains close to the FLRW solution for all time. Moreover, we show the perturbed metric components and scalar field converge to spatially homogeneous functions as $t \rightarrow \infty$. A key feature of our analysis is the decomposition of the metric and scalar field perturbations into their spatial averages and oscillatory remainders with zero average.</description>

      <title>Interface fluctuations for $1$D stochastic Allen-Cahn equation -- singular regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study interface fluctuations for the $1$D stochastic Allen-Cahn equation perturbed by half a spatial derivative of the spacetime white noise. This half derivative makes the solution distribution-valued, so that proper renormalization is needed to make sense of the solution.
  We show that if the noise is sufficiently small, then an analogue of the classical results by \cite{Fun95,BBDMP98} holds in this singular regime. More precisely, for initial data close to the traveling wave solution of the deterministic equation, under proper long time scaling, the solution still stays close to the family of traveling waves, and the interface location moves according to an approximate diffusion process. There is one interesting difference between our singular regime and the classical situation: even if the solution and its approximate phase separation point are both well defined, the intended diffusion describing the movement of the canonical candidate of the phase point is not (even for fixed $\eps$). Two infinite quantities arise from the derivation of such an SDE, one due to singularity of the noise, and the other from renormalization. Magically, it turns out that they cancel out each other, thus making the derivation of the interface SDE valid in the $\eps \rightarrow 0$ limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04994v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with the following nonlocal system of equations: \begin{align}\tag{$\mathcal S$}\label{MAT1} (-\Delta_p)^s u = \frac{\alpha}{p_s^*}|u|^{\alpha-2}u|v|^{\beta}+f(x) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d}, \, (-\Delta_p)^s v = \frac{\beta}{p_s^*}|v|^{\beta-2}v|u|^{\alpha}+g(x) \text{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d},\; u,v &gt;0 \mbox{ in } \mathbb{R}^{d}, \end{align} where $0&lt;s&lt;1&lt;p&lt; \infty$, $d&gt;sp$, $\alpha,\beta&gt;1$, $\alpha+\beta=\frac{dp}{d-sp}$, and $f,g$ are nontrivial nonnegative functionals in the dual space of $\mathcal{D}^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. The primary objective of this paper is to present a global compactness result that offers a complete characterization of the Palais-Smale sequences of the energy functional associated with \eqref{MAT1}. Using this characterization, within a certain range of $s$, we establish the existence of a solution with negative energy for \eqref{MAT1} when $\ker(f)=\ker(g)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the periodic homogenization for convex Hamilton-Jacobi equations on perforated domains under the Neumann type boundary conditions. We consider two types of conditions, the oblique derivative boundary condition and the prescribed contact angle boundary condition, which is important in the front propagation. We first establish the representation formula by using the Skorokhod problem and modified Lagrangians. We then obtain the optimal rate of convergence $O(\varepsilon)$ for homogenization by developing techniques in \cite{TY, HJMT} to apply to the Neumann type problems.</description>

Abstract: Consider a smooth, bounded domain $\O\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 4$ and a smooth positive function $V$. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of a sequence of positive solutions $u_\e$ to the equation $-\Delta u +V(x)u =u^{\frac{n+2}{n-2}-\e}$ in $\O$ with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, as $\e\to 0$. We determine the precise blow-up rate and characterize the locations of interior concentration points in the general case of multiple blow-up, providing an exhaustive description of interior blow-up phenomena of this equation. Our result is established through a delicate analysis of the gradient of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange functional.</description>

Abstract: This paper addresses the periodic homogenization of quasilinear elliptic PDEs in a two-component domain with an interfacial thermal barrier. It introduces a periodic extension operator that ensures strong convergence of function sequences in the Sobolev space. Moreover, two families of quasilinear elliptic problems in two-component domains with interfacial resistance will be considered here. One family with \(L^2\) data and another family with \(L^1\) data.</description>

      <title>Critical scattering for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on waveguide manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the small data scattering problem in critical spaces for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on waveguide manifolds. Our work is primarily inspired by the recent paper of Kwak and Kwon \cite{KwakKwon} that established the local well-posedness of the periodic NLS with possibly non-algebraic nonlinearity. While we adopt a framework similar to \cite{KwakKwon} for our problem, two main obstacles prevent its direct adaptation to the waveguide setting. First, the classical Strichartz estimates for NLS in critical product spaces, introduced by Hani and Pausader, possess limited endpoints and are thus inapplicable to high-dimensional waveguides. Second, the crucial fractional arguments used in \cite{KwakKwon} rely on a well-known fractional derivative formula due to Strichartz, which admits only a Hilbert space-valued extension and is therefore incompatible with our model setting.
  To overcome these difficulties, we develop an anisotropic generalization of the framework in \cite{KwakKwon} using the anisotropic Strichartz estimates established by Tzvetkov and Visciglia, which allow for nearly unlimited endpoints. We also resolve several new challenges arising from the vector-valued and anisotropic nature of the model by employing novel interpolation techniques within Besov spaces. As a further novelty, we provide a new proof of the main result based on classical fixed point arguments, differing from the approximation methods used in \cite{KwakKwon}. Consequently, we settle the small data scattering problem in critical spaces for the NLS with arbitrary mass-supercritical nonlinearity on waveguide manifolds.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and relaxation in a simplified model for viscoelastic phase separation via Hilbertian gradient flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with a gradient-flow approach to a Cahn-Hilliard model for viscoelastic phase separation introduced by Zhou et al. (Phys. Rev. E, 2006) in its variant with constant mobility. By means of time-incremental minimisation and generalised contractivity estimates, we establish the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem for moderately regular initial data. For general finite-energy data we obtain the existence of gradient-flow solutions and a stability estimate of weak-strong type. We further study the asymptotic behaviour for relaxation time and bulk modulus depending on a small parameter. Depending on the scaling, we recover the Cahn-Hilliard, the mass-conserving Allen-Cahn or the viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation. A challenge in the well-posedness analysis is the failure of semiconvexity of the appropriate driving functional, which is caused by a phase-dependence of the bulk modulus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05230v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha \in (0,2)$ and let $\beta&gt;0$. Fix $-\pi&lt;\varphi\leq \pi$ such that $|\varphi|&gt;\alpha \pi/2$. We determine the precise asymptotic behaviour of the Fourier transform of $E_{\alpha,\beta}(e^{\dot{\imath} \varphi} |\cdot|^{\sigma})$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$\!, whenever $\sigma&gt;(n-1)/2$. Remarkably, this asymptotic behaviour turns out to be independent of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\phi$ in the aforedescribed range. This helps us determine the values of the Lebesgue exponent $p=p(\sigma)$, $\sigma&gt;(n-1)/2$, for which $\mathcal{F} \left(E_{\alpha,\beta}(e^{\dot{\imath} \varphi} |\cdot|^{\sigma})\right)$ is in $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. Such values cannot be obtained via the Hausdorff-Young inequality. This problem arises in the study of space-time fractional equations. Our approach provides an effective alternative to the asymptotic analysis of the Fox $H-$ functions recently applied to the cases $\alpha \in (0,1)$, $\beta=\alpha$ with $\varphi=-\pi/2$, and $\beta=1$ with $\varphi=\pi$. We rather rely on an appropriate integral representative of $E_{\alpha,\beta}$, and an extended asymptotic expansion for the Bessel function whose coefficients and remainder term are obtained explicitly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long- and short-time behavior of solutions to dissipative evolution equations is studied by applying the concept of hypocoercivity. Aiming at partial differential equations that allow for a modal decomposition, we compute estimates that are uniform with respect to all modes. While the special example of the kinetic Lorentz equation was treated in previous work of the authors, that analysis is generalized here to general evolution equations having a scaled family of generators.</description>
