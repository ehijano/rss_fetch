      <title>New energy conversion system based on charge-exchange and inner-shell electron transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapidly growing demand for compact, high-energy power sources has outpaced the capabilities of conventional electrochemical systems that rely on outer-shell redox reactions. In this work, we present a new energy platform that utilizes inner-shell electron transitions that are previously inaccessible due to their high energy thresholds. By leveraging charge exchange processes between bare argon ions (Ar^18+) and neutral helium atoms, we provide clear evidence for the emission of soft X-ray and extreme-ultraviolet photons across a broad spectra range, resulting from inner-shell electron capture and cascade de-excitation. This strategy overcomes the limitations of radiative recombination by enhancing photon energy utilization through broader emission profiles more compatible with practical energy converters. Our design of a helium-filled chamber design enables precise control of output via pressure tuning, achieving a remarkable radiation power density of 6.29*10^8 W L^-1 and an unprecedented energy density of 2.64*10^6 Wh kg^-1. These results may provide a new and effective paradigm for energy conversion systems with ultra-high power and energy densities based on inner-shell electrons.</description>

      <title>General framework for quantifying entanglement production in ultracold molecular collisions and chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement, a defining feature of quantum mechanics, arises naturally from interactions between molecular systems. Yet the precise nature and quantification of entanglement in the products of molecular collisions and reactions remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that coupling between the external (motional) and internal degrees of freedom of the colliding molecules generates diverse forms of product-state entanglement: discrete-discrete, continuum-continuum, and hybrid discrete-continuum. We develop a general theoretical framework to quantify these entanglement forms directly from scattering S-matrix elements and identify a novel class of entangled states-multimode hybrid cat states, that exhibit multimode discrete-continuum entanglement. Although applicable at arbitrary collision energies, the formalism is illustrated in the ultracold and cold regimes for inelastic Rb+SrF and Rb+Sr$^+$ collisions, as well as the chemical reaction F+HD $\rightarrow$ HF+D, DF+H. We demonstrate that entanglement can be efficiently controlled near magnetic Feshbach resonances, paving the way for precise magnetic control of product-state entanglement generation in ultracold molecular collisions.</description>

      <title>Highly accurate semiclassical strong-field Herman-Kluk propagator method for high-harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our recently developed semiclassical strong-field Herman-Kluk propagator (SFHK) method to calculate high-order harmonic generation (HHG) for atoms in intense lasers. We show that our method, based on a combination of the Herman-Kluk propagator and the strong-field approximation, can provide highly accurate results for both HHG yield and phase, nearly identical to those from the exact numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We provide detailed analyses of our method and its applications to the HHG process, particularly the recombination time. The main computational task in this method is to solve the classical Newton equations for the active electron in the combined atomic potential and laser-electron interaction. The motion of the centers of the electron wave packets, modeled by coherent states, is governed by independent classical trajectories so that the computation can therefore be parallelized very efficiently.</description>

      <title>A fast and accurate method for simulating Bragg atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom interferometers are used in a variety of applications, from measuring gravity and gravity gradients in the field to performing tests of fundamental physics in the lab. One method of increasing interferometer sensitivity is to produce a larger momentum difference between interferometer arms through the use of large momentum transfer methods, such as Bragg diffraction. However, Bragg diffraction introduces systematic effects in the accumulated interferometer phase that are challenging to characterize.
  A Bragg atom interferometer is described by the one-dimensional time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (1D-TDSE). In this paper we show that for the case of Bragg diffraction the 1D-TDSE partial differential equation can be separated into several systems of ordinary differential equations, allowing for the use of adaptive step size Runge-Kutta methods. We compare the convergence of this method to the split-step and Crank-Nicolson methods, and present a method for further computational speed-ups using a lookup table.</description>

      <title>A comparison of Fraunhofer-type diffraction from an atomic single-slit and a molecular double-slit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measured the Q-value and the scattering angle distributions for non-dissociative state selective single electron capture in collisions of 7.5 keV H$^+$ and 15 keV H$_2^+$ with He. The experimental data are compared with semiclassical close-coupling calculations and predictions from the classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulations. By analogy with Fraunhofer diffraction, we also developed a toy model to reconstruct an imaginary screen that reflects the reaction impact-parameter dependence, in channels where the magnetic quantum number remains unchanged. It is well established that H$_2^+$ acts as a molecular double-slit in scattering processes. By demodulating the Young's double-slit-type interference pattern, we extracted the individual slit diffraction pattern of H$_2^+$ and compared it with that of the H$^+$ atomic single-slit. For ground state electron capture, we found that the single and the double slit diffraction patterns have equal fringe width, whereas for excited state electron capture, diffraction patterns are quite different.</description>

      <title>Hybrid collisional-radiative modeling for high-fidelity atomic kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fidelity of collisional-radiative (CR) models is critical for advancing our understanding of radiative properties and ionization balance in fusion plasmas. In this work, we present and evaluate hybrid CR schemes that combine fine-structure resolution with superconfiguration averaging, offering a practical compromise between accuracy and computational efficiency. Two hybrid CR models are developed for helium, lithium, and beryllium, retaining detailed fine-structure states up to selected principal quantum numbers, while higher-lying states are statistically averaged to form superconfigurations. These models are applied to compute radiative power loss, as well as average and effective charge states, across a wide range of electron temperatures and densities. The results are benchmarked against a fully fine-structure-resolved CR model to assess the accuracy of the hybrid approach. The findings demonstrate the versatility of hybrid CR schemes and their suitability for detailed plasma simulations where predictive fidelity must be balanced with computational cost.</description>

      <title>Holstein Primakoff spin codes for local and collective noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet most existing codes rely on local control and stabilizer measurements that are difficult to implement in systems dominated by collective interactions. Inspired by spin-GKP codes in PhysRevA.108.022428, we develop a general framework for Holstein-Primakoff spin codes, which maps continuous-variable bosonic codes onto permutation-symmetric spin ensembles via the Holstein-Primakoff approximation. We show that HP codes are robust to both collective and local-spin noise and propose an explicit measurement-free local error recovery procedure to map local noise into correctable collective-spin errors.</description>

      <title>Atom-light hybrid interferometer for atomic sensing with quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum memories feature a reversible conversion of optical fields into long-lived atomic spin waves, and are therefore ideal for operating as sensitive atomic sensors. However, up to now, atom-light interferometers have lacked an efficient approach to exploit their ultimate atomic sensing performance, since an extra optical delay line is required to compensate for the memory time. Here, we report a new protocol that records the photocurrent via heterodyne mixing with a stable local oscillator. The obtained complex quadrature amplitude that carries information imprinted on its phase by an external magnetic field, is successfully recovered from the interference patterns between the light and the atomic spin wave, without the stringent requirement of having them overlap in time. Our results reveal that the sensitivity scales favorably with the lifetime of the quantum memory. Our work may have important applications in building distributed quantum networks through quantum memory-assisted atom-light interferometers.</description>

      <title>Imperfect blockade in Rydberg superatoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensembles of atoms interacting via their Rydberg levels, known as "superatoms" for their ability to encode qubits and to emit single photons, attract increasing attention as building blocks for quantum network nodes. Assessing their performance requires an accurate, physically informative and numerically scalable description of interactions in a large and disordered ensemble. We derive such a description from first principles and successfully test it against brute-force numerics and experimental data. This model proves essential to make quantitative predictions about gate fidelities or photon emission efficiencies, and to guide experiments towards large-scale superatom-based systems.</description>

      <title>Supersolid phases and collective excitations in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled spin-1 condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective excitation spectrum and dynamics of a quasi two-dimensional spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba type spin-orbit (SO) coupling. Employing Bogoliubov-de-Gennes analysis, we analytically compute the excitation spectra across a wide range of interaction strengths and coupling parameters. By systematically varying the SO and Rabi couplings, we uncover distinct dynamical signatures of quantum phase transitions, including mode softening, the appearance of roton-like minima, and miscibility-driven instabilities in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interaction regimes. In the antiferromagnetic case, these instabilities lead to a dynamically unstable supersolid phase characterized by the coexistence of density modulation and global phase coherence. To corroborate the analytical predictions, we numerically solve the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations and analyze the dynamical stability of the condensate. Our results provide experimentally accessible signatures for spinor condensates with tunable spin-orbit coupling and demonstrate the rich interplay between spin-dependent interactions and synthetic couplings in nonequilibrium quantum fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bremsstrahlung emission remains a cornerstone process in the characterization of electron dynamics in diverse high-energy environments. In particular, the accurate description of thin-target electron-ion bremsstrahlung in the presence of high-$Z$ species requires careful treatment of atomic screening effects, especially when atoms are partially ionized. We present a fully analytic screening model based on a multi-Yukawa representation of the atomic potential, enabling the calculation of bremsstrahlung cross sections for arbitrary nuclear charge and ionization state, and electron energies up to a few tens of MeV. This framework extends prior treatments of neutral atoms to include partially ionized high-$Z$ elements in a fully analytic framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent single-photon detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of photons at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement by a single photon through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Qubit Loss Detection in Fault Tolerant Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubit loss errors constitute a dominant source of noise in many quantum hardware systems, particularly in neutral atom quantum computers. We develop a theoretical framework to effectively detect and correct loss errors in logical algorithms and leverage such loss information in decoding. Considering general quantum error correction codes and logical circuits, we introduce a delayed-erasure decoder for experimentally-motivated error models which leverages information from delayed loss detection to accurately correct loss errors, even when the precise moment of the error is unknown. Using this decoder, we identify strategies for detecting and correcting loss errors based on the logical circuit structure. For deep circuits prior to logical measurement, we explore methods to integrate loss detection into syndrome extraction with minimal overhead, identifying optimal strategies depending on the qubit loss fraction in the noise and hardware capabilities. In contrast, we find that many key algorithmic subroutines involve frequent gate teleportation, shortening the circuit depth before logical measurement and naturally replacing qubits with no additional experimental overhead. We simulate this setting using a toy model algorithm for small-angle synthesis, and find a significant performance improvement as the loss fraction increases. These results provide a path forward for advancing large-scale fault tolerant quantum computation in systems with loss error detection.</description>
