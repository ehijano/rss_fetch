      <title>Forecasting ICT-Driven Trade Competitiveness 2024-2028: A Cluster and Scenario Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces the Digital Competitiveness Index for Trade (DCIT), a composite metric integrating ICT readiness, broadband adoption, GDP per capita, foreign direct investment, government effectiveness, and trade volume to assess countries' digital trade competitiveness. The index captures the enabling conditions -- ICT innovation capacity, broadband diffusion, investment intensity, and macroeconomic fundamentals - that shape a nation's ability to participate in digital trade. Sensitivity analysis demonstrates strong robustness: adjusting ICT-FDI weights alters DCIT outcomes by only 26%, with near perfect linearity (R^2 = 0.9996). Predictive validation shows that DCIT is a strong explainer of trade connectivity growth (R^2 = 0.67) but a modest predictor of GDP expansion. Scenario simulations reveal that combined ICT and FDI acceleration consistently outperforms single-lever strategies, with gains increasing by cluster maturity (up to 10% in advanced clusters). High-growth scenarios generate a 50-60% uplift in competitiveness for mid-tier and advanced clusters, underscoring the importance of integrated digital investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Investigation into U.S. Citizen and Non-Citizen Worker Health Insurance and Employment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socioeconomic integration is a critical dimension of social equity, yet persistent disparities remain in access to health insurance, education, and employment across different demographic groups. While previous studies have examined isolated aspects of inequality, there is limited research that integrates both statistical analysis and advanced machine learning to uncover hidden structures within population data. This study leverages statistical analysis ($\chi^2$ test of independence and Two Proportion Z-Test) and machine learning clustering techniques -- K-Modes and K-Prototypes -- along with t-SNE visualization and CatBoost classification to analyze socioeconomic integration and inequality. Using statistical tests, we identified the proportion of the population with healthcare insurance, quality education, and employment. With this data, we concluded that there was an association between employment and citizenship status. Moreover, we were able to determine 5 distinct population groups using Machine Learning classification. The five clusters our analysis identifies reveal that while citizenship status shows no association with workforce participation, significant disparities exist in access to employer-sponsored health insurance. Each cluster represents a distinct demographic of the population, showing that there is a primary split along the lines of educational attainment which separates Clusters 0 and 4 from Clusters 1, 2, and 3. Furthermore, labor force status and nativity serve as secondary differentiators. Non-citizens are also disproportionately concentrated in precarious employment without benefits, highlighting systemic inequalities in healthcare access. By uncovering demographic clusters that face compounded disadvantages, this research contributes to a more nuanced understanding of socioeconomic stratification.</description>

      <title>Sticky Homelessness (Working Paper)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homelessness in American cities is becoming an ever more prominent issue, but its causes remain contested, ranging from mental health and substance abuse to housing affordability and local labor markets. To shed light on this issue, I construct a novel MSA-level national panel of homelessness counts using data from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Using a long-differencing regression specification with the changes in rent entered in piecewise linear form, I find that rent increases predict large increases in homelessness rates, but decreases have little to no effect. The same conclusions are reached when I use a quasi-differencing moment condition, assuming a multiplicative mean specification. Then, I propose a theoretical model of the low-end housing market that explains the asymmetry I find in the data. Finally, I outline an IV strategy that instruments rent changes with a Bartik instrument of predicted employment growth interacted with local housing-supply elasticities. My findings suggest that homelessness is a housing problem; however, because the response is sticky downward, effective policy must complement housing-market interventions with measures that address barriers faced by people experiencing homelessness.</description>

      <title>A dynamic factor semiparametric model for VaR and expected shortfall driven by realized measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a semiparametric joint VaRES framework driven by realized information, mo tivated by the economic mechanisms underlying tail risk generation. Building on the CAViaR quantile recursion, the model introduces a dynamic ESVaR gap to capture time-varying tail sever ity, while measurement equations transform multiple realized measures into high-frequency risk innovations.These innovations are further aggregated through a dynamic factor model, extracting common high-frequency tail risk factors that affect the quantile level and tail thickness through dis tinct risk channels. This structure explicitly separates changes in risk levels from the intensification of tail risk.Empirical evidence shows that the proposed model consistently outperforms quantile regression, EVT-based, and GARCH-type benchmarks across multiple loss functions, highlighting the importance of embedding high-frequency information directly into the tail risk generation layer</description>

      <title>Strategic Expression, Popularity Traps, and Welfare in Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms systematically reward popularity but not authenticity, incentivizing users to strategically tailor their expression for attention. We develop a utilitarian framework addressing strategic expression in social media. Agents hold fixed heterogeneous authentic opinions and derive (i) utility gains from the popularity of their own posts--measured by likes received--, and (ii) utility gains (losses) from exposure to content that aligns with (diverges from) their authentic opinion. Social media interaction acts as a state-dependent welfare amplifier: light topics generate Pareto improvements, whereas intense topics make everyone worse off in a polarized society (e.g., political debates during elections). Moreover, strategic expression amplifies social media polarization during polarized events while dampening it during unified events (e.g., national celebrations). Consequently, strategic distortions magnify welfare outcomes, expanding aggregate gains in light topics while exacerbating losses in intense, polarized ones. Counterintuitively, strategic agents often face a popularity trap: posting a more popular opinion is individually optimal, yet collective action by similar agents eliminates their authentic opinion from the platform, leaving them worse off than under the authentic-expression benchmark. Preference-based algorithms--widely used by platforms--or homophilic exposures discipline popularity-driven behavior, narrowing the popularity trap region and limiting its welfare effects. Our framework fills a critical gap in the social media literature by providing a microfoundation for user welfare that maps to observable metrics, while also introducing popularity incentives as an unexplored channel in social networks distinct from the canonical mechanisms of conformity, learning, persuasion, and (mis)information transmission.</description>

      <title>When Is Degree Enough? Bounds on Degree-Eigenvector Misalignment in Assortative Structured Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tight alignment between the degree vector and the leading eigenvector arises naturally in networks with neutral degree mixing and the absence of local structures. Many real-world networks, however, violate both conditions. We derive bounds on the divergence between the degree vector and the eigenvector in networks with degree assortativity and local mesoscopic structures such as communities, core-peripheries, and cycles. Our approach is constructive. We design sufficiently general degree-preserving rewiring algorithms that start from a neutral benchmark and monotonically increase assortativity and the strength of local structures, with each step inducing a perturbation of the adjacency matrix. Using the Stewart--Sun Perturbation Bound, together with explicit spectral-norm control of the rewiring steps, we derive upper bounds on the angle between the eigenvector and the degree vector for modest levels of assortativity and local structures. Our analytical bounds delineate regions of `spectral safety' in which a node's degree can be used as a reliable measure of its systemic importance in real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Improve Venture Capital Exit Timing After IPO?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exit timing after an IPO is one of the most consequential decisions for venture capital (VC) investors, yet existing research focuses mainly on describing when VCs exit rather than evaluating whether those choices are economically optimal. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in synthesizing complex financial data and textual information but have not been applied to post-IPO exit decisions. This study introduces a framework that uses LLMs to estimate the optimal time for VC exit by analyzing monthly post IPO information financial performance, filings, news, and market signals and recommending whether to sell or continue holding. We compare these LLM generated recommendations with the actual exit dates observed for VCs and compute the return differences between the two strategies. By quantifying gains or losses associated with following the LLM, this study provides evidence on whether AI-driven guidance can improve exit timing and complements traditional hazard and real-options models in venture capital research.</description>

      <title>Robust Appointment Scheduling with Waiting Time Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Appointment scheduling problems under uncertainty encounter a fundamental trade-off between cost minimization and customer waiting times. Most existing studies address this trade-off using a weighted sum approach, which puts little emphasis on individual waiting times and, thus, customer satisfaction. In contrast, we study how to minimize total cost while providing waiting time guarantees to all customers. Given box uncertainty sets for service times and no-shows, we introduce the Robust Appointment Scheduling Problem with Waiting Time Guarantees. We show that the problem is NP-hard in general and introduce a mixed-integer linear program that can be solved in reasonable computation time. For special cases, we prove that polynomial-time variants of the well-known Smallest-Variance-First sequencing rule and the Bailey-Welch scheduling rule are optimal. Furthermore, a case study with data from the radiology department of a large university hospital demonstrates that the approach not only guarantees acceptable waiting times but, compared to existing robust approaches, may simultaneously reduce costs incurred by idle time and overtime. This work suggests that limiting instead of minimizing customer waiting times is a win-win solution in the trade-off between customer satisfaction and cost minimization. Additionally, it provides an easy-to-implement and customizable appointment scheduling framework with waiting time guarantees.</description>

      <title>Demand and consumer surplus in the payday-loan market: Evidence from British Columbia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15247v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines how interest rate caps affect the demand for payday loans, using aggregate data from British Columbia (2012--2019) during which the province's maximum fee was reduced from $23 to $17 and then to \$15 per $100 borrowed. Estimating a linear demand function via OLS, we find that lowering interest rate caps significantly increases loan demand. We estimate that the $8 decrease, from $23 to $15 per $100, raised annual consumer surplus by roughly $28.6 million (2012 CAD). A further reduction to $14, starting in January 2025, would add another $3.9 million per year. These results suggest that stricter interest rate caps can yield substantial consumer welfare gains.</description>

      <title>Market Beliefs about Open vs. Closed AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Market expectations about AI's economic impact may influence interest rates. Previous work has shown that US bond yields decline around the release of a sample of mostly proprietary AI models (Andrews and Farboodi 2025). I extend this analysis to include also open weight AI models that can be freely used and modified. I find long-term bond yields shift in opposite directions following the introduction of open versus closed models. Patterns are similar for treasuries, corporate bonds, and TIPS. The different movements suggest that markets may anticipate open and closed AI advances to have important and different economic implications.</description>

      <title>Preventive Care Disruptions and Emergency Hospitalizations: Evidence from COVID-19 and SHARE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study whether disruptions to preventive care during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic affected subsequent acute hospital use. Using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe from eight countries, we focus on women aged 50-69, the target group for organized breast cancer screening. The outcome is an indicator for any all-cause emergency overnight hospitalization in the prior twelve months. To address selection into screening, we use an instrumental variables design based on six interview-month cohorts in Wave 9 (March-August 2022) interacted with country indicators. Because mammography is reported over a two-year recall window anchored to the interview month, these cohort-by-country interactions shift how much of the March-August 2020 restriction period falls inside the recall window, generating variation in mammography uptake across cohorts within countries. The estimates imply that mammography reduces emergency overnight hospitalization by about six percentage points. No effect appears among women aged 70 and above. Results are robust to controls, disruption measures, and falsification tests.</description>
