      <title>Pr10+ as a candidate for a high-accuracy optical clock for tests of fundamental physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose In-like Pr10+ as a candidate for the development of a high-accuracy optical clock with high sensitivity to a time variation of the fine-structure constant, (\dot alpha}/alpha, as well as favorable experimental systematics. We calculate its low-lying energy levels by combining the configuration interaction and the coupled cluster method, achieving uncertainties as low as 0.1%, and improving previous work. We benchmark these results by comparing our calculations for the (5s^2 5p 2P_1/2) - (5s^2 5p 2P_3/2) transition in Pr10+ with a dedicated measurement and for Pr9+ with a recent experiment, respectively. In addition, we report calculated hyperfine-structure constants for the clock and logic states in Pr10+.</description>

      <title>Interaction of vector light beams with atoms exposed to a time-dependent magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During recent years interest has been rising for applications of vector light beams towards magnetic field sensing. In particular, a series of experiments were performed to extract information about properties of static magnetic fields from absorption profiles of light passing through an atomic gas target. In the present work, we propose an extension to this method for oscillating magnetic fields. To investigate this scenario, we carried out theoretical analysis based on the time-dependent density matrix theory. We found that absorption profiles, even when averaged over typical observation times, are indeed sensitive to both strength and frequency of the time-dependent field, thus opening the prospect for a powerful diagnostic technique. To illustrate this sensitivity, we performed detailed calculations for the $5s \;\, {}^2S_{1/2}$ ($F=1$) $-$ $5p \;\, {}^2 P_{3/2}$ ($F=0$) transition in rubidium atoms, subject to a superposition of an oscillating (test) and a static (reference) magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of the Rydberg States of CO$_{2}$: Autoionization and Dissociation Lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the measurement of ultrafast relaxation dynamics of excited states of carbon dioxide molecule using time-resolved pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy. Neutral ground state carbon dioxide is excited to $nd\sigma_g$ Henning sharp Rydberg states with an attosecond extreme ultraviolet pulse train. A time delayed near infrared probe pulse is used to photoionize these states to their corresponding ionization limit $B^2\Sigma_u^+$. We obtain differential kinetic energy spectrograms and angular distributions for photoionization and autoionization channels. We model the competition between predissociation and autoionization in the Rydberg state dynamics and analyze differential photoelectron yield as a function of the time delay to extract previously unknown autoionization and predissociation lifetimes for three Henning sharp states (n = 4, 5, 6).</description>

      <title>Long-lived collective Rydberg excitations in atomic gas achieved via ac-Stark lattice modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06513v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective Rydberg excitations provide promising applications ranging from quantum information processing, and quantum computing to ultra-sensitive electrometry. However, their short lifetime is an immense obstacle in real-life scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods of prolonging the lifetime were mainly implemented for ground-state quantum memories and would require a redesign to effectively work on different atomic transitions. We propose a protocol for extending the Rydberg excitation lifetime, which in principle can freeze the spin-wave and completely cancel the effects of thermal dephasing. The protocol employs off-resonant ac-Stark lattice modulation of spin waves by interfering two laser beams on the atomic medium. Our implementation showed that the excitation lifetime can be extended by an order of magnitude, paving the way towards more complex protocols for collective Rydberg excitations.</description>
