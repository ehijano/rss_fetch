      <title>Critical and asymmetric Fourier uniqueness pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin, we construct a sufficient condition for discrete subsets of $\mathbb{R}$, which lie between the supercritical and subcritical cases, to constitute Fourier uniqueness pairs. This family of critical uniqueness pairs includes pairs that are strongly asymmetric, stretching beyond those associated with zeros of zeta and L-functions, discovered by Bondarenko, Radchenko, and Seip, and getting close to the classical Shannon--Whittaker uniqueness pair.</description>

      <title>A non-linear Roth theorem for thick Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17880v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for any function $f$ satisfying certain mild conditions and any Cantor set $K$ with Newhouse thickness greater than $1$, there exists $x\in K$ and $t&gt;0$ such that \[ \{x-t,x,x+f(t)\}\subset K. \] This is an extension of previous work on the existence of three-term arithmetic progressions in Cantor sets to the non-linear setting.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate computation of classical Gaussian quadratures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for computing classical Gaussian quadrature rules (Gauss-Jacobi, Gauss-Laguerre, and Gauss-Hermite) are presented, based on globally convergent fourth-order iterative methods and asymptotic approximations, which are applied in complementary regions of the parameter space. The combination of these approaches results in methods that surpass previous algorithms in terms of speed, accuracy, and computational range (practically unrestricted). The Gauss-Radau and Gauss-Lobatto variants are also considered, along with the computation of the associated barycentric weights. Arbitrary accuracy algorithms are also provided for the symmetric cases (Gauss-Gegenbauer and Gauss-Hermite).</description>

      <title>Boundary Feller-Dynkin processes associated with Laguerre processes and Pickrell diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a Feller-Dynkin boundary process by applying the method of intertwiners to the coherent family, introduced in our previous work, of Laguerre processes with a fixed parameter. The corresponding boundary process is computed explicitly, and it turns out to be a deterministic dynamical system. Since the Pickrell diffusions that leave the Pickrell measure invariant are coherent with respect to the same projective system, we also obtain the stochastic boundary process associated with the coherent family of Pickrell diffusions.</description>

      <title>A refined variant of Hartley convolution: Algebraic structures and related issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel convolution product associated with the $\mathscr{H}$-transform, denoted by $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$, and explore its fundamental properties. Here, the $\mathscr{H}$-transform may be regarded as a refined variant of the classical Fourier, Hartley transform, with kernel function depending on two parameters $a,b$. Our first contribution shows that the space of integrable functions, equipped with multiplication given by the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution, constitutes the commutative Banach algebra over the complex field, albeit without an identity element. Second, we prove the Wiener--L\'evy invertibility criterion for the $\mathscr H$-algebra and formulate Gelfand's spectral radius theorem. Third, we obtain a sharp form of Young's inequality for the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution and its direct corollary. Finally, all of these theoretical findings are applied to investigate specific classes of the Fredholm integral equations and heat source problems, yielding a priori estimates under the established assumptions.</description>

      <title>Entrywise preservers of sign regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entrywise functions preserving positivity and related notions have a rich history, beginning with the seminal works of Schur, P\'olya-Szeg\H{o}, Schoenberg, and Rudin. Following their classical results, it is well-known that entrywise functions preserving positive semidefiniteness for matrices of all dimensions must be real analytic with non-negative Taylor coefficients. These works were taken forward in the last decade by Belton, Guillot, Khare, Putinar, and Rajaratnam. Recently, Belton-Guillot-Khare-Putinar [J. d'Analyse Math. 2023] classified all functions that entrywise preserve totally positive (TP) and totally non-negative (TN) matrices. In this paper, we study entrywise preservers of strictly sign regular and sign regular matrices - a class that includes TP/TN matrices as special cases and was first studied by Schoenberg in 1930 to characterize variation diminution. Our main results provide complete characterizations of entrywise transforms of rectangular matrices which preserve: (i)~sign regularity and strict sign regularity, as well as (ii)~sign regularity and strict sign regularity with a given sign pattern.</description>

      <title>Weak porosity on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11419v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the subsets $E$ of a metric space $X$ with doubling measure whose distance function to some negative power $\textrm{dist}(\cdot,E)^{-\alpha}$ belongs to the Muckenhoupt $A_1$ class of weights in $X$. To this end, we introduce the weakly porous sets in this setting, and show that, along with certain doubling-type conditions for the sizes of the largest $E$-free holes, these sets characterize the mentioned $A_1$-property. We exhibit examples showing the optimality of these conditions, and simplify them in the particular case where the underlying measure satisfies a qualitative annular decay property. In addition, we use some of these distance functions as a new and simple method to explicitly construct doubling weights in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that do not belong to $A_\infty.$</description>

      <title>Flow of the zeros of polynomials under iterated differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a monic polynomial $Q_n$ of degree $n$, let $Q_{n, k}$ be its $k$-th derivative normalized to be monic. Under the only assumption that the sequence $\{Q_n\}$ has a weak* limiting zero distribution (an empirical distribution of zeros) represented by a probability measure $\mu_0$ with compact support in the complex plane, we show that as $n, k \rightarrow \infty$ such that $k / n \rightarrow t \in(0,1)$, the Cauchy transform of the normalized zero-counting measure of the polynomials $Q_{n, k}$ converges in a neighborhood of infinity to an analytic function, uniquely determined by $\mu_0$ and $t$, that can be written as the Cauchy transform of a measure $\mu_t$, not necessarily uniquely determined unless $\mu_0$ is supported on the real line.
  The family of these Cauchy transforms and, when well defined, the corresponding measures $\mu_t $, $t \in(0,1)$, whose dependence on the parameter $t$ can be interpreted as a flow of the zeros under iterated differentiation, has several interesting connections with the inviscid Burgers equation, the fractional free convolution of $\mu_0$, or a nonlocal diffusion equation governing the density of $\mu_t$ on $\mathbb R$.
  We provide an elementary and unified approach that not only recovers, but also explains various phenomena observed in prior works - from Burgers-type PDEs to free probability limits.</description>

Abstract: We prove two-weight norm inequalities for parabolic fractional maximal functions using parabolic Muckenhoupt weights. In particular, we prove a two-weight, weak-type estimate and Fefferman-Stein type inequalities for the centered parabolic maximal function. We also prove that a parabolic Sawyer-type condition implies the strong-type estimate for the parabolic fractional maximal function. Finally, we prove the strong-type estimate for the centered parabolic maximal function assuming a stronger parabolic Muckenhoupt bump condition.</description>

      <title>Weak $(1,1)$ estimate for maximal truncated rough singular integral operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In their seminal work (Amer. J. Math. 78: 289-309, 1956), Calder\'on and Zygmund introduced the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator and established its $L^p$-boundedness for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. However, the endpoint case $p = 1$ remained an open problem. This paper resolves this problem. More precisely, we prove that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator is of weak type $(1,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For Schr\"odinger operators $H_V=-\Delta_g+V$ with critically singular potentials $V$ on compact manifolds, we prove sharp estimates for the restriction of eigenfunctions to submanifolds. Our method refines the perturbative argument by Blair-Sire-Sogge and enables us to deal with submanifolds of all codimensions. As applications, we obtain improved estimates on negatively curved manifolds and flat tori. In particular, we extend the uniform $L^2$ restriction estimates on flat tori by Bourgain-Rudnick to singular potentials.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of tiles in finite Abelian groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the periodic tiling (PT) property for finite abelian groups. A finite abelian group is said to have the PT property if every non-periodic set that tiles the group by translation admits a periodic tiling complement. This notion extends the scope beyond groups with the Haj\'os property. We give a complete classification of cyclic groups possessing the PT property and identify certain non-cyclic groups that enjoy the PT property but fail to satisfy the Haj\'os property.. As a byproduct, we obtain new families of groups for which the implication ``Tile $\Longrightarrow$ Spectral" holds. Furthermore, for elementary $p$-groups with the PT property, by analyzing the structure of tiles, we prove that every tile is a complete set of representatives of the cosets of some subgroup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By using the vector-valued theory of singular integrals, we prove a Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality on product Hardy spaces $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$, which is a parallel result of the classical Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality. The same technique shows the $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$-boundedness of the iterated Hilbert transform. As a byproduct, new proofs of several recently discovered Hardy type inequalities on product Hardy spaces are obtained, which avoid complicated Calder\'on--Zygmund theory on product domain, rendering them considerably simpler than the original proofs.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established.
  In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959. In particular, our result confirms a remark of Billsborough et al., who observed that if the original Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres proof could be fixed, the O'Hara--Rodriguez bound would yield exactly this inequality.</description>
