      <title>Quantum theory of neutron in magnetic field and neutron-electron collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper presents solution of quantum problem of neutron propagation in the magnetic field with multipole field expansion. Rigorous solution of the Pauli equation for neutron reveals existence of two solutions, finite and infinite, for any miltipole configuration. As an example, we present detailed study of neutron motion in quadrupole and sextupole. Our predictions agree with the results of Stern-Gerlach experiment for neutrons. To verify existence of finite and infinite motion, we discuss an experiment which could be performed in the Budker Insitute of Nuclear Physics using existing equipment. We conclude with the proposal of neutron-electron intersecting ring (neutron-electron ``collider''), which, if realized, would allow to accomplish a number of important experiments devoting to study neutron internal structure.</description>

      <title>Development of a novel bunch oscillation recorder with RFSoC technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SuperKEKB accelerator is designed to achieve unprecedented luminosity levels, but this goal is currently hindered by Sudden Beam Loss (SBL) events. These events not only obstruct luminosity improvement but also pose a significant risk to accelerator components, the Belle II detectors, and the superconducting focusing system, potentially leading to severe damage and quenching of the superconducting system. To address this critical challenge, we have developed a novel Bunch Oscillation Recorder (BOR) based on RFSoC technology. The BOR has demonstrated high precision with a position resolution of 0.03 mm, making it a powerful tool for real-time beam monitoring. In its initial deployment, the BOR successfully recorded multiple SBL events, providing valuable data for further analysis. By strategically positioning BORs at the suspected points of SBL origin, we aim to directly identify sources of beam instability. We anticipate that this portable, high-speed BOR monitor will play a crucial role in resolving the SBL issue, ultimately helping achieve SuperKEKB's luminosity targets.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>
