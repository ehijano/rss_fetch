      <title>SNIC bifurcation and its Application to MEMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project focuses on a method to extract a frequency comb in mechanical means, for general interest and numerous practical applications in MEMS. The method of execution is the implementation of a beam that is exhibiting non-linear dynamics that is perturbed and analyzed for its transverse vibrations. The perturbation is an external harmonic driver with a chosen small amplitude and frequency (which is slightly detuned from the beam eigenfrequency), that when engaged with the unperturbed beam oscillations, causes it reach a state of "injection pulling" - an effect that occurs when one harmonic oscillator is coupled with a second one and causes it to oscillate in a frequency near its own. This causes the beam to reach SNIC bifurcation, rendering a frequency comb as desired. Theoretical analysis showed that the problem can be modelled using a non-linear equation of the beam, that translates to a form of the non-linear Duffing equation. While a solution to the dynamics function of the beam is hard to obtain in practice due to mathematical difficulties, a slow evolution model is suggested that is composed of functions of a amplitude and phase. Using several additional mathematical assumptions, the amplitude is seen to be related to the phase, while the phase equation solution is seen to be of the form of Adler's equation. These assumptions ultimately reduce the entire behaviour of the beam to a relatively simple solution to the Adler equation, which has a known analytical solution. Computerized numerical simulations are run on it to check the results and compare them to the theory and desired outcome. The results agreed with the theory and produce the expected frequency comb, showing the assumptions to be valid in extracting the comb.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Continuous Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Network-Toughened Diamond Composite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the fracture toughness of diamond while preserving its hardness is a significant challenge. Traditional toughening strategies have primarily focused on modulating the internal microstructural units of diamonds, including adjustments to stacking sequences, faults, nanotwinning, and the incorporation of amorphous phases, collectively referred to as intrinsic toughening. Here, we introduce an extrinsic toughening strategy to develop an unparalleled tough diamond composite with complex and abundant sp2-sp3 bonding interfaces, by incorporating highly dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) into the gaps of diamond grains to create a three-dimensional (3D) continuous MWCTNs network-toughen heterogeneous structure. The resultant composite exhibits a hardness of approximately 91.6 GPa and a fracture toughness of roughly 36.4 MPa.m1/2, which is six times higher than that of synthetic diamond and even surpasses that of tungsten alloys, surpassing the benefits achievable through intrinsic toughening alone. The remarkable toughening behavior can be attributed to the formation of numerous mixed sp2-sp3 bonding interactions at the 3D continuous network MWCNTs/diamond interfaces, which facilitate efficient energy dissipation. Our 3D continuous network heterogeneous structure design provides an effective approach for enhancing the fracture toughness of superhard materials, offering a new paradigm for the advanced composite ceramics.</description>

      <title>Giant Anomalous Hall Conductivity and Gilbert Damping in Room-temperature Ferromagnetic Half-Heusler Alloys PtMnBi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half-Heusler alloys have emerged as promising candidates for novel spintronic applications due to their exceptional properties including the high Curie temperature (TC) above room temperature and large anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this work, we systematically study the magnetic and electronic properties of PtMnBi in {\alpha}-, \{beta}-, and {\gamma}-phase using first-principles calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. The three phases are found to be ferromagnetic metals. In particular, the {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi shows a high TC up to 802 K and a relatively large Gilbert damping of 0.085. Additionally, the {\gamma}-phase PtMnBi possesses a non-negligible AHC, reaching 203 {\Omega}-1cm-1 at the Fermi level. To evaluate its potential in nanoscale devices, we further investigate the {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films. The Gilbert dampings of {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin films varies with film thickness and we attribute this variation to the distinct band structures at the high-symmetry point {\Gamma}, which arise from differences in film thickness. Moreover, the 1-layer (1L) {\alpha}-phase thin film retains robust ferromagnetism (TC = 688 K) and shows enhanced Gilbert damping (0.14) and AHC (1116 {\Omega}-1cm-1) compared to the bulk. Intriguingly, under a 2% in-plane biaxial compressive strain, the Gilbert damping of 1L {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi thin film increases to 0.17 and the AHC reaches 2386 {\Omega}-1cm-1. The coexistence of giant Gilbert damping and large AHC makes {\alpha}-phase PtMnBi a compelling platform for practical spintronic applications, and highlights the potential of half-Heusler alloys in spintronic device design.</description>

      <title>Quantum Process Tomography of a Room-Temperature Alkali-Metal Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a technique for reconstructing the dynamics of open quantum systems under the Born-Markov approximation, as described by a Liouvillian superoperator, capturing both coherent and dissipative processes. While QPT is well established for qubits, it presents significant experimental challenges in multi-level qudits. In room-temperature atomic vapors, these difficulties arise from complex interactions, residual fields present in the system, environmental noise, and inhomogeneities in the medium. Overcoming these limitations is essential for accurate modeling and precise control of such systems--a critical step toward practical usage of the QPT. We present a QPT method that we experimentally validate on a room-temperature $^{87}$Rb vapor ensemble, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction of qutrit Liouvillians. Our approach establishes a computationally efficient framework for characterizing open quantum systems, enabling the study of non-unitary dynamics, efficient benchmarking of quantum sensors, and data-driven identification of environmental noise correlations.</description>

      <title>Embodied Intelligence for Sustainable Flight: A Soaring Robot with Active Morphological Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving both agile maneuverability and high energy efficiency in aerial robots, particularly in dynamic wind environments, remains challenging. Conventional thruster-powered systems offer agility but suffer from high energy consumption, while fixed-wing designs are efficient but lack hovering and maneuvering capabilities. We present Floaty, a shape-changing robot that overcomes these limitations by passively soaring, harnessing wind energy through intelligent morphological control inspired by birds. Floaty's design is optimized for passive stability, and its control policy is derived from an experimentally learned aerodynamic model, enabling precise attitude and position control without active propulsion. Wind tunnel experiments demonstrate Floaty's ability to hover, maneuver, and reject disturbances in vertical airflows up to 10 m/s. Crucially, Floaty achieves this with a specific power consumption of 10 W/kg, an order of magnitude lower than thruster-powered systems. This introduces a paradigm for energy-efficient aerial robotics, leveraging morphological intelligence and control to operate sustainably in challenging wind conditions.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic chamber setup for superfluid helium experiments with optical fiber and electrical access</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superfluid helium is a prototypical quantum liquid. As such, it has been a prominent platform for the study of quantum many body physics. More recently, the outstanding mechanical and optical properties of superfluid helium, such as low mechanical dissipation and low optical absorption, have positioned superfluid helium as a promising material platform in applications ranging from dark matter and gravitational wave detection to quantum computation. However, experiments with superfluid helium incur a high barrier to entry as they require incorporation of complex optical and electrical setups within a hermetically sealed cryogenic chamber to confine the superfluid. Here, we report on the design and construction of a helium chamber setup for operation inside a dilution refrigerator at Millikelvin temperatures, featuring electrical and optical fiber access. By incorporating an automated gas handling system, we can precisely control the amount of helium gas inserted into the chamber, rendering our setup particularly promising for experiments with superfluid helium thin films, such as superfluid thin film optomechanics. Using silicon nanophotonic resonators, we demonstrate precise control and in-situ tuning of the thickness of a superfluid helium film on the sub-nanometer level. By making use of the exceptional tunability of the superfluid film thickness, we demonstrate optomechanically induced phonon lasing of phononic crystal cavity third sound modes in the superfluid film and show that the lasing threshold crucially depends on the film thickness. The large internal volume of our chamber (V_chamber = 1l) is adaptable for integration of various optical and electrical measurement and control techniques. Therefore, our setup provides a versatile platform for a variety of experiments in fundamental and applied superfluid helium research.</description>

      <title>Scalable Superconducting Nanowire Memory Array with Row-Column Addressing</title>

Abstract: Developing ultra-low-energy superconducting computing and fault-tolerant quantum computing will require scalable superconducting memory. While conventional superconducting logic-based memory cells have facilitated early demonstrations, their large footprint poses a significant barrier to scaling. Nanowire-based superconducting memory cells offer a compact alternative, but high error rates have hindered their integration into large arrays. In this work, we present a superconducting nanowire memory array designed for scalable row-column operation, achieving a functional density of 2.6$\,$Mb/cm$^{2}$. The array operates at $1.3\,$K, where we implement and characterize multi-flux quanta state storage and destructive readout. By optimizing write and read pulse sequences, we minimize bit errors while maximizing operational margins in a $4\times 4$ array. Circuit-level simulations further elucidate the memory cell's dynamics, providing insight into performance limits and stability under varying pulse amplitudes. We experimentally demonstrate stable memory operation with a minimum bit error rate of $10^{-5}$. These results suggest a promising path for scaling superconducting nanowire memories to high-density architectures, offering a foundation for energy-efficient memory in superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effects across Berry-Dipole Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional Hopf insulators are a class of topological phases beyond the tenfold-way classification. The critical point separating two rotation-invariant Hopf insulator phases with distinct Hopf invariants is quite different from the usual Dirac-type or Weyl-type critical points and uniquely characterized by a quantized Berry dipole. Close to such Berry-dipole transitions, we find that the extrinsic and intrinsic nonlinear Hall conductivity tensors in the weakly doped regime are characterized by two universal functions of the ratio between doping level and bulk energy gap, and are directly proportional to the change in Hopf invariant across the transition. Our work suggests that the nonlinear Hall effects display a general-sense quantized behavior across Berry-dipole transitions, establishing a correspondence between nonlinear Hall effects and Hopf invariant.</description>

Abstract: Temperature rise of qubits due to heating is a critical issue in large-scale quantum computers based on quantum-dot (QD) arrays. This leads to shorter coherence times, induced readout errors, and increased charge noise. Here, we propose a simple thermal circuit model to describe the heating effect on silicon QD array structures. Noting that the QD array is a periodic structure, we represent it as a thermal distributed-element circuit, forming a thermal transmission line. We validate this model by measuring the electron temperature in a QD array device using Coulomb blockade thermometry, finding that the model effectively reproduces experimental results. This simple and scalable model can be used to develop the thermal design of large-scale silicon-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Atomically clean free-standing two-dimensional materials through heating in ultra-high vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface contamination not only influences but in some cases even dominates the measured properties of two-dimensional materials. Although different cleaning methods are often used for contamination removal, commonly used spectroscopic cleanliness assessment methods can leave the level of achieved cleanliness ambiguous. Despite two decades of research on 2D materials, the true cleanliness of the used samples is often left open to interpretation. In this work, freestanding monolayer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride are annealed at different temperatures in a custom-built ultra-high vacuum heating chamber, connected to a scanning transmission electron microscope via a vacuum transfer line, enabling atomically resolved cleanliness characterization as a function of annealing temperature, while eliminating the introduction of airborne contamination during sample transport. While annealing at 200 {\deg}C already reduces contamination significantly, it is not until 400 {\deg}C or higher, where over 90% of the free-standing monolayer areas are atomically clean. At this point, further contamination removal is mainly limited by defects in the material and metal contamination introduced during the sample transfer or growth. The achieved large, atomically clean areas can then be used for further nanoscale engineering steps or device processing, facilitating interaction with the material rather than contamination.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Analysis of Cryogenically Cooled Photocathode in a CW SRF Injector cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper evaluates the thermal regime of a cryogenically cooled copper photocathode integrated into a continuous-wave superconducting radio-frequency injector cavity with direct thermal contact. Such a photoinjector layout is being developed at DESY and has recently demonstrated a record-high 50 MV/m axial electric field in radio-frequency tests, marking an important milestone. To address the thermal effect of the picosecond excitation laser, we first develop a two-temperature model to describe the temperature of the emitting surface at cryogenic temperatures and solve it numerically. Subsequently, we present a one-temperature model of the bulk photocathode coupled with an electromagnetic model of the injector cavity. For the current injector design, we predict a negligible impact of the laser on the intrinsic quality factor of the cavity, identifying instead the cryogenic stability of the copper cathode as the primary operational limit. To overcome cooling challenges, we propose an improved configuration of the cathode plug. For the proposed geometry, the multiphysics analysis confirms stable performance at a nominal 2 W laser power, sufficient for 100 pC beams at 1 MHz under optimistic quantum efficiency assumptions. Operation at higher laser loads will benefit from further dedicated cryogenic analysis.</description>
