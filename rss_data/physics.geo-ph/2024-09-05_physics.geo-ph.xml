      <title>Gaussian Processes enabled model calibration in the context of deep geological disposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a surrogate modeling approach for an emplacement drift of a deep geological repository based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). The surrogate model is used as a substitute for the high-fidelity mechanical model in many-query scenarios, such as time-dependent sensitivity analysis and calibration. Our GP-based approach emulates the behavior of an emplacement drift of a deep geological repository with significantly reduced computational time, enabling faster design iterations and effective incorporation as well as interpretation of monitoring data. Our findings show that only a few key parameters are essential for accurately reflecting in-situ conditions in complex rock salt models, which is critical for ensuring safety in deep geological disposal.</description>

      <title>A two-way coupled high resolution wave hindcast for the South China Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we performed a 53-year wave hindcast (1970-2022) for a significant portion of the South China Sea (SCS) with an unstructured mesh that reaches considerably high resolution along the coasts of the Guangdong province (China). The adopted modeling approach is based on the fully two-way coupled SCHISM-WWMIII numerical suite. The model was forced with ERA5 wind velocities that were compared to IFREMER altimeter wind velocities and then bias-corrected for a more accurate treatment of the wind component. Eight major tidal harmonics extracted from FES2014 were imposed to the open boundaries. After a preliminary mesh independence analysis, the model results have been validated against satellite altimeter observations retrieved from the European Space Agency database spanning the period from 1992 to 2019. Moreover, 28 year in-situ measurements from two coastal wave buoys and data from four tidal gauge stations (approximately 20 years) were used to test the nearshore skills of the model. Several statistical indicators have been used to evaluate the offshore and nearshore performance of the model results in terms of the main wave parameters (significant wave height, peak wave period, mean wave direction) and water levels. All statistical metrics suggest that the present hindcast improved the predictions of waves and water levels compared to previous datasets, especially in the coastal regions. The high spatial resolution together with a full coupling allowed the model to capture and simulate processes that are induced by the non-linear interactions between waves and currents, especially nearshore.</description>

      <title>Generation Model of a Spatially Limited Vortex in a Stratified Unstable Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new model for the generation of axisymmetric concentrated vortices. The solution of a nonlinear equation for internal gravity waves in an unstable stratified atmosphere is obtained and analyzed within the framework of ideal hydrodynamics. The corresponding expressions describing the dependences on the radius for the radial and vertical velocity components in the inner and outer regions of the vortex include combinations of Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. The proposed new nonlinear analytical model makes it possible to study the structure and nonlinear dynamics of vortices in the radial and vertical regions. The vortex is limited in height. The maximum vertical velocity component is reached at a certain height. Below this height, radial flows converge towards the axis, and above it, an outflow occurs. The resulting instability in the stratified atmosphere leads to an increase in the radial and vertical velocity components according to the hyperbolic sine law, which turns into exponential growth. The characteristic growth time is determined by the inverse growth rate of the instability. The formation of vortices with finite velocity components, which increase with time, is analyzed. The radial structure of the azimuthal velocity is determined by the structure of the initial perturbation and can change with height. The maximum rotation is reached at a certain height. The growth of the azimuth velocity occurs according to a super-exponential law.</description>

      <title>Two methods to analyse radial diffusion ensembles: the peril of space- and time- dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle dynamics in Earth's outer radiation belt can be modelled using a diffusion framework, where large-scale electron movements are captured by a diffusion equation across a single adiabatic invariant, $L^{*}$ $``(L)"$. While ensemble models are promoted to represent physical uncertainty, as yet there is no validated method to analyse radiation belt ensembles. Comparisons are complicated by the domain dependent diffusion, since diffusion coefficient $D_{LL}$ is dependent on $L$. We derive two tools to analyse ensemble members: time to monotonicity $t_m$ and mass/energy moment quantities $\mathcal{N}, \mathcal{E}$. We find that the Jacobian ($1/L^2$) is necessary for radiation belt error metrics. Components of $\partial\mathcal{E}/\partial t$ are explicitly calculated to compare the effects of outer and inner boundary conditions, and loss, on the ongoing diffusion. Using $t_m$, $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{E}$, we find that: (a) different physically motivated choices of outer boundary condition and location result in different final states and different rates of evolution; (b) the gradients of the particle distribution affect evolution more significantly than $D_{LL}$; (c) the enhancement location, and the amount of initial background particles, are both significant factors determining system evolution; (d) loss from pitch-angle scattering is generally dominant; it mitigates but does not remove the influence of both initial conditions and outer boundary settings, which are due to the $L$-dependence of $D_{LL}$. We anticipate this study will promote renewed focus on the distribution gradients, on the location and nature of the outer boundary in radiation belt modelling, and provide a foundation for systematic ensemble modelling.</description>
