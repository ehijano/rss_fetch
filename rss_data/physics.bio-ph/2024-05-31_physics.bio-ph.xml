      <title>Nanometer scale difference in myofilament lattice structure of muscle alter muscle function in a spatially explicit model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossbridge binding and force in active muscle is dependent on the radial spacing between the thick and the thin filaments. This radial lattice spacing has been shown through spatially explicit modeling and experimental efforts to greatly affect isometric, force production in muscle. It has recently been suggested that this radial spacing might also be able to drive differences in mechanical function, or net work, under dynamic oscillations like those which occur in muscles in vivo. However, previous spatially explicit models either had no radial spacing dependence, meaning the lattice spacing could not be investigated, or did include radial spacing dependence but could not reproduce in vivo net work during dynamic oscillations and only investigated isometric contractions. Here we show the first spatially explicit model to include radial crossbridge dependence which can produce mechanical function similar to real muscle. Using this spatially explicit model of a half sarcomere, we show that when oscillated at strain amplitudes and frequencies like those in the hawk moth Manduca sexta, net work does depend on the lattice spacing. In addition, we can prescribe a trajectory of lattice spacing changes in the spatially explicit half sarcomere model and investigate the extent to which the time course of lattice spacing changes can affect mechanical function. We simulated a half sarcomere undergoing dynamic oscillations and prescribed the Poisson's ratio of the lattice to be either 0 (constant lattice spacing) or 0.5 (isovolumetric lattice spacing changes). We also simulated net work using lattice spacing data taken from Manduca sexta which has a variable Poisson's ratio. Our simulation indicates that the lattice spacing can change the mechanical function of muscle, and that in some cases a 1 nm difference can switch the net work of the half sarcomere model from motor like to brake like.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic language of proteinoid gels: Boolean gates and QR codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an aim to build analog computers out of soft matter fluidic systems in future, this work attempts to invent a new information-theoretic language, in the form of two-dimensional Quick Response (QR) codes. This language is, effectively, a digital representation of the analog signals shown by the proteinoids. We use two different experimental techniques: (i) a voltage-sensitive dye and (ii) a pair of differential electrodes, to record the analog signals. The analog signals are digitally approximatied (synthesised) by sampling the analog signals into a series of discrete values, which are then converted into binary representations. We have shown the AND-OR-NOT-XOR-NOR-NAND-XNOR gate representation of the digitally sampled signal of proteinoids. Additional encoding schemes are applied to convert the binary code identified above to a two-dimensional QR code. As a result, the QR code becomes a digital, unique marker of a given proteinoid network. We show that it is possible to retrieve the analog signal from the QR code by scanning the QR code using a mobile phone. Our work shows that soft matter fluidic systems, such as proteinoids, can have a fundamental informatiom-theoretic language, unique to their internal information transmission properties (electrical activity in this case) - such a language can be made universal and accessible to everyone using 2D QR codes, which can digitally encode their internal properties and give an option to recover the original signal when required. On a more fundamental note, this study identifies the techniques of approximating continuum properties of soft matter fluidic systems using a series representation of gates and QR codes, which are a piece-wise digital representation, and thus one step closer to programming the fluids using information-theoretic methods, as suggested almost a decade ago by Tao's fluid program.</description>

      <title>Quantitative hydrodynamics for a generalized contact model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a quantitative version of the hydrodynamic limit for an interacting particle system inspired by integrate-and-fire neuron models. More precisely, we show that the $L^2$-speed of convergence of the empirical density of states in a generalized contact process defined over a $d$-dimensional torus of size $n$ is of the optimal order $\mathcal O(n^{d/2})$. In addition, we show that the typical fluctuations around the aforementioned hydrodynamic limit are Gaussian, and governed by a inhomogeneous stochastic linear equation.</description>

      <title>New sector morphologies emerge from anisotropic colony growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition during range expansions is of great interest from both practical and theoretical view points. Experimentally, range expansions are often studied in homogeneous Petri dishes, which lack spatial anisotropy that might be present in realistic populations. Here, we analyze a model of anisotropic growth, based on coupled Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equations that describe surface growth and lateral competition. Compared to a previous study of isotropic growth, anisotropy relaxes a constraint between parameters of the model. We completely characterize spatial patterns and invasion velocities in this generalized model. In particular, we find that strong anisotropy results in a distinct morphology of spatial invasion with a kink in the displaced strain ahead of the boundary between the strains. This morphology of the out-competed strain is similar to a shock wave and serves as a signature of anisotropic growth.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Optical Anisotropy of the Morpho Butterfly Wing for Quantitative, Stain-Free, and Contact-Free Assessment of Biological Tissue Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Changes in the density and organization of fibrous biological tissues often accompany the progression of serious diseases ranging from fibrosis to neurodegenerative diseases, heart disease and cancer. However, challenges in cost, complexity, or precision faced by existing imaging methodologies pose barriers to elucidating the role of tissue microstructure in disease. Here, we leverage the intrinsic optical anisotropy of the Morpho butterfly wing and introduce Morpho-Enhanced Polarized Light Microscopy (MorE-PoL), a stain- and contact-free imaging platform which enhances and quantifies the birefringent material properties of fibrous biological tissues. We develop a mathematical model, based on Jones calculus, which quantifies fibrous tissue density and organization. As a representative example, we analyze collagen-dense and collagen-sparse human breast cancer tissue sections and leverage our technique to assess the microstructural properties of distinct regions of interest. We compare our results with conventional Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) staining procedures and second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy for fibrillar collagen detection. Our findings demonstrate that our MorE-PoL technique provides a robust, quantitative, and accessible route toward analyzing biological tissue microstructures, with great potential for application to a broad range of biological materials.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of cooperative antimicrobial resistance in a population of fluctuating volume and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance to drugs (AMR), a global threat to human and animal health, is often regarded as resulting from a cooperative behaviour. Moreover, microbes generally evolve in volatile environments that, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and death events), drastically alter population size and strain survival. Motivated by the need to better understand the evolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two competing strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to demographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary carrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental conditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and antimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community (number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared public good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed concentration cooperation threshold, above which the sensitive strain has a growth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using computational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable quenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the influence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably obtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a function of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold. We find that microbial strains tend to coexistence, but demographic fluctuations eventually lead to the extinction of resistant or sensitive cells for small or large values of the concentration cooperation threshold, respectively. This also holds for dynamic environments, whose specific properties determine the extinction timescale.</description>

      <title>Dual network structure of the AV node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological systems, particularly the brain, are frequently analyzed as networks, conveying mechanistic insights into their function and pathophysiology. This is the first study of a functional network of cardiac tissue. We use calcium imaging to obtain two functional networks in a subsidiary but essential pacemaker of the heart, the atrioventricular node (AVN). The AVN is a small cellular structure with dual functions: a) to delay the pacemaker signal passing from the sinoatrial node (SAN) to the ventricles, and b) to serve as a back-up pacemaker should the primary SAN pacemaker fail. Failure of the AVN can lead to syncope and death. We found that the shortest path lengths and clustering coefficients of the AVN are remarkably similar to those of the brain. The network is ``small-world," thus optimized for energy use vs transmission efficiency. We further study the network properties of AVN tissue with knock-out of the sodium-calcium exchange transporter. In this case, the average shortest path-lengths remained nearly unchanged showing network resilience, while the clustering coefficient was somewhat reduced, similar to schizophrenia in brain networks. When we removed the global action potential using principal component analysis (PCA) in wild-type model, the network lost its ``small-world" characteristics with less information-passing efficiency due to longer shortest path lengths but more robust signal propagation resulting from higher clustering. These two wild-type networks (with and without global action potential) may correspond to fast and slow conduction pathways. Laslty, a one-parameter non-linear preferential attachment model is a good fit to all three AVN networks.</description>
