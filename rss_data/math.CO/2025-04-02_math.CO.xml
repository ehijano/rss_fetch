      <title>Finite sums associated with some polynomial identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a general framework for the derivation of interesting finite combinatorial sums starting with certain classes of polynomial identities. The sums that can be derived involve products of binomial coefficients and also harmonic numbers and squared harmonic numbers. We apply the framework to discuss combinatorial sums associated with some prominent polynomial identities from the recent past.</description>

      <title>On cores of distance-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at the question of which distance-regular graphs are core-complete, meaning they are isomorphic to their own core or have a complete core. We build on Roberson's homomorphism matrix approach by which method he proved the Cameron-Kazanidis conjecture that strongly regular graphs are core-complete. We develop the theory of the homomorphism matrix for distance-regular graphs of diameter $d$.
  We derive necessary conditions on the cosines of a distance-regular graph for it to admit an endomorphism into a subgraph of smaller diameter $e&lt;d$. As a consequence of these conditions, we show that if $X$ is a primitive distance-regular graph where the subgraph induced by the set of vertices furthest away from a vertex $v$ is connected, any retraction of $X$ onto a diameter-$d$ subgraph must be an automorphism, which recovers Roberson's result for strongly regular graphs as a special case for diameter $2$.
  We illustrate the application of our necessary conditions through computational results. We find that no antipodal, non-bipartite distance-regular graphs of diameter 3, with degree at most $50$ admits an endomorphism to a diameter 2 subgraph. We also give many examples of intersection arrays of primitive distance-regular graphs of diameter $3$ which are core-complete. Our methods include standard tools from the theory of association schemes, particularly the spectral idempotents.

      <title>Intersections of graphs and $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $k$ graphs $G_{1}, \ldots, G_{k}$, their intersection is the graph $(\cap_{i\in [k]}V(G_{i}), \cap_{i\in [k]}E(G_{i}))$. Given $k$ graph classes $\mathcal{G}_{1}, \ldots , \mathcal{G}_{k}$, we call the class $\{G: \forall i \in[k], \exists G_{i} \in \mathcal{G}_{i} \text{ such that } G=G_{1}\cap \ldots \cap G_{k}\}$ the graph-intersection of $\mathcal{G}_{1}, \ldots , \mathcal{G}_{k}$. The main motivation for the work presented in this paper is to try to understand under which conditions graph-intersection preserves $\chi$-boundedness. We consider the following two questions:
  Which graph classes have the property that their graph-intersection with every $\chi$-bounded class of graphs is $\chi$-bounded? We call such a class intersectionwise $\chi$-guarding. We prove that classes of graphs which admit a certain kind of decomposition are intersectionwise $\chi$-guarding. We provide necessary conditions that a finite set of graphs $\mathcal{H}$ should satisfy if the class of $\mathcal{H}$-free graphs is intersectionwise $\chi$-guarding, and we characterize the intersectionwise $\chi$-guarding classes which are defined by a single forbidden induced subgraph.
  Which graph classes have the property that, for every positive integer $k$, their $k$-fold graph-intersection is $\chi$-bounded? We call such a class intersectionwise self-$\chi$-guarding. We study intersectionwise self-$\chi$-guarding classes which are defined by a single forbidden induced subgraph, and we prove a result which allows us construct intersectionwise self-$\chi$-guarding classes from known intersectionwise $\chi$-guarding classes.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing graphs with subgraph compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the problem of reconstructing strings from their substring compositions first introduced by Acharya et al. in 2015 motivated by polymer-based advanced data storage systems utilizing mass spectrometry. Namely, we see strings as labeled path graphs, and as such try to reconstruct labeled graphs. For a given integer t, the subgraph compositions contain either vectors of labels for each connected subgraph of order t (t-multiset-compositions) or the sum of all labels of all connected subgraphs of order t (t-sum-composition). We ask whether, given a graph of which we know the structure and an oracle whom you can query for compositions, we can reconstruct the labeling of the graph. If it is possible, then the graph is reconstructable; otherwise, it is confusable, and two labeled graphs with the same compositions are called equicomposable. We prove that reconstructing through a brute-force algorithm is wildly inefficient, before giving methods for reconstructing several graph classes using as few compositions as possible. We also give negative results, finding the smallest confusable graphs and trees, as well as families with a large number of equicomposable non-isomorphic graphs. An interesting result occurs when twinning one leaf of a path: some paths are confusable, creating a twin out of a leaf sees the graph alternating between reconstructable and confusable depending on the parity of the path, and creating a false twin out of a leaf makes the graph reconstructable using only sum-compositions in all cases.</description>

      <title>Strong Geometry : Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of strong geometry, a structure composed by both the chirotope of the oriented matroid associated to a set of points X in the d-dimensional space and a new chirotope induced by the hyperplanes spanned by X. With this on hand, we answer positively a strong geometry version of a question due to M. Las Vergnas about reconstructing polygonal knots via oriented matroids.</description>

      <title>Full classification of anti-van der Waerden numbers of graph products of forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anti-van der Waerden number of a graph $G$ is the fewest number of colors needed to guarantee a rainbow $3$-term arithmetic progression in $G$, denoted $\operatorname{aw}(G,3)$. It is known that the anti-van der Waerden number of graph products is $3 \le \operatorname{aw}(G\square H,3)\le 4$. Previous work has been done on classifying families of graph products into $\operatorname{aw}(G\square H,3) = 3$ and $\operatorname{aw}(G\square H,3) = 4$. Some of these families include the product of two paths, the product of paths and cycles, the product of two cycles, and the product of odd cycles with any graph. Recently, a partial characterization of the product of two trees was established. This paper completes the characterization for $\operatorname{aw}(T\square T',3)$ where $T$ and $T'$ are trees. Moreover, this result extends to a full classification of products of forests.</description>

      <title>The connectedness of friends-and-strangers graphs about graph parameters and others</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ and $Y$ be two graphs of order $n$. The friends-and-strangers graph $\textup{FS}(X,Y)$ of $X$ and $Y$ is a graph whose vertex set consists of all bijections $\sigma: V(X)\rightarrow V(Y)$, in which two bijections $\sigma$ and $ \sigma'$ are adjacent if and only if they agree on all but two adjacent vertices of $X$ such that the corresponding images are adjacent in $Y$. The most fundamental question about these friends-and-strangers graphs is whether they are connected. In this paper, we provide a sufficient condition regarding the maximum degree $\Delta(X)$ and vertex connectivity $\kappa(Y)$ that ensures the graph $\textup{FS}(X,Y)$ is $s$-connected. As a corollary, we improve upon a result by Bangachev and partially confirm a conjecture he proposed. Furthermore, we completely characterize the connectedness of $\textup{FS}(X,Y)$, where $X\in\textup{DL}_{n-k,k}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of perfect state transfer (PST) on quantum spin networks is a fundamental problem in mathematics and physics. Various works in the literature have explored PST in graphs with arithmetic origins, such as gcd-graphs over $\mathbb{Z}$ and cubelike graphs. In this article, building on our recent work on gcd-graphs over an arbitrary finite Frobenius ring, we investigate the existence of PST on these graphs. Our approach is algebraic in nature, enabling us to unify various existing results in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the star b-chromatic number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A star coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper coloring where vertices of every two color classes induce a forest of stars. A strict partial order is defined on the set of all star colorings of $G$. We introduce the star b-chromatic number $S_b(G)$, analogous to the b-chromatic number, as the maximum number of colors in a minimum element of the mentioned order. We present several combinatorial properties of $S_b(G)$, compute the exact value for $S_b(G)$ for several known families and compare $S_b(G)$ with several invariants naturally connected to $S_b(G)$.</description>

      <title>On finite groups whose power graphs satisfy certain connectivity conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a graph $\Gamma$. A set $ S $ of vertices in $\Gamma$ is called a {cyclic vertex cutset} of $\Gamma$ if $\Gamma - S$ is disconnected and has at least two components containing cycles. If $\Gamma$ has a cyclic vertex cutset, then it is said to be {cyclically separable}. The {cyclic vertex connectivity} is the minimum cardinality of a cyclic vertex cutset of $\Gamma$. The power graph $\mathcal{P}(G)$ of a group $G$ is the undirected simple graph with vertex set $G$ and two distinct vertices are adjacent if one of them is a positive power of the other. If $G$ is a cyclic, dihedral, or dicyclic group, we determine the order of $G$ such that $\mathcal{P}(G)$ is cyclically separable. Then we characterize the equality of vertex connectivity and cyclic vertex connectivity of $\mathcal{P}(G)$ in terms of the order of $G$.</description>

      <title>Coconvex characters on collections of phylogenetic trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In phylogenetics, a key problem is to construct evolutionary trees from collections of characters where, for a set X of species, a character is simply a function from X onto a set of states. In this context, a key concept is convexity, where a character is convex on a tree with leaf set X if the collection of subtrees spanned by the leaves of the tree that have the same state are pairwise disjoint. Although collections of convex characters on a single tree have been extensively studied over the past few decades, very little is known about coconvex characters, that is, characters that are simultaneously convex on a collection of trees. As a starting point to better understand coconvexity, in this paper we prove a number of extremal results for the following question: What is the minimal number of coconvex characters on a collection of n-leaved trees taken over all collections of size t &gt;= 2, also if we restrict to coconvex characters which map to k states? As an application of coconvexity, we introduce a new one-parameter family of tree metrics, which range between the coarse Robinson-Foulds distance and the much finer quartet distance. We show that bounds on the quantities in the above question translate into bounds for the diameter of the tree space for the new distances. Our results open up several new interesting directions and questions which have potential applications to, for example, tree spaces and phylogenomics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of the higher-rank graphs associated to finite-dimensional complex semisimple Lie algebras, introduced by the author and R. Yuncken, whose construction relies on Kashiwara's theory of crystals. First we prove that the Bruhat graphs of the corresponding Weyl groups, both weak and strong, can be embedded into the higher-rank graphs as colored graphs. Next, specializing to Lie algebras of type $A$, we connect some aspects of the construction of the higher-rank graphs with some well-known notions in combinatorics, most notably the keys of Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.</description>

      <title>A Graph Minors Approach to Temporal Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a structural approach to simultaneous embeddability in temporal sequences of graphs, inspired by graph minor theory. Our main result is a classification theorem for 2-connected temporal sequences: we identify five obstruction classes and show that every 2-connected temporal sequence is either simultaneously embeddable or admits a sequence of improvements leading to an obstruction. This structural insight leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the simultaneous embeddability of 2-connected temporal sequences.
  The restriction to 2-connected sequences is necessary, as the problem is NP-hard for connected graphs, while trivial for 3-connected graphs. As a consequence, our framework also resolves the rooted-tree SEFE problem, a natural extension of the well-studied sunflower SEFE. More broadly, our results demonstrate the applicability of graph minor techniques to evolving graph structures and provide a foundation for future algorithmic and structural investigations in temporal graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on the intimate connection between the largest volume of an empty axis-parallel box in a set of $n$ points from $[0,1]^d$ and cover-free families from the extremal set theory. This connection was discovered in a recent paper of the authors. In this work, we apply a very recent result of Michel and Scott to obtain a whole range of new lower bounds on the number of points needed so that the largest volume of such a box is bounded by a given $\varepsilon$. Surprisingly, it turns out that for each of the new bounds, there is a choice of the parameters $d$ and $\varepsilon$ such that the bound outperforms the others.</description>

      <title>A Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 4-connected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a unique decomposition of every 4-connected graph into parts that are either quasi-5-connected, cycles of triangle-torsos and 3-connected torsos on $\leq 5$ vertices, generalised double-wheels, or thickened $K_{4,m}$'s. The decomposition can be described in terms of a tree-decomposition but with edges allowed in the adhesion-sets. Our construction is explicit, canonical, and exhibits a defining property of the Tutte-decomposition.
  As a corollary, we obtain a new Tutte-type canonical decomposition of 3-connected graphs into parts that are either quasi-4-connected, generalised wheels or thickened $K_{3,m}$'s. This decomposition is similar yet different from the tri-separation decomposition.
  As an application of the decomposition for 4-connectivity, we obtain a new theorem characterising all 4-connected vertex-transitive finite graphs as quasi-5-connected, the $K_4$-expansion of a quasi-5-connected graph, or on a short explicit list of graphs.</description>

      <title>The Ising model on cubic maps: arbitrary genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a recursive algorithm to compute the partition function of the Ising model, summed over cubic maps with fixed size and genus. The algorithm runs in polynomial time, which is much faster than methods based on a Tutte-like, or topological, recursion.
  We construct this algorithm out of a partial differential equation that we derive from the first equation of the KP hierarchy satisfied by the generating function of bipartite maps. This series is indeed related to the Ising partition function by a change of variables. We also obtain inequalities on the coefficients of this partition function, which should be useful for a probabilistic study of cubic Ising maps whose genus grows linearly with their size.</description>

      <title>A spanning tree model for chromatic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the discovery of Khovanov homology, which categorifies the Jones polynomial, an analogous categorification of the chromatic polynomial, known as chromatic homology, was introduced. Its graded Euler characteristic recovers the chromatic polynomial. In this paper, we present a spanning tree model for the chromatic complex, i.e., we describe a chain complex generated by certain spanning trees of the graph that is chain homotopy equivalent to the chromatic complex. We employ the spanning tree model over $\mathcal{A}_m:= \frac{\mathbb{Z}[x]}{&lt;x^m&gt;}$ algebra to answer two open questions. First, we establish the conjecture posed by Sazdanovic and Scofield regarding the homological span of chromatic homology over $\\mathcal{A}_m$ algebra, demonstrating that for any graph $G$ with $v$ vertices and $b$ blocks, the homological span is $v - b$. Additionally, we prove a conjecture of Helme-Guizon, Przytycki, and Rong concerning the existence of torsion of order dividing $m$ in chromatic homology over $\mathcal{A}_m$ algebra.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the class $\mathcal{C}^d$ of sphere intersection graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d \geq 2$. We show that for each integer $t$, the class of all graphs in $\mathcal{C}^d$ that exclude $K_{t,t}$ as a subgraph has strongly sublinear separators. We also prove that $\mathcal{C}^d$ has asymptotic dimension at most $2d+2$.</description>

      <title>Edge-disjoint linkage in infinite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1980, Thomassen stated his Weak Linkage conjecture: for odd positive integers $k$, if a graph $G$ is $k$-edge-connected, then, for any collection of $k$ pairs of vertices $\{s_1,t_1\}$, ..., $\{s_k,t_k\}$ in $G$, not necessarily distinct, there are pairwise edge-disjoint paths $P_1,...,P_k$ in $G$, with $P_i$ joining $s_i$ and $t_i$. In 1991, Huck proved that the conclusion holds if $G$ is finite and $(k+1)$-edge-connected. We prove that Huck's theorem holds also for all infinite graphs, extending and improving a result of Ok, Richter and Thomassen for 1-ended, locally finite graphs.
  A novel key tool in the proof is the Linking Fan Proposition proved in Section 3. To show the potential and usefulness of this proposition in other contexts, we present in the last section a new result, similar to a result of Thomassen, on the existence of $2k$-edge-connected finite immersions in $(2k+2)$-edge-connected infinite graphs, and as a corollary we also reprove a statement on $k$-arc-connected orientations.</description>

      <title>Random cliques in random graphs revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of the set of copies of some given graph $H$ in the random graph $G(n,p)$, focusing on the case when $H = K_r$. Our main results capture the 'leading term' in the difference between this distribution and the 'independent hypergraph model', where (in the case $H = K_r$) each copy is present independently with probability $\pi = p^{\binom{r}{2}}$. As a concrete application, we derive a new upper bound on the number of $K_r$-factors in $G(n,p)$ above the threshold for such factors to appear.
  We will prove our main results in a much more general setting, so that they also apply to random hypergraphs, and also (for example) to the case when $p$ is constant and $r = r(n) \sim 2\log_{1/p}(n)$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce ninfty, a header-only C++ library distributed under an MIT Open Source License designed for the study of enumeration problems arising in homotopical combinatorics. The ninfty repository moreover contains a folder with data files for many common finite groups. This is in addition to Sage code which can be used to generate input data for further finite groups, and Sage code for generating input data for abstract lattices which may not arise at the subgroup lattice of a group.</description>

      <title>Lower bounding the MaxCut of high girth 3-regular graphs using the QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study MaxCut on 3-regular graphs of minimum girth $g$ for various $g$'s. We obtain new lower bounds on the maximum cut achievable in such graphs by analyzing the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). For $g \geq 16$, at depth $p \geq 7$, the QAOA improves on previously known lower bounds. Our bounds are established through classical numerical analysis of the QAOA's expected performance. This analysis does not produce the actual cuts but establishes their existence. When implemented on a quantum computer, the QAOA provides an efficient algorithm for finding such cuts, using a constant-depth quantum circuit. To our knowledge, this gives an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithm guaranteed to achieve cuts of this size on graphs of this girth. We also apply the QAOA to the Maximum Independent Set problem on the same class of graphs.</description>

      <title>Preparing graph states forbidding a vertex-minor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement based quantum computing is preformed by adding non-Clifford measurements to a prepared stabilizer states. Entangling gates like CZ are likely to have lower fidelities due to the nature of interacting qubits, so when preparing a stabilizer state, we wish to minimize the number of required entangling states. This naturally introduces the notion of CZ-distance.
  Every stabilizer state is local-Clifford equivalent to a graph state, so we may focus on graph states $\left\vert G \right\rangle$. As a lower bound for general graphs, there exist $n$-vertex graphs $G$ such that the CZ-distance of $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ is $\Omega(n^2 / \log n)$. We obtain significantly improved bounds when $G$ is contained within certain proper classes of graphs. For instance, we prove that if $G$ is a $n$-vertex circle graph with clique number $\omega$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $4n \log \omega + 7n$. We prove that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph of rank-width at most $k$, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $(2^{2^{k+1}} + 1) n$. More generally, this is obtained via a bound of $(k+2)n$ that we prove for graphs of twin-width at most $k$.
  We also study how bounded-rank perturbations and low-rank cuts affect the CZ-distance. As a consequence, we prove that Geelen's Weak Structural Conjecture for vertex-minors implies that if $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph contained in some fixed proper vertex-minor-closed class of graphs, then $\left\vert G \right\rangle$ has CZ-distance at most $O(n\log n)$. Since graph states of locally equivalent graphs are local Clifford equivalent, proper vertex-minor-closed classes of graphs are natural and very general in this setting.</description>

      <title>Wall-crossing phenomenon for the liquid bin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the liquid bin model as a continuous-time deterministic dynamics, arising as the hydrodynamic limit of a discrete-time stochastic interacting particle system called the infinite bin model. For the liquid bin model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a stationary evolution, to which the dynamics converges exponentially fast. The speed of the front of the system is explicitly computed as a continuous piecewise rational function of the parameters of the model, revealing an underlying wall-crossing phenomenon. We show that the regions on which the speed is rational are of non-empty interior and are naturally indexed by Dyck paths. We provide a complete description of the adjacency structure of these regions, which generalizes the Stanley lattice for Dyck paths. Finally we point out an intriguing connection to the topic of extensions of partial cyclic orders to total cyclic orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a form of square-root cancellation for the operator which sums a mean-zero function over a hyperplane in $R^d$ for $R$ a possibly noncommutative finite ring. Using an argument of Hart, Iosevich, Koh, and Rudnev, we show that this square-root cancellation occurs when $R$ is a finite field. We then show that this square-root cancellation does not occur over finite rings which are not finite fields. This extends an earlier result of the author to an operator which is not translation-invariant.</description>

Abstract: A toric amplitude is a rational function associated to a simplicial polyhedral fan. The definition is inspired by scattering amplitudes in particle physics. We prove algebraic properties of such amplitudes and study the geometry of their zero loci. These hypersurfaces play the role of Warren's adjoint via a dual volume interpretation. We investigate their Fano schemes and singular loci via the nef cone and toric irrelevant ideal of the fan.</description>

Abstract: We prove that, as $m$ grows, any family of $m$ homotopically distinct closed curves on a surface induces a number of crossings that grows at least like $(m \log m)^2$. We use this to answer two questions of Pach, Tardos and Toth related to crossing numbers of drawings of multigraphs where edges are required to be non-homotopic. Furthermore, we generalize these results, obtaining effective bounds with optimal growth rates on every orientable surface.</description>

      <title>Causal Models for Growing Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks grow over time; statistical models based on node exchangeability are not appropriate. Instead of constraining the structure of the \textit{distribution} of edges, we propose that the relevant symmetries refer to the \textit{causal structure} between them. We first enumerate the 96 causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) models over pairs of nodes (dyad variables) in a growing network with finite ancestral sets that are invariant to node deletion. We then partition them into 21 classes with ancestral sets that are closed under node marginalization. Several of these classes are remarkably amenable to distributed and asynchronous evaluation. As an example, we highlight a simple model that exhibits flexible power-law degree distributions and emergent phase transitions in sparsity, which we characterize analytically. With few parameters and much conditional independence, our proposed framework provides natural baseline models for causal inference in relational data.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to satisfy the Vizing bound if $\chi(G)\leq \omega(G)+1$, where $\chi(G)$ and $\omega(G)$ denote the chromatic number and clique number of $G$, respectively. It was conjectured by Randerath in 1998 that if $G$ is a triangle-free and fork-free graph, where the fork (also known as trident) is obtained from $K_{1,4}$ by subdividing two edges, then $G$ satisfies the Vizing bound. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Complete Number of Some Variants of Caterpillar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is said to be Hamiltonian if it contains a spanning cycle. In this work, we investigate the Hamiltonian completeness of certain classes of caterpillar graphs, which are trees with a central path to which all other vertices are adjacent. For a non-Hamiltonian graph $G$, the Hamiltonian complete number $\lambda_H(G)$ is the minimum number of edges that must be added to $G$ to make it Hamiltonian. We focus on both regular and irregular caterpillar graphs, deriving explicit formulas for $\lambda_H(G)$ in various cases. Specifically, we show that for a regular caterpillar graph $G_{n(k)}$ where each vertex on the central path is adjacent to $k$ leaves, $\lambda_H(G_{n(k)}) = n(k-1)$. We also explore irregular caterpillar graphs, where the number of leaves adjacent to each vertex on the central path varies, and provide bounds for $\lambda_H(G)$ in these cases. Our results contribute to the understanding of Hamiltonian properties in tree-like structures and have potential applications in network design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Connectedness in weighted consensus division of graphical cakes between two agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Austin's moving knife procedure was originally introduced to find a consensus division of a cake between two agents: each agent believes that they receive exactly half of the cake. Here, we adapt it to the case when the two agents have arbitrary entitlements of the cake and seek a weighted consensus division -- one where each agent believes that they received exactly the share that they are entitled to -- which also minimizes the number of connected components that each agent receives. First, we find a weighted consensus division of a circular cake, which gives exactly one connected piece to each agent: this gives an explicit protocol for the Stromquist-Woodall theorem for two agents. Next, by judiciously mapping a circle to a graph, we produce a weighted consensus division of a star graph cake that gives at most two connected pieces to each agent -- and show that this bound on the number of connected pieces is tight. For trees, each agent receives at most h+1 connected pieces, where h is the height of the tree, and for general (connected) graphical cakes each agent receives r+2 connected pieces, where r is the radius of the graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using generating functions, we are proposing a unified approach to produce explicit formulas, which count the number of nodes in Smolyak grids based on various univariate quadrature or interpolation rules. Our approach yields, for instance, a new formula for the cardinality of a Smolyak grid, which is based on Chebyshev nodes of the first kind and it allows to recover certain counting-formulas previously found by Bungartz-Griebel, Kaarnioja, M\"uller-Gronbach, Novak-Ritter and Ullrich.</description>

Abstract: A De Bruijn cycle is a cyclic sequence in which every word of length $n$ over an alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ appears exactly once. De Bruijn tori are a two-dimensional analogue. Motivated by recent progress on universal partial cycles and words, which shorten De Bruijn cycles using a wildcard character, we introduce universal partial tori and matrices. We find them computationally and construct infinitely many of them using one-dimensional variants of universal cycles, including a new variant called a universal partial family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the product formula of the Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind $U_n(x)$, we newly introduce the partial Chebyshev polynomials $U^{\mathrm{e}}_n(x)$ and $U^{\mathrm{o}}_n(x)$ and derive their basic properties, relations to the classical Chebyshev polynomials, and new factorization formulas for $U_n(x)$. In order to calculate the quadratic embedding constant (QEC) of a fan graph $K_1+P_n$, we derive a new polynomial $\phi_n(x)$ which is factorized by partial Chebyshev polynomial $U^{\mathrm{e}}_n(x)$. We prove that $\mathrm{QEC}(K_1+P_n)$ is given in terms of the minimal zero of $\phi_n(x)$, and obtain the explicit value of $\mathrm{QEC}(K_1+P_n)$ for an even $n$ and its reasonable exstimate for an odd $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Imolay, Karl, Nazy and V\'{a}li explored a generalization of Tur\'{a}n's forbidden subgraph problem and Ruzsa-Szrmer\'{e}di $(6,3)$-problem. They specifically studied the following question: for two graphs $F$ and $G$, determine the maximum number of edge-disjoint copies of $F$ in a set of $n$ vertices such that there is no copy of $G$ whose edges come from different $F$-copies. The maximum number is denoted by $ex_F(n,G)$ and is called the {\em $F$-multicolor Tur\'{a}n number} of $G$. One of their main results is that $ex_F(n,G)=o(n^2)$ if and only if there exists a homomorphism from $G$ to $F$. We generalize the result to uniformly hypergraph using main tools of Hypergraph Regularity Lemma and Counting Lemma.</description>

      <title>Every Graph is Essential to Large Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for every graph $H$, there is a hereditary weakly sparse graph class $\mathcal C_H$ of unbounded treewidth such that the $H$-free (i.e., excluding $H$ as an induced subgraph) graphs of $\mathcal C_H$ have bounded treewidth. This refutes several conjectures and critically thwarts the quest for the unavoidable induced subgraphs in classes of unbounded treewidth, a wished-for counterpart of the Grid Minor theorem. We actually show a stronger result: For every positive integer $t$, there is a hereditary graph class $\mathcal C_t$ of unbounded treewidth such that for any graph $H$ of treewidth at most $t$, the $H$-free graphs of $\mathcal C_t$ have bounded treewidth. Our construction is a variant of so-called layered wheels. We also introduce a framework of abstract layered wheels, based on their most salient properties. In particular, we streamline and extend key lemmas previously shown on individual layered wheels. We believe that this should greatly help develop this topic, which appears to be a very strong yet underexploited source of counterexamples.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a nontrivial graph with minimum degree $\delta$ and $k$ an integer with $k\ge 2$. In the literature, there are eigenvalue conditions that imply $G$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees. We give eigenvalue conditions that imply $G$ contains $k$ edge-disjoint spanning trees and another forest $F$ with $|E(F)|&gt;\frac{\delta-1}{\delta}(|V(G)|-1)$, and if $F$ is not a spanning tree, then $F$ has a component with at least $\delta$ edges.</description>

      <title>Graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to path-length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two graph parameters are said to be coarsely equivalent if they are within constant factors from each other for every graph $G$. Recently, several graph parameters were shown to be coarsely equivalent to tree-length. Recall that the length of a tree-decomposition ${\cal T}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal T}(G)$, and the tree-length $tl(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all tree-decompositions of $G$. Similarly, the length of a path-decomposition ${\cal P}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal P}(G)$, and the path-length $pl(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all path-decompositions of $G$. In this paper, we present several graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to path-length. Among other results, we show that the path-length of a graph $G$ is small if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions is true: (a) $G$ can be embedded to an unweighted caterpillar tree (equivalently, to a graph of path-width one) with a small additive distortion; (b) there is a constant $r\ge 0$ such that for every triple of vertices $u,v,w$ of $G$, disk of radius $r$ centered at one of them intercepts all paths connecting two others; (c) $G$ has a $k$-dominating shortest path with small $k\ge 0$; (d) $G$ has a $k'$-dominating pair with small $k'\ge 0$; (e) some power $G^\mu$ of $G$ is an AT-free (or even a cocomparability) graph for a small integer $\mu\ge 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1930, Ramsey proved that every large graph contains either a large clique or a large edgeless graph as an induced subgraph. It is well known that every large connected graph contains a long path, a large clique, or a large star as an induced subgraph. Recently Allred, Ding, and Oporowski presented the unavoidable large induced subgraphs for large $2$-connected graphs and for infinite $2$-connected graphs. In this paper we establish the $2$-edge-connected analogues of these results. As consequences we obtain results on unavoidable large subgraphs, topological minors, minors, induced topological minors, induced minors, and Eulerian subgraphs in large and infinite $2$-edge-connected graphs. When appropriate we extend our results to multigraphs.</description>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is called $k$-factor-critical if $G-S$ has a perfect matching for every $S\subseteq G$ with $|S|=k$. A connected graph $G$ is called $t$-connected if it has more than $t$ vertices and remains connected whenever fewer than $t$ vertices are removed. We give a condition on the number of edges and a condition on the spectral radius for $k$-factor-criticality in $t$-connected graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained exposition of the recent remarkable result of Kelley and Meka: if $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$ has no non-trivial three-term arithmetic progressions then $\lvert A\rvert \leq \exp(-c(\log N)^{1/11})N$ for some constant $c&gt;0$.
  Although our proof is identical to that of Kelley and Meka in all of the main ideas, we also incorporate some minor simplifications relating to Bohr sets. This eases some of the technical difficulties tackled by Kelley and Meka and widens the scope of their method. As a consequence, we improve the lower bounds for finding long arithmetic progressions in $A+A+A$, where $A\subseteq \{1,\ldots,N\}$.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle are solvable in polynomial time in graphs of bounded independence number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian path (a Hamiltonian cycle) in a graph is a path (a cycle, respectively) that traverses all of its vertices. The problems of deciding their existence in an input graph are well-known to be NP-complete, in fact, they belong to the first problems shown to be computationally hard when the theory of NP-completeness was being developed. A lot of research has been devoted to the complexity of Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle problems for special graph classes, yet only a handful of positive results are known. The complexities of both of these problems have been open even for $4K_1$-free graphs, i.e., graphs of independence number at most $3$. We answer this question in the general setting of graphs of bounded independence number.
  We also consider a newly introduced problem called \emph{Hamiltonian-$\ell$-Linkage} which is related to the notions of a path cover and of a linkage in a graph. This problem asks if given $\ell$ pairs of vertices in an input graph can be connected by disjoint paths that altogether traverse all vertices of the graph. For $\ell=1$, Hamiltonian-1-Linkage asks for existence of a Hamiltonian path connecting a given pair of vertices. Our main result reads that for every pair of integers $k$ and $\ell$, the Hamiltonian-$\ell$-Linkage problem is polynomial time solvable for graphs of independence number not exceeding $k$.</description>

      <title>From affine to barycentric coordinates in polytopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Each point of a simplex is expressed as a unique convex combination of the vertices. The coefficients in the combination are the barycentric coordinates of the point. For each point in a general convex polytope, there may be multiple representations, so its barycentric coordinates are not necessarily unique. There are various schemes to fix particular barycentric coordinates: Gibbs, Wachspress, cartographic, etc. In this paper, a method for producing sparse barycentric coordinates in polytopes will be discussed. It uses a purely algebraic treatment of affine spaces and convex sets, with barycentric algebras. The method is based on a certain decomposition of each finite-dimensional convex polytope into a union of simplices of the same dimension.</description>

Abstract: As a higher analogue of the edge ideal of a graph, we study the $t$-connected ideal $\operatorname{J}_{t}$. This is the monomial ideal generated by the connected subsets of size $t$. For chordal graphs, we show that $\operatorname{J}_{t}$ has a linear resolution iff the tree is $t$-gap-free, and that this is equivalent to having linear quotients. We then show that if $G$ is any gap-free and $t$-claw-free graph, then $\operatorname{J}_{t}(G)$ has linear quotients and, hence, linear resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a bijection between marginal independence models on $n$ random variables and split closed order ideals in the poset of partial set partitions. We also establish that every discrete marginal independence model is toric in cdf coordinates. This generalizes results of Boege, Petrovic, and Sturmfels and Drton and Richardson, and provides a unified framework for discussing marginal independence models. Additionally, we provide an axiomatic characterization of marginal independence and we show that our set of axioms are sound and complete in the set of probability distributions. This follows the work of Geiger, Paz and Pearl who provided an analogous characterization of independence for statements involving 2 sets of random variables.</description>

      <title>Braid groups of J-reflection groups and associated classical and dual Garside structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The family of $J$-reflection groups can be seen as a combinatorial generalisation of irreducible rank two complex reflection groups and was introduced by the author in a previous article. In this article, we define the braid groups associated to $J$-reflection groups, which coincide with the complex braid group when the $J$-reflection group is finite. We show that the isomorphism type of the braid groups only depend on the reflection isomorphism types of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, we show that these braid groups are always abstractly isomorphic to circular groups. At the same time, we show that the center of the braid groups is cyclic and sent onto the center of the corresponding $J$-reflection groups under the natural quotient. Finally, we exhibit two Garside structures for each braid group of $J$-reflection group. These structures generalise the classical and dual Garside structures (when defined) of rank two irreducible complex reflection groups. In particular, the dual Garside structure of $J$-reflection groups provides candidates for dual monoids associated to the irreducible complex reflection groups of rank two which do not already have one.</description>

Abstract: The famous Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem for the complete graph on six vertices was extended to the general complete graph on $n$ vertices by Kazakov--Korablev as a congruence modulo $2$, and its integral lift was given by Morishita--Nikkuni. However, the proof is complicated and long. In this paper, we provide a shorter proof of the generalized Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem over integers.</description>

      <title>Quiver Grassmannians for the Bott-Samelson resolution of type A Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We realise the Bott-Samelson resolutions of type A Schubert varieties as quiver Grassmannians. In order to explicitly describe this isomorphism, we introduce the notion of a \textit{geometrically compatible} decomposition for any permutation in $S_n$. For smooth type A Schubert varieties, we identify a suitable dimension vector such that the corresponding quiver Grassmannian is isomorphic to the Schubert variety. To obtain these isomorphisms, we construct a special quiver with relations and investigate two classes of quiver Grassmannians for this quiver.</description>

      <title>Quantum K--theory of Grassmannians from a Yang-Baxter algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper, two of the authors defined a $5$-vertex Yang-Baxter algebra (a Hopf algebra) which acts on the sum of the equivariant quantum K-rings of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}(k;n)$, where $k$ varies from $0$ to $n$. We construct geometrically defined operators on quantum K-rings describing this action. In particular, the $R$-matrix defining the Yang-Baxter algebra corresponds to the left Weyl group action. Most importantly, we use the `quantum=classical' statement for the quantum K-theory of Grassmannians to prove an explicit geometric interpretation of the action of generators of the Yang-Baxter algebra. The diagonal entries of the monodromy matrix are given by quantum K-multiplications by explicitly defined classes, and the off-diagonal entries by certain push-pull convolutions. We use this to find a quantization of the classes of fixed points in the quantum K-rings, corresponding to the Bethe vectors of the Yang-Baxter algebra. On each of the quantum K-rings, we prove that the two Frobenius structures (one from geometry, and the other from the integrable system construction) coincide. We discuss several applications, including an action of the extended affine Weyl group on the quantum K-theory ring (extending the Seidel action), a quantum version of the localization map (which is a ring homomorphism with respect to the quantum K-product), and a graphical calculus to multiply by Hirzebruch $\lambda_y$ classes of the dual of the tautological quotient bundle. In an Appendix we illustrate our results in the case when $n=2$.</description>

      <title>J-braid groups are torus necklace groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of links we call torus necklaces for which the link groups are precisely the braid groups of generalised $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, this correspondence exhibits the meridians of the aforementioned link groups as braid reflections. In particular, this construction generalises to all irreducible rank two complex reflection groups a well-known correspondence between some rank two complex braid groups and some torus knot groups. In addition, as abstract groups, we show that the family of link groups associated to Seifert links coincides with the family of circular groups. This shows that every time a link group has a non-trivial center, it is a Garside group.</description>
