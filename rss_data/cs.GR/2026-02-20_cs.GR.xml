      <title>Fuse3D: Generating 3D Assets Controlled by Multi-Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, generating 3D assets with the control of condition images has achieved impressive quality. However, existing 3D generation methods are limited to handling a single control objective and lack the ability to utilize multiple images to independently control different regions of a 3D asset, which hinders their flexibility in applications. We propose Fuse3D, a novel method that enables generating 3D assets under the control of multiple images, allowing for the seamless fusion of multi-level regional controls from global views to intricate local details. First, we introduce a Multi-Condition Fusion Module to integrate the visual features from multiple image regions. Then, we propose a method to automatically align user-selected 2D image regions with their associated 3D regions based on semantic cues. Finally, to resolve control conflicts and enhance local control features from multi-condition images, we introduce a Local Attention Enhancement Strategy that flexibly balances region-specific feature fusion. Overall, we introduce the first method capable of controllable 3D asset generation from multiple condition images. The experimental results indicate that Fuse3D can flexibly fuse multiple 2D image regions into coherent 3D structures, resulting in high-quality 3D assets.

      <title>InstantRetouch: Personalized Image Retouching without Test-time Fine-tuning Using an Asymmetric Auto-Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized image retouching aims to adapt retouching style of individual users from reference examples, but existing methods often require user-specific fine-tuning or fail to generalize effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce $\textbf{InstantRetouch}$, a general framework for personalized image retouching that instantly adapts to user retouching styles without any test-time fine-tuning. It employs an $\textit{asymmetric auto-encoder}$ to encode the retouching style from paired examples into a content disentangled latent representation that enables faithful transfer of the retouching style to new images. To adaptively apply the encoded retouching style to new images, we further propose $\textit{retrieval-augmented retouching}$ (RAR), which retrieves and aggregates style latents from reference pairs most similar in content to the query image. With these components, $\textbf{InstantRetouch}$ enables superior and generic content-aware retouching personalization across diverse scenarios, including single-reference, multi-reference, and mixed-style setups, while also generalizing out of the box to photorealistic style transfer.</description>

      <title>Style-Aware Gloss Control for Generative Non-Photorealistic Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humans can infer material characteristics of objects from their visual appearance, and this ability extends to artistic depictions, where similar perceptual strategies guide the interpretation of paintings or drawings. Among the factors that define material appearance, gloss, along with color, is widely regarded as one of the most important, and recent studies indicate that humans can perceive gloss independently of the artistic style used to depict an object. To investigate how gloss and artistic style are represented in learned models, we train an unsupervised generative model on a newly curated dataset of painterly objects designed to systematically vary such factors. Our analysis reveals a hierarchical latent space in which gloss is disentangled from other appearance factors, allowing for a detailed study of how gloss is represented and varies across artistic styles. Building on this representation, we introduce a lightweight adapter that connects our style- and gloss-aware latent space to a latent-diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of non-photorealistic images with fine-grained control of these factors. We compare our approach with previous models and observe improved disentanglement and controllability of the learned factors.</description>
