      <description>arXiv:2504.16965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by virtue of a determinantal formula for derivatives of the ratio between two differentiable functions, in view of the Fa\`a di Bruno formula, and with the help of several identities and closed-form formulas for the partial Bell polynomials $\operatorname{B}_{n,k}$, the author establishes thirteen Maclaurin series expansions of the functions \begin{align*} &amp;\ln\frac{\operatorname{e}^x+1}{2}, &amp;&amp; \ln\frac{\operatorname{e}^x-1}{x}, &amp;&amp; \ln\cosh x, \\ &amp;\ln\frac{\sinh x}{x}, &amp;&amp; \biggl[\frac{\ln(1+x)}{x}\biggr]^r, &amp;&amp; \biggl(\frac{\operatorname{e}^x-1}{x}\biggr)^r \end{align*} for $r=\pm\frac{1}{2}$ and $r\in\mathbb{R}$ in terms of the Dirichlet eta function $\eta(1-2k)$, the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(1-2k)$, and the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds $s(n,k)$ and $S(n,k)$. presents four determinantal expressions and three recursive relations for the Bernoulli numbers $B_{2n}$.  finds out three closed-form formulas for the Bernoulli numbers $B_{2n}$ and the generalized Bernoulli numbers $B_n^{(r)}$ in terms of the Stirling numbers of the second kind $S(n,k)$, and deduce two combinatorial identities for the Stirling numbers of the second kind $S(n,k)$. acquires two combinatorial identities, which can be regarded as diagonal recursive relations, involving the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds $s(n,k)$ and $S(n,k)$. recovers an integral representation and a closed-form formula, and establish an alternative explicit and closed-form formula, for the Bernoulli numbers of the second kind $b_n$ in terms of the Stirling numbers of the first kind $s(n,k)$. obtains three identities connecting the Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds $s(n,k)$ and $S(n,k)$.</description>

      <title>The autotopism group of a family of commutative semifields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely determine the autotopism group of the (as of now) largest family of commutative semifields found by G\"olo\u{g}lu and K\"olsch. Since this family of semifields generally does not have large nuclei, this process is considerably harder than for families considered in preceding work. Our results show that all autotopisms are semilinear over the degree 2 subfield and that the autotopism group is always solvable. Using known connections, our results also completely determine the automorphism groups of the associated rank-metric codes and the collineation groups of the associated translation planes.</description>

      <title>On the number of drawings of a combinatorial triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1962, Tutte provided a formula for the number of combinatorial triangulations, that is, maximal planar graphs with a fixed triangular face and $n$ additional vertices. In this note, we study how many ways a combinatorial triangulation can be drawn as geometric triangulation, that is, with straight-line segments, on a given point set in the plane. Our central contribution is that there exists a combinatorial triangulation with n vertices that can be drawn in at least $\Omega(1,31^n)$ ways on a set of n points as different geometric triangulations. We also show an upper bound on the number of drawings of a combinatorial triangulation on the so-called double chain point set.</description>

      <title>Insertion algorithms and pattern avoidance on trees arising in the Kapranov embedding of $\overline{M}_{0,n+3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve a question of Gillespie, Griffin, and Levinson that asks for a combinatorial bijection between two classes of trivalent trees, tournament trees and slide trees, that both naturally arise in the intersection theory of the moduli space $\overline{M}_{0,n+3}$ of stable genus zero curves with $n+3$ marked points. Each set of trees enumerates the same intersection product of certain pullbacks of $\psi$ classes under forgetting maps.
  We give an explicit combinatorial bijection between these two sets of trees using an insertion algorithm. We also classify the words that appear on the slide trees of caterpillar shape via pattern avoidance conditions.</description>

      <title>On the Reflective Symmetry of the Mother Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permutiple is a natural number whose representation in some base is an integer multiple of a number whose representation has the same collection of digits. Previous efforts have made progress on finding such numbers using graph-theoretical and finite-state-machine constructions. These are the mother graph and the Hoey-Sloane machine (and its state graph). In this paper, we use the reflective symmetry of the mother graph as a starting point for understanding relationships between permutiple classes and how new classes can be determined from old. Such results are not only useful for finding new permutiples from old, they help us to see previous work through a new lens.</description>

      <title>On the existence and non-existence of spherical $m$-stiff configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the existence of $m$-stiff configurations in the unit sphere $S^{d-1}$, which are spherical $(2m-1)$-designs that lie on $m$ parallel hyperplanes. We establish two non-existence results: (1) for each fixed integer $m &gt; 5$, there exists no $m$-stiff configuration in $S^{d-1}$ for sufficiently large $d$; (2) for each fixed integer $d &gt; 10$, there exists no $m$-stiff configuration in $S^{d-1}$ for sufficiently large $m$. Furthermore, we provide a complete classification of the dimensions where $m$-stiff configurations exist for $m=2,3,4,5$. We also determine the non-existence (and the existence) of $m$-stiff configurations in $S^{d-1}$ for small $d$ ($3 \leq d \leq 120$) with arbitrary $m$, and also for small $m$ ($6 \leq m \leq 10$) with arbitrary $d$. Finally, we conjecture that there is no $m$-stiff configuration in $S^{d-1}$ for $(d,m)$ with $d\geq 3$ and $m\geq 6$.</description>

      <title>Sombor index and eigenvalues of weakly zero-divisor graph of commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weakly zero-divisor graph $W\Gamma(R)$ of a commutative ring $R$ is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are nonzero zero-divisors of $R$ and two distinct vertices $x$, $y$ are adjacent if and only if there exist $w\in {\rm ann}(x)$ and $ z\in {\rm ann}(y)$ such that $wz =0$. In this paper, we determine the Sombor index for the weakly zero-divisor graph of the integers modulo ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$. Furthermore, we investigate the Sombor spectrum and establish bounds for the Sombor energy of the weakly zero-divisor graph of $\mathbb{Z}_n$.</description>

      <title>An Upper Bound on Generalized Cospectral Mates of Oriented Graphs Using Skew-Walk Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be an oriented graph with skew adjacency matrix $S(D)$. Two oriented graphs $D$ and $C$ are said to share the same generalized skew spectrum if $S(D)$ and $S(C)$ have the same eigenvalues, and $J-S(D)$ and $J-S(C)$ also have the same eigenvalues, where $J$ is the all-ones matrix. Such graphs that are not isomorphic are generalized cospectral mates. We derive tight upper bounds on the number of non-isomorphic generalized cospectral mates an oriented graph can admit, based on arithmetic criteria involving the determinant of its skew-walk matrix. As a special case, we also provide a criterion for an oriented graph to be weakly determined by its generalized skew spectrum (WDGSS), that is, its only generalized cospectral mate is its transpose. These criteria relate directly to the controllability of graphs, a fundamental concept in the control of networked systems, thereby connecting spectral characterization of graphs to graph controllability.</description>

      <title>Vertex evaluation of multiplex graphs using Forman Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying vertices that play a central role is a fundamental problem in network analysis. Although traditional centrality measures have been widely used for this purpose, the growing complexity of contemporary networks necessitates more sophisticated indicators. Forman curvature has recently emerged as a promising approach. In this paper, we define Forman curvature for multilayer networks, a class of complex networks characterized by multiple types of connections or layers between nodes, which are increasingly used to model intricate real-world phenomena. We establish the key properties of Forman curvature in the context of multilayer networks and demonstrate its utility for identifying vertices that hold central positions within these networks. Furthermore, we show that Forman curvature can also serve as an effective tool for the structural classification of entire multilayer networks.</description>

      <title>Graph covers and semi-covers: Who is stronger?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of graph cover, also known as locally bijective homomorphism, is a discretization of covering spaces known from general topology. It is a pair of incidence-preserving vertex- and edge-mappings between two graphs, the edge-component being bijective on the edge-neighborhoods of every vertex and its image. In line with the current trends in topological graph theory and its applications in mathematical physics, graphs are considered in the most relaxed form and as such they may contain multiple edges, loops and semi-edges.
  Nevertheless, simple graphs (binary structures without multiple edges, loops, or semi-edges) play an important role. It has been conjectured in [Bok et al.: List covering of regular multigraphs, Proceedings IWOCA 2022, LNCS 13270, pp. 228--242] that for every fixed graph $H$, deciding if a graph covers $H$ is either polynomial time solvable for arbitrary input graphs, or NP-complete for simple ones. A graph $A$ is called stronger than a graph $B$ if every simple graph that covers $A$ also covers $B$. This notion was defined and found useful for NP-hardness reductions for disconnected graphs in [Bok et al.: Computational complexity of covering disconnected multigraphs, Proceedings FCT 2022, LNCS 12867, pp. 85--99]. It was conjectured in [Kratochv\'{\i}l: Towards strong dichotomy of graphs covers, GROW 2022 - Book of open problems, p. 10, {\tt https://grow.famnit.upr.si/GROW-BOP.pdf}] that if $A$ has no semi-edges, then $A$ is stronger than $B$ if and only if $A$ covers $B$. We prove this conjecture for cubic one-vertex graphs, and we also justify it for all cubic graphs $A$ with at most 4 vertices.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and Separation in the Graph Covering Number Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph class $\mathcal G$ and a graph $H$, the four $\mathcal G$-covering numbers of $H$, namely global ${\rm cn}_{g}^{\mathcal{G}}(H)$, union ${\rm cn}_{u}^{\mathcal{G}}(H)$, local ${\rm cn}_{l}^{\mathcal{G}}(H)$, and folded ${\rm cn}_{f}^{\mathcal{G}}(H)$, each measure in a slightly different way how well $H$ can be covered with graphs from $\mathcal G$. For every $\mathcal G$ and $H$ it holds \[
  {\rm cn}_{g}^{\mathcal{G}}(H) \geq {\rm cn}_{u}^{\mathcal{G}}(H) \geq {\rm cn}_{l}^{\mathcal{G}}(H) \geq {\rm cn}_{f}^{\mathcal{G}}(H) \] and in general each inequality can be arbitrarily far apart. We investigate structural properties of graph classes $\mathcal G$ and $\mathcal H$ such that for all graphs $H \in \mathcal{H}$, a larger $\mathcal G$-covering number of $H$ can be bounded in terms of a smaller $\mathcal G$-covering number of $H$. For example, we prove that if $\mathcal G$ is hereditary and the chromatic number of graphs in $\mathcal H$ is bounded, then there exists a function $f$ (called a binding function) such that for all $H \in \mathcal{H}$ it holds ${\rm cn}_{u}^{\mathcal{G}}(H) \leq f({\rm cn}_{g}^{\mathcal{G}}(H))$.
  For $\mathcal G$ we consider graph classes that are component-closed, hereditary, monotone, sparse, or of bounded chromatic number. For $\mathcal H$ we consider graph classes that are sparse, $M$-minor-free, of bounded chromatic number, or of bounded treewidth. For each combination and every pair of $\mathcal G$-covering numbers, we either give a binding function $f$ or provide an example of such $\mathcal{G},\mathcal{H}$ for which no binding function exists.</description>

      <title>Two gluing methods for string C-group representations of the symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of string C-group representations of rank at least $n/2$ for the symmetric group $S_n$ has gained a lot of attention in the last fifteen years. In a recent paper, Cameron et al. gave a list of permutation representation graphs of rank $r\geq n/2$ for $S_n$, having a fracture graph and a non-perfect split. They conjecture that these graphs are permutation representation graphs of string C-groups. In trying to prove this conjecture, we discovered two new techniques to glue two CPR graphs for symmetric groups together. We discuss the cases in which they yield new CPR graphs. By doing so, we invalidate the conjecture of Cameron et al. We believe our gluing techniques will be useful in the study of string C-group representations of high ranks for the symmetric groups.</description>

      <title>Principal Minors of Hermitian Laplacian Matrix of Directed Graphs and Their Connection to Directed Graph Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the algebraic characterization of directed graph substructures through principal minors of the Hermitian Laplacian matrix. By generalizing Bapat et al.'s nonsingular substructure theory and by defining substructures as vertex-edge pairs $(V',E')$ which allows edges to connect vertices outside $V'$, we establish a link between the principle minors and the topological properties of key substructures such as rootless trees and unicyclic graphs. Using the Cauchy-Binet formula, we decompose principal minors into sums of determinants of regular substructures. Specifically, we investigate how these algebraic invariants encode information about unicyclic substructures and their properties, contributing to the broader understanding of graph structures through the lens of Hermitian Laplacian matrix of algebraic graph theory.</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of paving matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gao and Xie (2021) conjectured that the inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of any matroid is log-concave. Although the inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial may not always have only real roots, we conjecture that the Hadamard product of an inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial of degree $n$ and $(1+t)^n$ has only real roots. Using interlacing polynomials and multiplier sequences, we confirm this conjecture for paving matroids. This result allows us to confirm the log-concavity conjecture for these matroids by applying Newton's inequalities.</description>

      <title>Quasi-treeings are treeable: a streamlined proof</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09843v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a streamlined exposition of a construction by R. Chen, A. Poulin, R. Tao, and A. Tserunyan, which proves the treeability of equivalence relations generated by any locally-finite Borel graph such that each component is a quasi-tree. More generally, we show that if each component of a locally-finite Borel graph admits a finitely-separating Borel family of cuts, then we may 'canonically' replace each component of the graph by a tree of special ultrafilter-like objects on cuts called orientations; moreover, if the cuts are dense towards ends, then the union of these trees is a Borel treeing.</description>

      <title>Burning some myths on privacy properties of social networks against active attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on showing some arguments addressed to dismantle the extended idea about that social networks completely lacks of privacy properties. We consider the so-called active attacks to the privacy of social networks and the counterpart $(k,\ell)$-anonymity measure, which is used to quantify the privacy satisfied by a social network against active attacks. To this end, we make use of the graph theoretical concept of $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for which the case $k=1$ represents those graphs achieving the worst scenario in privacy whilst considering the $(k,\ell)$-anonymity measure.
  As a product of our investigation, we present a large number of computational results stating that social networks might not be as insecure as one often thinks. In particular, we develop a large number of experiments on random graphs which show that the number of $1$-metric antidimensional graphs is indeed ridiculously small with respect to the total number of graphs that can be considered. Moreover, we search on several real networks in order to check if they are $1$-metric antidimensional, and obtain that none of them are such. Along the way, we show some theoretical studies on the mathematical properties of the $k$-metric antidimensional graphs for any suitable $k\ge 1$. In addition, we also describe some operations on graphs that are $1$-metric antidimensional so that they get embedded into another larger graphs that are not such, in order to obscure their privacy properties against active attacks.</description>

Abstract: Following our previous works on $C^*$-graph algebras and the associated Cuntz-Krieger graph families, in this paper we will try to have a look at the colored version of these structures and to see what a $C^*$-colored graph algebra might mean by employing some constructive examples very close to the toy example used in our previous works, and we also will try to study their graph theoretical properties as possible.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound for Zeros in The Character Table of The Symmetric Group with an n-Core Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any two partitions $\lambda$ and $\mu$ of a positive integer $N$, let $\chi_{\lambda}(\mu)$ denote the value of the irreducible character of the symmetric group $S_{N}$ associated with $\lambda$, evaluated at the conjugacy class of elements whose cycle type is determined by $\mu$. The quantity $Z_{t}(N)$ is defined as $$ Z_{t}(N):= \#\{(\lambda,\mu): \chi_{\lambda}(\mu) = 0 \quad \text{with $\lambda$ a $t$-core}\}. $$ We establish the bound $$ \max\limits_{1\leq t \leq N} Z_{t}(N) \geq c_{t}(N)p(N-t)\geq \frac{2\pi p(N)^{2}}{1.01e\sqrt{6N}\log N} \biggl(1+O(N^{-\frac{1}{2}}\log N)\biggr), $$ where $p(N)$ denotes the number of partitions of $N$. Also, we give lower bounds for $Z_{t}(N)$ in different ranges of $t$ and obtain a lower bound for the total number of zeros in the character table of $S_N$.</description>

      <title>Graph Quasirandomness for Hypothesis Testing of Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Chung, Graham, and Wilson on quasirandom graphs implies that if the 4-cycle and edge counts in a graph $G$ are both close to their typical number in $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2),$ then this also holds for the counts of subgraphs isomorphic to $H$ for any $H$ of constant size. We aim to prove a similar statement where the notion of close is whether the given (signed) subgraph count can be used as a test between $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and a stochastic block model $\mathbb{SBM}.$
  Quantitatively, this is related to approximately maximizing $H \longrightarrow |\Phi(H)|^{\frac{1}{|\mathsf{V}(H)|}},$ where $\Phi(H)$ is the Fourier coefficient of $\mathbb{SBM}$, indexed by subgraph $H.$ This formulation turns out to be equivalent to approximately maximizing the partition function of a spin model over alphabet equal to the community labels in $\mathbb{SBM}.$
  We resolve the approximate maximization when $\mathbb{SBM}$ satisfies one of four conditions: 1) the probability of an edge between any two vertices in different communities is exactly $1/2$; 2) the probability of an edge between two vertices from any two communities is at least $1/2$ (this case is also covered in a recent work of Yu, Zadik, and Zhang); 3) the probability of belonging to any given community is at least $c$ for some universal constant $c&gt;0$; 4) $\mathbb{SBM}$ has two communities. In each of these cases, we show that there is an approximate maximizer of $|\Phi(H)|^{\frac{1}{|\mathsf{V}(H)|}}$ in the set $\mathsf{A} = \{\text{stars, 4-cycle}\}.$ This implies that if there exists a constant-degree polynomial test distinguishing $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and $\mathbb{SBM},$ then the two distributions can also be distinguished via the signed count of some graph in $\mathsf{A}.$ We conjecture that the same holds true for distinguishing $\mathbb{G}(n,1/2)$ and any graphon if we also add triangles to $\mathsf{A}.$</description>

      <title>Service Rate Regions of MDS Codes &amp; Fractional Matchings in Quasi-uniform Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The service rate region (SRR) has emerged as a critical performance metric for distributed systems that store data redundantly. It measures the system's ability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a polytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of one of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we characterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard simplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows with the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We establish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with fractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope is equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching polytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is sufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the entire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large subset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous characterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering a unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish a relation between the quantum corner VOA $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, which can be regarded as a generalization of quantum $W_N$ algebra, and Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials. We demonstrate precisely that, under a specific map, the correlation functions of the currents of $q\widetilde{Y}_{L,0,N}[\Psi]$, coincide with the Sergeev-Veselov super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>Morphisms and BWT-run Sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the application of injective morphisms affects the number $r$ of equal-letter runs in the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT). This parameter has emerged as a key repetitiveness measure in compressed indexing. We focus on the notion of BWT-run sensitivity after application of an injective morphism. For binary alphabets, we characterize the class of morphisms that preserve the number of BWT-runs up to a bounded additive increase, by showing that it coincides with the known class of primitivity-preserving morphisms, which are those that map primitive words to primitive words. We further prove that deciding whether a given binary morphism has bounded BWT-run sensitivity is possible in polynomial time with respect to the total length of the images of the two letters. Additionally, we explore new structural and combinatorial properties of synchronizing and recognizable morphisms. These results establish new connections between BWT-based compressibility, code theory, and symbolic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modularity of tadpole Nahm sums in ranks 4 and 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around 2016, Calinescu, Milas and Penn conjectured that the rank $r$ Nahm sum associated with the $r\times r$ tadpole Cartan matrix is modular, and they provided a proof for $r=2$. The $r=3$ case was recently resolved by Milas and Wang. We prove this conjecture for the next cases $r=4,5$. We also prove the modularity of some companion Nahm sums by establishing the corresponding Rogers--Ramanujan type identities. A key new ingredient in our proofs is some rank reduction formulas which allow us to decompose higher rank tadpole Nahm sums to mixed products of some lower rank Nahm-type sums and theta functions.</description>

Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to develop the dual Ramsey theory for finite relational structures with respect to natural structure-preserving maps. Tools of category theory prove to be instrumental in this endeavor, as they allow us to lift the dual Ramsey phenomena from the context of chains and rigid surjections (which capture the Finite Dual Ramsey Theorem of Graham, Leeb and Rothschild, and the Infinite Dual Ramsey Theorem of Carlson and Simpson) onto the context of structures and structure-preserving maps.</description>

Abstract: It is known that in matroids the difference between the chromatic number and the fractional chromatic number is smaller than 1, and that the list chromatic number is equal to the chromatic number. We investigate the gap within these pairs of parameters for hypergraphs that are the intersection of a given number k of matroids. We prove that in such hypergraphs the list chromatic number is at most k times the chromatic number and at most 2k-1 times the maximum chromatic number among the k matroids. We study the relationship between three polytopes associated with k-sets of matroids, and connect them to bounds on the fractional chromatic number of the intersection of the members of the k-set. This also connects to bounds on the matroidal matching and covering number of the intersection of the members of the k-set. The tools used are in part topological.</description>

Abstract: A result [The intersection of a matroid and a simplicial complex, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 358] from 2006 of Aharoni and the first author of this paper states that for any two positive integers $p,q$, where $p$ divides $q$, if a matroid $\mathcal{M}$ is $p$-colorable and a matroid $\mathcal{N}$ is $q$-colorable then $\mathcal{M} \cap \mathcal{N}$ is $(p+q)$-colorable. In this paper we show that the assumption that $p$ divides $q$ is in fact redundant, and we also prove that $\mathcal{M} \cap \mathcal{N}$ is even $p+q$ list-colorable.
  The result uses topology and relies on a new parameter yielding a lower bound for the topological connectivity of the intersection of two matroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce some (p,q)-deformations of the weight multiplicities for the representations of any simple Lie algebra g over the complex numbers. This is done by associating the indeterminate q to the positive roots of a parabolic subsystem of g and the indeterminate p to the remaining positive roots. When p=q, we so recover the usual Lusztig analogues of weight multiplicities. We then study the positivity of the coefficients in these double deformations. In particular, the positivity holds when p=1 in which case the polynomials have a natural algebraic interpretation in terms of a parabolic Brylinski filtration. For the parabolic restriction from type C to type A, this positivity result was conjectured by Lee.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Sieving of Multisets with Bounded Multiplicity and the Frobenius Coin Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two subjects in the title are related via the specialization of symmetric polynomials at roots of unity. Let $f(z_1,\ldots,z_n)\in\mathbb{Z}[z_1,\ldots,z_n]$ be a symmetric polynomial with integer coefficients and let $\omega$ be a primitive $d$th root of unity. If $d|n$ or $d|(n-1)$ then we have $f(1,\ldots,\omega^{n-1})\in\mathbb{Z}$. If $d|n$ then of course we have $f(\omega,\ldots,\omega^n)=f(1,\ldots,\omega^{n-1})\in\mathbb{Z}$, but when $d|(n+1)$ we also have $f(\omega,\ldots,\omega^n)\in\mathbb{Z}$. We investigate these three families of integers in the case $f=h_k^{(b)}$, where $h_k^{(b)}$ is the coefficient of $t^k$ in the generating function $\prod_{i=1}^n (1+z_it+\cdots+(z_it)^{b-1})$. These polynomials were previously considered by several authors. They interpolate between the elementary symmetric polynomials ($b$=2) and the complete homogeneous symmetric polynomials ($b\to\infty$). When $\gcd(b,d)=1$ with $d|n$ or $d|(n-1)$ we find that the integers $h_k^{(b)}=(1,\omega,\ldots,\omega^{n-1})$ are related to cyclic sieving of multisets with multiplicities bounded above by $b$, generalizing the well know cyclic sieving results for sets ($b=2$) and multisets ($b\to \infty$). When $\gcd(b,d)=1$ and $d|(n+1)$ we find that the integers $h_k^{(b)}(\omega,\omega^2,\ldots,\omega^n)$ are related to the Frobenius coin problem with two coins. The case $\gcd(b,d)\neq 1$ is more complicated. At the end of the paper we combine these results with the expansion of $h_k^{(b)}$ in various bases of the ring of symmetric polynomials.</description>

      <title>A short proof of Tuza's conjecture for weak saturation in hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and a positive integer $n$, the weak saturation number $\mathrm{wsat}(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph $F$ on $n$ vertices such that the missing edges in $F$ can be added, one at a time, so that each added edge creates a copy of $H$. Shapira and Tyomkyn (Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, 2023) proved Tuza's conjecture on asymptotic behaviour of $\mathrm{wsat}(n, H)$. In this paper we provide a significantly shorter proof of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Recursive Block Pillar Structure in the Kolakoski Sequence K(1,3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kolakoski sequence K(1,3) over {1, 3} is known to be structured, unlike K(1,2), with symbol frequency d approx. 0.397 linked to the Pisot number alpha (real root of x^3 - 2x^2 - 1 = 0). We reveal an explicit nested recursion defining block sequences B(n) and pillar sequences P(n) via B(n+1) = B(n) P(n) B(n) and P(n+1) = G(R(P(n)), 3), where G generates runs from vector R(P(n)). We prove B(n) are prefixes of K(1,3) converging to it, and B(n+1) = G(R(B(n)), 1), directly reflecting the Kolakoski self-encoding property. We derive recurrences for lengths |B(n)|, |P(n)| and symbol counts, confirming growth governed by alpha (limit |B(n+1)|/|B(n)| = alpha as n -&gt; infinity). If block/pillar densities converge, they must equal d. This constructive framework provides an alternative perspective on K(1,3)'s regularity, consistent with known results from substitution dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hypertrees and their host trees: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hypergraph $\mathcal{H}=(V,\mathcal{E})$ is a hypertree if it admits a tree $T$ with vertex set $V$ such that every edge of $\mathcal{H}$ induces a subtree of $T$. A tree like that is called a host tree. Several characterizations and properties of hypertrees have been discovered over the years. However, the interest in the structure of their host trees was weaker and restricted to particular scenarios where they arise, like the clique tree of chordal graphs. In that special case, the proofs of most characteristics of clique trees that exist in the literature rely significantly on the structural properties of chordal graphs. The purpose of this work is the study of the properties of the host trees of hypertrees in a more general context and have them described in a single place, giving simpler proofs for known facts, generalizing others and introducing some new concepts that the author considers that are relevant for the study of the topic. Particularly, we will determine what edges can be found in some host tree of a hypertree, and how these edges must be combined to form a host tree, with an emphasis in tools like the basis and the completion of a hypergraph, and the concept of equivalent hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandomness of the Sticky Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the pseudorandomness of random walks on expander graphs using the sticky random walk. Building on prior works, it was recently shown that expander random walks can fool all symmetric functions in total variation distance (TVD) upto an $O(\lambda(\frac{p}{\min f})^{O(p)})$ error, where $\lambda$ is the second largest eigenvalue of the expander, $p$ is the size of the arbitrary alphabet used to label the vertices, and $\min f = \min_{b\in[p]} f_b$, where $f_b$ is the fraction of vertices labeled $b$ in the graph. Golowich and Vadhan conjecture that the dependency on the $(\frac{p}{\min f})^{O(p)}$ term is not tight. In this paper, we resolve the conjecture in the affirmative for a family of expanders. We present a generalization of the sticky random walk for which Golowich and Vadhan predict a TVD upper bound of $O(\lambda p^{O(p)})$ using a Fourier-analytic approach. For this family of graphs, we use a combinatorial approach involving the Krawtchouk functions to derive a strengthened TVD of $O(\lambda)$. Furthermore, we present equivalencies between the generalized sticky random walk, and, using linear-algebraic techniques, show that the generalized sticky random walk parameterizes an infinite family of expander graphs.</description>

      <title>Catalan percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Catalan percolation, all nearest-neighbor edges $\{i,i+1\}$ along $\mathbb Z$ are initially occupied, and all other edges are open independently with probability $p$. Open edges $\{i,j\}$ are occupied if some pair of edges $\{i,k\}$ and $\{k,j\}$, with $i&lt;k&lt;j$, become occupied. This model was introduced by Gravner and the third author, in the context of polluted graph bootstrap percolation.
  We prove that the critical $p_{\mathrm c}$ is strictly between that of oriented site percolation on $\mathbb Z^2$ and the Catalan growth rate $1/4$. Our main result shows that an enhanced oriented percolation model, with non-decaying infinite-range dependency, has a strictly smaller critical parameter than the classical model. This is reminiscent of the work of Duminil-Copin, Hil\'ario, Kozma and Sidoravicius on brochette percolation. Our proof differs, however, in that we do not use Aizenman--Grimmett enhancements or differential inequalities. Two key ingredients are the work of Hil\'ario, S\'a, Sanchis and Teixeira on stretched lattices, and the Russo--Seymour--Welsh result for oriented percolation by Duminil-Copin, Tassion and Teixeira.</description>

      <title>Two-row Delta Springer varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and topology of $\Delta$-Springer varieties associated with two-row partitions. These varieties were introduced in recent work by Griffin-Levinson-Woo to give a geometric realization of a symmetric function appearing in the Delta conjecture by Haglund-Remmel-Wilson. We provide an explicit and combinatorial description of the irreducible components of the two-row $\Delta$-Springer variety and compare it to the ordinary two-row Springer fiber as well as Kato's exotic Springer fiber corresponding to a one-row bipartition. In addition to that, we extend the action of the symmetric group on the homology of the two-row $\Delta$-Springer variety to an action of a degenerate affine Hecke algebra and relate this action to a $\mathfrak{gl}_{2}$-tensor space.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Free-Parafermion Solvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a graph-theoretic characterisation of when a quantum spin model admits an exact solution via a mapping to free parafermions. Our characterisation is based on the concept of a frustration graph, which represents the commutation relations between Weyl operators of a Hamiltonian. We show that a quantum spin system has an exact free-parafermion solution if its frustration graph is an oriented indifference graph. Further, we show that if the frustration graph of a model can be dipath oriented via switching operations, then the model is integrable in the sense that there is a family of commuting independent set charges. Additionally, we establish an efficient algorithm for deciding whether this is possible. Our characterisation extends that given for free-fermion solvability. Finally, we apply our results to solve three qudit spin models.</description>

      <title>Monomial ideals whose all matching powers are Cohen-Macaulay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we aim to classify monomial ideals whose all matching powers are Cohen-Macaulay. We especially focus our attention on edge ideals. The Cohen-Macaulayness of the last matching power of an edge ideal is characterized, providing an algebraic analogue of the famous Tutte theorem regarding graphs having a perfect matching. For chordal graphs, very well-covered graphs and Cameron-Walker graphs, we completely solve our problem.</description>

      <title>Fermions and Zeta Function on the Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel fermionic model on the graphs. The Dirac operator of the model consists of deformed incidence matrices on the graph and the partition function is given by the inverse of the graph zeta function. We find that the coefficients of the inverse of the graph zeta function, which is a polynomial of finite degree in the coupling constant, count the number of fermionic cycles on the graph. We also construct the model on grid graphs by using the concept of the covering graph and the Artin-Ihara $L$-function. In connection with this, we show that the fermion doubling is absent, and the overlap fermions can be constructed on a general graph. Furthermore, we relate our model to statistical models by introducing the winding number around cycles, where the distribution of the poles of the graph zeta function (the zeros of the partition function) plays a crucial role. Finally, we formulate gauge theory including fermions on the graph from the viewpoint of the covering graph derived from the gauge group in a unified way.</description>
