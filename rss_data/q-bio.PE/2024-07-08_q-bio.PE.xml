      <title>Statistics for Phylogenetic Trees in the Presence of Stickiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Samples of phylogenetic trees arise in a variety of evolutionary and biomedical applications, and the Fr\'echet mean in Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann tree space is a summary tree shown to have advantages over other mean or consensus trees. However, use of the Fr\'echet mean raises computational and statistical issues which we explore in this paper. The Fr\'echet sample mean is known often to contain fewer internal edges than the trees in the sample, and in this circumstance calculating the mean by iterative schemes can be problematic due to slow convergence. We present new methods for identifying edges which must lie in the Fr\'echet sample mean and apply these to a data set of gene trees relating organisms from the apicomplexa which cause a variety of parasitic infections. When a sample of trees contains a significant level of heterogeneity in the branching patterns, or topologies, displayed by the trees then the Fr\'echet mean is often a star tree, lacking any internal edges. Not only in this situation, the population Fr\'echet mean is affected by a non-Euclidean phenomenon called stickness which impacts upon asymptotics, and we examine two data sets for which the mean tree is a star tree. The first consists of trees representing the physical shape of artery structures in a sample of medical images of human brains in which the branching patterns are very diverse. The second consists of gene trees from a population of baboons in which there is evidence of substantial hybridization. We develop hypothesis tests which work in the presence of stickiness. The first is a test for the presence of a given edge in the Fr\'echet population mean; the second is a two-sample test for differences in two distributions which share the same sticky population mean.</description>

      <title>The Complex Interplay Between Risk Tolerance and the Spread of Infectious Diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Risk-driven behavior provides a feedback mechanism through which individuals both shape and are collectively affected by an epidemic. We introduce a general and flexible compartmental model to study the effect of heterogeneity in the population with regards to risk tolerance. The interplay between behavior and epidemiology leads to a rich set of possible epidemic dynamics. Depending on the behavioral composition of the population, we find that increasing heterogeneity in risk tolerance can either increase or decrease the epidemic size. We find that multiple waves of infection can arise due to the interplay between transmission and behavior, even without the replenishment of susceptibles. We find that increasing protective mechanisms such as the effectiveness of interventions, the number of risk-averse people in the population, and the duration of intervention usage reduces the epidemic overshoot. When the protection is pushed past a critical threshold, the epidemic dynamics enter an underdamped regime where the epidemic size exactly equals the herd immunity threshold. Lastly, we can find regimes where epidemic size does not monotonically decrease with a population that becomes increasingly risk-averse.</description>

      <title>Error-induced extinction in a multi-type critical birth-death process</title>

Abstract: Extreme mutation rates in microbes and cancer cells can result in error-induced extinction (EEX), where every descendant cell eventually acquires a lethal mutation. In this work, we investigate critical birth-death processes with $n$ distinct types as a birth-death model of EEX in a growing population. Each type-$i$ cell divides independently $(i)\to(i)+(i)$ or mutates $(i)\to(i+1)$ at the same rate. The total number of cells grows exponentially as a Yule process until a cell of type-$n$ appears, which cell type can only die at rate one. This makes the whole process critical and hence after the exponentially growing phase eventually all cells die with probability one. We present large-time asymptotic results for the general $n$-type critical birth-death process. We find that the mass function of the number of cells of type-$k$ has algebraic and stationary tail $(\text{size})^{-1-\chi_k}$, with $\chi_k=2^{1-k}$, for $k=2,\dots,n$, in sharp contrast to the exponential tail of the first type. The same exponents describe the tail of the asymptotic survival probability $(\text{time})^{-\chi_n}$. We present applications of the results for studying extinction due to intolerable mutation rates in biological populations.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics imposed by natural selection on the populations of two competing, sexually reproducing, haploid species. In this setting, the fitness of any genome varies over time due to the changing population mix of the competing species; crucially, this fitness variation arises naturally from the model itself, without the need for imposing it exogenously as is typically the case. Previous work on this model [14] showed that, in the special case where each of the two species exhibits just two phenotypes, genetic diversity is maintained at all times. This finding supported the tenet that sexual reproduction is advantageous because it promotes diversity, which increases the survivability of a species.
  In the present paper we consider the more realistic case where there are more than two phenotypes available to each species. The conclusions about diversity in general turn out to be very different from the two-phenotype case.
  Our first result is negative: namely, we show that sexual reproduction does not guarantee the maintenance of diversity at all times, i.e., the result of [14] does not generalize. Our counterexample consists of two competing species with just three phenotypes each. We show that, for any time~$t_0$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is a time $t\ge t_0$ at which the combined diversity of both species is smaller than~$\varepsilon$. Our main result is a complementary positive statement, which says that in any non-degenerate example, diversity is maintained in a weaker, "infinitely often" sense.
  Thus, our results refute the supposition that sexual reproduction ensures diversity at all times, but affirm a weaker assertion that extended periods of high diversity are necessarily a recurrent event.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency of parsimony under the multispecies coalescent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is known that parsimony can be statistically inconsistent under certain models of evolution due to high levels of homoplasy, the consistency of parsimony under the multispecies coalescent (MSC) is less well studied. Previous studies have shown the consistency of concatenated parsimony (parsimony applied to concatenated alignments) under the MSC for the rooted 4-taxa case under an infinite-sites model of mutation; on the other hand, other work has also established the inconsistency of concatenated parsimony for the unrooted 6-taxa case. These seemingly contradictory results suggest that concatenated parsimony may fail to be consistent for trees with more than 5 taxa, for all unrooted trees, or for some combination of the two. Here, we present a technique for computing the expected internal branch lengths of gene trees under the MSC. This technique allows us to determine the regions of the parameter space of the species tree under which concatenated parsimony fails for different numbers of taxa, for rooted or unrooted trees. We use our new approach to demonstrate that there are always regions of statistical inconsistency for concatenated parsimony for the 5- and 6-taxa cases, regardless of rooting. Our results therefore suggest that parsimony is not generally dependable under the MSC.</description>

      <title>Strength and weakness of disease-induced herd immunity in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a fraction of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, the population-wide infection risk decreases nonlinearly due to collective protection known as herd immunity. Studies based on mean-field models suggest that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce herd immunity more efficiently than homogeneous immunization. Here, we use network epidemic models to show that the opposite can also be the case. We identify two competing mechanisms driving disease-induced herd immunity in networks: the high density of immunity among socially active individuals enhances the herd immunity effect, while the topological localization of immune individuals weakens it. The effect of localization is stronger in networks embedded in low-dimensional space, which can make disease-induced immunity less effective than random immunization. Our results highlight the role of networks in shaping herd immunity and call for careful examination of model predictions that inform public health policies.</description>
