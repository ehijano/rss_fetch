      <title>Exploring lenticular galaxy formation in field environments using NewHorizon: evidence for counter-rotating gas accretion as a formation channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation pathways of lenticular galaxies (S0s) in field environments remain a matter of debate. We utilize the cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, NewHorizon, to investigate the issue. We select two massive star-formation quenched S0s as our main sample. By closely tracing their physical and morphological evolution, we identify two primary formation channels: mergers and counter-rotating gas accretion. The former induces central gas inflow due to gravitational and hydrodynamic torques, triggering active central star formation which quickly depletes the gas of the galaxy. Counter-rotating gas accretion overall has a similar outcome but more exclusively through hydrodynamic collisions between the pre-existing and newly-accreted gas. Both channels lead to S0 morphology, with gas angular momentum cancellation being a crucial mechanism. These formation pathways quench star formation on a short timescale (&lt; Gyr) compared to the timescales of environmental effects. We also discuss how counter-rotating gas accretion may explain the origin of S0s with ongoing star formation and the frequently observed gas-star misaligned kinematics in S0s.</description>

      <title>Moving Groups in the Solar Neighborhood with Gaia, APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST: Dynamical Effects Gather Gas and the Ensuing Star Formation Plays an Important Role in Shaping the Stellar Velocity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With Gaia, APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST data, we investigate the positional, kinematic, chemical, and age properties of nine moving groups in the solar neighborhood. We find that each moving group has a distinct distribution in the velocity space in terms of its metallicity, $\alpha$ abundance, and age. Comparison of the moving groups with their underlying background stars suggests that they have experienced the enhanced, prolonged star formation. We infer that any dynamical effects that gathered stars as a moving group in the velocity space also worked for gas. We propose for the first time that the ensuing newborn stars from such gas inherited the kinematic feature from the gas, shaping the current stellar velocity distributions of the groups. Our findings improve the understanding of the origins and evolutionary histories of moving groups in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>DULAG: A DUal and Lensed AGN candidate catalog with GMP method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A series of studies have demonstrated that the Gaia multipeak method (GMP) is a very efficient technique to select active galactic nucleus (AGN) pair candidates. The number of candidates is determined by the size of the input AGN catalogs, usually limited to spectroscopically-confirmed objects. Aims. The objective of this work is to compile a larger and highly reliable catalog of GMP pair candidates extracted from the six million objects the Gaia AGN catalog, the majority of which lack spectroscopic information. Methods. In order to ascertain the differences in the properties of GMP pair candidates compared to normal AGN, we conducted an investigation utilising samples of GMP AGN. These differences were employed to establish the optimal selecting criteria, which ultimately led to the identification of a highly reliable candidate catalog. Results. We found significant differences in astrometry and multi-band colour distribution between normal AGN and GMP pair candidates. A DUal and Lensed AGN candidate catalog with GMP method (DULAG) comprising 5,286 sources was ultimately compiled, accompanied by a highly reliable Golden sample of 1,867 sources. A total of 37 sources in the Golden sample have been identified as dual AGN or lensed AGN. For the majority of sources in the Golden sample, we provide reference redshifts and find three close AGN pair candidates among them.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All XI. Empirical prescriptions for the interpretation of JWST imaging observations of star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) JWST continues to deliver incredibly detailed infrared (IR) images of star forming regions in the Milky Way and beyond. IR emission from star-forming regions is very spectrally rich due to emission from gas-phase atoms, ions, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Physically interpreting IR images of these regions relies on assumptions about the underlying spectral energy distribution in the imaging bandpasses. We aim to provide empirical prescriptions linking line, PAH, and continuum intensities from JWST images, to facilitate the interpretation of JWST images in a wide variety of contexts. We use JWST PDRs4All Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) imaging and Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) integral field unit (IFU) and MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectroscopic observations of the Orion Bar photodissociation region (PDR), to directly compare and cross-calibrate imaging and IFU data at ~100 AU resolution over a region where the radiation field and ISM environment evolves from the hot ionized gas to the cold molecular gas. We measure the relative contributions of line, PAH, and continuum emission to the NIRCam and MIRI filters as functions of local physical conditions. We provide empirical prescriptions based on NIRCam and MIRI images to derive intensities of emission lines and PAH features. Within the range of the environments probed in this study, these prescriptions accurately predict Pa-alpha, Br-alpha, PAH 3.3 um and 11.2 um intensities, while those for FeII 1.644 um, H_2 1--0 S(1) 2.12 um and 1--0 S(9) 4.96 um, and PAH 7.7 um show more complicated environmental dependencies. Linear combinations of JWST NIRCam and MIRI images provide effective tracers of ionized gas, H_2, and PAH emission in PDRs. We expect these recipes to be useful for both the Galactic and extragalactic communities.</description>

      <title>Accurate sticking coefficient calculation for carbonaceous dust growth through accretion and desorption in astrophysical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Cosmic dust is ubiquitous in astrophysical environments, where it significantly influences the chemistry and the spectra. Dust grains are likely to grow through the accretion of atoms and molecules from the gas-phase onto them. Despite their importance, only a few studies compute sticking coefficients for relevant temperatures and species, and their direct impact on grain growth. Overall, the formation of dust and its growth are processes not well understood. Aims. To calculate sticking coefficients, binding energies, and grain growth rates over a wide range of temperatures, for various gas species interacting with carbonaceous dust grains. Methods. We perform molecular dynamics simulations with a reactive force field algorithm to compute accurate sticking coefficients and obtain binding energies. The results are included in an astrophysical model of nucleation regions to study dust growth. Results. We present, for the first time, sticking coefficients of H, H2, C, O, and CO on amorphous carbon structures for temperatures ranging from 50 K to 2250 K. In addition, we estimate the binding energies of H, C, and O in carbonaceous dust to calculate the thermal desorption rates. Combining accretion and desorption allows us to determine an effective accretion rate and sublimation temperature for carbonaceous dust. Conclusions. We find that sticking coefficients can differ substantially from what is commonly used in astrophysical models and this gives new insight on carbonaceous dust grain growth via accretion in dust-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Condor Array Telescope. V. Deep Broad- and Narrow-Band Imaging Observations of the M81 Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the Condor Array Telescope to obtain deep imaging observations through the luminance broad-band and He II 468.6 nm, [O III] 500.7 nm, He I 587.5 nm, H$\alpha$, [N II] 658.4 nm, and [S II] 671.6 nm narrow-band filters of an extended region comprising 13 "Condor fields" spanning $\approx 8 \times 8$ deg$^2$ on the sky centered near M81 and M82. Here we describe the acquisition and processing of these observations, which together constitute unique very deep imaging observations of a large portion of the M81 Group through a complement of broad- and narrow-band filters. The images are characterized by an intricate web of faint, diffuse, continuum produced by starlight scattered from Galactic cirrus, and all prominent cirrus features identified in the broad-band image can also be identified in the narrow-band images. We subtracted the luminance image from the narrow-band images to leave more or less only line emission in the difference images, and we masked regions of the resulting images around stars at an isophotal limit. The difference images exhibit extensive extended structures of ionized gas in the direction of the M81 Group, from known galaxies of the M81 Group, clouds of gas, filamentary structures, and apparent or possible bubbles or shells. Specifically, the difference images show a remarkable filament known as the "Ursa Major Arc;" a remarkable network of criss-crossed filaments between M81 and NGC 2976, some of which intersect and overlap the Ursa Major Arc; and details of a "giant shell of ionized gas."</description>

      <title>Introducing the Condor Array Telescope. VI. Discovery of Extensive Ionized Gaseous Filaments of the Cosmic Web in the Direction of the M81 Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used the Condor Array Telescope to obtain deep imaging observations through luminance broad-band and He II, [O III], He I, H$\alpha$, [N II], and [S II] narrow-band filters of an extended region of the M81 Group spanning $\approx 8 \times 8$ deg$^2$ on the sky centered near M81 and M82. Here we report aspects of these observations that are specifically related to (1) a remarkable filament known as the "Ursa Major Arc" that stretches $\approx 30$ deg on the sky roughly in the direction of Ursa Major, (2) a "Giant Shell of Ionized Gas" that stretches $\approx 0.8$ deg on the sky located $\approx 0.6$ deg NW of M82, and (3) a remarkable network of ionized gaseous filaments revealed by the new Condor observations that appear to connect the arc, the shell, and various of the galaxies of the M81 Group and, by extension, the group itself. We measure flux ratios between the various ions to help to distinguish photoionized from shock-ionized gas, and we find that the flux ratios of the arc and shell are not indicative of shock ionization. This provides strong evidence against a previous interpretation of the arc as an interstellar shock produced by an unrecognized supernova. We suggest that all of these objects, including the arc, are associated with the M81 Group and are located at roughly the distance $\approx 3.6$ Mpc of M81, that the arc is an intergalactic filament, and that the objects are associated with the low-redshift cosmic web.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for the magnetic field in the thick shell of (super-) bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbles and super-bubbles are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium and influence their local magnetic field. Starting from the assumption that bubbles result from violent explosions that sweep matter away in a thick shell, we derive the analytical equations for the divergence-free magnetic field in the shell. The explosion velocity field is assumed to be radial but not necessarily spherical, making it possible to model various-shaped bubbles. Assuming an explosion center, the magnetic field at the present time is fully determined by the initial uniform magnetic field, the present-time geometry of the bubble shell, and a radial vector field that encodes the explosion-induced displacement of matter, from its original location to its present-time location. We present the main characteristics of our magnetic-field model using a simple displacement model which predicts a constant density of the swept-up matter in the bubble shell and magnetic flux conservation. We further estimate the expected contribution of the shell of the Local Bubble, the super-bubbles in which the Sun resides, to the integrated Faraday rotation measures and synchrotron emission and compare these to full-sky observational data. We find that, while the contribution to the former is minimal, the contribution to the latter is very significant at Galactic latitudes $|b|&gt;45^\circ$. Our results underline the need to take the Local Bubble into account in large-scale Galactic magnetic field studies.</description>

      <title>VLA 22 GHz Imaging of Massive Star Formation in Local Wolf-Rayet Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 22 GHz imaging of regions of massive star formation within the Local Wolf-Rayet Galaxy Sample (LWRGS), a NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) survey of 30 local galaxies showing spectral features of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. These spectral features are present in galaxies with young super star clusters (SSCs), and are an indicator of large concentrations of massive stars. We present a catalog of 92 individually-identified regions of likely free-free emission associated with potential young SSCs located in these WR galaxies. The free-free fluxes from these maps allow extinction-free estimates of the Lyman continuum rates, masses, and luminosities of the emission regions. 39 of these regions meet the minimum Lyman continuum rate to contain at least once SSC, and 29 of these regions could contain individual SSCs massive enough to test specific theories on star formation and feedback inhibition in SSCs, requiring follow-up observations at higher spatial resolution. The resulting catalog provides sources for future molecular line and infrared studies into the properties of super star cluster formation.</description>

      <title>NEXUS Early Data Release: NIRCam Imaging and WFSS Spectroscopy from the First (Partial) Wide Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Early Data Release of the Multi-Cycle JWST-NEXUS Treasury program (2024-2028), which includes NIRCam imaging and WFSS observations from the first (partial) NEXUS-Wide epoch covering the central 100 ${\rm arcmin^2}$ of the NEXUS field, located near the North Ecliptic Pole and within the Euclid Ultra-Deep Field. We release reduced NIRCam mosaics (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F356W, F444W), photometric source catalogs, as well as preliminary WFSS spectra (in F322W2 and F444W) for the subset of bright sources (F356W$&lt;$21 mag or F444W$&lt;$21 mag). These observations fully cover the NEXUS-Deep area, and anchor the long-term baseline of the program. These data will be used for initial target selection for the NIRSpec/MSA spectroscopy starting from June 2025. The NIRCam imaging reaches depths of 27.4--28.2 (AB) mags in F090W--F444W. Upcoming NEXUS-Wide epochs will expand the area to the full $\sim 400\,{\rm arcmin^2}$, and improve the NIRCam exposure depths in the Wide tier by a factor of three. In addition, this central region will be repeatedly covered by the NEXUS-Deep observations (NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec/MSA PRISM spectroscopy) over 18 epochs with a $\sim 2$-month cadence. We demonstrate the data quality of the first NEXUS observations, and showcase some example science cases enabled by these data.</description>

      <title>MOCCA-III: Effects of pristine gas accretion and cluster migration on globular cluster evolution, global parameters and multiple stellar populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the MOCCA code, we study the evolution of globular clusters with multiple stellar populations. For this purpose, the MOCCA code has been significantly extended to take into account the formation of an enriched population of stars from re-accreted gas with a time delay after the formation of the pristine population of stars. The possibility of cluster migration in the host galaxy and the fact that the pristine population can be described by a model, not in virial equilibrium are also taken into account. Gas re-accretion and cluster migration have a decisive impact on the observational parameters of clusters and the ratio of the number of objects between the pristine and enriched populations. The obtained results, together with observational data, suggest a speculative scenario that makes it possible to explain observational data, the correlation between the mass of the cluster and the ratio of the pristine to the enriched populations, and the observational fact that for some globular clusters, the pristine population is more concentrated than the enriched one. In this scenario, it is important to take into account the environment in which the cluster lives, the conditions in the galaxy when it formed, and the fact that a significant part of the globular clusters associated with the Galaxy come from dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way. The initial conditions describing GCs in the simulations discussed in the paper are different from typical initial GC models that are widely used. Instead of GCs being highly concentrated and lying deep inside the Roche lobe, models that fill the Roche lobe are required. This carries strong constraints on where in the galaxy GCs are formed.</description>

      <title>CO(1--0) imaging reveals 10-kiloparsec molecular gas reservoirs around star-forming galaxies at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive, intensely star-forming galaxies at high redshift require a supply of molecular gas from their gas reservoirs, replenished by infall from the surrounding circumgalactic medium, to sustain their immense star-formation rates. However, our knowledge of the extent and morphology of their cold-gas reservoirs is still in its infancy. We present the results of stacking 80 hours of JVLA observations of CO(1--0) emission -- which traces the cold molecular gas -- in 19 $z=2.0-4.5$ dusty, star-forming galaxies from the AS2VLA survey. The visibility-plane stack reveals extended emission with a half-light radius of $3.8\pm0.5$~kpc, 2--3$\times$ more extended than the dust-obscured star formation and $1.4\pm0.2\times$ more extended than the stellar emission. Similarly, stacking the [CI](1--0) observations for a subsample of our galaxies yields sizes consistent with CO(1--0). The CO(1--0) size is comparable to the [CII] halos detected around high-redshift star-forming galaxies.The bulk (up to 80\%) of molecular gas resides outside the star-forming region; only a small part of their molecular gas reservoir directly contributes to their current star formation. Photon-dissociation region modelling indicates that the extended CO(1--0) emission arises from clumpy, dense clouds rather than smooth, diffuse gas.</description>

Abstract: JWST/MIRI images have been used to study the Fourier transform power spectra (PS) of two spiral galaxies, NGC 628 and NGC 5236, and two dwarfs, NGC 4449 and NGC 5068, at distances ranging from 4 to 10 Mpc. The PS slopes on scales larger than 200 pc range from -0.6 at 21 microns to -1.2 at 5.6 microns, suggesting a scaling of region luminosity with size as a power law with index ranging from 2.6 to 3.2, respectively. This result is consistent with the size-luminosity relation of star-forming regions found elsewhere, but extending here to larger scales. There is no evidence for a kink or steepening of the PS at some transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional turbulence on the scale of the disk thickness. This lack of a kink could be from large positional variations in the PS depending on two opposite effects: local bright sources that make the slope shallower and exponential galaxy profiles that make the slope steeper. The sources could also be confined to a layer of molecular clouds that is thinner than the HI or cool dust layers where PS kinks have been observed before. If the star formation layers observed in the near-infrared here are too thin, then the PS kink could be hidden in the broad tail of the JWST point spread function.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Unique Close Quasar-DSFG Pair Linked by a [C II] Bridge at $z=5.63$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a unique quasar-dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) system at $z = 5.63$, consisting of the bright quasar J1133+1603 ($M_{\rm UV} = -27.42$) and its compact, dust-obscured companion, J1133c. ALMA observations reveal a prominent [C II] bridge connecting the quasar and DSFG, indicating ongoing interaction at a projected separation of 1.8 arcsec ($\sim$10 proper kpc). J1133c exhibits unusually bright and broad [C II] emission ($L_{\rm [CII]} &gt; 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, FWHM $&gt; 500$ km s$^{-1}$), with a [C II] luminosity five times that of the quasar, suggesting intense star formation or potential AGN activity. The inferred star formation rate from [C II] is approximately $10^3$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The remarkable properties of this pair strongly suggest that galaxy interactions may simultaneously trigger both starburst and quasar activity, driving rapid evolution in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Dwarf Galaxies in the MATLAS Survey: The satellite system of NGC474 under scrutiny with MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study of the distribution of dwarf galaxies in the MATLAS sample in galaxy groups revealed an excess of flattened satellite structures, reminiscent of the co-rotating planes of dwarf galaxies discovered in the local Universe. If confirmed, this lends credence to the plane-of-satellite problem and further challenges the standard model of hierarchical structure formation. However, with only photometric data and no confirmation of the satellite membership, the study could not address the plane-of-satellite problem in full detail. Here we present spectroscopic follow-up observations of one of the most promising planes-of-satellites candidates in the MATLAS survey, the satellite system of NGC 474. Employing MUSE at the VLT and full spectrum fitting, we studied 13 dwarf galaxy candidates and confirmed nine to be members of the field around NGC 474. Measuring the stellar populations of all observed galaxies, we find that the MATLAS dwarfs have lower metallicities than the Local Group dwarfs at given luminosity. Two dwarf galaxies may form a pair of satellites based on their close projection and common velocity. Within the virial radius, we do not find a significant plane-of-satellites, however, there is a sub-population of six dwarf galaxies which seem to be anti-correlated in phase-space. Due to the low number of dwarf galaxies, this signal may arise by chance. With over 2000 dwarf galaxy candidates found in the MATLAS survey, this remains an intriguing data set to study the plane-of-satellites problem in a statistical fashion once more follow-up observations have been conducted.</description>

      <title>A spatially-resolved spectral analysis of giant radio galaxies with MeerKAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we report spatially resolved, wideband spectral properties of three giant radio galaxies (GRGs) in the COSMOS field: MGTC J095959.63+024608.6 , MGTC J100016.84+015133.0 and MGTC J100022.85+031520.4. One such galaxy MGTC J100022.85+031520.4 is reported here for the first time with a projected linear size of 1.29 Mpc at a redshift of 0.1034. Unlike the other two, it is associated with a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), making it one of the few GRGs known to inhabit cluster environments. We examine the spectral age distributions of the three GRGs using new MeerKAT UHF-band (544-1088 MHz) observations, and $L$-band (900-1670 MHz) data from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey. We test two different models of spectral ageing, the Jaffe-Perola and Tribble models, using the Broadband Radio Astronomy Tools (\textsc{brats}) software which we find agree well with each other. We estimate the Tribble spectral age for MGTC J095959.63+024608.6 as 68 Myr, MGTC J100016.84+015133.0 as 47 Myr and MGTC J100022.85+031520.4 as 67 Myr. We find significant disagreements between these spectral age estimates and the estimates of the dynamical ages of these GRGs, modelled in cluster and group environments. Our results highlight the need for additional processes which are not accounted for in either the dynamic age or spectral age estimations.</description>

      <title>Investigating Differences in the Palomar-Green Blazar Population Using Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present polarization images with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in A and B-array configurations at 6 GHz of 7 radio-loud (RL) quasars and 8 BL Lac objects belonging to the Palomar-Green (PG) `blazar' sample. This completes our arcsecond-scale polarization study of an optically-selected volume-limited blazar sample comprising 16 radio-loud quasars and 8 BL Lac objects. Using the VLA, we identify kpc-scale polarization in the cores and jets/lobes of all the blazars, with fractional polarization varying from around $0.8 \pm 0.3$% to $37 \pm 6$%. The kpc-scale jets in PG RL quasars are typically aligned along their parsec-scale jets and show apparent magnetic fields parallel to jet directions in their jets/cores and magnetic field compression in their hotspots. The quasars show evidence of interaction with their environment as well as restarted AGN activity through morphology, polarization and spectral indices. These quasi-periodic jet modulations and restarted activity may be indicative of an unstable accretion disk undergoing transition. We find that the polarization characteristics of the BL Lacs are consistent with their jets being reoriented multiple times, with no correlation between their core apparent magnetic field orientations and pc-scale jet directions. We find that the low synchrotron peaked BL Lacs show polarization and radio morphology features typical of `strong' jet sources as defined by Meyer et al. (2011) for the `blazar envelope scenario', which posits a division based on jet profiles and velocity gradients rather than total jet power.</description>

      <title>WALLABY Pilot Survey: Gas-Rich Galaxy Scaling Relations from Marginally-Resolved Kinematic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first set of galaxy scaling relations derived from kinematic models of the Widefield ASKAP L-band Legacy All-sky Blind surveY (WALLABY) pilot phase observations. Combining the results of the first and second pilot data releases, there are 236 available kinematic models. We develop a framework for robustly measuring HI disk structural properties from these kinematic models; applicable to the full WALLABY survey. Utilizing this framework, we obtained the HI size, a measure of the rotational velocity, and angular momentum for 148 galaxies. These comprise the largest sample of galaxy properties from an untargetted, uniformly observed and modelled HI survey to date. We study the neutral atomic Hydrogen (HI) size-mass, size-velocity, mass-velocity, and angular momentum-mass scaling relations. We calculate the slope, intercept, and scatter for these scaling relations and find that they are similar to those obtained from other HI surveys. We also obtain stellar masses for 92 of the 148 robustly measured galaxies using multiband photometry through the Dark Energy Sky Instrument Legacy Imaging Survey Data Release-10 images. We use a subset of 61 of these galaxies that have consistent optical and kinematic inclinations to examine the stellar and baryonic Tully Fisher relations, the gas fraction-disk stability and gas fraction-baryonic mass relations. These measurements and relations demonstrate the unprecedented resource that WALLABY will represent for resolved galaxy scaling relations in HI.</description>

      <title>MusE GAs FLOw and Wind (MEGAFLOW) XII. Rationale and design of a MgII survey of the cool circum-galactic medium with MUSE and UVES: The MEGAFLOW Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, rationale, properties and catalogs of the MusE Gas FLOw and Wind survey (MEGAFLOW), a survey of the cool gaseous halos of $z\sim1$ galaxies using low-ionization MgII absorption systems. The survey consists of 22 quasar fields selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) having multiple ($\geq3$) strong MgII absorption lines over the redshift range $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5$. Each quasar was observed with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph (UVES), for a total of 85~hr and 63~hr, respectively. The UVES data resulted in 127 MgII absorption lines over $0.25&lt;z&lt;1.6$, with a median rest-frame equivalent width (REW) $3\sigma$ limit of $\approx 0.05$~\AA. The MUSE data resulted in $\sim$2400 galaxies of which 1403 with redshift confidence ZCONF$&gt;1$, i.e. more than 60 galaxies per arcmin$^{2}$. They were identified using a dual detection algorithm based on both continuum and emission line objects. The achieved [OII] 50\%\ completeness is 3.7$\times 10^{-18}$ erg/s/cm$^2$ (corresponding to SFR$&gt;0.01$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z=1$) using realistic mock [OII] emitters and the 50\%\ completeness is $m_{F775W}\approx26$ AB magnitudes for continuum sources. We find that (i) the fraction of [OII] emitting galaxies which have no continuum is $\sim15$\%; (ii) the success rate in identifying at least one galaxy within 500 km/s and 100 kpc is $\approx90$\%\ for MgII absorptions with $W_r^{2796}\gtrsim0.5$~\AA; (iii) the mean number of galaxies per MgII absorption is $2.9\pm1.6$ within the MUSE field-of-view; (iv) of the 80 MgII systems at $0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5$, 40 (20) have 1 (2) galaxies within 100 kpc, respectively; (v) all but two host galaxies have stellar masses $M_\star&gt;10^9$ M$_\odot$, and star-formation rates $&gt;1$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approach for Estimating Magnetic Field Strength in Galaxy Clusters from Synchrotron Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a crucial role in various astrophysical processes within the intracluster medium, including heat conduction, cosmic ray acceleration, and the generation of synchrotron radiation. However, measuring magnetic field strength is typically challenging due to the limited availability of Faraday Rotation Measure sources. To address the challenge, we propose a novel method that employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) alongside synchrotron emission observations to estimate magnetic field strengths in galaxy clusters. Our CNN model is trained on either Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence simulations or MHD galaxy cluster simulations, which incorporate complex dynamics such as cluster mergers and sloshing motions. The results demonstrate that CNNs can effectively estimate magnetic field strengths with median uncertainties of approximately $0.22\mu$G, $0.01\mu$G, and $0.1\mu$G for $\beta = 100$, 200, and 500 conditions, respectively. Additionally, we have confirmed that our CNN model remains robust against noise and variations in viewing angles with sufficient training, ensuring reliable performance under a wide range of observational conditions. We compare the CNN approach with the traditional magnetic field strength estimates method that assumes equipartition between cosmic ray electron energy and magnetic field energy. Unlike the equipartition method, this CNN approach does not rely on the equipartition assumption, offering a new perspective for comparing traditional estimates and enhancing our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Revealing hidden structures in the Zone of Avoidance -- a blind MeerKAT HI Survey of the Vela Supercluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted the MeerKAT Vela Supercluster survey, named Vela$-$HI, to bridge the gap between the Vela SARAO MeerKAT Galactic Plane Survey (Vela$-$SMGPS, $-2^{\circ} \leq b \leq 1^{\circ}$), and optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the Vela Supercluster (hereafter Vela$-$OPT/NIR) at $|b| \gtrsim 7^{\circ}$. Covering coordinates from $263^{\circ} \leq \ell \leq 284^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ} \leq b \leq 6.2^{\circ}$ above, and $-6.7^{\circ} \leq b \leq -2^{\circ}$ below the Galactic Plane (GP), we sampled 667 fields spread across an area of ${\sim} \rm 242 ~deg^2$. With a beam size of ${\sim} 38'' \times 31''$, Vela$-$HI achieved a sensitivity of $\langle \rm rms \rangle = 0.74$ mJy beam$^{-1}$ at 44.3 km s$^{-1}$ velocity resolution over ${\sim}$67 hours of observations. We cataloged 719 galaxies, with only 211 (29%) previously documented in the literature, primarily through the HIZOA, 2MASX, and WISE databases. Among these known galaxies, only 66 had optical spectroscopic redshift information. We found marginal differences of less than one channel resolution for all galaxies in common between HIZOA and Vela$-$SMGPS, and a mean difference of $70 \pm 15$ km s$^{-1}$ between optical and HI velocities. Combining data from Vela$-$SMGPS, Vela$-$HI, and Vela$-$OPT/NIR confirmed the connection of the Hydra/Antlia filament across the GP and revealed a previously unknown diagonal wall at a heliocentric velocity range of $6500-8000$ km s$^{-1}$. Vela$-$HI reinforces the connection between the first wall at $18500-20000$ km s$^{-1}$ and the inner ZOA. The second wall seems to traverse the GP at $270^{\circ} \leq \ell \leq 279^{\circ}$, where it appears that both walls intersect, jointly covering the velocity range $18500-21500$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent metal ionization and the persistence of collisionally excited emission lines in the diffuse ionized gas of star forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our time-dependent hydrogen ionization simulations of diffuse ionized gas to include metals important for collisional cooling and diagnostic emission lines. The combination of heating from supernovae and time-dependent collisional and photoionization from midplane OB stars produces emission line intensities (and emission line ratios) that follow the trends observed in the Milky Way and other edge-on galaxies. The long recombination times in low density gas result in persistent large volumes of ions with high ionization potentials, such as O III and Ne III. In particular, the vertically extended layers of Ne III in our time-dependent simulations result in [Ne III] 15$\mu$m/[Ne II] 12$\mu$m emission line ratios in agreement with observations of the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. Simulations adopting ionization equilibrium do not allow for the persistence of ions with high ionization states and therefore cannot reproduce the observed emission lines from low density gas at high altitudes.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to understanding the link between supermassive black holes and host galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongest and most universal scaling relation between a supermassive black hole and its host galaxy is known as the $M_\bullet-\sigma$ relation, where $M_\bullet$ is the mass of the central black hole and $\sigma$ is the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This relation has been studied for decades and is crucial for estimating black hole masses of distant galaxies. However, recent studies suggest the potential absence of central black holes in some galaxies, and a significant portion of current data only provides upper limits for the mass. Here, we introduce a novel approach using a Bayesian hurdle model to analyze the $M_\bullet-\sigma$ relation across 244 galaxies. This model integrates upper mass limits and the likelihood of hosting a central black hole, combining logistic regression for black hole hosting probability with a linear regression of mass on $\sigma$. From the logistic regression, we find that galaxies with a velocity dispersion of $11$, $34$ and $126$ km/s have a $50$%, $90$% and $99$% probability of hosting a central black hole, respectively. Furthermore, from the linear regression portion of the model, we find that $M_\bullet \propto \sigma^{5.8}$, which is significantly steeper than the slope reported in earlier studies. Our model also predicts a population of under-massive black holes ($M_\bullet=10-10^5 M_\odot$) in galaxies with $\sigma \lesssim 127$ km/s and over-massive black holes ($M_\bullet \geq 1.8 \times 10^7$) above this threshold. This reveals an unexpected abundance of galaxies with intermediate-mass and ultramassive black holes, accessible to next-generation telescopes like the Extremely Large Telescope.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Neural Ratio and Posterior Estimators to Distributional Shifts for Population-Level Dark Matter Analysis in Strong Gravitational Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of Neural Ratio Estimators (NREs) and Neural Posterior Estimators (NPEs) to distributional shifts in the context of measuring the abundance of dark matter subhalos using strong gravitational lensing data. While these data-driven inference frameworks can be accurate on test data from the same distribution as the training sets, in real applications, it is expected that simulated training data and true observational data will differ in their distributions. We explore the behavior of a trained NRE and trained sequential NPEs to estimate the population-level parameters of dark matter subhalos from a large sample of images of strongly lensed galaxies with test data presenting distributional shifts within and beyond the bounds of the training distribution in the nuisance parameters (e.g., the background source morphology). While our results show that NREs and NPEs perform well when tested perfectly in distribution, they exhibit significant biases when confronted with slight deviations from the examples seen in the training distribution. This indicates the necessity for caution when applying NREs and NPEs to real astrophysical data, where high-dimensional underlying distributions are not perfectly known.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Tomography with the Gravitational Wave Background from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar timing arrays suggests the presence of a supermassive black hole binary population. Although the observed spectrum generally aligns with predictions from orbital evolution driven by gravitational wave emission in circular orbits, there is a discernible preference for a turnover at the lowest observed frequencies. This turnover could indicate a significant hardening phase, transitioning from early environmental influences to later stages predominantly influenced by gravitational wave emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. By analyzing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we assess how the gravitational wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile prior to disruption by binary ejections, accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. Our findings suggest a parsec-scale galactic center density around $10^6\,M_\odot/\textrm{pc}^3$ across most of the parameter space, offering insights into the environmental effects on black hole evolution and combined matter density near galaxy centers.</description>

      <title>Simulating Solar Neighborhood Brown Dwarfs I: The Luminosity Function Above and Below the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited the large-scale analysis of these objects to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, enabling the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand how they will look in upcoming surveys. In this work, we construct a synthetic population of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the cloudless Sonora Bobcat, hybrid SM08, and gravity-dependent hybrid Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models to the sample. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of brown dwarf parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>A shock crashing into confined dense circumstellar matter brightens the nascent SN 2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red supergiants may experience a short-lived period of episodic mass loss rather than steady winds before their core collapses, leading to dense circumstellar matter (CSM) close to core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Interaction of SN ejecta with such nearby CSM can generate additional radiation, appending to the cooling radiation from the shock breakout of the progenitor envelope, to brighten the nascent SN explosion. This phenomenon is conspicuous for SN 2023ixf as its V-band brightness showed a rapid increase of about three magnitudes from the first to the third day after the explosion, which is distinctive among type II SNe with flash ionized signatures. In this paper, we employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate the radiative diffusion process in the unshocked CSM. Considering a wide range of mass-loss rates from 10^-5 to 10^-2 Msun/yr, we found that the fast-rising light curve of SN 2023ixf can be fitted by the interaction of the SN ejecta with a CSM having a mass-loss rate of about 10^-2 Msun/yr located within 10^15 cm to the progenitor.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of Galactic Cepheids from long-baseline interferometry V. High-accuracy orbital parallax and mass of SU Cygni</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cepheid masses are particularly necessary to help solving the mass discrepancy, while independent distance determinations provide crucial test of the period-luminosity relation and Gaia parallaxes. We used CHARA/MIRC to measure the astrometric positions of the high-contrast companion orbiting the Cepheid SU Cygni. We also present new radial velocity measurements from the HST. The combination of interferometric astrometry with optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy provides the full orbital elements of the system, in addition to component masses and the distance to the Cepheid system. We measured the mass of the Cepheid, $M_A = 4.859\pm0.058M_\odot$, and its two companions, $M_{Ba} = 3.595 \pm 0.033 M_\odot$ and $M_{Bb} = 1.546 \pm 0.009 M_\odot$. This is the most accurate existing measurement of the mass of a Galactic Cepheid (1.2%). Comparing with stellar evolution models, we show that the mass predicted is higher than the measured mass of the Cepheid, similar to conclusions of our previous work. We also measured the distance to the system to be $926.3 \pm 5.0$pc, i.e. an unprecedented parallax precision of $6\mu$as (0.5%), being the most precise and accurate distance for a Cepheid. Such precision is similar to what is expected by Gaia for the last data release (DR5 in $\sim$ 2030) for single stars fainter than G = 13, but is not guaranteed for stars as bright as SU Cyg. We demonstrated that evolutionary models remain inadequate in accurately reproducing the measured mass, often predicting higher masses for the expected metallicity, even when factors such as rotation or convective core overshooting are taken into account. Our precise distance measurement allowed us to compare prediction period-luminosity relations. We found a disagreement of 0.2-0.5 mag with relations calibrated from photometry, while relations calibrated from direct distance measurement are in better agreement.</description>

      <title>CARMENES input catalogue of M dwarfs VIII. Kinematics in the solar neighbourhood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. Our goals are to characterise the kinematic properties and to identify young and old stars among the M dwarfs of the CARMENES input catalogue. Methods. We compiled the spectral types, proper motions, distances, and radial velocities for 2187 M dwarfs. We used the public code SteParKin to derive their galactic space velocities and identify members in the different galactic populations. We also identified candidate members in young stellar kinematic groups, with ages ranging from 1 Ma to 800 Ma with SteParKin, LACEwING, and BANYAN {\Sigma}. We removed known close binaries and perform an analysis of kinematic, rotation, and activity indicators (rotational periods and projected velocities, Halpha, X-rays, and UV emission) for 1546 M dwarfs. We defined five rotation-activity-colour relations satisfied by young ({\tau} &lt;= 800 Ma) stars. Results. We identified 191 young M dwarf candidates (~12%), 113 of which are newly recognised in this work. In this young sample, there are 118 very active stars based on H{\alpha} emission, fast rotation, and X-ray and UV emission excess. Of them, 27 have also strong magnetic fields, 9 of which are likely younger than 50 Ma. Additionally, there are 87 potentially young stars and 99 stars with a dubious youth classification, which may increase the fraction of young stars to an astounding 24%. Only one star out of the 2187 exhibits kinematics typical of the old Galactic halo. Conclusions. A combined analysis of kinematic and rotation-activity properties provides a robust method for identifying young M dwarfs from archival data. However, more observational efforts are needed to ascertain the true nature of numerous young star candidates in the field and, perhaps more importantly, to precisely quantify their age.</description>

Abstract: Mass loss through a stellar wind is an important physical process that steers the evolution of massive stars and controls the properties of their end-of-life products, such as the supernova type and the mass of compact remnants. For an accurate mass loss determination, the inhomogeneities in the wind, known as clumping, needs to be taking into account. We aim to improve empirical estimates of mass loss and wind clumping for hot main-sequence massive stars, study the dependence of both properties on the metallicity, and compare the theoretical predictions to our findings. We analyzed the optical and UV spectra of 13 O-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud galaxy, which has a metallicity of $\sim 0.2\,Z_\odot$. We quantified the stellar atmosphere, outflow, and wind-clumping properties. To probe the role of metallicity, we compared our findings to studies of Galactic and Large Magellanic Cloud samples that were analyzed with similar methods. We find significant variations in the wind-clumping properties of the target stars, with clumping starting at flow velocities $0.01 - 0.23$ of the terminal wind velocity and reaching clumping factors $f_{\rm cl} = 2 - 30$. In the luminosity ($\log L / L_{\odot} = 5.0 - 6.0$) and metallicity ($Z/Z_{\odot} = 0.2 - 1$) range we considered, we find that the scaling of the mass loss $\dot{M}$ with metallicity $Z$ varies with luminosity. At $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.75$, we find $\dot{M} \propto Z^m$ with $m = 1.02 \pm 0.30$, in agreement with pioneering work in the field. For lower luminosities, however, we obtain a significantly steeper scaling of $m &gt; 2$. The monotonically decreasing $m(L)$ behavior adds a complexity to the functional description of the mass-loss rate of hot massive stars. Although the trend is present in the predictions, it is much weaker than we found here.</description>

      <title>The Role of Thermal Instability in Accretion Outbursts in High-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-mass young stellar objects (HMYSOs) can exhibit episodic bursts of accretion, accompanied by intense outflows and luminosity variations.
  Thermal Instability (TI) due to Hydrogen ionisation is among the most promising mechanisms of episodic accretion in low mass ($M_*\lesssim 1M_{\odot}$) protostars. Its role in HMYSOs has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigate the properties of TI outbursts in young, massive ($M_*\gtrsim 5M_{\odot}$) stars, and compare them to those observed so far.
  Our simulations show that modelled TI bursts can replicate the durations and peak accretion rates of long (a few years to decades) outbursts observed in HMYSOs with similar mass characteristics. However, they struggle with short-duration (less than a year) bursts with short (a few weeks or months) rise times, suggesting the need for alternative mechanisms. Moreover, while our models match the durations of longer bursts, they fail to reproduce the multiple outbursts seen in some HMYSOs, regardless of model parameters. We also emphasise the significance of not just evaluating model accretion rates and durations, but also performing photometric analysis to thoroughly evaluate the consistency between model predictions and observational data.
  Our findings suggest that some other plausible mechanisms, such as gravitational instabilities and disc fragmentation can be responsible for generating the observed outburst phenomena in HMYSOs and underscore the need for further investigation into alternative mechanisms driving short outbursts.
  However, the physics of TI is crucial in sculpting the inner disc physics in the early bright epoch of massive star formation, and comprehensive parameter space exploration and the use of 2D modeling are essential for obtaining a more detailed understanding of the underlying physical processes.</description>

      <title>A Cigale module tailored (not only) for Low-Luminosity AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectral energy distribution (SED) of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) presents challenges due to their faint emissions and the complexity of their accretion processes. This study introduces a new CIGALE module tailored for LLAGN, combining the empirical $L_X$-$L_{12\mu m}$ relationship with physical models like advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and truncated accretion disks. This module yields a refined depiction of LLAGN emissions, and a mock analysis shows reliable parameter recovery, with only minor biases.
  We tested the module on a sample of 50 X-ray-detected local galaxies, including LINERs and Seyferts, where it demonstrated good estimation of bolometric luminosities, even in the presence of significant galaxy contamination. Notably, the previous X-ray module failed to provide AGN solutions for this sample, stressing the need for a novel approach. Comparisons with mid-luminosity AGN confirm the module's robustness and applicability to AGN up to $L_X$ &lt; $10^{45}$ erg/s. We also expanded the X-ray to bolometric correction formula, making it applicable to AGN spanning ten orders of magnitude in luminosity, and revealing lower $k_X$ values than typically assumed. Additionally, our analysis of the $\alpha_{ox}$ index, representing the slope between UV and X-ray emissions, uncovered trends that differ from those observed in high-luminosity AGN, suggesting a shift in accretion physics and photon production mechanisms in low-luminosity regimes.
  These results underscore the importance of a multiwavelength approach in AGN studies and reveal distinct behaviors in LLAGN compared to quasars. Our findings significantly advance the understanding of LLAGN and offer a comprehensive framework for future research aimed at completing the census of the AGN population.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Weak AGNs from Super-Eddington Accretion onto Infant Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple model for the X-ray weakness of JWST-selected broad-line AGNs is proposed under the assumption that the majority of these sources are fed at super-Eddington accretion rates. In these conditions, the hot inner corona above the geometrically thin disk that is responsible for the emission of X-rays in "normal" AGNs will be embedded instead in a funnel-like reflection geometry. The coronal plasma will Compton upscatter optical/UV photons from the underlying thick disk as well as the surrounding funnel walls, and the high soft-photon energy density will cool down the plasma to temperatures in the range 30-40 keV. The resulting X-ray spectra are predicted to be extremely soft, with power-law photon indices Gamma=2.8-4.0, making high-z super-Eddington AGNs largely undetectable by Chandra.</description>

We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar feedback through the AMUSE framework. We find that the binary fraction decreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries' orbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser, more massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the disruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction also decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O stars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous, indicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the cluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a by-product of hierarchical cluster assembly: most changes to the binary population take place when the star formation rate is high and there are frequent mergers between sub-clusters in the cluster-forming region. A universal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in the Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters with resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar masses could be explained by differences in their formation history.</description>

      <title>Semi-confined supernova feedback in HII region bubbles</title>

Abstract: Galactic-scale simulations rely on sub-grid models to provide prescriptions for the coupling between supernova (SN) feedback and the interstellar medium (ISM). Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way to account for the variability of properties of their local environment. However, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe within molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the presence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve cavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being partially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially through these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D descriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we present a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN expanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with pre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of energy release increases the local dynamical impact of the outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically coupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale solenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.</description>

      <title>Self-gravitating isothermal sphere in an expanding background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatially homogeneous thermal equilibria of self-gravitating gas, being impossible otherwise, are nevertheless allowed in an expanding background accounting for Universe's expansion. Furthermore, a fixed density at the boundary of a perturbation is a natural boundary condition keeping the mass finite inside without the need to invoke any unphysical walls. These facts allow us to develop a consistent gravitational thermodynamics of isothermal spheres inside an expanding Universe. In the canonical and grand canonical ensembles we identify an instability for both homogeneous and inhomogeneous equilibria. We discuss a potential astrophysical application. If such an instability is triggered on baryonic gas at high redshift $z &gt; 137$ when the primary baryonic component, namely atomic hydrogen, was still thermally locked to the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation, then the corresponding destabilized gaseous clouds have baryonic mass $\geq 0.8\cdot 10^5 {\rm M}_\odot$ and radius $\geq 15{\rm pc}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.01165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Herbig Ae/Be stars are young contracting stars on the radiative track in the HR diagram on their way to the main sequence. These stars provide a valuable link between high and low mass stars. Here we review the progress that has been made in our understanding of these fascinating objects and their disks since the last major review on this topic published in 1998. We begin with a general overview of these stars and their properties. We then discuss the accretion of circumstellar material onto these stars. Next we discuss the dust and gas properties of the circumstellar disk before exploring the evidence for planet formation in these disks. We conclude with a brief discussion of future prospects for deepening our understanding of these sources and propose a new working definition of Herbig Ae/Be stars.</description>

      <title>Inferring reionization and galaxy properties from the patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The patchy kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal is an integral probe of the timing and morphology of the epoch of reionization (EoR). Recent observations have claimed a low signal-to-noise (S/N) measurement, with a dramatic increase in S/N expected in the near future. In this work, we quantify what we can learn about the EoR from the kSZ signal. We perform Bayesian inference by sampling galaxy properties and using forward-models of the kSZ as well as other EoR and galaxy observations in the likelihood. Including the recent kSZ measurement obtained by the South Pole Telescope ($\mathcal{D}_{3000}^{\rm{pkSZ}} = 1.1_{-0.7}^{+1.1} \mu$K$^2$) shifts the posterior distribution in favor of faster and later reionization models, resulting in lower values of the optical depth to the CMB: $\tau_e = 0.052_{-0.008}^{+0.009}$ with a 68$\%$ confidence interval (C.I.). The combined EoR and UV luminosity function observations also imply a typical ionizing escape fraction of $0.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05}$ (95$\%$ C.I.), without a strong dependence on halo mass. We show how the patchy kSZ power from our posterior depends on the commonly-used parameters of reionization. For a given midpoint and duration, the EoR morphology only has a few percent impact on the patchy kSZ power in our posterior. However, a physical model is needed to obtain tight constraints from the current low S/N patchy kSZ measurement, as it allows us to take advantage of complimentary high-$z$ observations. Future high S/N detections of the patchy kSZ should decrease the current uncertainties on the timing of the EoR by factors of $\sim$2 - 3.</description>

      <title>Gleeok's Fire-breathing: Triple Flares of AT 2021aeuk within Five Years from the Active Galaxy SDSS J161259.83+421940.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a noteworthy transient AT 2021aeuk exhibiting three distinct optical flares between 2018 and 2023. It is hosted in a radio-loud narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy, with an optical image showing a minor tidal morphology and a red mid-infrared color W1-W2=1.1. Flares II and III exhibit rapid rises, and long-term decays (around 1000 days) with recurring after-peak bumps. The g-r color after subtracting the reference magnitude exhibited a rapid drop and recovery during Flare II, followed by the minor after-peak evolution in blue colors. We applied a canonical tidal disruption event (TDE) fitting on the light curves which gives a decay index p of $-2.99_{-0.14}^{+0.13}$ for Flare II and $-1.61_{-0.65}^{+0.34}$ for Flare III. The blackbody fitting shows lower temperatures ($\sim 10^{3.8}$K) with minor after-peak evolution. The blackbody radius ($\gtrsim 10^{16}\ \rm cm$) and luminosity ($\sim 10^{45}\rm erg\ s^{-1}$) are larger than the typical TDE sample's. The time lag (in rest frame) between ZTF g- and r-band ($\rm \tau_{g,r}=3.4^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$ days) significantly exceeds the prediction from the standard accretion disk. Pre-burst spectra reveal prominent Bowen fluorescence lines, indicating a vigorous or potentially long-lasting process that enriches the local metallicity. Additionally, we derived black hole masses of $\log\it{M}_{\bullet}\rm=7.09^{+0.18}_{-0.31}\ \it{M}_{\odot}$ and $\log\it{M}_{\bullet}\rm=7.52^{+0.08}_{-0.10}\ \it{M}_{\odot}$ using $\rm H\beta$ and $\rm H\alpha$ emission lines. The variation and recurring features of AT 2021aeuk are not likely induced by the radio-beaming effect or Type-II superluminous supernova (SLSN-II), however, we cannot rule out the possibility of TDE or enhanced active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion process. The unusually high occurrence of three flares within five years may also induced by the complex local environment.</description>

      <title>Clues in Bailey Diagrams Indicate that the Horizontal Branch Evolutionary Effect Is the Direct Reason for Oosterhoff Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noticing the potential relationship between the pulsation amplitude of fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars and their average effective temperatures, we derived the relation between them from observational data. Using these relationships, we present the zero-age horizontal branch lines and corresponding evolutionary tracks in the Bailey diagrams. We first find that the trends of zero-age horizontal branch lines are consistent with the distributions of Oosterhoff I RR Lyrae stars, and there is a period shift effect in relatively metal-rich samples ([Fe/H] &gt; -1). Main results show that evolutionary effects are the direct cause of the Oosterhoff dichotomy. The vast majority of Oosterhoff I RR Lyrae stars are in the early stage of horizontal branch evolution, while most of the Oosterhoff II stars are near the end of the horizontal branch phase. Our Bailey diagrams can intuitively explain some Oosterhoff phenomena (e.g., long-period RR Lyrae stars in the metal-rich globular clusters NGC 6388 and NGC 6441), and also have the potential to become an important tool for in-depth study of RR Lyrae stars. Further research is needed on the Oosterhoff dichotomy to explore the formations and evolutionary processes of the Milky Way and its substructures.</description>

      <title>Spectro-Photometry and Radial Distribution of Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters from Gaia XP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs) represents a challenge for stellar population studies. Nevertheless, the outermost cluster regions, likely to hold clues about the initial configuration of GC stars, remain underexplored. We use synthetic spectra reflecting the chemical compositions of first- and second-population (1P, 2P) stars in 47Tucanae to identify spectral regions sensitive to these populations. This led us to define new photometric bands that effectively distinguish 1P and 2P giant stars using Gaia XP spectra. Testing these filters, we constructed the pseudo two-color diagrams dubbed chromosome maps (ChMs) and, for the first time, identified 1P and 2P stars in the cluster's outermost regions and beyond its tidal radius. We constructed similar diagrams for NGC3201, NGC6121, NGC6752, and NGC6397, thus exploring GCs with different metallicities. The ChMs effectively distinguished multiple populations in the outer regions of all clusters, except for the metal-poor NGC6397. Our findings, together with literature results from more-internal regions, show that the 2P stars of 47Tucanae are more-centrally concentrated than the 1P. A similar pattern is seen for 2P stars with extreme chemical composition of NGC3201. The multiple populations of NGC6121, and NGC6752 share the same radial distributions. These radial behaviors are consistent with the GC formation scenarios where 2P stars originate in the central regions. Noticeably, results on NGC3201 are in tension with the conclusion from recent work that its 1P is more centrally concentrated than the 2P and might form with more central concentration.</description>

      <title>AstroMLab 1: Who Wins Astronomy Jeopardy!?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of proprietary and open-weights large language models using the first astronomy-specific benchmarking dataset. This dataset comprises 4,425 multiple-choice questions curated from the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, covering a broad range of astrophysical topics. Our analysis examines model performance across various astronomical subfields and assesses response calibration, crucial for potential deployment in research environments. Claude-3.5-Sonnet outperforms competitors by up to 4.6 percentage points, achieving 85.0% accuracy. For proprietary models, we observed a universal reduction in cost every 3-to-12 months to achieve similar score in this particular astronomy benchmark. open-weights models have rapidly improved, with LLaMA-3-70b (80.6%) and Qwen-2-72b (77.7%) now competing with some of the best proprietary models. We identify performance variations across topics, with non-English-focused models generally struggling more in exoplanet-related fields, stellar astrophysics, and instrumentation related questions. These challenges likely stem from less abundant training data, limited historical context, and rapid recent developments in these areas. This pattern is observed across both open-weights and proprietary models, with regional dependencies evident, highlighting the impact of training data diversity on model performance in specialized scientific domains. Top-performing models demonstrate well-calibrated confidence, with correlations above 0.9 between confidence and correctness, though they tend to be slightly underconfident. The development for fast, low-cost inference of open-weights models presents new opportunities for affordable deployment in astronomy. The rapid progress observed suggests that LLM-driven research in astronomy may become feasible in the near future.</description>

      <title>A tell-tale tracer for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks: comparing the [CI] 8727 A line and ALMA observations in proplyds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of disks. These winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star forming-regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O i] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i] 8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i] lines are well detected in all these targets, there is &lt;&lt;10% detection rate in the case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a ~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation. The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-tale tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>
