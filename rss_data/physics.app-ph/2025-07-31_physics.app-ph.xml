      <title>On the efficiency roll-off in Perovskite Light Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report a comprehensive modeling framework to unravel the efficiency roll-off in Perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs). Our model self-consistently accounts for a positive feedback mechanism which involves diverse phenomena like temperature-dependent carrier recombination, space charge effects, Joule heating, and thermal transport. Model predictions compare well with experimental results such as dark current-voltage characteristics and efficiency as well as radiance roll-off under high injection conditions. This work identifies key performance limiting phenomena in current state-of-the-art PeLEDs and could be of broad relevance towards device optimization, thermal design, packaging, and operational lifetime.</description>

      <title>Ambiguity-Aware Segmented Estimation of Mutual Coupling in Large RIS: Algorithm and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing a real-life RIS-parametrized wireless channel with a physics-consistent multiport-network model necessitates prior remote estimation of the mutual coupling (MC) between RIS elements. The number of MC parameters grows quadratically with the number of RIS elements, posing scalability challenges. Because of inevitable ambiguities, independently estimated segments of the MC matrix cannot be easily stitched together. Here, by carefully handling the ambiguities, we achieve a separation of the full estimation problem into three sequentially treated sets of smaller problems. We partition the RIS elements into groups. First, we estimate the MC for one group as well as the characteristics of the available loads. Second, we separately estimate the MC for each of the remaining groups, in each case with partial overlap with an already characterized group. Third, we separately estimate the MC between each distinct pair of groups. Full parallelization is feasible within the second and third sets of problems, and the third set of problems can furthermore benefit from efficient initialization. We experimentally validate our algorithm for a 4x4 MIMO channel parametrized by a 100-element RIS inside a rich-scattering environment. Our experimentally calibrated 5867-parameter multiport-network model achieves an accuracy of 40.5 dB, whereas benchmark models with limited or no MC awareness only reach 17.0 dB and 13.8 dB, respectively. Based on the experimentally calibrated models, we optimize the RIS for five wireless performance indicators. Experimental measurements with the optimized RIS configurations demonstrate only moderate benefits of MC awareness in RIS optimization in terms of the achieved performance. However, we observe that limited or no MC awareness markedly erodes the reliability of model-based predictions of the expected performance.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5x10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in low lunar orbits, at the Earth-Moon L1 point and in near-rectilinear halo orbits. Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are required to achieve 5x10^{-18} fractional stability, supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation in cislunar space. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>Understanding the fill-factor limit of organic solar cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the power conversion efficiencies of organic solar cells (OSCs) have surpassed 20%, they still lag behind commercial inorganic solar cells and emerging perovskite solar cells. To bridge this efficiency gap, improving the fill factor (FF) is critical, provided other photovoltaic parameters are not compromised. However, the fundamental understanding of the FF in OSCs remains incomplete. In this work, we systematically investigate a wide range of OSCs with the FF values spanning 0.27 to 0.80, and analyse the effect of free charge generation and recombination on the FF in OSCs. To explain our observations, we developed an analytical model that quantitatively correlates the applied electric field with the energetics of excited states in donor-acceptor blends. By combining device characterisation, spectroscopy, and theoretical modelling, we reveal that the Stark effect and the field-dependent charge transfer significantly impact the FF in state-of-the-art OSCs with low voltage losses. Our findings highlight that suppressing geminate decay by increasing exciton lifetime is a promising strategy for boosting the FF and achieving future efficiency gains in OSCs.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Faraday Rotation Probe of Chiral Phonon-Polaritons in LiNbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time reversal symmetry breaking motion of chiral phonon-polaritons in LiNbO3 is probed via the ultrafast Faraday effect. By combining a pair of perpendicularly polarized THz pulses with the right relative delay, we create a chiral THz driving field to excite chiral phonon-polaritons. The chiral atomic motion combines with the inverse Faraday effect from the circularly polarized THz pump to induce a magnetic moment field in the nonmagnetic material, LiNbO3. We attempt to quantify the strength of the magnetic field with Faraday rotation probe measurements. The direction of the Faraday signal flips when the input THz pulse is changed from left- to right-circular polarization, and we estimate a strong induced magnetic field strength of ~11 Tesla based on the Faraday rotation.</description>

      <title>Strain effects on the fluctuation properties in noncollinear antiferromagnets: a first-principles and macrospin-based study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of epitaxial strain effects on the magnetic fluctuation properties of Mn$_3$Sn noncollinear antiferromagnets. Employing density functional theory (DFT), we uncover significant strain-induced modifications to key magnetic parameters, including magnetic anisotropy and both bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions. Our findings reveal that the biquadratic exchange, often neglected, plays a crucial role in defining the magnetic energy landscape and its response to strain. These microscopic changes directly impact the energy barriers governing magnetic switching, thereby influencing thermal stability and fluctuation rates. Using macrospin-based simulations based on DFT-derived parameters, we provide a quantitative analysis of the macroscopic magnetic fluctuations influenced by these microscopic interactions. These insights are particularly relevant for applications requiring precisely controlled magnetic behavior, such as hardware for probabilistic computing.</description>

      <title>NeOTF: Speckle-Constrained OTF Neural Representation for Non-invasive Imaging through Scattering Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22328v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaging through scattering media via speckle correlation is fundamentally challenged by ill-posed reconstruction. To overcome this, we bypass direct object recovery and instead target the system's deterministic optical transfer function (OTF). We introduce NeOTF, a framework that learns an implicit neural representation of the OTF. By optimizing this representation using multi-frame speckle intensities and a physical Fourier-domain prior, NeOTF robustly retrieves the system's OTF. Subsequent deconvolution with this retrieved OTF yields high-fidelity object reconstructions. Both simulations and experiments demonstrate that NeOTF achieves superior accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time scattering imaging.</description>

      <title>Enhancing interfacial thermal conductance in Si/Diamond heterostructures by phonon bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the mechanism of enhancing interfacial thermal transport performance in Silicon/Diamond (Si/Diamond) heterostructures using the phonon bridge. A heat transfer model for three-layer heterostructures is developed by combining First-principles calculations with the Monte Carlo method. The temperature distribution, spectral heat conductance, and interfacial thermal conductance are compared for Si/Diamond heterostructures with and without a silicon carbide (SiC) interlayer. The results show that the SiC interlayer effectively bridges low-frequency phonons in Si with mid-to-high-frequency phonons in Diamond, which forms a specific phonon bridge, significantly improving interfacial phonon transport. The influence of SiC interlayer thickness is further studied, revealing a size-dependent phonon bridge enhancement. For thin interlayers, intensified phonon boundary scattering weakens the bridging effect. Conversely, excessively thick interlayers increase the bulk thermal resistance, reducing overall interfacial thermal conductance. Thus, an optimal interlayer thickness exists, identified as 40 nm for SiC. Thirteen candidate interlayer materials, including SiC, AlN, {\alpha}-Si3N4, \b{eta}-Si3N4, and AlxGa1-xN (x ranges from 0.1 to 0.9), are compared at various thicknesses. SiC emerges as the most effective interlayer material, increasing interfacial thermal conductance by 46.6% compared to the bilayer heterostructure. AlN ranks second, improving thermal conductance by 21.9%. These findings provide essential insights into the phonon bridge mechanism at heterogeneous interface thermal transport and offer valuable theoretical guidance for designing heterostructures with enhanced thermal transport performance.</description>

      <title>Vortex Pinning in Niobium covered by a thin polycrystalline Gold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to its superconducting properties, Niobium (Nb) is an excellent candidate material for superconducting electronics and applications in quantum technology. Here we perform scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments on Nb films covered by a thin gold (Au) film. We investigate the minigap structure of the proximitized region and provide evidence for a highly transparent interface between Nb and Au, beneficial for device applications. Imaging of Abrikosov vortices in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field is reported. The data show vortex pinning by the granular structure of the polycrystalline Au film. Our results show robust and homogeneous superconducting properties of thin Nb film in the presence of a gold capping layer. The Au film not only protects the Nb from surface oxidation but also preserves its excellent superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Optically Actuated Transitions in Multimodal, Bistable Micromechanical Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a new class of optomechanical nonlinearities in weakly damped micromechanical resonators, arising from the interplay between the Duffing nonlinearity, intermodal coupling, and thermal fluctuations. Within the bistable regime of a single Duffing mode driven by radiation pressure forces, we observe stochastically generated sidebands, originating from thermal fluctuations around equilibrium trajectories in phase space, and exploit these sidebands to induce probabilistic transitions between bistable states using weak secondary acoustic excitation. Extending this framework to multimodal interactions, we show that nonlinear modes coupling within the same resonator leads to similar transitions due to parametric modulation around the noise-excited sidebands as a result of frequency mixing. Simultaneously, abrupt changes in displacements of modes cause their instantaneous energy exchange rates to span five orders of magnitude. These findings open new avenues for reconfigurable optomechanical networks, nonreciprocal energy transport, and precision sensing based on dynamically tunable mechanical nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Cation Engineering of Cu-Doped CsPbI3: Lead Substitution and Dimensional Reduction for Improved Scintillation Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystals show promising contributions in emerging luminescent materials due to their high tolerance to defects. In particular, the development of cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) has shown its efficiency for light-harvesting properties. However, further implementation is hindered due to the toxicity of the lead content. Therefore, in this study, we introduced Cu atoms to partially substitute Pb atoms (5% Cu) in the CsPbI3 lattice as a solution to reduce Pb toxicity. A partial lead material is substituted using Cu displays a larger Stokes shift (-67 nm) compared to the pristine, and resulted doped CsPbI3 not undergo the undesired self absorption. An outcome is focused on the champion of fast-component (tau_1) decay time ~0.6 ns. Temperature-dependent radioluminescence outlines an incremental change in the emission intensity is marginally centered at 713 +- 16 nm, which indicates Cu-doped CsPbI3 is not greatly affected by temperature. In addition, we report that the light yield (LY) pristine CsPbI3 after doping is increased to 3.0 +- 0.8 photons/keV. Our work provides physical insights into a tunable scintillation property using transition metal doping toward lead-free based scintillating perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining the highest quality and output of photon science in the VUV-, EUV-, soft- and tender-X-ray energy ranges requires high-quality blazed profile gratings. Currently, their availability is critical due to technological challenges and limited manufacturing resources. In this work we discuss the opportunity of an alternative method to manufacture blazed gratings by means of electron-beam lithography (EBL). We investigate the different parameters influencing the optical performance of blazed profile gratings produced by EBL and develop a robust process for the manufacturing of high-quality blazed gratings using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as high resolution, positive tone resist and ion beam etching.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication of the first 24-mode universal photonic processor (UPP) realized through femtosecond laser writing (FLW), marking the most complex UPP demonstrated to date. Optimized for quantum dot emission at 925 nm, the device exhibits total insertion losses averaging only 4.35 dB, enabling its direct application in advanced multi-photon quantum experiments. Leveraging the versatility of FLW, we introduce suspended waveguides and precisely engineered 2D and 3D microstructures, significantly enhancing thermal isolation and minimizing power dissipation. As a result, our processor operates efficiently at less than 10 W, requiring only a simple thermo-electric cooler for stable thermal management. The device exhibits exceptional performance after calibration, implementing Haar-random unitary transformations with an amplitude fidelity of 99.7 %. This work establishes FLW-based integrated photonics as a scalable and robust platform for advancing quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, we provide a practical guide on protection of superconducting quantum circuits from broadband electromagnetic and infrared-radiation noise by using cryogenic shielding and filtering of microwave lines. Recently, superconducting multi-qubit processors demonstrated quantum supremacy and quantum error correction below the surface code threshold. However, the decoherence-induced loss of quantum information still remains a challenge for more than 100 qubit quantum computing. Here, we review the key aspects of superconducting quantum circuits protection from stray electromagnetic fields and infrared radiation, namely, multilayer shielding design, materials, filtering of the fridge lines and attenuation, cryogenic setup configurations, and methods for shielding efficiency evaluation developed over the last 10 years. In summary, we make recommendations for creation of an efficient and compact shielding system as well as microwave filtering for a large-scale superconducting quantum systems.</description>
