      <title>In-situ Measurements of Dark Photon Dark Matter using Parker Solar Probe: Going beyond the Radio Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photon dark matter emerges as a compelling candidate for ultralight bosonic dark matter, detectable through resonant conversion into photons within a plasma environment. This study employs in-situ measurements from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), the first spacecraft to venture into the solar corona, to probe for DPDM signatures. The PSP in-situ measurements go beyond the traditional radio window, spanning frequencies between about 10 kHz and 20 MHz, a challenging range inaccessible to Earth-based radio astronomy. Additionally, the proximity of PSP to the resonant conversion location enhances the signal flux, providing a distinct advantage over ground-based observations. As a result, the PSP data establishes the most stringent constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ for DPDM frequencies between 70 kHz and 20 MHz, with values of $\epsilon \lesssim 10^{-14}-10^{-13}$. Investigating the data from STEREO satellites resulted in weaker constraints compared to those obtained from PSP. By utilizing state-of-the-art solar observations from space, we have surpassed the cosmic microwave background limits established in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Solar wind data analysis aided by synthetic modeling: a better understanding of plasma-frame variations from temporal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-situ measurements of the solar wind, a turbulent and anisotropic plasma flow originating at the Sun, are mostly carried out by single spacecraft, resulting in one-dimensional time series. The conversion of these measurements to the spatial frame of the plasma is a great challenge, but required for direct comparison of the measurements with MHD turbulence theories. Here we present a toolkit, based on the synthetic modeling of solar wind fluctuations as two-dimensional noise maps with adjustable spectral and power anisotropy, that can help with the temporal-spatial conversion of real data. Specifically, by following the spacecraft trajectory through a noise map (relative velocity and angle relative to some mean magnetic field) with properties tuned to mimic those of the solar wind, the likelihood that the temporal data fluctuations represent parallel or perpendicular fluctuations in the plasma frame can be quantified by correlating structure functions of the noise map. Synthetic temporal data can also be generated, which can provide a testing ground for analysis applied to the solar wind data. We demonstrate this tool by investigating Parker Solar Probe's E7 trajectory and data, and showcase several possible ways in which it can be used. We find that whether temporal variations in the spacecraft frame come from parallel or perpendicular variations in the plasma frame strongly depends on the spectral and power anisotropy of the measured wind. Data analysis assisted by such underlying synthetic models as presented here could open up new ways to interpret measurements in the future, specifically in the more reliable determination of plasma frame quantities from temporal measurements.</description>

      <title>Future Prospects for Partially Ionised Solar Plasmas: the Prominence Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially ionised plasmas (PIP) constitute an essential ingredient of our plasma universe. Historically, the physical effects associated with partial ionisation were considered in astrophysical topics such as the interstellar medium, molecular clouds, accretion disks and, later on, in solar physics. PIP can be found in layers of the Sun's atmosphere as well as in solar structures embedded within it. As a consequence, the dynamical behaviour of these layers and structures is influenced by the different physical effects introduced by partial ionisation.
  Here, rather than considering an exhaustive discussion of partially ionised effects in the different layers and structures of the solar atmosphere, we focus on solar prominences. The reason is that they represent a paradigmatic case of a partially ionised solar plasma, confined and insulated by the magnetic field, constituting an ideal environment to study the effects induced by partial ionisation. We present the current knowledge about the effects of partial ionisation in the global stability, mass cycle and dynamics of solar prominences. We revise the identified observational signatures of partial ionisation in prominences. We conclude with prospects for PIP research in prominences, proposing the path for advancing in the prominence modelling and theory and using new and upcoming instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator for Accelerating Coronal Magnetic Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the sun's outer atmosphere is challenging due to its complex magnetic fields impacting solar activities. Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations help model these interactions but are extremely time-consuming (usually on a scale of days). Our research applies the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to accelerate the coronal magnetic field modeling, specifically, the Bifrost MHD model. We apply Tensorized FNO (TFNO) to generate solutions from partial differential equations (PDEs) over a 3D domain efficiently. TFNO's performance is compared with other deep learning methods, highlighting its accuracy and scalability. Physics analysis confirms that TFNO is reliable and capable of accelerating MHD simulations with high precision. This advancement improves efficiency in data handling, enhances predictive capabilities, and provides a better understanding of magnetic topologies.</description>

      <title>Magneto-inertial range dominated by magnetic helicity in space plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.03524v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magneto-inertial range dominated by magnetic helicity has been studied using results of numerical simulations, laboratory measurements, solar, solar wind, the Earth's and planets' magnetosphere observations (spacecraft measurements), and the global magnetic observatory network. The spectral data have been compared with the theoretical results based on the distributed chaos notion in the frames of the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology. The transition from magnetohydrodynamics to kinetics in the electron and Hall magnetohydrodynamics, and in a fully kinetic 3D approach, as well as in the solar wind, solar photosphere, and at the special events (reconnections, Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, isolated flux tube interchanges, etc.) in the magnetosphere of Earth, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury has been studied using the above-mentioned data. Despite the considerable differences in the physical parameters and scales, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the observational data in the frames of the magneto-inertial range notion. Temporal variability of the magnetic field at Earth's surface under the influence of the ionosphere, magnetosphere, and solar wind has been also briefly discussed in this context.</description>

      <title>A Computational Model for Ion and Electron Energization during Macroscale Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of equations are developed that extend the macroscale magnetic reconnection simulation model kglobal to include particle ions. The extension from earlier versions of kglobal, which included only particle electrons, requires the inclusion of the inertia of particle ions in the fluid momentum equation, which was not required in the electron-only model. The new equations will facilitate the exploration of the simultaneous non-thermal energization of ions and electrons during magnetic reconnection in macroscale systems. Numerical tests of the propagation of Alfv\'en waves in a plasma with anisotropic electron and ion pressure are presented to benchmark the new model.</description>
