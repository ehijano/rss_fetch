      <title>Improved high-gradient performance for medium-velocity superconducting half-wave resonators: Surface preparation and trapped flux mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A development effort to improve the performance of superconducting radio-frequency half-wave resonators (SRF HWRs) is underway at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), where 220 such resonators are in operation. Our goal was to achieve an intrinsic quality factor (Q0) of &gt;= 2E10 at an accelerating gradient (Ea) of 12 MV/m. FRIB production resonators were prepared with buffered chemical polishing (BCP). First trials on electropolishing (EP) and post-EP low temperature baking (LTB) of FRIB HWRs allowed us to reach higher gradient (15 MV/m, limited by quench) with a higher quality factor at high gradient, but Q0 was still below our goal. Trapped magnetic flux during the Dewar test was found to be a source of Q0 reduction. Three strategies were used to reduce the trapped flux: (i) adding a local magnetic shield (LMGS) to supplement the ``global'' magnetic shield around the Dewar for reduction of the ambient magnetic field; (ii) performing a ``uniform cool-down'' (UC) to reduce the thermoelectric currents; and (iii) using a compensation coil to further reduce the ambient field with active field cancellation (AFC). The LMGS improved the Q0, but not enough to reach our goal. With UC and AFC, we exceeded our goal, reaching Q0 = 2.8E10 at Ea = 12 MV/m.</description>

      <title>First Observation of Dispersive Shock Waves in an Electron Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersive shock waves (DSWs) are expanding nonlinear wave trains that arise when dispersion regularizes a steepening front, a phenomenon observed in fluids, plasmas, optics, and superfluids. Here we report the first experimental observation of DSWs in an intense electron beam, using the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER). A localized induction-cell perturbation produced a negative density pulse that evolved into a leading soliton-like peak followed by an expanding train of oscillations. The leading peak satisfied soliton scaling laws for width^2 vs inverse amplitude and velocity vs amplitude, while the total wave-train width increased linearly with time, consistent with Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) predictions. Successive peaks showed decreasing amplitude and velocity toward the trailing edge, in agreement with dispersive shock ordering. These results demonstrate that intense charged particle beams provide a new laboratory platform for studying dispersive hydrodynamics, extending nonlinear wave physics into the high-intensity beam regime.</description>

      <title>Acceleration gradients in dielectric laser accelerators with triangular-shaped gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study investigated transparent on-chip structures with a rectangular profile and triangular profiles with grating ridge base angles of $\alpha = 36^\circ$, $30^\circ$, and $20^\circ$. Each triangular structure had both left- and right-handed profile orientations. For all variants, a modified version with a reflective gold coating was additionally considered. The maximum energy gains and accelerating gradients were determined and quantified for all structure classes: transparent and reflective (with both rectangular and triangular profiles).</description>

      <title>Improving Optics Control and Measurement at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to aid in luminosity maximization at the interaction point (IP), the collision location $s_{IP}$ must be equivalent to the location of the minimum value of the beta function $s^*$. Accurate optics measurements and $s^*$ movements are therefore essential to luminosity optimization. However, according to current Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) operations measurements, average horizontal beta beat measurements between operating IPs are around $20\%$ along with significant variation in $s^*$ measurements. A sensitivity matrix was shown to successfully move $s^*$ and the linear optics to their desired values using power supply currents at the 8 o'clock interaction region (IR8). A method to measure the linear optics using the one-turn map within IRs was explored and compared with other mature methods. An error analysis was also included for all optics measurements methods. Through these methods, a $10\%$ beat reduction was consistently achieved while moving $s^*_x$ as well significant improvement to variations in $s^*$ measurements. These methods used at the RHIC control room will be updated for future linear optics analysis and control.</description>

      <title>Influence of an external static magnetic field on prebreakdown electron emission and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL is upgrading several LLRF systems for its Linac and Sub-Harmonic Bunchers, where it is desired to have a unified LLRF system design to support various RF frequencies (at 125MHz, 500MHz and 3GHz) and configurations. This paper demonstrates an open-source, direct sampling RFSoC based LLRF system design, featuring: sample-to-sample Multi-Tile Synchronization, deterministic latency, digital up/down conversion, arbitrary waveform generation and acquisition, in-pulse closed loop control, timing and EPICS integration, modular RF frontend and hardware designs. Measured RF characteristics show that the RFSoC based LLRF system is able to meet the system requirements.</description>

      <title>Simulation of surface x-ray emission from the ASTERICS ECR ion source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The bremsstrahlung x-ray emission induced by the impact of plasma electrons de-confined on the chamber wall of the ASTERICS electron cyclotron resonance ion source is investigated through a suite of two simulation codes. The electron high energy temperature distribution tail at the wall is found to be anisotropic and increases with Bmin. The electrons impinge the walls with broad angular distribution peaking at angles ranging between 5-25{\deg} with respect to the surface, which has consequences on the x-ray emission directionality and on the yield of electrons bouncing back toward the plasma, reaching up to 50%. The x-ray dose is mapped inside and around the ion source for Bmin = 0.8 T and an electron temperature artificially increased to 120 keV to dimension with margin the cave shielding. The dose without shielding reaches 100 $\mu$Sv/h per kW of impacting electrons at 5 m. A set of internal and external shielding is presented to attenuate this dose and reduce it to less than 1 $\mu$Sv/h per kW of electrons. A parametric electron distribution temperature study with Fluka indicates that the deposition of 1 W of heat in the superconducting cold mass per kW of plasma electrons, as reported experimentally, is obtained when the temperature is set to 380 keV. Such a result is compatible with previous experiments achieved on several ion sources showing an x-ray spectral temperature 3 to 4 times higher radially.</description>
