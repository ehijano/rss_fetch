      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorems and generalizations in long-range interacting systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a unified fashion, we establish Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorems and their generalizations in systems with long-range interactions. We show that, for a quantum spin chain, if the interactions decay fast enough as their ranges increase and the Hamiltonian has an anomalous symmetry, the Hamiltonian cannot have a unique gapped symmetric ground state. If the Hamiltonian contains only 2-spin interactions, these theorems hold when the interactions decay faster than $1/r^2$, with $r$ the distance between the two interacting spins. Moreover, any pure state with an anomalous symmetry, which may not be a ground state of any natural Hamiltonian, must be long-range entangled. The symmetries we consider include on-site internal symmetries combined with lattice translation symmetries, and they can also extend to purely internal but non-on-site symmetries. Moreover, these internal symmetries can be discrete or continuous. We explore the applications of the theorems through various examples.</description>

      <title>Arresting Quantum Chaos Dynamically in Transmon Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergodic quantum many-body systems evolving under unitary time dynamics typically lose memory of their initial state via information scrambling. Here we consider a paradigmatic translationally invariant many-body Hamiltonian of interacting bosons -- a Josephson junction array in the transmon regime -- in the presence of a strong Floquet drive. Generically, such a time-dependent drive is expected to heat the system to an effectively infinite temperature, featureless state in the late-time limit. However, using numerical exact-diagonalization we find evidence of special ratios of the drive amplitude and frequency where the system develops {\it emergent} conservation laws, and {\it approximate} integrability. Remarkably, at these same set of points, the Lyapunov exponent associated with the semi-classical dynamics for the coupled many-body equations of motion drops by orders of magnitude, arresting the growth of chaos. We supplement our numerical results with an analytical Floquet-Magnus expansion that includes higher-order corrections, and capture the slow dynamics that controls decay away from exact freezing.</description>

      <title>Realizing triality and $p$-ality by lattice twisted gauging in (1+1)d quantum spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the twisted gauging on the (1+1)d lattice and construct various non-local mappings on the lattice operators. To be specific, we define the twisted Gauss law operator and implement the twisted gauging of the finite group on the lattice motivated by the orbifolding procedure in the conformal field theory, which involves the data of non-trivial element in the second cohomology group of the gauge group. We show the twisted gauging is equivalent to the two-step procedure of first applying the SPT entangler and then untwisted gauging. We use the twisted gauging to construct the triality (order 3) and $p$-ality (order $p$) mapping on the $\mathbb{Z}_p\times \mathbb{Z}_p$ symmetric Hamiltonians, where $p$ is a prime. Such novel non-local mappings generalize Kramers-Wannier duality and they preserve the locality of symmetric operators but map charged operators to non-local ones. We further construct quantum process to realize these non-local mappings and analyze the induced mappings on the phase diagrams. For theories that are invariant under these non-local mappings, they admit the corresponding non-invertible symmetries. The non-invertible symmetry will constrain the theory at the multicritical point between the gapped phases. We further give the condition when the non-invertible symmetry can have symmetric gapped phase with a unique ground state.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis Theorem with Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem in $d$-dimensional spin systems exhibiting $SO(3)$ spin rotation and lattice translation symmetries in the presence of interactions decaying as $\sim 1/r^\alpha$ with distance $r$. Two types of Hamiltonians are considered: Type I comprises long-range spin-spin couplings, while Type II features long-range couplings between $SO(3)$ symmetric local operators. For spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems, it is shown that Type I cannot have a unique ground state with a nonzero excitation gap when the interaction decays sufficiently fast, i.e., when $\alpha&gt;\max(3d,4d-2)$. For Type II, the condition becomes $\alpha&gt;\max(3d-1,4d-3)$. In $1d$, this ingappability condition is improved to $\alpha&gt;2$ for Type I and $\alpha&gt;0$ for Type II by examining the energy of a state with a uniform $2\pi$ twist. Notably, in $2d$, a Type II Hamiltonian with van der Waals interaction is subject to the constraint of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Revealing Quadrupolar Excitations with Non-Linear Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local moments with a spin $S&gt;1/2$ can exhibit a rich variety of elementary quasiparticle excitations, such as quadrupolar excitations, that go beyond the dipolar magnons of conventional spin-$1/2$ systems. However, the experimental observation of such quadrupolar excitations is often challenging due to the dipolar selection rules of many linear response probes, rendering them invisible. Here we show that non-linear spectroscopy, in the form of two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS), can be used to reveal quadrupolar excitations. Considering a family of spin-1 Heisenberg ferromagnets with single-ion easy-axis anisotropy as an example, we explicitly calculate their 2DCS signature by combining exact diagonalization and generalized spin wave theory. We further demonstrate that 2DCS can provide access to the quadrupolar weight of an excitation, analogous to how linear response provides access to the dipolar weight. Our work highlights the potential of non-linear spectroscopy as a powerful tool to diagnose multipolar excitations in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Spin chirality engineering induced giant topological Hall effect in a kagome magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferrimagnet TbMn6Sn6 has attracted vast attention, because its pristine Mn kagome lattice with strong spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane Tb-Mn exchange supports quantum-limit Chern topological magnetism which can be described by the simple spinless Haldane model. We unveil herein that engineering the pristine kagome lattice through partial replacement of Mn by nonmagnetic Cr which tends to concentrate into the single Mn1 layer in a unit cell breaks the collinear configuration of Mn spins and reduces the D6h point group symmetry to the C2 one. The nearly isolated Tb networks result in easily polarized Tb spins even under a weak magnetic field, and simultaneously, different spin chirality of the Tb-Mn1-Mn1 and Mn1-Mn1-Mn1. Such a peculiar spin structure leads to a plateau-like topological Hall effect with a record resistivity of 19.1 {\mu}Ohm cm among bulk systems. Our direct visualization of the domain-wall structure and its evolution under external magnetic field fully support the picture, thus highlighting the pivotal role of broken kagome lattice symmetry in generating the peculiar spin chirality in real space. Our results set a paradigm for exploration of exotic properties in kagome topological magnets and would be a proof-of-principle strategy for investigating the correlation between magnetism and exotic topological properties in kagome lattice.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-dimensional ferromagnetism in the triangular magnet EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report ferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm {C}=1.3\,$K in the quasi-two dimensional magnet EuAl$_{12}$O$_{19}$ with large spins $S=7/2$. This ferromagnetic state was characterized by magnetization and specific heat measurements and the experimental results were compared with classical Monte Carlo simulations. They reveal a strong single ion anisotropy leading to an uniaxial spontaneous magnetization along the $c$ axis. Furthermore the application of a magnetic field in the hard magnetization plane $ab$ reduces the Curie temperature and it reaches zero temperature at a magnetic field of $\mu_\mathrm{0} H_c \approx 0.5\,$T.</description>

      <title>Extended Kohler's scaling, a low temperature anomaly and Isosbestic point in the charge density wave state of 1T-VSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1T-VSe$_2$ is a narrow band transition metal chalcogenide that shows charge density wave (CDW) state below $T_{CDW}$ = 110 K. Here, we have explored the relevance of Kohler's rule and the thermal transport properties of VSe$_2$ across the CDW state. The magnetoresistance (MR) follows Kohler's rule above $T_{CDW}$, while an extended Kohler's rule is employed below $T_{CDW}$. Interestingly, we observed an anomaly in MR at T = 20 K, below which MR value decreases on lowering temperature. This anomaly is also reflected in the slope ($\kappa$) of Kohler's plots and the relative change in the thermal excitation induced carrier density ($n_T$) also. The $T_{CDW}$ remains largely unaffected in both electrical resistivity ($\rho(T)$) and longitudinal Seebeck coefficient ($\it{S_{xx}}$) even under a strong magnetic field of 14 Tesla. However, the application of magnetic field enhances the peak intensity of $\it{S_{xx}}$ at T $\sim$ 60 K. Additionally, $\it{S_{xx}(T)}$ curves measured at different fields exhibit a crossover at T = 20 K, which suggest the existence of unique feature in the CDW state of VSe$_2$ \textit{i.e.} a locally exact isosbestic point.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-easy-axis anisotropy in antiferromagnetic $S=1$ diamond-lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic properties of $S=1$ antiferromagnetic diamond lattice, Ni$X_{2}$(pyrimidine)$_{2}$ ($X$ = Cl, Br), hosting a single-ion anisotropy (SIA) orientation which alternates between neighbouring sites. Through neutron diffraction measurements of the $X$ = Cl compound, the ordered state spins are found to align collinearly along a pseudo-easy-axis, a unique direction created by the intersection of two easy planes. Similarities in the magnetization, exhibiting spin-flop transitions, and the magnetic susceptibility in the two compounds imply that the same magnetic structure and a pseudo-easy-axis is also present for $X$ = Br. We estimate the Hamiltonian parameters by combining analytical calculations and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations of the spin-flop and saturation field. The MC simulations also reveal that the spin-flop transition occurs when the applied field is parallel to the pseudo-easy-axis. Contrary to conventional easy-axis systems, there exist field directions perpendicular to the pseudo-easy-axis for which the magnetic saturation is approached asymptotically and no symmetry-breaking phase transition is observed at finite fields.</description>

      <title>A journey on self-$G$-ality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore topological manipulations in one spatial dimension, which are defined for a system with a global symmetry and map the system to another one with a dual symmetry. In particular, we discuss fusion category symmetries enhanced by the invariance of the actions of topological manipulations, i.e., self-$G$-alities for topological manipulations. Based on the self-$G$-ality conditions, we provide LSM-type constraints on the ground states of many-body Hamiltonians. We clarify the relationship between different enhanced symmetries and introduce the notion of $\textit{codimension-two transitions}$. We explore concrete lattice models for such self-$G$-alities and find how the self-$G$-ality structures match the IR critical theories.</description>

      <title>Tuning structural modulation and magnetic properties in metal-organic coordination polymers [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$(HCOO)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three solid solutions of [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$(HCOO)$_3$, with $x$ = 0.25 (1), 0.50 (2) and 0.75 (3), were synthesized and their nuclear structures and magnetic properties were characterized using single crystal neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements. At room temperature, all three compounds crystallize in the Pnma orthorhombic space group, akin to the cobalt and nickel end series members. Upon cooling, each compound undergoes distinct series of structural transitions to modulated structures. Compound 1 exhibits a phase transition to a modulated structure analogous to the pure nickel compound, while compound 3 maintains the behaviour observed in the pure cobalt compound, although in both cases the temperatures at which the phase transitions occur differ slightly from the pure phases. Monochromatic neutron diffraction measurements showed that the structural evolution of 2 diverges from that of either parent compound, with the competing hydrogen bond interactions which drive the modulation throughout the series producing a unique sequence of phases. It involves two modulated phases below 96(3) K and 59(3) K, with different q vectors, similar to the pure cobalt compound (with modulated phases below 128 K and 96 K), however it maintains the modulated phase below magnetic order (at 22.5(7) K), resembling the pure nickel compound (which present magnetic order below 34 K), resulting in an improper modulated magnetic structure. Despite these large scale structural changes, magnetometry data reveal that the bulk magnetic properties of these solid solutions form a linear continuum between the end members. Notably, doping of the metal site in these solid solutions allows for tuning of bulk magnetic properties, including magnetic ordering temperature, transition temperatures, and the nature of nuclear phase transitions, through adjustment of metal ratios.</description>

      <title>Utilizing frustration for milli-Kelvin adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manifold of energetically degenerate configurations arising from competing interactions in frustrated magnets gives rise to an enhanced entropy at lowest temperatures, which can be utilized for adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration (ADR). We review structural and magnetic properties of various Yb- and Gd-based oxides featuring frustration related to different triangular moment configurations and (in some cases) structural randomness. In comparison to paramagnetic hydrated salts, which have traditionally been employed for mK-ADR, these novel ADR materials enable cooling to temperatures several times lower than the magnetic interaction strength, significantly enhancing the entropy density and cooling power at a given target temperature. A further advantage is their chemical stability, allowing for a much simpler ADR pill design and ultra-high vacuum applications. For the temperature range between 0.02 and 2 K, a systematic comparison of the field-induced entropy density change is provided, that illustrates the advantages of frustrated magnets for low-temperature ADR.</description>

      <title>Quantum operations for Kramers-Wannier duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Kramers-Wannier duality for the transverse-field Ising lattice on a ring. A careful consideration of the ring boundary conditions shows that the duality has to be implemented with a proper treatment of different charge sectors of both the twisted and untwisted Ising and the dual-Ising Hilbert spaces. We construct a superoperator that explicitly maps the Ising operators to the dual-Ising operators. The superoperator naturally acts on the tensor product of the Ising and the dual-Ising Hilbert space. We then show that the relation between our superoperator and the Kramers-Wannier duality operator that maps the Ising Hilbert space to the dual-Ising Hilbert space is naturally provided by quantum operations and the duality can be understood as a quantum operation that we construct. We provide the operator-sum representation for the Kramers-Wannier quantum operations and reproduce the well-known fusion rules. In addition to providing the quantum information perspective on the Kramers-Wannier duality, our explicit protocol will also be useful in implementing the Kramers-Wannier duality on a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>The magic angle of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: optimizing correlation-driven superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental understanding of unconventional superconductivity is crucial for engineering materials with specific order parameters or elevated superconducting transition temperatures. However, for many of these materials, such as Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, the pairing mechanism and the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter remain unclear; furthermore, reliable and efficient methods of predicting their response to tuning - e.g. via structural distortions through strain and octahedral rotations - are lacking. Here we investigate the response of superconductivity in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ to distortions via two numerical techniques, the random phase approximation (RPA) and functional renormalization group (FRG), starting from realistic models of the electronic structure. Comparison of the results from the two techniques suggests that RPA misses the important interplay of competing fluctuation channels, while FRG reproduces key experimental findings. In accordance with earlier studies by RPA and FRG, we confirm the experimentally observed tuneability of $T_c$ with uniaxial strain. With octahedral rotation, we find an even larger increase of $T_c$ before superconductivity is completely suppressed in FRG, a finding that confirms experiments but is not reproduced in RPA. Throughout the parameter space investigated here, we find a dominant $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairing symmetry from FRG. To provide benchmark results for determining the pairing symmetry experimentally by quasiparticle interference using a Scanning Tunneling Microscope, we introduce the pairing interactions into continuum local density of states calculations, enabling experimental verification of the symmetry of the order parameter via phase-referenced Bogoliubov Quasiparticle Interference imaging.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-unitary dynamics of a class of quantum circuits based on stochastically measuring check operators of subsystem quantum error-correcting codes, such as the Bacon-Shor code and its various generalizations. Our focus is on how properties of the underlying code are imprinted onto the measurement-only dynamics. We find that in a large class of codes with nonlocal stabilizer generators, at late times there is generically a nonlocal contribution to the subsystem entanglement entropy which scales with the subsystem size. The nonlocal stabilizer generators can also induce slow dynamics, since depending on the rate of competing measurements the associated degrees of freedom can take exponentially long (in system size) to purify (disentangle from the environment when starting from a mixed state) and to scramble (become entangled with the rest of the system when starting from a product state). Concretely, we consider circuits for which the nonlocal stabilizer generators of the underlying subsystem code take the form of subsystem symmetries. We present a systematic study of the phase diagrams and relevant time scales in two and three spatial dimensions for both Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) and non-CSS codes, focusing in particular on the link between slow measurement-only dynamics and the geometry of the subsystem symmetry. A key finding of our work is that slowly purifying or scrambling degrees of freedom appear to emerge only in codes whose subsystem symmetries are nonlocally {\it generated}, a strict subset of those whose symmetries are simply nonlocal. We comment on the link between our results on subsystem codes and the phenomenon of Hilbert-space fragmentation in light of their shared algebraic structure.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation in long-range interacting super-Tonks-Girardeau systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate the system when the interactions are suddenly switched from the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) to the super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) limit. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the sTG gas exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the nonthermal (quantum) gas and the thermal (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce some intermediate quasi-prethermal states. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced strong zero modes in short quantum dot chains with time-reversal symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the emergence of strong zero modes in a two-site chain consisting of two quantum dots coupled due to a central dot that mediates electron hopping and singlet superconducting pairing. In the presence of time-reversal symmetry, the on-site Coulomb interaction leads to a three-fold ground-state degeneracy when tuning the system to a sweet spot as a function of the inter-dot couplings. This degeneracy is protected against changes of the dot energies in the same way as "poor man's'' Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains. In the limit of strong interactions, this protection is maximal and the entire spectrum becomes triply degenerate, indicating the emergence of a ''poor man's'' version of a strong zero mode. We explain the degeneracy and protection by constructing corresponding Majorana Kramers-pair operators and $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermion operators. The strong zero modes share many properties of Majorana bound states in short Kitaev chains, including the stability of zero-bias peaks in the conductance and the behavior upon coupling to an additional quantum dot. However, they can be distinguished through finite-bias spectroscopy and the exhibit a different behavior when scaling to longer chains.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electrons at internal and twistronic twin boundaries of van der Waals ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (MX$_2$) occur in 2H and rhombohedral polytypes, respectively distinguished by anti-parallel and parallel orientation of consecutive monolayer lattices. In its bulk form, rhombohedral MX$_2$ is ferroelectric, hosting an out-of-plane electric polarization, the direction of which is dictated by stacking. Here, we predict that twin boundaries, separating adjacent polarization domains with reversed built-in electric fields, are able to host two-dimensional electrons and holes with an areal density reaching $\sim 10^{13} {\rm cm}^{-2}$. Our modelling suggests that n-doped twin boundaries have a more promising binding energy than p-doped ones, whereas hole accumulation is stable at external surfaces of a twinned film. We also propose that the introduction of a twist at the twinned interface, with a `magic' angle $\theta^* \approx 3^{\circ}$, should promote a regime of strongly correlated states of electrons, such as Wigner crystals, due to commensurability between the moir\'e pattern at the interface and the accumulated carrier density.</description>

      <title>Dynamic, Symmetry-Preserving, and Hardware-Adaptable Circuits for Quantum Computing Many-Body States and Correlators of the Anderson Impurity Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hardware-reconfigurable ansatz on $N_q$-qubits for the variational preparation of many-body states of the Anderson impurity model (AIM) with $N_{\text{imp}}+N_{\text{bath}}=N_q/2$ sites, which conserves total charge and spin z-component within each variational search subspace. The many-body ground state of the AIM is determined as the minimum over all minima of $O(N_q^2)$ distinct charge-spin sectors. Hamiltonian expectation values are shown to require $\omega(N_q) &lt; N_{\text{meas.}} \leq O(N_{\text{imp}}N_{\text{bath}})$ symmetry-preserving, parallelizable measurement circuits, each amenable to post-selection. To obtain the one-particle impurity Green's function we show how initial Krylov vectors can be computed via mid-circuit measurement and how Lanczos iterations can be computed using the symmetry-preserving ansatz. For a single-impurity Anderson model with a number of bath sites increasing from one to six, we show using numerical emulation that the ease of variational ground-state preparation is suggestive of linear scaling in circuit depth and sub-quartic scaling in optimizer complexity. We therefore expect that, combined with time-dependent methods for Green's function computation, our ansatz provides a useful tool to account for electronic correlations on early fault-tolerant processors. Finally, with a view towards computing real materials properties of interest like magnetic susceptibilities and electron-hole propagators, we provide a straightforward method to compute many-body, time-dependent correlation functions using a combination of time evolution, mid-circuit measurement-conditioned operations, and the Hadamard test.</description>

      <title>Computational toolkit for predicting thickness of 2D materials using machine learning and autogenerated dataset by large language model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thickness of 2D materials not only plays a crucial role in determining the performance of nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices but also introduces complexities in predicting volume-dependent properties such as energy storage capacity, due to the intrinsic vacuum within these materials. Although a plethora of experimental techniques, including but not limited to optical contrast, Raman spectroscopy, nonlinear optical spectroscopy, near-field optical imaging, and hyperspectral imaging, facilitate the measurement of 2D material thickness, comprehensive data for many materials remains elusive. Over the last decade, the exponential proliferation of 2D materials and their heterostructures has outstripped the capabilities of conventional experimental and computational approaches. In this evolving landscape, machine learning (ML) has emerged as an indispensable tool, offering novel avenues to augment these traditional methodologies. Addressing the critical gap, we introduce THICK2D - Thickness Hierarchy Inference and Calculation Kit for 2D Materials. This Python-based computational framework harnesses an autogenerated thickness database, developed using large language models (LLMs), and advanced ML algorithms to facilitate the rapid and scalable estimation of material thickness, relying solely on crystallographic data. To demonstrate the utility and robustness of THICK2D, we successfully employed the toolkit to predict the thickness of more than 8000 2D-based materials, sourced from two extensive 2D material databases. THICK2D is disseminated as an open-source utility, accessible on GitHub https://github.com/gmp007/THICK2D, and archived on Zenodo at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11216648}{10.5281/zenodo.11216648.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Deep Neural Network Approach To Solve Fermionic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for interacting many-body quantum systems faces computational challenges due to exponential scaling with system size. This complexity limits the study of important phenomena in materials science and physics. We develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-driven algorithm to simulate fermionic systems on lattices. Our method uses Pauli matrices to represent quantum states, incorporates Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and leverages an adaptive momentum optimizer. We demonstrate the algorithm's accuracy by simulating the Heisenberg Hamiltonian on a one-dimensional lattice, achieving results with an error in the order of $10^{-4}$ compared to exact diagonalization. Furthermore, we successfully model a magnetic phase transition in a two-dimensional lattice under an applied magnetic field. Importantly, our approach avoids the sign problem common to traditional Fermionic Monte Carlo methods, enabling the investigation of frustrated systems. This work demonstrates the potential of ANN-based algorithms for efficient simulation of complex quantum systems, opening avenues for discoveries in condensed matter physics and materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered van der Waals material CrCl3 exhibits very strongly bound ligand field excitons that control optoelectronic applications and are connected with magnetic ordering by virtue of their d-orbital origin. Time-resolved photoluminescence of these exciton populations at room temperature shows that their relaxation is dominated by exciton-exciton annihilation and that the spontaneous decay lifetime is very long. These observations allow the rough quantification of the exciton annihilation rate constant and contextualization in light of a recent theory of universal scaling behavior of the annihilation process.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in Ground States of Long-Range Fermionic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scaling of ground state entanglement entropy of various free fermionic models on one dimensional lattices, where the hopping and pairing terms decay as a power law. We seek to understand the scaling of entanglement entropy in generic models as the exponent of the power law $\alpha$ is varied. We ask if there exists a common $\alpha_{c}$ across different systems governing the transition to area law scaling found in local systems. We explore several examples numerically and argue that when applicable, the scaling of entanglement entropy in long-range models is constrained by predictions from the low-energy theory. In contrast, disordered models and models without a continuum limit show fractal scaling of entanglement approaching volume-law behavior as $\alpha$ approaches zero. These general features are expected to persist on turning on interactions.</description>

Abstract: Photo-doped states in strongly correlated charge transfer insulators are characterized by $d$-$d$ and $d$-$p$ interactions and the resulting intertwined dynamics of charge excitations and local multiplets. Here we use femtosecond x-ray absorption spectroscopy in combination with dynamical mean-field theory to disentangle these contributions in NiO. Upon resonant optical excitation across the charge transfer gap, the Ni $L_3$ and O $K$ absorption edges red-shift for $&gt;10$ ps, associated with photo-induced changes in the screening environment. An additional signature below the Ni $L_3$ edge is identified for $&lt;1$ ps, reflecting a transient nonthermal population of local many-body multiplets. We employ a nonthermal generalization of the multiplet ligand field theory to show that the feature originates from $d$-$d$ transitions. Overall, the photo-doped state differs significantly from a chemically doped state. Our results demonstrate the ability to reveal excitation pathways in correlated materials by x-ray spectroscopies, which is relevant for ultrafast materials design.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally Slow, Long Range, and Non-Gaussian Critical Fluctuations Dominate the Charge Density Wave Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $(TaSe_4)_2I$ is a well-studied quasi-one-dimensional compound long-known to have a charge-density wave (CDW) transition around 263 K. We argue that the critical fluctuations of the pinned CDW order parameter near the transition can be inferred from the resistance noise on account of their coupling to the dissipative normal carriers. Remarkably, the critical fluctuations of the CDW order parameter are slow enough to survive the thermodynamic limit and dominate the low-frequency resistance noise. The noise variance and relaxation time show rapid growth (critical opalescence and critical slowing down) within a temperature window of $ \varepsilon \approx \pm 0.1$, where $\varepsilon$ is the reduced temperature. This is very wide but consistent with the Ginzburg criterion. We further show that this resistance noise can be quantitatively used to extract the associated critical exponents. Below $|\varepsilon | \lesssim 0.02$, we observe a crossover from mean-field to a fluctuation-dominated regime with the critical exponents taking anomalously low values. The distribution of fluctuations in the critical transition region is skewed and strongly non-Gaussian. This non-Gaussianity is interpreted as the breakdown of the validity of the central limit theorem as the diverging coherence volume becomes comparable to the macroscopic sample size. The large magnitude critical fluctuations observed over an extended temperature range, as well as the crossover from the mean-field to the fluctuation-dominated regime highlight the role of the quasi-one dimensional character in controlling the phase transition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for the recursion method applied within the Liouvillian formalism, enabling the computation of response functions for a wide range of quantum operators. Indeed, unlike most previous literature on the Liouvillian recursion method, this framework readily computes electronic Green's function. We demonstrate the method by showcasing its application to a temperature dependence study of a $2\times2$ Hubbard model. Our results show that the recursion method accurately computes response functions and provides valuable insights into quantum many-body systems. While the method has already been successfully applied to study of condensed matter, further efforts are required to develop efficient algorithms for larger and more realistic systems. Tensor network methods and other variational techniques hold promise for tackling these challenges. Overall, the recursion method offers a flexible approach for investigating strongly correlated system.</description>

      <title>Spin Green's Function Approach to Understanding Localized Majorana Fermions in the Kitaev Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kitaev model, defined on a honeycomb lattice, features an exactly solvable ground state with fractionalized Majorana fermion excitations, which can potentially form non-Abelian anyons crucial for fault-tolerant topological quantum computing. Although Majorana fermions are essential for obtaining the exact ground state, their physical interpretation in terms of spin operators remains unclear. In this study, we employ a Green's function approach that maintains SU(2) symmetry to address this issue and explore the model's finite temperature properties. Our results demonstrate that the computed temperature dependence of the correlation functions closely approximates the exact values at zero temperature, confirming the accuracy of our method. We also present several exact results concerning the spin Green's function and spin-spin correlation functions that are specific to the Kitaev model. Furthermore, the spin Green's function effectively describes the behavior of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes, which are formed by the product of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge fields around the sides of each hexagon, where the gauge field has the form of the product of two localized Majorana fermions. However, the contribution of itinerant Majorana fermions remains an open challenge for future research.</description>

Abstract: Kitaev's quantum double model is a lattice gauge theoretic realization of Dijkgraaf-Witten topological quantum field theory (TQFT), its topologically protected ground state space has broad applications for topological quantum computation and topological quantum memory. We investigate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry enriched generalization of the model for the cyclic Abelian group in a categorical framework and present an explicit Hamiltonian construction. This model provides a lattice realization of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry enriched topological (SET) phase. We discuss in detail the categorical symmetry of the phase, for which the electric-magnetic (EM) duality symmetry is a special case. The aspects of symmetry defects are investigated using the $G$-crossed unitary braided fusion category (UBFC). By determining the corresponding anyon condensation, the gapped boundaries and boundary-bulk duality are also investigated. Then we carefully construct the explicit lattice realization of EM duality for these SET phases.</description>

Abstract: Non-stabilizerness - commonly known as magic - measures the extent to which a quantum state deviates from stabilizer states and is a fundamental resource for achieving universal quantum computation. In this work, we investigate the behavior of non-stabilizerness around criticality in quantum spin chains. To quantify non-stabilizerness, we employ a monotone called mana, based on the negativity of the discrete Wigner function. This measure captures non-stabilizerness for both pure and mixed states. We introduce R\'enyi generalizations of mana, which are also measures of non-stabilizerness for pure states, and utilize it to compute mana in large quantum systems. We consider the three-state Potts model and its non-integrable extension and we provide strong evidence that the mutual mana exhibits universal logarithmic scaling with distance in conformal field theory, as is the case for entanglement.</description>

Abstract: Topological phases exhibit edge responses that are robust against deformations and defects. Such phases have recently been realized in stochastic systems, which model a large class of biological and chemical phenomena. However, general theoretical principles are lacking for these systems, such as the relation between the bulk topological invariant and observed edge responses, i.e. the celebrated bulk-edge correspondence. We show that contrary to established topological phases, stochastic systems require non-reciprocal (or non-Hermitian) transitions to have edge responses, which holds across all dimensions and geometries. For both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states, we demonstrate that stochastic edge responses grow dramatically with non-reciprocity while the quantum version plateaus. Having established the necessity and importance of non-reciprocity for stochastic edge states, we point out fundamental theoretical and physical consequences of this result. Lastly, we present a novel mechanism by which non-reciprocity engenders robust edge currents in stochastic systems. Our work establishes the crucial role of non-reciprocal interactions in permitting robust responses in active and living matter.</description>

      <title>Quantum slush state in Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04115v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an exotic quantum state which does not order at zero temperature in a Rydberg atom array with antiblockade mechanism. By performing an unbiased large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate a minimal model with facilitated excitation in a disorder-free system. At zero temperature, this model exhibits a heterogeneous structure of liquid and glass mixture. This state, dubbed quantum slush state, features a quasi-long-range order with an algebraic decay for its correlation function, and is different from most well-established quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Pair correlations of the hybridized orbitals in a ladder model for the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04304</link>

Abstract: To clarify the nature of high-temperature superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure, we investigate, using the density-matrix renormalization group method, the pair correlations in the two-orbital $t$-$J$ ladder model. While the interchain-intraorbital pair correlations exhibit a slow power-law decay in both orbitals, the interorbital pair correlation also develops strongly enough to be comparable with the intraorbital correlations. These intra and interorbital pair correlations are enhanced by Hund's coupling, but more importantly, the interorbital pair correlation develops even when interorbital pairing glue mediated by Hund's coupling is absent. Our finding suggests that the pair correlation in the present system develops as a hybridized two-orbital entity, which may have some implications on the superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of the $\text{SO}(2N)$ symmetry in the Gross-Neveu model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The canonical Gross-Neveu model for $N$ two-component Dirac fermions in $2+1$ dimensions suffers a continuous phase transition at a critical interaction $g_{c1} \sim 1/N$ at large $N$, at which its continuous symmetry $\text{SO}(2N)$ is preserved and a discrete (Ising) symmetry becomes spontaneously broken. A recent mean-field calculation, however, points to an additional transition at a different critical $g_{c2}\sim -N g_{c1}$, at which $\text{SO}(2N) \rightarrow \text{SO}(N) \times \text{SO}(N)$. To study the latter phase transition we rewrite the Gross-Neveu interaction $g (\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ in terms of three different quartic terms for the single ($L=1$) $4N$-component real (Majorana) fermion, and then extend the theory to $L&gt;1$. This allows us to track the evolution of the fixed points of the renormalization group transformation starting from $L\gg 1$, where one can discern three distinct critical points which correspond to continuous phase transitions into (1) $\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet mass-order-parameter, (2) $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor mass-order-parameters, and (3) $\text{SO}(2N)$-adjoint nematic-order-parameters, down to $L=1$ value that is relevant to the standard Gross-Neveu model. Below the critical value of $L_c (N)\approx 0.35 N$ for $N\gg1$ only the Gross-Neveu critical point (1) still implies a diverging susceptibility for its corresponding ($\text{SO}(2N)$-singlet) order parameter, whereas the two new critical points that existed at large $L$ ultimately become equivalent to the Gaussian fixed point at $L=1$. We interpret this metamorphosis of the $\text{SO}(2N)$-symmetric-tensor fixed point from critical to spurious as an indication that the transition at $g_{c2}$ in the original Gross-Neveu model is turned first-order by fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Characterizing MPS and PEPS Preparable via Measurement and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Preparing long-range entangled states poses significant challenges for near-term quantum devices. It is known that measurement and feedback (MF) can aid this task by allowing the preparation of certain paradigmatic long-range entangled states with only constant circuit depth. Here we systematically explore the structure of states that can be prepared using constant-depth local circuits and a single MF round. Using the framework of tensor networks, the preparability under MF translates to tensor symmetries. We detail the structure of matrix-product states (MPS) and projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) that can be prepared using MF, revealing the coexistence of Clifford-like properties and magic. Furthermore, we fully parameterize states exhibiting MF symmetries akin to the symmetry-protected topological order in one dimension and the topological order in two dimensions, and we discuss their characteristics. Finally, we discuss the analogous implementation of operators via MF, providing a structural theorem that connects to the well-known Clifford teleportation.</description>

      <title>Exotic d-wave Bose Metal in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Landau Fermi liquid theory, a cornerstone in condensed matter physics, encounters limitations in explaining certain phenomena, like the peculiar behavior of strange metals in high-temperature superconductors. Non-Fermi liquids, like Bose metals with uncondensed bosonic ground state, offer potential explanations, yet constructing an elusive Bose metal phase in two dimensions (2D) remains a formidable challenge. Utilizing constraint path quantum Monte Carlo and functional renormalization group methods on a fermionic system with spin anisotropy in a 2D lattice, we reveal the emergence of a Cooper pair Bose metal in a highly anisotropic regime (a &lt; 0.30) with wide range of filling, most notably at a filling fraction of n~0.8. Our findings exhibit a visible nonzero momentum Bose surface in the Cooper-pair distribution function, accompanied by a distinct signal of dxy correlation between pairs. Our results highlight that spin-dependent anisotropy in the Fermi surface leads to versatile pairing forms. Platforms such as ultracold atoms in optical lattices and recently proposed altermagnets hold promise for realizing this intriguing phase.</description>
