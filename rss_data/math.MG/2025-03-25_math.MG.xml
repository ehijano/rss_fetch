      <title>The superposition principle for local 1-dimensional currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every one-dimensional locally normal metric current, intended in the sense of U. Lang and S. Wenger, admits a nice integral representation through currents associated to (possibly unbounded) curves with locally finite length, generalizing the result shown by E. Paolini and E. Stepanov in the special case of Ambrosio-Kirchheim normal currents. Our result holds in Polish spaces, or more generally in complete metric spaces for 1-currents with tight support.</description>

      <title>Horoboundaries of coarsely convex spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A horoboundary is one of the attempts to compactify metric spaces, and is constructed using continuous functions on metric spaces. It is a concept that includes global information of metric spaces, and its correspondence with an ideal boundary constructed using geodesics has been studied in nonpositive curvature spaces such as CAT(0) spaces and geodesic Gromov hyperbolic spaces. We will introduce a certain correspondence between the horoboundary and the ideal boundary of coarsely convex spaces, which can be regarded as a generalization of spaces of nonpositive curvature.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the quantization problem on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of quantization of measures looks for best approximations of probability measures on a metric space by discrete measures supported on $N$ points, where the error of approximation is measured with respect to the Wasserstein distance. Zador's theorem states that, for measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ or $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds satisfying appropriate integrability conditions, the quantization error decays to zero as $N \to \infty$ at the rate $N^{-1/d}$.
  In this paper, we provide a general treatment of the asymptotics of quantization on metric measure spaces $(X, \nu)$. We show that a weaker version of Zador's theorem involving the Hausdorff densities of $\nu$ holds also in this general setting. We also prove Zador's theorem in full for appropriate $m$-rectifiable measures on Euclidean space, answering a conjecture by Graf and Luschgy in the affirmative. For both results, the higher integrability conditions of Zador's theorem are replaced with a general notion of $(p,s)$-quantizability, which follows from Pierce-type (non-asymptotic) upper bounds on the quantization error, and we also prove multiple such bounds at the level of metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>On a family of hyperbolic Brunnian links and their volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $n$-component link $L$ is said to be \emph{Brunnian} if it is non-trivial but every proper sublink of $L$ is trivial. The simplest and best known example of a hyperbolic Brunnian link is the 3-component link known as "Borromean rings". For $n\geq 2,$ we introduce an infinite family of $n$-component Brunnian links with positive integer parameters $Br(k_1, \ldots, k_n)$ that generalize examples constructed by Debrunner in 1964. We are interested in hyperbolic invariants of 3-manifolds $S^3 \setminus Br(k_1, \ldots, k_n)$ and we obtain upper bounds for their volumes. Our approach is based on Dehn fillings on cusped manifolds with volumes related to volumes of ideal right-angled hyperbolic antiprisms.</description>

      <title>The Power of Recursive Embeddings for $\ell_p$ Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric embedding is a powerful mathematical tool that is extensively used in mathematics and computer science. We devise a new method of using metric embeddings recursively that turned out to be particularly effective for $\ell_p$ spaces, $p&gt;2$. Our method yields state-of-the-art results for Lipschitz decomposition, nearest neighbor search and embedding into $\ell_2$. In a nutshell, we compose metric embeddings by way of reductions, leading to new reductions that are substantially more effective than the straightforward reduction that employs a single embedding. In fact, we compose reductions recursively, oftentimes using double recursion, which exemplifies this gap.</description>

      <title>Non-self-intersective dragon curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let us fold a strip of paper many times in the same direction, and then unfold it to form a fixed angle $\theta$ at all creases. The resulting shape is called the Dragon curve with the unfolding angle $\theta$. When $0\le\theta&lt;90^{\circ}$, the corresponding Dragon curve has a self-intersection. When $\theta=180^{\circ}$, the corresponding Dragon curve is a straight line, which has no self-intersection. In this paper, we will show that any Dragon curve whose unfolding angle is greater than $99.3438^{\circ}$ and less than $180^{\circ}$ has no self-intersection.</description>

      <title>On the polar of Schneider's difference body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th-order extension of the difference body $DK$ of a convex body $K\subset\mathbb R^n$, the convex body $D^m(K)$ in $\mathbb R^{nm}$. He conjectured that its volume is minimized for ellipsoids when the volume of $K$ is fixed.
  In this work, we solve a dual version of this problem: we show that the volume of the polar body of $D^m(K)$ is maximized precisely by ellipsoids. For $m=1$ this recovers the symmetric case of the celebrated Blaschke-Santal\'o inequality. We also show that Schneider's conjecture cannot be tackled using standard symmetrization techniques, contrary to this new inequality. As an application for our results, we prove Schneider's conjecture asymptotically \'a la Bourgain-Milman. We also consider a functional version.</description>
