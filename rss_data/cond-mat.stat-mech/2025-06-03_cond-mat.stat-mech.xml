      <title>Complete universal scaling of first-order phase transitions in the two-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase transitions, as one of the most intriguing phenomena in nature, are divided into first-order phase transitions (FOPTs) and continuous ones in current classification. While the latter shows striking phenomena of scaling and universality, the former has recently also been demonstrated to exhibit scaling and universal behavior within a mesoscopic, coarse-grained Landau-Ginzburg theory. Here we apply this theory to a microscopic model -- the paradigmatic Ising model, which undergoes FOPTs between two ordered phases below its critical temperature -- and unambiguously demonstrate universal scaling behavior in such FOPTs. These results open the door for extending the theory to other microscopic FOPT systems and experimentally testing them to systematically uncover their scaling and universal behavior.</description>

      <title>Fr\"ohlich Condensation of Bosons: Graph texture of curl flux network for nonequilibrium properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium condensates of bosons subject to energy pump and dissipation are investigated, manifesting the Fr\"ohlich coherence proposed in 1968. A quantum theory is developed to capture such a nonequilibrium nature, yielding a certain graphic structure arising from the detailed-balance breaking. The results show a network of probability curl fluxes that reveals a graph topology. The winding number associated with the flux network is thus identified as a new order parameter for the phase transition towards the Fr\"ohlich condensation (FC), not attainable by the symmetry breaking. Our work demonstrates a global property of the FCs, in conjunction with the coherence of cavity polaritons that may exhibit robust cooperative phases driven far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>New universality classes and BKT transition in the vortex lattice phases of Kagome Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the experimental realization of direct Kagome spin ice [arXiv:2404.19377], the theoretical six-vertex model on the Kagome lattice is systematically simulated using the directed loop Monte Carlo method. Four distinct vortex lattice phases are identified: (i) Ferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both triangular and honeycomb faces, with a winding number $ k = 1 $. (ii) Antiferromagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on both types of faces, with $ k = -2 $ on the honeycomb faces and $ k = 1 $ on the triangular faces. (iii) Paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the triangular faces with $ k = 1 $. (iv) Paramagnetic leg states and vortex lattice order on the honeycomb faces with $ k = 1 $. As for ferromagnetic to different types of magnetic disorder phase, besides the Ising universality class with $ y_t = 1 $, a new critical exponent $ y_t = 1.317(6) $ has also been found. The transition between the third and fourth types of vortex lattice phases occurs with the new exponent $y_t=1.340(3)$. The third and fourth types of the vortex lattice phase to the vortex disorder phase are found to be of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. These findings contribute to the search for and understanding of ice on complex lattices.</description>

      <title>Hybrid scaling mechanism of critical behavior in the overlapping critical regions of classical and quantum Yang-Lee edge singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the study of scaling behavior in Yang-Lee edge singularities (YLES) has attracted sustained attention. However, the scaling mechanism for the overlapping critical region between classical and quantum YLES remains unclear. In this work, we investigate this question, and a hybrid scaling mechanism is introduced to characterize the scaling behavior in the overlapping regions. The hybrid scaling mechanism asserts that in the overlapping region the scaling behavior can be described by the scaling function for both critical regions simultaneously, and it results in a constraint on the scaling functions. The transverse Ising chain in an imaginary longitudinal field, which exhibits $(0+1)$ dimensional (D) and $(1+1)$ D quantum YLES phase transitions at zero temperature, and $(0+0)$ D and $(1+0)$ D classical YLES phase transitions at finite temperature, is employed as a model to test this hybrid scaling mechanism. The scaling functions in the critical regions of $(0+1)$ D and $(1+1)$ D quantum YLES as well as $(0+0)$ D and $(1+0)$ D classical YLES of such model are systematically investigated. Furthermore, the hybrid scaling mechanisms in overlapping critical regions, particularly between classical and quantum YLES, are thoroughly examined. Through this study, we have established a scaling mechanism capable of describing behaviors in the overlapping critical regions between classical and quantum phase transitions, which also facilitates the extraction of quantum phase transition information from classical phase transition systems.</description>

      <title>Anomalous current fluctuations and mobility-driven clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study steady-state current fluctuations in hardcore lattice gases on a ring of $L$ sites, where $N$ particles perform symmetric, {\it extended-ranged} hopping. The hop length is a random variable depending on a length scale $l_0$ (hopping range) and the inter-particle gap. The systems have mass-conserving dynamics with global density $\rho = N/L$ fixed, but violate detailed balance. We consider two analytically tractable cases: (i) $l_0 = 2$ (finite-ranged) and (ii) $l_0 \to \infty$ (infinite-ranged); in the latter, the system undergoes a clustering or condensation transition below a critical density $\rho_c$. In the steady state, we compute, exactly within a closure scheme, the variance $\langle Q^2(T) \rangle_c = \langle Q^2(T) \rangle - \langle Q(T) \rangle^2$ of the cumulative (time-integrated) current $Q(T)$ across a bond $(i,i+1)$ over a time interval $[0, T]$. We show that for $l_0 \to \infty$, the scaled variance of the time-integrated bond current, or equivalently, the mobility diverges at $\rho_c$. That is, near criticality, the mobility $\chi(\rho) = \lim_{L \to \infty} [\lim_{T \to \infty} L \langle Q^2(T, L) \rangle_c / 2T] \sim (\rho - \rho_c)^{-1}$ has a simple-pole singularity, thus providing a dynamical characterization of the condensation transition, previously observed in a related mass aggregation model by Majumdar et al.\ [{\it Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ {\bf 81}, 3691 (1998)}]. At the critical point $\rho = \rho_c$, the variance has a scaling form $\langle Q^2(T, L) \rangle_c = L^{\gamma} {\cal W}(T/L^{z})$ with $\gamma = 4/3$ and the dynamical exponent $z = 2$. Thus, near criticality, the mobility {\it diverges} while the diffusion coefficient remains {\it finite}, {\it unlike} in equilibrium systems with short-ranged hopping, where diffusion coefficient usually {\it vanishes} and mobility remains finite.</description>

      <title>Deep learning of thermodynamic laws from microscopic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically show that a deep neural network (DNN) can learn macroscopic thermodynamic laws purely from microscopic data. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we generate the data of snapshot images of gas particles undergoing adiabatic processes. We train a DNN to determine the temporal order of input image pairs. We observe that the trained network induces an order relation between states consistent with adiabatic accessibility, satisfying the axioms of thermodynamics. Furthermore, the internal representation learned by the DNN act as an entropy. These results suggest that machine learning can discover emergent physical laws that are valid at scales far larger than those of the underlying constituents -- opening a pathway to data-driven discovery of macroscopic physics.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining dynamics to maximize irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many far-from-equilibrium biological systems, energy injected by irreversible processes at microscopic scales propagates to larger scales to fulfill important biological functions. But given dissipative dynamics at the microscale, how much irreversibility can persist at the macroscale? Here, we propose a model-free coarse-graining procedure that merges microscopic states to minimize the amount of lost irreversibility. Beginning with dynamical measurements, this procedure produces coarse-grained dynamics that retain as much information as possible about the underlying irreversibility. In synthetic and experimental data spanning molecular motors, biochemical oscillators, and recordings of neural activity, we derive simplified descriptions that capture the essential nonequilibrium processes. These results provide the tools to study the fundamental limits on the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility.</description>

Abstract: We study from a statistical mechanics viewpoint some of the simplest mathematical objects, finite pure sets. Starting from the empty set, new generations are produced step by step, sets of the next generation being those whose elements are the sets of the current generation. We compute in particular correlations and limiting laws for chains of various lengths for the membership relation when the number of generations becomes large.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network for Anomaly Detection in the Latent Space of Proton Collision Events at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of discovering new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) demands constant innovation in algorithms and technologies. Tensor networks are mathematical models on the intersection of classical and quantum machine learning, which present a promising and efficient alternative for tackling these challenges. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based strategy for anomaly detection at the LHC and demonstrate its superior performance in identifying new phenomena compared to established quantum methods. Our model is a parametrized Matrix Product State with an isometric feature map, processing a latent representation of simulated LHC data generated by an autoencoder. Our results highlight the potential of tensor networks to enhance new-physics discovery.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Coherent error induced phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of logical information in quantum stabilizer codes subject to coherent unitary errors. Beginning with a logical state, we apply a random unitary error channel and subsequently measure stabilizer checks, resulting in a syndrome-dependent post-measurement state. By examining both this syndrome state and the associated syndrome distribution, we identify a phase transition in the behavior of the logical state. Below a critical error threshold pc, the syndrome state remains in the same logical state, enabling successful recovery of the code's logical information via suitable error-correction protocols. Above pc, however, the syndrome state shifts to a different logical state, signaling the breakdown of efficient error correction. Notably, this process can often induce an effective unitary rotation within the logical space. This transition is accompanied by qualitative changes in both the global and local features of the syndrome distribution. We refer to this phenomenon as a coherent error induced phase transition. To illustrate this transition, we present two classes of quantum error correcting code models the toric code and non-local random stabilizer codes thereby shedding light on the design and performance limits of quantum error correction under coherent errors.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Space Filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic space filling (DSF) is a stochastic process defined on any connected graph. Each vertex can host an arbitrary number of particles forming a pile, with every arriving particle landing on the top of the pile. Particles in a pile, except for the particle at the bottom, can hop to neighboring vertices. Eligible particles hop independently and stochastically, with the overall hopping rate set to unity for every eligible particle at every vertex. When the number of vertices in a graph is equal to the total number of particles, the evolution stops at the moment when every vertex gets occupied by a single particle. We determine the halting time distribution on complete graphs. Using the mapping of the DSF into a two-species annihilation process, we argue that on $d-$dimensional tori with $N\gg 1$ vertices, the average halting time scales with the number of vertices as $N^{4/d}$ when $d\leq 4$ and as $N$ when $d&gt;4$.</description>

      <title>Analogs of deconfined quantum criticality for non-invertible symmetry breaking in 1d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to exotic phenomena such as coexistence of order and disorder. Here we explore second-order phase transitions in 1d spin chains between two phases that correspond to distinct patterns of non-invertible symmetry breaking. The critical point shares several features with well-understood examples of deconfined quantum critical points, such as enlarged symmetry and identical exponents for the two order parameters participating in the transition. Interestingly, such deconfined transitions involving non-invertible symmetries allow one to construct a whole family of similar critical points by gauging spin-flip symmetries. By employing gauging and bosonization, we characterize the phase diagram of our model in the vicinity of the critical point. We also explore proximate phases and phase transitions in related models, including a deconfined quantum critical point between invertible order parameters that is enforced by a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Adsorbate phase transitions on nanoclusters from nested sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nested sampling was employed to investigate adsorption equilibria on the truncated-octahedral Lennard-Jones nanocluster LJ$_{38}$ while systematically varying adsorbate-surface well depth and Lennard-Jones size parameters. Evaluation of the canonical partition function over a wide temperature range identifies two successive phase transitions: (i) condensation of the gas phase onto the cluster surface at higher temperatures, and (ii) lateral rearrangement of the adsorbed layer at lower temperatures. For identical interactions, the condensate first populates both three- and four-fold hollow sites; when adsorbate-adsorbate interactions are weakened, preference shifts to the four-coordinated (100) sites. Size mismatch governs low-temperature behavior: smaller adsorbates aggregate to increase mutual contacts, whereas larger ones distribute more evenly to maximize coordination with the cluster. These findings highlight key trends in facet competition and lattice mismatch, and showcase nested sampling as an automated, unbiased tool for exploring surface configurational space and guiding investigations of more complex, realistic interfaces.</description>

      <title>Alignment Phase Transition in Socially Driven Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective human movement is a hallmark of complex systems, exhibiting emergent order across diverse settings, from pedestrian flows to biological collectives. In high-speed scenarios, alignment interactions ensure efficient flow and navigation. In contrast, alignment in low-speed, socially engaged contexts emerges not from locomotion goals but from interpersonal interaction. Using high-resolution spatial and orientation data from preschool classrooms, we uncover a sharp, distance-dependent transition in pairwise alignment patterns that reflects a spontaneous symmetry breaking between distinct behavioral phases. Below a critical threshold of approximately 0.65\,m, individuals predominantly align side-by-side; beyond this range, face-to-face orientations prevail. We show that this transition arises from a distance-dependent competition among three alignment mechanisms: parallelization, opposition, and reciprocation, whose interplay generates a bifurcation structure in the effective interaction potential. A Fourier-based decomposition of empirical orientation distributions reveals these mechanisms, enabling the construction of a minimal pseudo-potential model that captures the alignment transition as a non-equilibrium phase transition. Monte Carlo simulations using the inferred interaction terms closely reproduce the empirical patterns. These findings establish a quantitative framework for social alignment in low-speed human motion, extending active matter theory to a previously unexplored regime of socially mediated orientation dynamics, with implications for modeling coordination and control in biological collectives and artificial swarms.</description>

      <title>Micelle Forming Linear-Dendritic Block Copolymers: A Theoretical Comparison between Random Hyperbranched and Precise Dendrimer Polymer Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperbranched block copolymers offer a simpler and more efficient synthesis route compared to more traditional dendritic systems, while still providing exceptional control over surface functionality and self-assembly. This makes them ideal candidates for engineering nanoparticles with tailored properties for applications such as drug delivery and sensing. Here we use self-consistent field calculations to compare the micelle structures formed by copolymers with a polydisperse hyperbranched (LHBC), monodisperse dendritic (LDBC), and linear solvophilic blocks. Representative LHBC structures were generated by molecular dynamics simulations mimicking the slow-monomer addition protocol. We find that LHBC micelles are more stable, have a lower critical micelle concentration, and are better at accommodating larger drug payloads than LDBC micelles, and these properties further improve with increasing polydispersity. LHBC micelles also offer more terminal ends for functionalization than LDBC micelles for LDBCs with up to four branching generations, with the number of terminal ends being surprisingly independent of the LHBC polydispersity. Our findings highlight the superiority of LHBC micelles in flexibility and performance over LDBC micelles.</description>

      <title>Emergence of thermodynamic functioning regimes from finite coupling between a quantum thermal machine and a load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous quantum thermal machines are particularly suited to understand how correlations between thermal baths, a load, and a thermal machine affect the overall thermodynamic functioning of the setup. Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.</description>

      <title>A Concurrent Multiscale Framework Coupling Direct Simulation Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to couple the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) algorithm with molecular dynamics (MD). The coupling approach generalizes prior coupling methods using a cell-based decision. The approach is supported by a lifting and restricting operator, which translate length and time scales between DSMC and MD. We verify the framework on basic conservation laws, and demonstrate its usability on a hypersonic flow example. Its accuracy gain is discussed in light of conventional DSMC simulations. Advantages and limitations are discussed, and additional use cases are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>

Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Drift in Feynman-Kac Theory: Preserving Early Probabilistic Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1905, Einstein's theory of Brownian motion supported the molecular basis of the diffusion equation and introduced two complementary viewpoints: a deterministic field description and a probabilistic formulation based on stochastic particle ensembles. The consequences were far-reaching in the development of key concepts of modern physics such as wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics. In the 1940s, Feynman and Kac advanced this framework by casting path integrals within measure theory, defining solutions as mathematical expectations and extending the method to a broad class of differential operators. Despite its influence, applying this deterministic-probabilistic correspondence to flows within confined geometries has remained elusive: how can one recover deterministic streamlines from particles advected by a random velocity that never matches the true flow field? Elegant particle-system models have been devised for collisional plasmas, semiconducting crystals, globular clusters, and biological microswimmers, yet they depart from the original intent of representing the solution as an expectation of sources propagated by a single process. Here, we show that Feynman-Kac's theory can be rigorously extended to nonlinear dynamics with drift, staying true to its probabilistic origin. This yields novel propagator representations and forges a convergence of ideas across applied mathematics, computer graphics, and engineering communities tackling complex geometries.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of a system of many point particles initially concentrated in a small region in $d$ dimensions. Particles undergo overdamped motion caused by pairwise interactions through the long-ranged repulsive $r^{-s}$ potential; each particle is also subject to Brownian noise. When $s&lt;d$, the expansion is governed by non-local hydrodynamic equations. In the one-dimensional case, we deduce self-similar solutions for all $s\in (-2,1)$. The expansion of Coulomb gases remains well-defined in the infinite-particle limit: The density is spatially uniform and inversely proportional to time independent of the spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric simple exclusion process on a random comb: Transport properties in the stationary state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11931v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the dynamics of interacting particles on a disordered lattice formed by a random comb. The dynamics comprises that of the asymmetric simple exclusion process, whereby motion to nearest-neighour sites that are empty is more likely in the direction of a bias than in the opposite direction. The random comb comprises a backbone lattice from each site of which emanates a branch with a random number of sites. The backbone and the branches run in the direction of the bias. The number of branch sites or alternatively the branch lengths are sampled independently from a common distribution, specifically, an exponential distribution. The system relaxes at long times into a nonequilibrium stationary state. We analyse the stationary-state density of sites across the random comb, and also explore the transport properties, in particular, the stationary-state drift velocity of particles along the backbone. We show that in the stationary state, the density is uniform along the backbone and nonuniform along the branches, decreasing monotonically from the free-end of a branch to its intersection with the backbone. On the other hand, the drift velocity as a function of the bias strength has a non-monotonic dependence, first increasing and then decreasing with increase of bias. However, remarkably, as the particle density increases, the dependence becomes no more non-monotonic. We understand this effect as a consequence of an interplay between biased hopping and hard-core exclusion, whereby sites towards the free end of the branches remain occupied for long times and become effectively non-participatory in the dynamics of the system. This results in an effective reduction of the branch lengths and a motion of the particles that takes place primarily along the backbone.</description>

Abstract: We study coupled KPZ equations with three control parameters $X,Y,T$. These equations are used in the context of stretched polymers in a random medium, for the spacetime spin-spin correlator of the isotropic quantum Heisenberg chain, and for exciton-polariton condensates. In an earlier article we investigated merely the diagonal $X=Y$, $T=1$. Then the stationary measure is delta-correlated Gaussian and the dynamical exponent is obtained numerically to be close to $z = \tfrac{3}{2}$. We observed that the scaling functions of the dynamic correlator change smoothly when varying $X$. In this contribution, the analysis is extended to the whole $X$-$Y$-$T$ plane. Solutions are stable only if $XY \geq 0$. Based on numerical simulations, the static correlator still has rapid decay. We argue that the parameter space is foliated into distinct universality classes. They are labeled by $X$ and consist of half-planes parallel to the $Y$-$T$ plane containing the point $(X,X,1)$.</description>

      <title>Control of active field theories at minimal dissipation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.</description>

Abstract: Introduced by Boltzmann under the name "monode," the microcanonical ensemble serves as the fundamental representation of equilibrium thermodynamics in statistical mechanics by counting all possible realizations of a system's states. Ensemble theory connects this idea with probability and information theory, leading to the notion of Shannon-Gibbs entropy and, ultimately, to the principle of maximum caliber describing trajectories of systems--in and out of equilibrium. While the latter phenomenological generalization reproduces many results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, given a proper choice of observables, its physical justification remains an open area of research. What is the microscopic origin and physical interpretation of this variational approach? What guides the choice of relevant observables? We address these questions by extending Boltzmann's method to a microcanonical caliber principle and counting realizations of a system's trajectories--all assumed equally probable. Maximizing the microcanonical caliber under the imposed constraints, we systematically develop generalized detailed-balance relations, clarify the statistical origins of inhomogeneous transport, and provide an independent derivation of key equations from stochastic thermodynamics. This approach introduces a dynamical ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady states in spatially extended and active systems. While verifying the equivalence of ensembles, e.g. those of Norton and Thevenin, our framework contests other common assumptions about nonequilibrium regimes, with supporting evidence provided by stochastic simulations. Our theory suggests further connections to the first principles of microscopic dynamics in classical statistical mechanics, which are essential for investigating systems where the necessary conditions for thermodynamic behavior are not satisfied.</description>

      <title>Symmetry induced pairing in dark excitonic condensate at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bose Einstein condensate of dark intervalley excitons must be inherently multi-component because of crystalline symmetries. Since valleys hosting such excitons are separated by large quasi-momenta, a minimal inter-component Josephson-type coupling can only be established between pairs of excitons from the time-reversed valleys. As a result, a paired condensate can emerge at finite temperature, that is, the off-diagonal order exists for the pairs from the time-reversed valleys, while the individual valleys are disordered. This prediction follows from the elementary mean field analysis regardless of the dimensionality. However, as Monte Carlo simulations show, no such a phase exists in 3D crystals. Instead, the multi-component condensation proceeds as the Ist order transition from the normal state. The paired phase does exist in 2D for the number of the components $N_v\geq 6$. It forms by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the high temperature (normal) phase. The multi-component condensate appears upon further lowering of temperature.</description>

Abstract: The mean compositions of individual components can be tuned to control phase behavior in number-conserving passive mixtures. In this work, we investigate the role of variable average density in a system of infinitely many non-reciprocally interacting scalar densities, within the framework of the multi-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard (NRCH) model. Rather than focusing on specific parameter choices, we study ensembles of systems where the inter-species interaction coefficients and average densities are sampled from probability distributions. We show that non-reciprocity stabilizes the homogeneous mixed state even in the presence of compositional disorder. Using random matrix theory, we derive a general condition for the onset of spinodal instability, which we verify through simulations. Finally, we illustrate the connection between the statistics of the most unstable eigenvalue and the emergent nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Folded State Dynamics -- A Geometric and Deterministic Origin of Irreversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of irreversibility in isolated, deterministic systems remains a central challenge in statistical mechanics. Traditional approaches, such as Boltzmann's H-theorem and Lanford's derivation of the Boltzmann equation, rely on probabilistic assumptions and are limited to dilute gases and short timescales. We introduce Folded State Dynamics (FSD), a framework in which irreversibility arises from the geometric structure of phase space in systems with coupled rotational and translational degrees of freedom. In contrast to conventional models with unfolded, weakly coupled modes, FSD exhibits phase space folding, where deterministic coupling induces instability and chaotic mixing. We show that equilibrium states exponentially dominate the accessible phase space volume, while constrained configurations (e.g., pure rotation) occupy measure-zero subsets. This yields a geometric derivation of entropy growth, with reversal probabilities suppressed as Prev and recurrence times Trec, resolving Loschmidt's and Zermelo's objections without coarse-graining or fine-tuning. FSD is further extended to include charged systems (cFSD), where electromagnetic interactions continuously drive phase space folding. FSD thus offers a deterministic and testable mechanism for irreversibility, with implications ranging from confined colloids to the cosmological arrow of time</description>

      <title>Accurate heat currents via reorganised master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces: Time Evolution of Area and Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05547v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. This paper focuses on the dynamics of the overall area and the genus of the surface. The time evolution of the area is shown to follow a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow to a size of order of the inverse cosmological constant. The time evolution of the genus is argued to lead to two different phases, dominated by (i) planar surfaces, and (ii) ``foamy'' surfaces, whose genus diverges. In phase (i), which exhibits critical phenomena, time variations of the order parameter are approximately t-distributed with 4 or more degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Collectively-modified inter-molecular electron correlations: The connection of polaritonic chemistry and spin glass physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed many-molecules electronic-structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model of a spin glass. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability of the intermolecular electron correlations, which could provide the long sought-after seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. Overall, the qualitative predictions made from the SSK model (e.g., dispersion effects, phase transitions, differently modified bulk and rare event properties, heating,...) agree well with available experimental observations. Our connection paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as modified fluctuation-dissipation relations, (non-equilibrium) aging dynamics, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the connection also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems suggesting novel theoretical directions such as spin glasses with explicitly time-dependent (random) interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact volume-law entangled zero-energy eigenstates in a large class of spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact solutions for excited states in non-integrable quantum Hamiltonians have revealed novel dynamical phenomena that can occur in quantum many-body systems. This work proposes a method to analytically construct a specific set of volume-law-entangled zero-energy exact excited eigenstates in a large class of spin Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that all spin chains that satisfy a simple set of conditions host exact volume-law zero-energy eigenstates in the middle of their spectra. Examples of physically relevant spin chains of this type include the transverse-field Ising model, PXP model, spin-$S$ $XY$ model, and spin-$S$ Kitaev chain. Although these eigenstates are highly atypical in their structure, they are thermal with respect to local observables. Our framework also unifies many recent constructions of volume-law entangled eigenstates in the literature. Finally, we show that a similar construction also generalizes to spin models on graphs in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium, coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We employ the thermal properties of the field to model heat and cold reservoirs between which the thermal machine operates. Treating the detector as an open quantum system, we employ a master equation to study its finite-time dynamics during each cycle stroke. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing, respectively, the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases satisfied by the field at spatial infinity. Furthermore, we evaluate the optimal performance of the thermal machine by analyzing its efficiency at maximum power output and ecological impact. Our study presents a general framework for understanding the finite-time operation of relativistic quantum thermal machines, focusing on their energy optimization.</description>

      <title>Large time cumulants of the KPZ equation on an interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the interval $[0,L]$ with Neumann type boundary conditions and boundary parameters $u,v$. We show that the $k$-th order cumulant of the height behaves as $c_k(L,u,v)\, t$ in the large time limit $t \to +\infty$, and we compute the coefficients $c_k(L,u,v)$. We obtain an expression for the upper tail large deviation function of the height. We also consider the limit of large $L$, with $u=\tilde u/\sqrt{L}$, $u=\tilde v/\sqrt{L}$, which should give the same quantities for the two parameter family $(\tilde u, \tilde v)$ KPZ fixed point on the interval. We employ two complementary methods. On the one hand we adapt to the interval the replica Bethe ansatz method pioneered by Brunet and Derrida for the periodic case. On the other hand, we perform a scaling limit using previous results available for the open ASEP. The latter method allows to express the cumulants of the KPZ equation in terms a functional equation involving an integral operator.</description>

      <title>Strict advantage of complex quantum theory in a communication task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard formulations of quantum theory are based on complex numbers: Quantum states can be in superpositions, with weights given by complex probability amplitudes. Motivated by quantum theory promising a range of practical advantages over classical for a multitude of tasks, we investigate how the presence of complex amplitudes in quantum theory can yield operational advantages over counterpart real formulations. We identify a straightforward communication task for which complex quantum theory exhibits a provably lower communication cost than not just any classical approach, but also any approach based on real quantum theory. We certify the necessity of complex quantum theory for optimal approaches to the task through geometric properties of quantum state ensembles that witness the presence of basis-independent complexity. This substantiates a strict operational advantage of complex quantum theory. We discuss the relevance of this finding for quantum advantages in stochastic simulation.</description>
