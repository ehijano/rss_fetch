      <title>Modular Properties of $\mathcal{W}_3$ Generalised Gibbs Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we make a proposal for the solution to a long-standing problem - the asymptotic expansions of the modular $S$-transform of a generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE) in a theory with $\mathcal{W}_3$ symmetry where the GGE includes the first non-trivial charge. Equivalently, we give a proposal for the modular $S$-transform of traces of arbitrary powers of the zero mode $W_0$. We provide evidence in the form of exact results using Zhu's recursion, results obtained using conjectured results for Verma modules, and exact results for the particular value $c=-2$. We expect these have generalisations to other symmetry algebras/hierarchies such as the Virasoro algebra/KdV charges, and to GGEs with arbitrary finite sets of charges.</description>

      <title>Infinite matrix product states for $(1+1)$-dimensional gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator construction that allows us to represent the lattice Hamiltonians of (abelian or non-abelian) gauge theories in a local and manifestly translation-invariant form. In particular, we use symmetric matrix product states and introduce link-enhanced matrix product operators (LEMPOs) that can act on both the physical and virtual spaces of the matrix product states. This construction allows us to study Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories on infinite lattices. As examples, we show how to implement this method to study the massless and massive one-flavor Schwinger model and adjoint QCD$_2$.</description>

      <title>Large N limit of spectral duality in classical integrable systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the large $N$ limit of spectral duality between rational Gaudin models introduced by Adams, Harnad and Hurtubise. The limit of ${\rm gl}_N$ model is performed by means of the noncommutative torus algebra represented by the fields on a torus with the Moyal-Weyl star product. We apply the approach developed by Hoppe, Olshanetsky and Theisen to the Gaudin type models and describe the corresponding integrable field theory (2d hydrodynamics) on a torus. The dual model is a large $N$ limit of the ${\rm gl}_M$ Gaudin model with $N$ marked points written in the form of Gaudin model with irregular singularities.</description>

      <title>The twisted geometry of 6d F-theory vacua with discrete gauge symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fate of discrete gauge groups and discrete charges of gravitational theories under twisted circle compactification. We then apply our results to six-dimensional F-theory vacua with discrete gauge symmetries and relate them to the geometry of the genus one fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds that underlie the dual M-theory compactifications. This leads us to introduce a class of geometries, which we call almost generic elliptic/genus one fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds, and to make detailed conjectures about their properties. A second twisted circle compactification relates these M-theory vacua to Type IIA compactifications with flat but topologically non-trivial B-fields along the internal geometry. The A-model topological string partition function on such configurations is intimately tied to the twisted-twined elliptic genera of the six-dimensional non-critical strings of the associated F-theory vacuum. The modular properties of the twisted-twined elliptic genera imply new twisted derived equivalences. We thus recover and significantly extend earlier results from both the physical and the mathematical literature. An important outcome of our study is that if the discrete gauge symmetry is not cyclic, then no smooth genus one fibration exists that represents the associated axio-dilaton profile.</description>

      <title>Microscopic field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect from matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N$ electrons, corresponding to matrix dimension $N$. We first consider a quantum Hall droplet within finite $N$ matrix Chern-Simons theory. Taking into account the differential geometry of the matrix Chern-Simons droplet for a partially-filled fuzzy two-sphere, we first generalize the quantization procedure by replacing the Poisson bracket, a classical Lie derivative, with a quantum counterpart, the Lie derivative for a deformed fuzzy sphere. This yields the topological invariant introduced in earlier works on the quantum skyrmion Hall effect and previously unidentified fusion rules. This is consistent with treatment of a spin $S$ of multiplicity $2S+1$ as a quantum Hall droplet within matrix Chern-Simons theory for $N=2S+1$ spinless electrons and a generalization of a Jain composite particle for a Laughlin state. We then construct $D$-dimensional arrays of coupled small $N$ matrix Chern-Simons droplets as effective field theories of the quantum skyrmion Hall effect. In higher-symmetry constructions, this yields what appears to be a D+1 dimensional $U(N)$ Yang-Mills theory, but actually contains $\delta$ extra fuzzy dimensions from the finite $N$ MCS theory as well as deformations from $U(N)$ due to partial filling of the fuzzy spheres. In this construction, the Chern-Simons level is $k+1$ for each small $N$ droplet, while the entire array can be interpreted as an unbounded matrix Chern-Simons theory at level $k$. Such constructions at $k=2$ are consistent with earlier results for the multiplicative Chern insulator. We also formulate the quantum skyrmion Hall effect in terms of a Lagrangian for an array of potentially distinct, small $N$ droplets within anisotropic fuzzification. We discuss the relevance of these results to spin lattice models and lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Constraining light dark matter in vector-scalar portals with COSI and AMEGO-X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting gamma-ray signals that could be due to dark matter (DM) particles would give us invaluable information about the nature of DM. In particular, gamma-ray lines could provide a way to measure the DM mass. The excellent energy resolution of the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) will allow us to probe underexplored regions of the DM parameter space while being sensitive to distinctive spectral features of potential DM signals. In this work, we consider a fermionic sub-GeV DM charged under a new U(1) gauge symmetry. Both the DM and the new gauge boson $Z'$ acquire mass from a new singlet scalar. The masses of the new particles in this class of vector-scalar portal models are naturally at the MeV scale, enabling detectable gamma-ray lines in the bandpasses of COSI and proposed missions such as the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X). We estimate the sensitivity of COSI and AMEGO-X to sub-GeV DM in this context, considering a B-L and a purely axial $Z'$ as benchmark examples. We find regions of the parameter space where COSI will provide leading constraints, beyond the strong CMB limits. On the other hand, AMEGO-X would probe most of the viable parameter space leading to continuum gamma rays.</description>

      <title>Angular phase-space integrals with four denominators through Mellin--Barnes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute four-denominator angular phase-space integrals using the Mellin--Barnes (MB) technique in dimensional regularisation. Independent of the scattering process, an angular integral can be categorised based on the nature of the momenta appearing in the denominators. We address all scenarios involving fully massless and massive momenta. We present a partial fraction decomposition that relates angular integrals with multiple massive momenta to those with a single massive momentum. By solving six- and seven-fold MB integrals, we express the final results up to the finite order in the dimensional regulator in terms of Goncharov polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Tessellation Groups, Harmonic Analysis on Non-compact Symmetric Spaces and the Heat Kernel in view of Cartan Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces $\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel Theta function.</description>

      <title>Causality and Stability in Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The causality and stability of a relativistic hydrodynamic theory is shown to require a consensus between, either (i) newer degrees of freedom apart from the fundamental fluid fields, or (ii) a general hydrodynamic frame other than the Landau or Eckart compromising the field's first principle definition, unless the non-equilibrium derivative correction goes to infinity. Any finitely truncated derivative correction (no matter how high it is) is shown to lead to an acausal theory, unless the corrections are infinitely summed up to include all orders. From an underlying microscopic theory, an exact form of relativistic hydrodynamics has been derived which establishes that the resummation of all order temporal derivatives is essential for causality, which finally 'integrated in' as newer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of hot and dense matter in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport coefficients are known as the measure of system interactions, as well as the dynamical input of the hydrodynamic evolution equations of an expanding system created in the relativistic heavy ion collisions. In the current analysis, they have been evaluated for strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma system as well as hot hadronic media. The medium effects for an interacting QCD system have been introduced through a quasiparticle model. The same for a hadronic system has been captured via the in-medium self-energy correction using thermal field theory. The resulting behavior of the transport coefficients shows significant modification with respect to the estimations made in vacuum or using ideal equation of state.</description>

      <title>Topological Stabilization via Higgs and $Z$-Boson Repulsions in Electroweak Monopole-Antimonopole Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate dual repulsive mechanisms stabilizing Cho-Maison monopole-antimonopole pairs (MAPs) through stress-energy tensor analysis. Higgs-mediated repulsion exhibits non-monotonic dependence on topological charge and Higgs self-coupling, confirming its topological origin while revealing a mass-controlled range transition beyond Yukawa suppression. Simultaneously, $Z$-boson field generates localized repulsive cores of radius $R_c\approx 0.8$ $m_W^{-1}$, which aligns with weak interaction scales. Neutral charge distribution confirms $Z$-boson exchange as the physical mechanism. These competing effects -- operating at topological and electroweak scales -- establish a stabilization mechanism for Cho-Maison MAPs that extends to other topological solitons in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Interacting Scalar Field Cosmology from Full Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relational cosmological dynamics emerging from interacting group field theory (GFT) models minimally coupled to a massless clock scalar field and a self-interacting scalar field. We focus on two broad classes of GFT interactions - pseudosimplicial and pseudotensorial - which generalize simplicial and tensorial interactions, respectively. Treating these interactions perturbatively, we extract the effective cosmological dynamics using mean-field techniques. In the geometric sector, we identify appropriate classical limits of the resulting dynamics, characterized by the emergence of a cosmological constant term in pseudotensorial models and of dynamical dark energy in pseudosimplicial ones. In the matter sector, we find that quantum gravity interactions induce a mass term and modify the classical symmetries of the scalar field dynamics, allowing for a consistent classical matter-geometry description only for specific forms of the effective scalar field potential. Finally, we show that these quantum gravity compatibility conditions on the effective potentials can be relaxed by allowing for a scale-dependent gravitational coupling, and that this running is uniquely fixed once the classical scalar field potential is specified.</description>

      <title>Scalable Hybrid quantum Monte Carlo simulation of U(1) gauge field coupled to fermions on GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a GPU-accelerated hybrid quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to solve the fundamental yet difficult problem of $U(1)$ gauge field coupled to fermions, which gives rise to a $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state under the description of (2+1)d quantum electrodynamics QED$_3$. The algorithm renders a good acceptance rate and, more importantly, nearly linear space-time volume scaling in computational complexity $O(N_{\tau} V_s)$, where $N_\tau$ is the imaginary time dimension and $V_s$ is spatial volume, which is much more efficient than determinant QMC with scaling behavior of $O(N_\tau V_s^3)$. Such acceleration is achieved via a collection of technical improvements, including (i) the design of the efficient problem-specific preconditioner, (ii) customized CUDA kernel for matrix-vector multiplication, and (iii) CUDA Graph implementation on the GPU. These advances allow us to simulate the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state with unprecedentedly large system sizes, which is up to $N_\tau\times L\times L = 660\times66\times66$, and reveal its novel properties. With these technical improvements, we see the asymptotic convergence in the scaling dimensions of various fermion bilinear operators and the conserved current operator when approaching the thermodynamic limit. The scaling dimensions find good agreement with field-theoretical expectation, which provides supporting evidence for the conformal nature of the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state in the \qed. Our technical advancements open an avenue to study the Dirac spin liquid state and its transition towards symmetry-breaking phases at larger system sizes and with less computational burden.</description>

      <title>Ultralight dark matter from non-slowroll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The longitudinal mode of a massive vector field, generated during inflation, offers a well-motivated and phenomenologically rich candidate for dark matter. We show that a rapid variation in the mass of the vector boson, occurring during a brief phase of non-slowroll inflationary evolution, can naturally give rise to extremely small vector masses after inflation ends, corresponding to an ultralight dark matter candidate. This mechanism predicts a stochastic gravitational-wave background, generated at second order by non-adiabatic longitudinal vector fluctuations and amplified at very low frequencies, yielding a distinctive observational signature of the scenario. By leveraging a brief departure from slowroll dynamics during inflation - commonly invoked in scenarios that produce primordial black holes - our framework establishes a novel connection between ultralight vector dark matter and primordial black hole physics, suggesting a possible unified setting for mixed dark matter scenarios.</description>

Abstract: The quantum vacuum is not really empty; it is a reservoir of operationally accessible non-classical resources. Understanding how to extract these resources to fuel information processing is a core objective in quantum technologies and lies at the heart of relativistic quantum information (RQI). While earlier studies of quantum resource harvesting protocols relied primarily on numerical methods, we present, for the first time, exact analytic results for the transition probability and coherence of a qutrit Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting with a scalar field in anti-de Sitter spacetime of arbitrary dimension. Leveraging these results, we analytically investigate the harvesting of non-stabilizerness and demonstrate that stronger spacetime curvature and higher dimensionality significantly suppress the amount of extractable magic resource from the vacuum. Our analytic framework is readily applicable to other scenarios, laying the groundwork for further analytic studies in RQI.</description>

      <title>Emergent statistical mechanics in holographic random tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have enjoyed substantial progress in capturing properties of complex quantum systems by means of random tensor networks (RTNs), which form ensembles of quantum states that depend only on the tensor network geometry and bond dimensions. Of particular interest are RTNs on hyperbolic geometries, with local tensors typically chosen from the unitary Haar measure, that model critical boundary states of holographic bulk-boundary dualities. In this work, we elevate static pictures of ensemble averages to a dynamical one, to show that RTN states exhibit equilibration of time-averaged operator expectation values under a highly generic class of Hamiltonians with non-degenerate spectra. We prove that RTN states generally equilibrate at large bond dimension and also in the scaling limit for three classes of geometries: Those of matrix product states, regular hyperbolic tilings, and single "black hole" tensors. Furthermore, we prove a hierarchy of equilibration between finite-dimensional instances of these classes for bulk and boundary states with small entanglement. This suggests an equivalent hierarchy between corresponding many-body phases, and reproduces a holographic degree-of-freedom counting for the effective dimension of each system. These results demonstrate that RTN techniques can probe aspects of late-time dynamics of quantum many-body phases and suggest a new approach to describing aspects of holographic dualities using techniques from statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dilatons Improve (Non)-Goldstones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shift symmetry forbids conformal coupling of Goldstone bosons from internal symmetries, but not for spontaneously broken conformal symmetry. Its Goldstone boson, the dilaton $D$, admits and indeed requires, an improvement term $ {\cal L}_R \propto R e^{-2D/F_D}$ as it realises the Goldstone matrix element in the effective theory. The improvement, combined with Weyl-gauging, enables conformal coupling to Goldstone bosons and other particles of arbitrary Weyl-weight. While improvement does not affect scattering amplitudes in flat space, it impacts gravitational form factors decisively, giving rise to the dilaton pole in the spin-zero channel. We compute leading-order scalar, fermion, pion, and dilaton form factors, confirming low-energy constraints. The dilaton decoupling limit further implies that the operator driving spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking has scaling dimension $\Delta= d-2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02379v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new type of holographic correspondence between non-relativistic string theory in String Newton-Cartan AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ and Galilean Yang-Mills supplemented with 5 adjoint interacting scalar fields living on the 3+1 dimensional Penrose conformal boundary. In our derivation, we start with Maldacena's setting of a stack of $N$ coincident D3-branes and we show that the near-horizon/decoupling limit commutes with the non-relativistic limit, giving a unique answer both from the gravity and gauge theory perspectives. As a first evidence, we systematically compute the Killing vectors on the string theory side, and find that they match the symmetries of the dual gauge theory.</description>

Abstract: We consider the possibility of a past and future eternal universe, constructing geodesically complete inflating, loitering, and bouncing spacetimes. We identify the constraints energy conditions in General Relativity place on the building of eternal cosmological models. Inflationary and bouncing behavior are shown to be essential ingredients in all significant examples. Non-trivial complete flat spacetimes are shown to violate the null energy condition (NEC) for at least some amount of time. Ignoring the intractable subtleties introduced by quantum considerations, such as rare tunneling events and Boltzmann brains, we demonstrate that these universes need not have had a beginning or an end.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the following paper, we will study a charged scalar field under an electromagnetic external field taking into account the spatial confining of the system. We shall use the Coleman-Weinberg method in one-loop approximation to obtain the effective potential of the model in the proper time representation. Through generalized Matsubara formalism, we applied several kinds of boundary conditions on the frontier of the system. The regularization of the model is performed by a scheme independent of the external electromagnetic applied field. The model presents phase transition and we carry out its analysis by the free energy density functional of the bosonic system. The findings show magnetic catalysis, electric catalysis, and inverse electric catalysis phenomena, all of them depending on the thickness of the system.</description>

Abstract: Twisted period integrals are ubiquitous in theoretical physics and mathematics, where they inhabit a finite-dimensional vector space governed by an inner product known as the intersection number. In this work, we uncover the associated tensor structures of intersection numbers and integrate them with the fibration method to develop a novel evaluation scheme. Companion matrices allow us to cast the computation of the intersection numbers in terms of a matrix operator calculus within the ambient tensor space. For illustrative purposes, our algorithm has been successfully applied to the numerical decomposition of a sample of two-loop integrals, coming from planar five-point massless functions, representing a significant advancement for the direct projection of Feynman integrals to master integrals via intersection numbers.</description>

Abstract: We show that a novel holographic correspondence appears after taking a suitable stringy non-relativistic limit of the AdS$_5$/CFT$_4$ duality. This correspondence relates string theory in String Newton-Cartan AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ with Galilean Yang-Mills with five interacting adjoint scalars defined on the Penrose conformal boundary.

Abstract: In these lecture notes for the Les Houches School on Quantum Geometry I give an introductory overview of non-perturbative aspects of topological string theory. After a short summary of the perturbative aspects, I first consider the non-perturbative sectors of the theory as unveiled by the theory of resurgence. I give a self-contained derivation of recent results on non-perturbative amplitudes, and I explain the conjecture relating the resurgent structure of the topological string to BPS invariants. In the second part of the lectures I introduce the topological string/spectral theory (TS/ST) correspondence, which provides a non-perturbative definition of topological string theory on toric Calabi-Yau manifolds in terms of the spectral theory of quantum mirror curves</description>

      <title>Equivalence of effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate three-dimensional torsional Newton-Cartan (TNC) gravity by gauging the su$(1,2)\oplus$u$(1)$ algebra and construct its action using the Chern-Simons theory. This TNC exhibits novel features, including the fact that the gauge fields associated with both dilatation and rotation symmetries transform non-trivially under Galilean boosts. This theory also reproduces the Schr\"odinger gravity acquired by gauging the extended $z=2$ Schr\"odinger algebra arXiv:1604.08054 via a large speed of light ($1/c$)-expansion. In particular, we explain that the $z=2$ Lifshitz vacuum solution appearing in Schr\"odinger gravity is related to the null reduction of 4d $\Omega$-background up to a conformal factor. Based on these results, we revisit the identification between the extended Schr\"odinger algebra and bosonic analogue of super BMS algebra arXiv:1905.13154. We interpret that this relation originates from the $\mathcal{W}_3^{(2)}$ algebra which acts as the bosonic analogue of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractors paradigm aims to explain the applicability of hydrodynamics after a very short timescale in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC in terms of the emergence of universal behavior across different initial states. The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently, a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phase Transitions in Large $N$ Matrix Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is believed that the theory of quantum gravity describing our universe is unitary. Nonetheless, if we only have access to a subsystem, its dynamics is described by nonequilibrium physics. Motivated by this, we investigate the planar limit of large $N$ one-matrix quantum mechanics obeying the Lindblad master equation with dissipative jump terms, focusing on the existence, uniqueness, and properties of steady states. After showing that Lindblad dissipation is absent in the gauged model at large $N$, we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in planar ungauged matrix quantum mechanics. In the first class of examples, where potentials are unbounded from below, we study nonequilibrium critical points above which strong dissipation allows for the existence of normalizable steady states that would otherwise not exist. In the second class of examples, termed matrix quantum optics, we find evidence of nonequilibrium phase transitions analogous to those recently reported in the quantum optics literature for driven-dissipative Kerr resonators. Preliminary results on two-matrix quantum mechanics are also presented. We implement bootstrap methods to obtain concrete and rigorous results for the nonequilibrium steady states of matrix quantum mechanics in the planar limit.</description>

Abstract: We apply the Renormalization Group Procedure for Effective Particles (RGPEP) to the front form Yukawa Hamiltonian, yielding a renormalized (effective) Hamiltonian, accurate up to second order in the coupling strength. Subsequently, we examine the spectrum and parton distribution functions produced by the renormalized Hamiltonian, and show that the addition of counterterms leads to finite results. Resource estimates for quantum simulation are calculated for a single `Ladder Operator Block Encoding' (LOBE), and show that the cost to block encode the renormalized Hamiltonian is comparable to block encoding the bare Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics and phase structure of a deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black hole, generated via the gravitational decoupling (GD) method as a minimal geometric deformation. In the bulk canonical ensemble, our results exhibit a van der Waals-type first-order phase transition in addition to the Hawking-Page transition, in the suitable parameter regime. Further, we compute the critical exponents characterising the bulk transition, confirming their consistency with mean-field theory predictions. Exploiting the exact holographic dictionary between extended black hole thermodynamics and the dual conformal field theory (CFT), we extend this analysis to the boundary and uncover a rich array of phase transitions and critical phenomena across three distinct thermodynamic ensembles. In particular, for an ensemble of fixed volume and central charge, the dual CFT displays a van der Waals-like phase structure. Throughout, we emphasise the pivotal influence of the GD deformation parameter on the thermodynamic behaviour, and we elucidate its role in the confinement-deconfinement transitions characteristic of the deformed AdS-Schwarzschild geometry.</description>

      <title>Photon-instanton scattering in a superconducting circuit: Beyond the very high impedance regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instantons, semi-classical trajectories of quantum tunneling in imaginary time, have long been used to study thermodynamic and transport properties in a myriad of condensed matter and high energy systems. A recent experiment in superconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first evidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips), manifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which they interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully predicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several experimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons is much shorter than the relaxation time due to the environment in which they are embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton trajectory. Here, we alleviate these restrictions by incorporating numerical methods that eliminate some of the previously applied approximations. Our results improve the agreement with the experimental measurements, also for devices with lower impedances and thus shorter relaxation times, without fitting parameters. This framework should be useful in many other quantum field theoretical contexts.</description>

Abstract: Precision measurements of the gravitational wave signal from compact binary inspirals allow us to constrain the internal structure of those objects via physical parameters such as the tidal Love numbers. In scalar-tensor theories, one typically finds new types of Love numbers that are usually not considered or simply absent in General Relativity, which further allows us to constrain deviations from General Relativity. Building upon previous results, we present the linear perturbation equations necessary to calculate static and even-parity tidal Love numbers in Horndeski theories, the most general scalar-tensor theories with second-order field equations of motion. We further focus on the quadrupolar Love numbers and demonstrate how these can be extracted from the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields. We find that there is a potential ambiguity in extracting the Love numbers in this way, which we resolve by performing supplementary calculations in the effective field theory framework. We show that, in the case of scalar-tensor theories, the tidal Love numbers are not directly given by the $1/r^3$ term in the asymptotic expansion of the perturbation fields, as there is an additional contribution to this term independent of the Love numbers. We calculate such a contribution for a minimally coupled scalar field and also for the Damour-Esposito-Far\`ese model. For the latter, we find that the Love numbers can differ by $\mathcal{O}(1 \sim 10)\,\%$, if this additional contribution is not taken into account.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the Origins of the NANOGrav Signal: Early Universe Models and $\Delta N_{eff}$ Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether an Early-Universe stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) can account for the common spectrum process reported by NANOGrav, while also being consistent with current and projected CMB measurements of extra radiation. We compute the contribution of effective number of relativistic species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, for a number of Early-Universe models proposed to explain the pulsar timing array (PTA) spectrum. We demonstrate that models predicting $\Delta N_{eff}$ above the CMB limit would be firmly excluded, implying that the NANOGrav signal in tension with these bounds must instead arise from astrophysical sources. We find that current NANOGrav 15-year dataset, sensitive up to 60 nHz, gives a negligible contribution to $\Delta N_{eff}$ and remains well below the present and future CMB detection threshold. However, when we project future PTA capabilities reaching upto 1 $\mu$Hz, even with our conservative estimate we find that Inflation, Scalar Induced Gravitational Waves (SIGW), and metastable cosmic strings can induce a $\Delta N_{eff}$ large enough for $&gt;3.5\sigma$ detection by the Simons Observatory.</description>
