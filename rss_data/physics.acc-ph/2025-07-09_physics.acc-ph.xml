      <title>Design and Numerical Simulation of a SARA-Based RF Accelerator Using the $\mathrm{TE}_{112}$ Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged particle accelerators play a pivotal role in scientific research, industry, and medical applications. Among them, radiofrequency (RF) accelerators offer a promising approach for achieving high-energy particle acceleration in compact systems. This study presents the design and numerical simulation of a microwave-driven electron accelerator based on the Spatial Autoresonant Acceleration (SARA) mechanism. The proposed system consists of a cylindrical resonant cavity excited in the TE$_{112}$ mode, influenced by a tailored magnetostatic field generated by a set of external coils. The electromagnetic field distribution, magnetostatic configuration, and electron dynamics were simulated using COMSOL Multiphysics. The results validate the feasibility of accelerating electrons to energies close to 200~keV with a 1~kW microwave source, demonstrating their capability for X-ray generation through Bremsstrahlung radiation. Additionally, the study provides optimized design parameters for practical implementation. The high-quality factor $(Q\sim25000)$ of the resonant cavity ensures efficient energy storage but necessitates precise frequency control to maintain resonance conditions. The findings underscore the potential of SARA-based accelerators for compact X-ray sources, with applications in medical imaging, security screening, and materials analysis.</description>

      <title>Simulation of surface x-ray emission from the ASTERICS ECR ion source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bremsstrahlung x-ray emission induced by the impact of plasma electrons de-confined on the chamber wall of the ASTERICS electron cyclotron resonance ion source is investigated through a suite of two simulation codes. The electron high energy temperature distribution tail at the wall is found to be anisotropic and increases with Bmin. The electrons impinge the walls with broad angular distribution peaking at angles ranging between 5-25{\deg} with respect to the surface, which has consequences on the x-ray emission directionality and on the yield of electrons bouncing back toward the plasma, reaching up to 50%. The x-ray dose is mapped inside and around the ion source for Bmin = 0.8 T and an electron temperature artificially increased to 120 keV to dimension with margin the cave shielding. The dose without shielding reaches 100 $\mu$Sv/h per kW of impacting electrons at 5 m. A set of internal and external shielding is presented to attenuate this dose and reduce it to less than 1 $\mu$Sv/h per kW of electrons. A parametric electron distribution temperature study with Fluka indicates that the deposition of 1 W of heat in the superconducting cold mass per kW of plasma electrons, as reported experimentally, is obtained when the temperature is set to 380 keV. The mechanism required to provide such a high electron temperature is unclear, but previous experiments on several ion sources reported an x-ray spectral temperature 3 to 4 times higher radially, compatible with this simulation result.</description>
