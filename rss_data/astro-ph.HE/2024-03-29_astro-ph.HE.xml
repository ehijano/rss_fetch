      <title>Ephemeral Flaring Transients Following Supernova Explosions in Black-Hole Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars are members of binary systems, a fraction of which is expected to remain bound after the first star goes off as a supernova. When the second star also explodes, the SN ejecta are bound to interact with the compact object companion. We explore the consequences of this interaction in the case of a black hole (BH) companion. We show that accretion of the SN ejecta by the BH generally occurs with highly super-Eddington rates, which can be strongly modulated if the ejecta are clumpy, as typically observed in supernova remnants. This late accretion produces transient flaring activity with a time delay from the SN explosion of days to months, depending on the orbital separation and the velocity of the ejecta. The flares are expected to have a non-thermal, broad band spectrum, but their high-frequency emission (UV and X-rays) would be absorbed within the remnant. Observed flares should therefore be in the optical and near-infrared. We propose this model as an explanation to the late-time flaring activity observed in the fast blue optical transient AT2022tsd.</description>

Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae have become increasingly mature and important in recent years. Magnetic fields take center stage in scenarios for explaining hypernova explosions, but are now also considered in supernova theory more broadly as an important factor even in neutrino-driven explosions, especially in the context of neutron star birth properties. Here we present an overview of simulation approaches currently used for magnetohydrodynamic supernova simulations and sketch essential physical concepts for understanding the role of magnetic fields in supernovae of slowly or rapidly rotating massive stars. We review progress on simulations of neutrino-driven supernovae, magnetorotational supernovae, and the relevant field amplification processes. Recent results on the nucleosynthesis and gravitational wave emission from magnetorotational supernovae are also discussed. We highlight efforts to provide better initial conditions for magnetohydrodynamic supernova models by simulating short phases of the progenitor evolution in 3D to address uncertainties in the treatment of rotation and magnetic fields in current stellar evolution models.</description>

      <title>X-ray measurement of a high-mass white dwarf and its spin for the intermediate polar IGR J18434-0508</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IGR J18434-0508 is a Galactic Intermediate Polar (IP) type Cataclysmic Variable (CV) previously classified through optical spectroscopy. The source is already known to have a hard Chandra spectrum. In this paper, we have used follow-up XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations to measure the white dwarf (WD) mass and spin period. We measure a spin period of P = 304.4 +/- 0.3 s based on the combined MOS1, MOS2, and pn light curve. Although this is twice the optical period found previously, we interpret this value to be the true spin period of the WD. The source has an 8 +/- 2% pulsed fraction in the 0.5-10 keV XMM-Newton data and shows strong dips in the soft energy band (0.5-2 keV). The XMM-Newton and NuSTAR joint spectrum is consistent with a thermal bremsstrahlung continuum model with an additional partial covering factor, reflection, and Fe line Gaussian components. Furthermore, we fit the joint spectrum with the post-shock region "ipolar" model which indicates a high WD mass $&gt;$ $\sim$ 1.36 Msun, approaching the Chandrasekhar limit.</description>

      <title>GeV gamma-ray emission in the field of young massive star cluster RCW 38</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of gamma-ray emission by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) towards the young massive star cluster RCW 38 in the 1-500 GeV photon energy range. We found spatially extended GeV emission towards the direction of RCW 38, which is best modelled by a Gaussian disc of 0.23$\deg$ radius with a significance of the extension is $\sim 11.4 \sigma$. Furthermore, the spatial correlation with the ionized and molecular gas content favors the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission. The gamma-ray spectrum of RCW 38 has a relatively hard photon index of $2.44 \pm 0.03$, which is similar to other young massive star clusters. We argue that the diffuse GeV gamma-ray emission in this region likely originates from the interaction of accelerated protons in the stellar cluster with the ambient gas.</description>

      <title>Joint ALMA/X-ray monitoring of the radio-quiet type 1 AGN IC 4329A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of a compact millimeter (mm, 100-250 GHz) emission in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGN) remains debated. Recent studies propose a connection with self-absorbed synchrotron emission from the accretion disk X-ray corona. We present the first joint ALMA ($\sim$100 GHz) and X-ray (NICER/XMM-Newton/Swift; 2-10 keV) observations of the unobscured RQ AGN, IC 4329A ($z = 0.016$). The time-averaged mm-to-X-ray flux ratio aligns with recently established trends for larger samples (Kawamuro et al. 2022, Ricci et al. 2023), but with a tighter scatter ($\sim$0.1 dex) compared to previous studies. However, there is no significant correlation on timescales of less than 20 days. The compact mm emission exhibits a spectral index of $-0.23 \pm 0.18$, remains unresolved with a 13 pc upper limit, and shows no jet signatures. Notably, the mm flux density varies significantly (factor of 3) within 4 days, exceeding the contemporaneous X-ray variability (37% vs. 18%) and showing the largest mm variations ever detected in RQ AGN over daily timescales. The high amplitude variability rules out scenarios of heated dust and thermal free-free emission, pointing toward a synchrotron origin for the mm radiation in a source of $\sim$1 light day size. While the exact source is not yet certain, an X-ray corona scenario emerges as the most plausible compared to a scaled-down jet or outflow-driven shocks.}</description>

      <title>Limits on Early Matter Domination from the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmologies with hidden sector dark matter, the lightest hidden sector species can come to dominate the energy budget of the universe and cause an early matter-dominated era (EMDE). EMDEs amplify the matter power spectrum on small scales, leading to dense, early-forming microhalos which massively boost the dark matter annihilation signal. We use the Fermi-LAT measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background to place limits on the parameter space of hidden sector models with EMDEs. We calculate the amplified annihilation signal by sampling the properties of prompt cusps, which reside at the centers of these microhalos and dominate the signal on account of their steep $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ density profiles. We also include the portions of the parameter space affected by the gravitational heating that arises from the formation and subsequent destruction of nonlinear structure during the EMDE. We are able to rule out significant portions of the parameter space, particularly at high reheat temperatures. Long EMDEs remain poorly constrained despite large structure-induced boosts to the annihilation signal.</description>

      <title>Feedback in the dark: a critical examination of CMB bounds on primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If present in the early universe, primordial black holes (PBHs) will accrete matter and emit high-energy photons, altering the statistical properties of the {Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)}. This mechanism has been used to constrain the fraction of dark matter that is in the form of PBHs to be much smaller than unity for PBH masses well above one solar mass. Moreover, the presence of dense dark matter mini-halos around the PBHs has been used to set even more stringent constraints, as these would boost the accretion rates. In this work, we critically revisit CMB constraints on PBHs taking into account the role of the local ionization of the gas around them. We discuss how the local increase in temperature around PBHs can prevent the dark matter mini-halos from strongly enhancing the accretion process, in some cases significantly weakening previously derived CMB constraints. We explore in detail the key ingredients of the CMB bound and derive a conservative limit on the cosmological abundance of massive PBHs.</description>

      <title>Neural Post-Einsteinian Framework for Efficient Theory-Agnostic Tests of General Relativity with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parametrized post-Einsteinian (ppE) framework and its variants are widely used to probe gravity through gravitational-wave tests that apply to a large class of theories beyond general relativity. However, the ppE framework is not truly theory-agnostic as it only captures certain types of deviations from general relativity: those that admit a post-Newtonian series representation in the inspiral of coalescencing compact objects. Moreover, each type of deviation in the ppE framework has to be tested separately, making the whole process computationally inefficient and expensive, possibly obscuring the theoretical interpretation of potential deviations that could be detected in the future. We here present the neural post-Einsteinian (npE) framework, an extension of the ppE formalism that overcomes the above weaknesses using deep-learning neural networks. The core of the npE framework is a variantional autoencoder that maps the discrete ppE theories into a continuous latent space in a well-organized manner. This design enables the npE framework to test many theories simultaneously and to select the theory that best describes the observation in a single parameter estimation run. The smooth extension of the ppE parametrization also allows for more general types of deviations to be searched for with the npE model. We showcase the application of the new npE framework to future tests of general relativity with the fifth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. In particular, the npE framework is demonstrated to efficiently explore modifications to general relativity beyond what can be mapped by the ppE framework, including modifications coming from higher-order curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high post-Newtonian order, and dark-photon interactions in possibly hidden sectors of matter that do not admit a post-Newtonian representation.</description>

      <title>More on Black Holes Perceiving the Dark Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last two years the dark dimension scenario has emerged as focal point of many research interests. In particular, it functions as a stepping stone to address the cosmological hierarchy problem and provides a colosseum for dark matter contenders. We reexamine the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) perceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the universe. We re-assess limits on the abundance of PBHs as dark matter candidates from $\gamma$-ray emission resulting from Hawking evaporation. We re-evaluate constraints from the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission in the direction of the Galactic center which offer the best and most solid upper limits on the dark matter fraction composed of PBHs. The revised mass range which allows PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter is estimated to be $10^{15} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. We demonstrate that due to the constraints from $\gamma$-ray emission, quantum corrections due to the speculative memory burden effect do not modify this mass range. We also investigate the main characteristics of PBHs which are localized in the bulk. We show that PBHs localized in the bulk can make all cosmological dark matter if $10^{11} \alt M_{\rm BH}/{\rm g} \alt 10^{21}$. Finally, we comment on the black holes that could be produced if one advocates a space with two boundaries for the dark dimension.</description>

      <title>Radio properties of Green Pea galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green Peas (GPs) are young, compact, star-forming dwarf galaxies, and local (z~0.3) analogues of the early galaxies (z&gt;6) considered to be mainly responsible for the reionisation of the Universe. Recent X-ray observations of GPs have detected high excess emission which cannot be accounted for by star formation alone, and implies presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We employ radio observations to study the radio properties of GPs, build their radio spectral energy distributions, and verify the presence of AGNs. We performed new radio observations of three GPs with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) in the L, C, and X bands (1.4, 6 and 10 GHz resp.), supplemented by the data from archival observations and large radio surveys. We also analysed the archival radio data for a larger sample of GPs and blueberry (BBs) galaxies, which are lower-mass and lower-redshift analogues of the GPs. To understand the significance of the radio observations, we assess the detectability of these sources, and compare the detected radio luminosities with the expectations from theoretical and empirical relations. Two of the three targeted GPs were strongly detected ($&gt;10\sigma$) in the JVLA observations and their fluxes are consistent with star formation, while the third source was undetected. Although a large fraction (~75%) of the sources from the larger archival sample of GPs and BBs could be detected with archival surveys, only a small number (&lt;40%) are detected and their radio luminosity is significantly lower than the expectation from empirical relations. Our results show that the majority of the dwarf galaxy sample is highly underluminous. Especially towards the lower end of galaxy mass and star formation rate (SFR), the radio luminosity-SFR relation deviates from the empirical relations, suggesting that the relations established for larger galaxies may not hold towards the low-mass end.</description>

      <title>Consistency of JWST Black Hole Observations with NANOGrav Gravitational Wave Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations have opened a new chapter in studies of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), stimulating discussion of two puzzles: the abundance of SMBHs in the early Universe and the fraction of dual AGNs. In this paper we argue that the answers to these puzzles may be linked to an interpretation of the data on the nHz gravitational wave (GWs) discovered by NANOGrav and other Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) in terms of SMBH binaries losing energy by interactions with their environments as well as by GW emission. According to this interpretation, the SMBHs in low-$z$ AGNs are the tip of the iceberg of the local SMBH population, which are mainly in inactive galaxies. This interpretation would favour the observability of GW signals from BH binaries in LISA and deciHz GW detectors.</description>

Abstract: Ultra-high energy cosmic rays are the most extreme energetic particles detected on Earth, however, their acceleration sites are still mysterious. We explore the contribution of low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts to the ultra-high energy cosmic ray flux, since they form the bulk of the nearby population. We analyse a representative sample of these bursts detected by BeppoSAX, INTEGRAL and Swift between 1998-2016, and found that in order to reconcile our theoretical flux with the observed flux, these bursts should accelerate at most $10^{-13}$ M$_\odot$ of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>NuSTAR Observations of Candidate Subparsec Binary Supermassive Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analysis of NuSTAR X-ray observations of three AGN that were identified as candidate subparsec binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) systems in the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey based on apparent periodicity in their optical light curves. Simulations predict that close-separation accreting SMBH binaries will have different X-ray spectra than single accreting SMBHs. We previously observed these AGN with Chandra and found no differences between their low energy X-ray properties and the larger AGN population. However some models predict differences to be more prominent at energies higher than probed by Chandra. We find that even at the higher energies probed by NuSTAR, the spectra of these AGN are indistinguishable from the larger AGN population. This could rule out models predicting large differences in the X-ray spectra in the NuSTAR bands. Alternatively, it might mean that these three AGN are not binary SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Invariance Violation Limits from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been long conjectured that a signature of Quantum Gravity will be Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) that could be observed at energies much lower than the Planck scale. One possible signature of LIV is an energy-dependent speed of photons. This can be tested with a distant transient source of very high-energy photons. We explore time-of-flight limits on LIV derived from LHAASO's observations of tens of thousands of TeV photons from GRB 221009A, the brightest gamma-ray burst of all time. For a linear ($n=1$) dependence of the photon velocity on energy, we find a lower limit on the subluminal (superluminal) LIV scale of ${5.9} (6.2) mpl$. These are comparable to the stringent limits obtained so far and, as an independent bound obtained from a different redshift, confirm their robustness. For a quadratic model ($n=2$, corresponding to $d=6$ SME operators), the limits, which are currently the best available with the time-of-flight method, are $5.8 (4.6) \times 10^{-8} mpl$. Our analysis uses the publicly available LHAASO data, which is only in the $0.2-7$ TeV range. Higher energy data would enable us to improve these limits by a factor of 3 for $n=1$ and by an order of magnitude for $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Astromers: Status and Prospects</title>

Abstract: The extreme temperatures and densities of many astrophysical environments tends to destabilize nuclear isomers by inducing transitions to higher energy states. Those states may then cascade to ground. However, not all environments destabilize all isomers. Nuclear isomers which retain their metastable character in pertinent astrophysical environments are known as astrophysically metastable nuclear isomers, or "astromers". Astromers can influence nucleosynthesis, altering abundances or even creating new pathways that would otherwise be inaccessible. Astromers may also release energy faster or slower relative to their associated ground state, acting as heating accelerants or batteries, respectively. In stable isotopes, they may even simply remain populated after a cataclysmic event and emit observable x- or $\gamma$-rays. The variety of behaviors of these nuclear species and the effects they can have merit careful consideration in nearly every possible astrophysical environment. Here we provide a brief overview of astromers past and present, and we outline future work that will help to illuminate their role in the cosmos.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Upward-going Milli-charged particles at the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07617v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is assumed that superheavy dark matter particles with O(EeV) mass may decay to relativistic milli-charged particles (MCPs). The upward-going MCPs passing through the Earth could be measured by the fluorescence detectors (FD) of the Pierre Auger observatory (Auger). The massless hidden photon model was taken for MCPs to interact with nuclei, so that the numbers and fluxes of expected MCPs and neutrinos may be evaluated at the FD of Auger. Based on the assumption that no events are observed at the FD of Auger in 14 years, the corresponding upper limits on MCP fluxes were calculated at 90\% C. L.. These results indicated that MCPs could be directly detected in the secondaries' energy range O(1EeV)-O(10EeV) at the FD of Auger, when $3\times10^{-13}\lesssim\epsilon^2\lesssim 10^{-3}$. And a new region of 10 MeV &lt; $m_{MCP}$ &lt; 1 PeV and $10^{-7}$ $\lesssim$ $\epsilon$ $\lesssim$ $3\times10^{-2}$ is ruled out in the $m_{MCP}$-$\epsilon$ plane with 14 years of Auger data.</description>

      <title>Differential Sensitivity of the KM3NeT/ARCA detector to a diffuse neutrino flux and to point-like source emission: exploring the case of the Starburst Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: KM3NeT/ARCA is a Cherenkov neutrino telescope under construction in the Mediterranean sea, optimised for the detection of astrophysical neutrinos with energies above $\sim$1~TeV. In this work, using Monte Carlo simulations including all-flavour neutrinos, the integrated and differential sensitivities for KM3NeT/ARCA are presented considering the case of a diffuse neutrino flux as well as extended and point-like neutrino sources. This analysis is applied to Starburst Galaxies demonstrating that the detector has the capability of tracing TeV neutrinos from these sources. Remarkably, after eight years, a hard power-law spectrum from the nearby Small Magellanic Cloud can be constrained. The sensitivity and discovery potential for NGC 1068 is also evaluated showing that KM3NeT/ARCA will discriminate between different astrophysical components of the measured neutrino flux after 3 years of data taking.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the matching of black hole tidal responses: a systematic study of relativistic and logarithmic corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The worldline effective field theory (EFT) gives a gauge-invariant definition of black hole conservative tidal responses (Love numbers), dissipation numbers, and their spin-0 and spin-1 analogs. In the first part of this paper we show how the EFT allows us to circumvent the source/response ambiguity without having to use the analytic continuation prescription. The source/response ambiguity appears if Post-Newtonian (PN)corrections to external sources overlap with the response. However, these PN corrections can be clearly identified and isolated using the EFT. We illustrate that by computing static one-point functions of various external fields perturbing the four-dimensional Schwarzschild geometry. Upon resumming all relevant Feynman diagrams, we find that the PN terms that may mimic the response actually vanish for static black holes. Thus, the extraction of Love numbers from matching the EFT and general relativity (GR) calculations is completely unambiguous, and it implies that the Love numbers vanish identically for all types of perturbations. We also study in detail another type of fine tuning in the EFT, the absence of Love numbers' running. We show that logarithmic corrections to Love numbers do stem from individual loop diagrams in generic gauges, but cancel after all diagrams are summed over. In the particular cases of spin-0 and spin-2 fields the logarithms are completely absent if one uses the Kaluza-Klein metric decomposition. In the second part of the paper we compute frequency-dependent dissipative response contributions to the one-point functions using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism. We extract black hole dissipation numbers by comparing the one-point functions in the EFT and GR. Our results are in perfect agreement with those obtained from a manifestly gauge-invariant matching of absorption cross-sections.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Tidal Response of Kerr Black Holes from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We match scattering amplitudes in point particle effective field theory (EFT) and general relativity to extract low frequency dynamical tidal responses of rotating (Kerr) black holes to all orders in spin. In the conservative sector, we study local worldline couplings that correspond to the time-derivative expansion of the black hole tidal response function. These are dynamical (frequency-dependent) generalizations of the static Love numbers. We identify and extract couplings of three types of subleading local worldline operators: the curvature time derivative terms, the spin - curvature time derivative couplings, and quadrupole - octupole mixing operators that arise due to the violation of spherical symmetry. The first two subleading couplings are non-zero and exhibit a classical renormalization group running; we explicitly present their scheme-independent beta functions. The conservative mixing terms, however, vanish as a consequence of vanishing static Love numbers. In the non-conservative sector, we match the dissipation numbers at next-to-leading and next-to-next-to leading orders in frequency. In passing, we identify terms in the general relativity absorption probabilities that originate from tails and short-scale logarithmic corrections to the lowest order dissipation contributions.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin-Induced Quadrupole Moments in Precessing Compact Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-induced quadrupole moments provide an important characterization of compact objects, such as black holes, neutron stars and black hole mimickers inspired by additional fields and/or modified theories of gravity. Black holes in general relativity have a specific spin-induced quadrupole moment, with other objects potentially having differing values. Different values of this quadrupole moment lead to modifications of the spin precession dynamics, and consequently modifications to the inspiral waveform. Based on the spin-dynamics and the associated precessing waveform developed in our previous work, we assess the prospects of measuring spin-induced moments in various black hole, neutron star, and black-hole mimicker binaries. We focus on binaries in which at least one of the objects is in the mass gap (similar to the $2.6 M_\odot$ object found in GW190814). We find that for generic precessing binaries, the effect of the spin-induced quadrupole moments on the precession is sensitive to the nature of the mass-gap object, i.e., whether it is a light black hole or a massive neutron star. So that this is a good probe of the nature of these objects. For precessing black-hole mimicker binaries, this waveform also provides significantly tighter constraints on their spin-induced quadrupole moments than the previous results obtained without incorporating the precession effects of spin-induced quadrupole moments. We apply the waveform to sample events in GWTC catalogs to obtain better constraints on the spin-induced quadrupole moments, and discuss the measurement prospects for events in the O$4$ run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>
