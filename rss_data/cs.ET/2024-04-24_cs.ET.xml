      <title>Practical Battery Health Monitoring using Uncertainty-Aware Bayesian Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Battery health monitoring and prediction are critically important in the era of electric mobility with a huge impact on safety, sustainability, and economic aspects. Existing research often focuses on prediction accuracy but tends to neglect practical factors that may hinder the technology's deployment in real-world applications. In this paper, we address these practical considerations and develop models based on the Bayesian neural network for predicting battery end-of-life. Our models use sensor data related to battery health and apply distributions, rather than single-point, for each parameter of the models. This allows the models to capture the inherent randomness and uncertainty of battery health, which leads to not only accurate predictions but also quantifiable uncertainty. We conducted an experimental study and demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed models, with a prediction error rate averaging 13.9%, and as low as 2.9% for certain tested batteries. Additionally, all predictions include quantifiable certainty, which improved by 66% from the initial to the mid-life stage of the battery. This research has practical values for battery technologies and contributes to accelerating the technology adoption in the industry.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tier Non-Terrestrial Networking for Disaster Communications: A Layered Clustering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is crucial to deploy temporary non-terrestrial networks (NTN) in disaster situations where terrestrial networks are no longer operable. Deploying uncrewed aerial vehicle base stations (UAV-BSs) can provide a radio access network (RAN); however, the backhaul link may also be damaged and unserviceable in such disaster conditions. In this regard, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) spark attention as they can be deployed as super macro base stations (SMBS) and data centers. Therefore, in this study, we investigate a three-layer heterogeneous network with different topologies to prolong the lifespan of the temporary network by using UAV-BSs for RAN services and HAPS-SMBS as a backhaul. Furthermore, a two-layer clustering algorithm is proposed to handle the UAV-BS ad-hoc networking effectively.</description>

      <title>Augmented Voices: An Augmented Reality Experience Highlighting the Social Injustices of Gender-Based Violence in the Muslim South-Asian Diaspora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper delves into the distressing prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV) and its deep-seated psychological ramifications, particularly among Muslim South Asian women living in diasporic communities. Despite the gravity of GBV, these women often face formidable barriers in voicing their experiences and accessing support. "Augmented Voices" emerges as a technological beacon, harnessing the potential of augmented reality (AR) to bridge the digital and physical realms through mobile devices, enhancing the visibility of these often-silenced voices. With its technological motivation firmly anchored in the convergence of AR and real-world interactions, "Augmented Voices" offers a digital platform where storytelling acts as a catalyst, bringing to the fore the experiences shared by these women. By superimposing their narratives onto physical locations via Geographic Information System (GIS) Mapping, the application "augments their voices" in the diaspora, providing a conduit for expression and solidarity. This project, currently at its developmental stage, aspires to elevate the stories of GBV victims to a level where their struggles are not just heard but felt, forging a powerful connection between the user and the narrative. It is designed to transcend the limitations of conventional storytelling, creating an "augmented" reality where voices that are often muted by societal constraints can resonate powerfully. The project underscores the urgent imperative to confront GBV, catalyzing societal transformation and fostering robust support networks for those in the margins. It is a pioneering example of how technology can become a formidable ally in the fight for social justice and the empowerment of the oppressed. Additionally, this paper delves into the AR workflow illustrating its relevance and contribution to the broader theme of site-specific AR for social justice.</description>

      <title>DGR: Tackling Drifted and Correlated Noise in Quantum Error Correction via Decoding Graph Re-weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from high error rates and noise, which makes directly running applications on them ineffective. Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is a critical technique towards fault tolerance which encodes the quantum information distributively in multiple data qubits and uses syndrome qubits to check parity. Minimum-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) is a popular QEC decoder that takes the syndromes as input and finds the matchings between syndromes that infer the errors. However, there are two paramount challenges for MWPM decoders. First, as noise in real quantum systems can drift over time, there is a potential misalignment with the decoding graph's initial weights, leading to a severe performance degradation in the logical error rates. Second, while the MWPM decoder addresses independent errors, it falls short when encountering correlated errors typical on real hardware, such as those in the 2Q depolarizing channel.
  We propose DGR, an efficient decoding graph edge re-weighting strategy with no quantum overhead. It leverages the insight that the statistics of matchings across decoding iterations offer rich information about errors on real quantum hardware. By counting the occurrences of edges and edge pairs in decoded matchings, we can statistically estimate the up-to-date probabilities of each edge and the correlations between them. The reweighting process includes two vital steps: alignment re-weighting and correlation re-weighting. The former updates the MWPM weights based on statistics to align with actual noise, and the latter adjusts the weight considering edge correlations.
  Extensive evaluations on surface code and honeycomb code under various settings show that DGR reduces the logical error rate by 3.6x on average-case noise mismatch with exceeding 5000x improvement under worst-case mismatch.</description>

      <title>Follow-Me AI: Energy-Efficient User Interaction with Smart Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces Follow-Me AI, a concept designed to enhance user interactions with smart environments, optimize energy use, and provide better control over data captured by these environments. Through AI agents that accompany users, Follow-Me AI negotiates data management based on user consent, aligns environmental controls as well as user communication and computes resources available in the environment with user preferences, and predicts user behavior to proactively adjust the smart environment. The manuscript illustrates this concept with a detailed example of Follow-Me AI in a smart campus setting, detailing the interactions with the building's management system for optimal comfort and efficiency. Finally, this article looks into the challenges and opportunities related to Follow-Me AI.</description>
