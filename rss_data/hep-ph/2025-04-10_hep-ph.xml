      <title>Scattering and gluon emission of physical quarks in a SU(3) colored field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the scattering of the gluon-dressed physical quarks, defined as the eigenstates of the vacuum QCD Hamiltonian, off a colored medium. We solve the wavefunction of the physical quark state by diagonalizing the QCD Hamiltonian in vacuum in a $\ket{q}+\ket{qg}$ Fock space, with implementing the sector-dependent mass renormalization scheme. We then perform numerical simulations of the real-time quantum state evolution of the initially dressed quark state at various medium densities. The results are compared with those of an initially bare or off-shell quark states. With the obtained light-front wavefunction of the evolved state, we extract the quark jet transverse momentum broadening, the quenching parameter, the cross section, the gluon emission rate, and the evolution of the invariant mass. The scenario considered is relevant for high energy scattering processes, where the quark originates from far outside the color field describing the scattering target. This investigation on dressed quarks complements our earlier studies of the single quark scattering in the $\ket{q}$ Fock space, and of the bare quark scattering in the $\ket{q}+\ket{qg}$ Fock space, providing a novel systematic description of quark scattering process using a non-perturbative formalism.</description>

      <title>A Robust Determination of Antinuclei Production from Dark Matter via Weakly Decaying Beauty Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) Collaboration presented tentative evidence for the detection of cosmic antihelion-3 (${}^3\overline{\rm He}$) events, alongside a comparable number of antideuterons ($\overline{\rm D}$). If confirmed, these observations could revolutionize our understanding of cosmic-ray production and propagation and/or serve as compelling indirect evidence for dark matter. Given that the detection of cosmic $\overline{\rm D}$ is already at the limit of AMS-02 sensitivity, explaining the observation of ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ even within the standard coalescence framework poses a significant challenge. It has recently been shown that a previously overlooked mechanism within the Standard Model of particle physics-namely, the production of antihelion via the displaced-vertex decay of $\bar{\Lambda}_b^0$ baryons-could substantially enhance the ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ flux arising from dark matter-induced processes. In light of these challenges, we present a tuning of Pythia that is consistent with LEP data on the fragmentation function of $b$ quarks into $b$-hadrons-a critical factor for determining the $\bar{\Lambda}_b^0$ multiplicity-and with ALICE and ALEPH data for the $\overline{\rm D}$ and ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ spectra, which we employ to determine our coalescence model. Our refined Pythia tuning, in conjunction with our coalescence model, results in a predicted branching ratio for the production of ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ from $\bar{\Lambda}_b^0$ decays that is consistent with the recent upper limit measured by LHCb. Furthermore, our prediction indicates that the contribution of $\overline{\rm D}$ and ${}^3\overline{\rm He}$ from beauty-hadron decays is negligible relative to the direct production from hadronization.</description>

      <title>Primordial neutrinos fade to gray: constraints from cosmological observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of potentially large distortions of the relic neutrino spectra on cosmological observables.To that end, we consider a phenomenological model of "gray" spectral distributions, described by a single parameter which generalizes the traditional $y$-distortions to possibly large negative values. Implementing these distortions in the primordial nucleosynthesis code PRIMAT, we can constrain the distortion parameter along with the presence of extra radiation, exploiting the complementarity of big bang nucleosynthesis and cosmic microwave background measurements to disentangle gravitational and non-thermal effects. These constraints rule out a distortion where more than $\sim 1/2$ of the neutrinos energy density is replaced by dark radiation. Nonetheless, we find that large distortions, accompanied by extra radiation, are allowed-and even slightly preferred in some cases-by current cosmological observations. As this scenario would require substantial modifications to the physics of neutrino decoupling in the early Universe, these observational constraints call for a renewed attention on the possibility of large deviations from the standard cosmological model in the neutrino sector.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting new dark physics with the next generation of atomic clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide classes of new fundamental physics theories cause apparent variations in particle mass ratios in space and time. In theories that violate the weak equivalence principle (EP), those variations are not uniform across all particles and may be detected with atomic and molecular clock frequency comparisons. In this work we explore the potential to detect those variations with near-future clock comparisons. We begin by searching published clock data for variations in the electron-proton mass ratio. We then undertake a statistical analysis to model the noise in a variety of clock pairs that can be built in the near future according to the current state of the art, determining their sensitivity to various fundamental physics signals. Those signals are then connected to constraints on fundamental physics theories that lead directly or indirectly to an effective EP-violating, including those motivated by dark matter, dark energy, the vacuum energy problem, unification or other open questions of fundamental physics. This work results in projections for tight new bounds on fundamental physics that could be achieved with atomic and molecular clocks within the next few years. Our code for this work is packaged into a forecast tool that translates clock characteristics into bounds on fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Probing the UV with IR Axion Dark Matter Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is an ongoing and future experimental program searching for axions as both extensions of the Standard Model and as candidates for the observed dark matter. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of being able to pin down precise features of axions within the context of this program. We define a set of infrared data that can be probed by experiments and explain how it encodes the ultraviolet data defining particular models of the QCD axion. We then critically examine the extent to which these data can be determined. If the parameters are favorable, we will be able to determine the axion couplings to photons, electrons, nuclei, as well as the dark matter halo density. However, further experimental proposals are needed to fully flesh out the ultraviolet model of the axion.</description>

      <title>Strongly coupled inert scalar sector with radiative neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological implications of a model with an extended scalar sector, incorporating strongly coupled inert Higgs doublets. The model introduces three Higgs doublets: one interacting with the $SU(2)$ symmetry of the Standard Model and two inert doublets belonging to a strongly interacting sector, within the $SU(2)_2 \times SU(2)_1 \times U(1)_Y$ electroweak gauge symmetry, which is supplemented by the spontaneously broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and preserved $\mathbb{Z}_2'$ discrete symmetries. In this model, the top quark and exotic fermion masses arise from renormalizable Yukawa interactions at tree level, the masses of the SM charged fermions lighter than the top quark are generated via a tree-level seesaw mechanism, and the tiny neutrino masses emerge from a one-loop-level radiative seesaw mechanism. The model is consistent with constraints from charged lepton flavor-violating processes, electroweak precision observables, and the Higgs diphoton decay rate, as well as with the constraints resulting from the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. Furthermore, it successfully complies with the constraints arising from the $95$ GeV diphoton excess.</description>

      <title>Empirical Determination of the Kaon Distribution Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach to extract the Kaon leading-twist distribution amplitude (DA) from empirical information on the ratio of the neutral-to-charged kaon electromagnetic form factors, $\mathcal{R}_K$. Our study employs a two-parameter representation of the DA at $\zeta=2$ GeV, designed to capture the expected broadening and asymmetry of the distribution, as well as the soft endpoint behavior predicted by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our leading-order analysis of the latest experimental measurements of $\mathcal{R}_K$ reveals that the extracted DA exhibits a somewhat significant skewness, with the first symmetric moment approximately $\langle 1-2x \rangle_K= 0.082(7)$. On the other hand, the brodaness and general shape of the produced distributions show a reasonable consistency with contemporaty lattice and continuum QCD analyses. These findings highlight the importance of accurately determining the profile of the DA, especially the skewness and its relation to $SU_F(3)$ flavor symmetry breaking, as well as the inclusion of higher-order effects in the hard-scattering kernels for analyzing data at experimentally accessible scales.</description>

      <title>Constraining the 3HDM Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the standard ways to study scenarios beyond the Standard Model involves extending the Higgs Sector. This work examines the Three Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) in a Type-Z or democratic setup, where each Higgs doublet couples exclusively to a specific type of fermion. The particle spectrum of the 3HDM includes four charged Higgs bosons, two CP-odd scalars, and three CP-even scalars. This work investigates the allowed mass and coupling parameter space in the Type-Z 3HDM after imposing all theoretical and experimental constraints. We extract the allowed parameter space under three distinct alignment-limit conditions or mass hierarchies leveraging machine learning techniques. Specifically, we analyze scenarios where the 125 GeV Higgs is the lightest, an intermediary, or the heaviest CP-even Higgs boson. Our findings indicate that while a single lighter CP-even Higgs boson below 125 GeV still remains a possibility, the presence of two lighter Higgses is ruled out.</description>

      <title>Probing fluctuating protons using forward neutrons in soft and hard inelastic proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for the distribution of the number of forward neutrons emitted in soft (minimum bias) and hard inelastic proton-nucleus ($pA$) scattering at the LHC. It is based on the Gribov-Glauber model for the distribution over the number of inelastic collisions (wounded nucleons) combined with a parametrization of cross section (color) fluctuations in the projectile proton, which depend on the parton momentum fraction $x_p$, and the assumption of independent neutron emissions. It allows us to qualitatively explain the ATLAS data on the ZDC energy spectra of forward neutrons emitted in dijet production in inelastic $pA$ scattering at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV.</description>

      <title>$C$ and $CP$ violation in effective field theories and applications to $\eta$-meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quest for sources of the simultaneous violation of $C$ and $CP$ symmetry was popular in the 1960s, but has since been neglected for a long time. We revisit the operators that break $C$ and $CP$ for flavor-conserving transitions in both the Standard Model effective field theory and the low-energy effective field theory, which subsequently can be matched to light-meson physics using chiral perturbation theory. As applications, we discuss in particular the $C$-odd Dalitz plot asymmetries in $\eta\to3\pi$, but also decays with dilepton pairs in the final state, such as long-distance contributions to the rare semileptonic decays $\eta\to\pi^0\ell^+\ell^-$ as well as asymmetries in $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \gamma \ell^+\ell^-$ and $\eta^{(\prime)} \to \pi^+\pi^-\ell^+\ell^-$.</description>

      <title>Axion dark matter search from terrestrial magnetic fields at extremely low frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The natural environment of the Earth can act as a sensitive detector for dark matter in ultralight axions. When axions with masses between $1\times10^{-15}\,{\rm eV}$ and $1\times10^{-13}\,{\rm eV}$ pass through the Earth, they interact with the global geomagnetic field, generating electromagnetic (EM) waves in the extremely low-frequency range ($0.3$--$30\,{\rm Hz}$) through axion-photon coupling. This paper is one of a series of companion papers for~\cite{Taruya:2025zql}, focusing on the data analysis method and search results for an axion signal. Utilizing the theoretical predictions of axion-induced EM spectra from a companion study, we analyzed long-term observational data of terrestrial magnetic fields in this frequency band to search for axion-induced signals. Our analysis identified 65 persistent signal candidates with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3. Aside from these candidates, we placed a new upper bound on the axion-photon coupling parameter, significantly refining the previous constraint from CAST by at most two orders of magnitude down to $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 4\times10^{-13} \,{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for the axion mass around $3 \times 10^{-14}\,{\rm eV}$.</description>

      <title>Strong Decays of Charmonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we calculate the charmonium spectrum and strong decay widths of cc states. The calculations are performed using the quark potential model with which incorporates the relativistic effects. The resulting cc spectrum exhibits a good agreement with experimental data. The open flavor strong decay widths are calculated employing the 3P0 model. We adopt two choices of wave functions to determine the observables: the first involves the utilization of realistic wave functions obtained by solving relativistic Schrodinger equation, while the second employs Simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) wave functions whose parameters are fitted to the realistic wave functions. We find that the decay widths of higher charmonia states above the threshold value of open charm mesons are well described with these wave functions. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the strong decay widths and assigned specific charmonium states: X(3940) is assigned to the {\eta}c(3S) state, Y (4660) to the {\psi}(5S) state, X(3915) to the \c{hi}0(2P) state, Zc(3900) to the hc(2P) state, X(4350) to the \c{hi}2(3P) state, and X(3842) to the {\psi}3(1D) state. We also compare our results with available experimental data and theoretical predictions of other models.</description>

      <title>Molecular nature of hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{c\bar{c}s}$ with strangeness $S=-1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hidden-charm pentaquark states with strangeness $S=-1$ ($P_{c\bar{c}s}$) within an off-shell coupled-channel approach based on effective Lagrangians that respect heavy-quark spin symmetry, SU(3) flavor symmetry, and hidden local symmetry. All relevant meson-baryon two-body channels composed of low-lying anti-charmed mesons and singly-charmed baryons with $S=-1$, as well as the $J/\psi \Lambda$ channel, are included. We find a total of eleven negative-parity states and three positive-parity states. AMong the negative-parity states, the $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4338)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)$ can be naturally interpreted as $\bar{D} \Xi_c$ and $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ molecular states, respectively. We identify a second state, $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4472)$, located close to the $P_{c\bar{c}s}(4459)$ but with different spin and width, which may correspond to the structure observed by the Belle Collaboration. Both states are generated from the $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c$ channel and can be interpreted as spin partners. Their properties are consistent with recent experimental observations, providing strong support for the molecular interpretation of the $P_{c\bar{c}s}$ states. We also observe a two-pole structure near the $\bar{D}_s^* \Lambda_c$ and $\bar{D}^* \Xi_c'$ channel depending on spin-parity.</description>

      <title>Electroweak baryogenesis in 2HDM without EDM cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two Higgs doublet models with successful electroweak baryogenesis but without cancellations of electric dipole moments (EDMs). For the baryogenesis, additional scalar bosons are favored to couple mainly with the top quark with CP violations. However, if they also couple to light fermions of the Standard Model, the model is limited severely by EDMs, and additional CP phases irrelevant to the baryogenesis are often introduced to cancel the contributions to the EDMs. Alternatively, we consider a scenario where the light-fermion couplings are suppressed to avoid the constraints. In our scenario, it is found that the leading contributions arise in the top-quark EDMs at the two-loop level. They induce the electron, neutron, and proton EDMs via radiative corrections. Since there is no additional CP-violating phase, they are correlated with the baryon asymmetry. We show that our scenario is compatible with the current experimental bounds and is within the scope of future EDM experiments.</description>

      <title>Inflection Point Inflation in Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inflection point inflation generated by a polynomial superpotential and a canonical K\"ahler potential under the supergravity framework, where only one chiral superfield is needed. We find that the special form of the scalar potential limits the inflationary Hubble parameter to values $\lesssim 10^{10}\, \textrm{GeV}$ and the inflaton mass to $\lesssim 10^{11} \, \textrm{GeV}$. We obtain analytic results for small field cases and present numerical results for large field ones. We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r&lt;10^{-8}$ is always suppressed in these models, while the running of spectral index $\alpha\approx \mathcal{O}(-10^{-3})$ may be testable in next-generation CMB experiments. We also discuss the possible effects of SUSY breaking Polonyi term presented in the superpotential where we find a general upper bound for the SUSY breaking scale for a given value of the Hubble parameter.</description>

      <title>The effect of background matter on the spin oscillations of neutrinos scattered by the supermassive black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spin oscillations of neutrinos in relativistic moving matter inside an accretion disk. These neutrinos are gravitationally scattered off a spinning Kerr black hole surrounded by a thick accretion disk. The disk can co-rotate and counter-rotate with respect to BH spin. We perform numerical simulations of the propagation of a large number of incoming test neutrinos. We briefly discuss our results.</description>

      <title>Testing Leptogenesis from Observable Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leptogenesis provides an elegant mechanism to explain the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe (BAU), yet its experimental verification remains challenging due to requirements of either extremely heavy right-handed neutrinos or precisely fine-tuned mass splittings. We adapt a solution by introducing an extra scalar field that significantly enhances $CP$ asymmetry through loop-level contributions. This scalar extension not only facilitates successful leptogenesis but also enables a strong first-order electroweak phase transition, generating potentially observable gravitational waves (GWs). We demonstrate a strong correlation between the generated BAU and the GW signal strength, establishing a unique way to test the leptogenesis. We show that when the model achieves a successful BAU, the resulting GW signal from EWPT can have signal-to-noise ratio of $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ at the upcoming LISA and DECIGO experiments, respectively. This work presents a concrete connection between successful leptogenesis and detectable GWs, offering a promising method for experimental testing of the leptogenesis mechanism through future GW observations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-range field configurations exist in the Proca theory and their non-equilibrium evolution is of interest in this work. General arguments suggest that a charge can be assigned to them and that its evolution is governed by the law of periodic charge oscillations. We discuss an elegant analytically-solvable example of a field configuration in the Proca theory respecting such a law. We also identify a weak point in the aforementioned general arguments, construct the counterexample to the law of periodic charge oscillations in the Proca theory, and comprehensively discuss it. The Gibbs-Wilbraham phenomenon is discussed in the course of these studies.</description>

      <title>$B$ meson semileptonic decays from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $B$ processes are a rich source of potential anomalies that could lead to the discovery of BSM physics. The long-standing tension between the inclusive and the exclusive determinations of the CKM matrix elements $|V_{xb}|$, or the current tensions in the $R(D)$-$R(D^\ast)$ plane are some examples of active areas of research where we might find signals of new physics. Heavy-to-heavy $B$ semileptonic decays, $B_{(s)}\to D^{(\ast)}_{(s)}\ell\nu$, and in particular, decays with a vector product ($D^\ast_{(s)}$) are especially interesting from an experimental point of view, but experiment and theory must walk together in order to reach conclusions in the intensity frontier. In this review I talk about the current status of the lattice-QCD calculations of the $B\to D^{\ast}\ell\nu$ form factors at non-zero recoil, I discuss the implications they have for the determination of $B$ anomalies, and finally I give some hints of what we can expect from future calculations.</description>

      <title>Conversion-Driven Freeze-Out: A Common Framework for Dark Matter and Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore dark matter genesis beyond the WIMP paradigm, focusing on the mechanism of conversion-driven freeze-out. This mechanism enables the thermalization of dark matter despite its very weak couplings. While the scenario evades conventional WIMP searches, it predicts novel signatures of long-lived particles at colliders, making it a prime target for upcoming LHC searches. We review various model realizations of this mechanism, highlighting its deep connections to other unresolved problems of the Standard Model. In particular, we show how conversion-driven freeze-out can naturally give rise to baryogenesis, offering a compelling perspective on the origins of both dark and baryonic matter.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter we give a pedagogical introduction to the constituent quark model. The explanation of magnetic moments of the nucleons was crucial to introduce an effective quark mass for light quarks that nowadays are understood as an effect of Spontaneous Chiral Symmetry Breaking in QCD. We give an overview of the first applications of the model and an introduction to the most modern developments studying states beyond the naive quark model as tetraquarks and pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>Biased domain walls: faster annihilation, weaker gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of domain wall networks and their phenomenological implications in a model of a real scalar $\chi$, where a $Z_2$-symmetry is slightly broken by a potential bias $V_{bias}$. It is demonstrated that the latter triggers domain wall annihilation considerably earlier than previously thought. Namely, we observe that the scaling relation $t_{ann} \propto 1/V^{2/3}_{bias}$ for the annihilation time $t_{ann}$ fits to the simulation data better than a commonly assumed $t_{ann} \propto 1/V_{bias}$. As a result, the energy density of gravitational waves produced by the network of biased domain walls, for a given tiny $V_{bias}$, is suppressed compared to naive expectations. The spectral shape of gravitational waves is similar to that resulting from unbiased domain walls, but with more power in the close-to-maximum ultraviolet part. In the far ultraviolet region, the spectrum of gravitational waves becomes nearly flat; such a plateau has been recognized earlier in the case of unbiased walls. In our investigation we mainly focus on the symmetry breaking potential $V_{breaking} \propto \chi^3$, and argue that no significant modifications of the domain walls evolution take place if one includes higher powers of $\chi$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter could be composed of macroscopic objects with large masses and geometric cross-sections spanning many decades. We investigate the potential interaction of such `stuff-sized' dark matter by considering its interactions with asteroids, planetary rings, and terrestrial bodies. This hail of dark matter could catastrophically destroy these Solar System objects, evaporate them from their orbits, or cause substantial cratering. We estimate these effects and use them to place competitive bounds on a wide, previously-unconstrained swathe of the dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy with AdS-dS transitions vs. Baryon Acoustic Oscillations at $z =$ 2.3-2.4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, written in memory of Alexei Starobinsky, we discuss the observational viability of the Ph-$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model - a dynamical dark energy scenario based on a phantom scalar field undergoing an anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) transition - and revisit the Sahni-Shtanov braneworld model in light of updated BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \sim 2.3$. Both models are able to remain consistent with Planck CMB data while offering potential resolutions to the $H_0$ tension. In both cases, the expansion rate $H(z)$ is suppressed relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM at high redshift and enhanced at low redshift, while remaining consistent with the comoving distance to recombination as estimated by Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. Comparing model predictions with BAO-inferred values of $H(z)$, we find that SDSS Ly-$\alpha$ data at $z \approx 2.33$ mildly favor such dynamical models, whereas the recent DESI Ly-$\alpha$ measurements agree more closely with $\Lambda$CDM. Although current high-redshift BAO data do not decisively favor one model over another, our findings illustrate how frameworks originally developed to address earlier anomalies - such as the braneworld scenario - may gain renewed relevance in confronting today's cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>$\Xi_c \to \Xi$ form factors from lattice QCD with domain-wall quarks: a new piece in the puzzle of $\Xi_c^0$ decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD determination of the vector and axial-vector form factors that describe the charm-baryon semileptonic decays $\Xi_c\to \Xi \ell^+ \nu_\ell$. The calculation uses a domain-wall action for the up, down, and strange quarks, and an anisotropic clover action for the charm quark. We use four ensembles of gauge-field configurations generated by the RBC and UKQCD collaborations, with lattice spacings between 0.111 and 0.073 fm and pion masses ranging from 420 to 230 MeV. We present Standard-Model predictions for the decay rates and branching fractions of $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi_c^-\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ and $\Xi_c^+\to\Xi_c^0\ell^+ \nu_\ell$ for $\ell=e,\mu$. In particular, we obtain $\Gamma(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- e^+ \nu_e)/|V_{cs}|^2 = 0.2515(73)\text{ ps}^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{B}(\Xi_c^0 \to \Xi^- e^+ \nu_e) = 3.58(12)\:\%$. These values are higher than those predicted by a previous lattice calculation and substantially higher than the experimentally measured values, but consistent with expectations from approximate $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parton distribution functions (PDFs) describe the inner, non-perturbative structure of hadrons. Their computation involves matrix elements with a Wilson line along a direction on the light cone, posing significant challenges in Euclidean lattice calculations, where the time direction is not directly accessible. We propose implementing the light-front Wilson line within the Hamiltonian formalism using tensor network techniques. The approach is demonstrated in the massive Schwinger model (quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions), a toy model that shares key features with quantum chromodynamics. We present accurate continuum results for the fermion PDF of the vector meson at varying fermion masses, obtained from first principle calculations directly in Minkowski space. Our strategy also provides a useful path for quantum simulations and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Evidence for Non-Minimal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observational evidence of deviations from the $\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model points towards the presence of evolving dark energy. The simplest possibility consists of a cosmological scalar field $\varphi$, dubbed quintessence, driving the accelerated expansion. We assess the evidence for the existence of such a scalar field. We find that, if the accelerated expansion is driven by quintessence, the data favour a potential energy $V(\varphi)$ that is concave, i.e., $m^2=d^2V/d\varphi^2&lt;0$. Furthermore, and more significantly, the data strongly favour a scalar field that is non-minimally coupled to gravity (Bayes factor $\log(B) = 7.34 \pm 0.60$), leading to time variations in the gravitational constant on cosmological scales, and the existence of fifth forces on smaller scales. The fact that we do not observe such fifth forces implies that either new physics must come into play on non-cosmological scales or that quintessence is an unlikely explanation for the observed cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Exploratory calculation of the rare hyperon decay $\Sigma^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rare hyperon decay $\Sigma^+ \to p \ell^+ \ell^-$ is a flavour-changing neutral current process mediated by an $s \to d$ transition that occurs only at loop level within the Standard Model. Consequently, this decay is highly suppressed, making it a promising avenue for probing potential new physics. While phenomenological calculations have made important progress in predicting the decay amplitude, there remains a four-fold ambiguity in the relevant transition form factors that prevents a unique prediction for the branching fraction and angular observables. Fully resolving this ambiguity requires a first-principles Standard-Model calculation, and the recent observation of this process using LHCb Run 2 data reinforces the timeliness of such a calculation. In this work, we present the first lattice-QCD calculation of this decay, performed using a 2+1-flavour domain-wall fermion ensemble with a pion mass of 340 MeV. At a small baryon source-sink separation, we observe the emergence of a signal in the relevant baryonic four-point functions. This allows us to determine the positive-parity form factors for the rare hyperon decays from first-principles, albeit with large statistical and systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Meets DESI: Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 observations indicate that dark energy has crossed from phantom to quintessence regime, a behavior known as the quintom-B realization. In this work we constrain dynamical dark energy and modified gravity using the swampland Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC), which forbids eternal acceleration since in this case any trans-Planckian quantum fluctuation would eventually stretch beyond the Hubble radius, breaking the applicability of any effective field theory and cosmological techniques. By combining DESI DR2 data with the TCC criterion, we impose tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state and its parameter space in scenarios such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder, Barboza-Alcaniz, Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan, EXP and LOG parameterizations, significantly constraining the quintom-A behavior. Also we examine models within the framework of $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$ modified gravity theories, demonstrating that TCC is very powerful to constrain or exclude them, a result that indicates the necessity to consider infrared modifications on General Relativity apart from the usual ultraviolet ones. Our findings imply that viable dynamical dark energy scenarios must asymptotically transit to deceleration, shedding light on new physics consistent with both cosmological observations and quantum gravity principles.</description>

Abstract: Affleck-Dine (AD) baryogenesis can produce the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field. The field generally fragments into Q-balls, whose rapid decay induces enhanced gravitational waves. In this Letter, we investigate the anisotropies in this gravitational wave background as a new essential observable for AD baryogenesis. The evolution of AD field causes non-Gaussian baryonic isocurvature perturbations, and the non-Gaussianity modulates the spatial distribution of Q-balls on large scales, resulting in large-scale anisotropies in the Q-ball-induced gravitational wave background. We present that the anisotropies can be significantly large with a reduced angular power spectrum $\sim 10^{-2}$, and can be detected by future experiments like LISA. Moreover, these anisotropies universally reveal the $CP$-violating dynamics of AD field, opening a novel road to explore the longstanding baryon asymmetry puzzle.</description>

      <title>Resummation of Universal Tails in Gravitational Waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a formula for the universal anomalous scaling of the multipole moments of a generic gravitating source in classical general relativity. We derive this formula in two independent ways using effective field theory methods. First, we use the absorption of low frequency gravitational waves by a black hole to identify the total multipole scaling dimension as the renormalized angular momentum of black hole perturbation theory. More generally, we show that the anomalous dimension is determined by phase shifts of gravitational waves elastically scattering off generic source multipole moments, which reproduces the renormalized angular momentum in the particular case of black holes. The effective field theory approach thus clarifies the role of the renormalized angular momentum in the multipole expansion. The universality of the point-particle effective description of compact gravitating systems further allows us to extract the universal part of the anomalous dimension, which is the same for any object, including black holes, neutron stars, and binary systems. As an application, we propose a novel resummation of the universal short-distance logarithms (``tails'') in the gravitational waveform of binary systems, which may improve the modeling of signals from current and future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Stupendously Large Primordial Black Holes from the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflationary diffusion of (pseudo-)scalar fields with discrete symmetries can seed the formation of a gas of closed domain walls after inflation, when the distance between degenerate minima in field space is not too far from the inflationary Hubble scale. Primordial black holes (PBHs) can then be formed once sufficiently heavy domain walls re-enter the Hubble sphere. In this scenario, inflation determines a distinctive PBH mass distribution that is rather flat and can thus lead to a sizable total abundance of PBHs, while avoiding some of the downsides of PBH formation from critical collapse. We show that generic QCD axion models, with decay constant close to the inflationary Hubble scale, can yield up to $1\%$ of the dark matter (DM) today in the form of PBHs, while being compatible with isocurvature constraints from Cosmic Microwave Background observations. This occurs for values of axion decay constants around $f_a\simeq 10^{8}~\text{GeV}$, that is the region targeted by axion helioscopes and partially constrained by astrophysical observations. The resulting PBHs have \textit{stupendously} large masses, above $10^{11}M_\odot$, and their existence can be probed by Large Scale Structure observations. Larger PBH abundances can be generated by axion-like particles. Alternatively, in scenarios where isocurvature constraints can be relaxed, we find that the totality of the DM can be produced by the QCD axion misalignment mechanism, accompanied by a ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ DM fraction in PBHs of masses $(10^5-10^6)~M_\odot$. These can act as seeds for the formation of massive black holes at large redshifts, as suggested by recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>The generation of baryon asymmetry and hypermagnetic field by the chiral vortical effect in the presence of sphalerons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the temperature-dependent chiral vortical effect can generate hypermagnetic fields and matter-antimatter asymmetries, in the symmetric phase of the early Universe, in the temperature range $100\mbox{GeV} \le T\le 10\mbox{TeV}$, even in the presence of the weak sphaleron processes. We take into account all perturbative chirality-flip processes, as well as the nonperturbative Abelian and non-Abelian anomalous effects for all three generations. Using the constraints and conservation laws in the plasma, we reduce the number of required evolution equations. We also simplify the anomalous transport coefficients, accordingly. We consider both monochromatic and continuous spectra for the hypermagnetic and velocity fields to solve the anomalous magnetohydrodynamics equations. We then show that overlapping small transient fluctuations in the temperature of some matter degrees of freedom and vorticity of the plasma can generate a chiral vortical current, resulting in the generation of strong hypermagnetic fields and matter-antimatter asymmetries, all starting from zero initial values. We obtain the baryon asymmetry $\eta_{B}\simeq 5\times10^{-10}$ and a positive helicity hypermagnetic field with amplitude $B_{Y}(x)\simeq10^{19}G$, at the onset of the electroweak phase transition. Although the sphaleron processes tend to washout the generated $(\rm B +L)$ asymmetry, the anomalous processes prevail and the baryogenesis and leptogenesis occur without $(\rm B-L)$ violation.</description>

      <title>Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment in Noncommutative Space-Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explanation of the muon anomalous magnetic moment ($\mu$-AMM) requires new physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we investigate the effects of noncommutative space-time on the $\mu$-AMM within the Seiberg-Witten map framework, analyzing both tree-level and loop-level diagrams. Additionally, we examine the $\mu$-AMM by studying the scattering cross-section of electron-positron annihilation into muon-antimuon pairs $ (e^- e^+ \rightarrow \mu^- \mu^+ ) $. Previous studies have explored the implications of noncommutative space-time through various processes, leading to different bounds on the noncommutative parameter $\theta^{\mu\nu}$. Our analysis estimates $\theta^{\mu\nu} \sim (43 \, \mathrm TeV)^{-2} $ for both tree-level and loop-level contributions when noncommutative space-time accounts for the entire observed $\mu$-AMM. If noncommutative effects are responsible for only 10$\%$ of the $\mu$-AMM, the constraint relaxes to approximately $(136 \, \mathrm TeV)^{-2}$. Furthermore, by comparing the noncommutative cross-section of $ e^- e^+ \rightarrow \mu^- \mu^+ $ with experimental data, we derive an approximate bound of $(90 \, \mathrm TeV)^{-2}$ which corresponds to a 23$\%$ contribution to the $\mu$-AMM.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P-$wave doubly charmed and bottom baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the strong decays for $P-$wave excited states of doubly charmed and bottom baryons in the constituent quark model. Our results indicate that some $\lambda-$mode $\Xi_{cc/bb}(1P)$ and $\Omega_{cc/bb}(1P)$ states are relatively narrow, which are very likely to be discovered by future experiments. The light meson emissions for the low-lying $\rho-$mode states are highly suppressed due to the orthogonality of wave functions between initial and final states. Moreover, the strong decay behaviors for doubly charmed and bottom baryons preserve the heavy superflavor symmetry well, where the small violation originates from the finite heavy quark masses and different phase spaces. We hope that present theoretical results for undiscovered doubly charmed and bottom baryons can provide helpful information for future experiments and help us to better understand the heavy quark symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19946v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the $e^+ e^- \to \gamma^* \to J/\psi \, \pi \, \pi \, (K \bar{K})$ and $e^+ e^- \to \gamma^* \to h_c \, \pi \, \pi$ processes employing the recently proposed Dalitz-plot decomposition approach, which is based on the helicity formalism for three-body decays. For the above reactions, we validate the factorization of the overall rotation for all decay chains and spin alignments, along with the crossing symmetry between final states, using a Lagrangian-based toy model. For the model-dependent factors that describe the subchannel dynamics, we employ the dispersive treatment of the $\pi \, \pi \, (K \bar{K})$ final state interaction, which accurately reproduces pole positions and couplings of the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonances. The constructed amplitudes serve as an essential framework to further constrain the properties of the charged exotic states $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_c(4020)$, produced in these reactions.</description>

      <title>Axion Dark Matter and Plateau-Plateau Transition in Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06038v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion dark matter inevitably generates electromagnetic radiation in quantum Hall effect experiments that use strong magnetic fields. Although these emissions are very weak, we have shown using a QCD axion model that they influence the plateau-plateau transition at low temperatures (below $100$ mK) in a system with a large surface area (greater than $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$) of two-dimensional electrons. By analyzing previous experiments that show saturation of the transition width $\Delta B$ as temperature and microwave frequency change, we provide evidence for the presence of axions. Notably, in most experiments without axion effects, the saturation frequency $f_s(T)$ is less than $1$ GHz at temperatures of $100$ mK or higher and for system sizes of $10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ or smaller. Additionally, the frequency $f_s(T)$ decreases with decreasing temperature or increasing system size. However, there are experiments that show a saturation frequency $f_s(T)\simeq 2.4$GHz despite a low temperature of 35 mK and a large surface area of $6.6\times 10^{-3}\rm cm^2$ for the Hall bar. This identical frequency of approximately $2.4$ GHz has also been observed in different plateau transitions and in Hall bars of varying sizes. These unexpected results are caused by axion microwaves. The saturation frequency $f_s=m_a/2\pi$ of $\simeq 2.4$ GHz implies an axion mass of $\simeq 10^{-5}$eV. By comparing the axion effect with thermal effect on the width $\Delta B$, we have shown the dominance of the axion effect over thermal effect at low temperature less than $50$mK. The dominance of the axion effect is attributed to significant absorption of axion energy, which is proportional to the square of the number of electrons involved.</description>

      <title>Investigating the universality of five-point QCD scattering amplitudes at high energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate $2 \to 3$ QCD scattering amplitudes in multi-Regge kinematics, i.e. where the final partons are strongly ordered in rapidity. In this regime amplitudes exhibit intriguing factorisation properties which can be understood in terms of effective degrees of freedom called \emph{reggeons}. Working within the Balitsky/JIMWLK framework, we predict these amplitudes for the first time to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic order, and compare against the limit of QCD scattering amplitudes in full colour and kinematics. We find that the latter can be described in terms of universal objects, and that the apparent non-universality arising at NNLL comes from well-defined and under-control contributions that we can predict. Thanks to this observation, we extract for the first time the universal vertex that controls the emission of the central-rapidity gluon, both in QCD and $N = 4$ super Yang-Mills.</description>

      <title>Constraining the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state via the $Z_c(3900)$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position to constrain the existence of the $DDD^*$ three-body bound state within the one-boson-exchange (OBE) model. The existence of the $DDD^*$ bound state remains uncertain due to significant variations in the OBE interaction, particularly in the strength of scalar-meson-exchange interactions, which can differ by a factor about 20 between two commonly used OBE models. This discrepancy renders the $DDD^*$ system highly model-dependent. To address this issue, we constrain the scalar-meson-exchange interaction using the $Z_c(3900)$ pole position, where the pseudoscalar-meson coupling is well-determined, and the $\rho$- and $\omega$-exchange interactions nearly cancel each other out, leaving the coupling constant of the $\sigma$-exchange as the only unknown parameter. Our results indicate that the isospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ $DDD^*$ bound states exist when $Z_c(3900)$ is a virtual state of $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ located within approximately $-15$ MeV of the threshold. However, the three-body bound state is gone when the $Z_c(3900)$ virtual state pole is more than $20$ MeV away from the threshold. Each experimental progress, either on the $DDD^*$ state or the $Z_c(3900)$, can shed light on the nature of the other state. Another significant outcome is a refined set of OBE model parameters calibrated using the pole positions of $X(3872)$, $T_{cc}(3875)$, and $Z_c(3900)$, rigorously addressing the cutoff dependence. These parameters provide a valuable resource for more accurate calculations of systems involving few-body $D$, $D^*$ and their antiparticles. Additionally, we find no evidence of the $DDD^*$ three-body resonances after extensive search using a combination of the Gaussian expansion method and the complex scaling method.</description>

      <title>Non-radial oscillations of hadronic neutron stars, quark stars, and hybrid stars : Calculation of $f$, $p$, and $g$ mode frequencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The composition and equation of state (EoS) of dense matter relevant to compact stars are quite inconclusive. However, certain observational constraints on the structural properties of compact stars help us constrain the EoS to a fair extent. Moreover, gravitational asteroseismology gives a notion of the composition and EoS of compact stars. The next generation gravitational wave (GW) detectors are likely to detect several oscillation mode frequencies of the GWs. In this work we compute the fundamental ($f$) and the first pressure ($p_1$) mode frequencies ($f_f$ and $f_{p1}$, respectively) with different compositions viz., hadronic, quark, and hybrid star (HS) matter. For HSs, we also study the gravity ($g$) mode frequency ($f_g$). For each phase we also study the correlation between the oscillation frequencies of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ and 2.01 $M_{\odot}$ compact stars with other different properties. We find that various possible composition of compact stars substantially affects the oscillation frequencies. However, the mass-scaled angular $f$ mode frequency ($\omega_f M$) varies universally with compactness ($C$) for all hadronic, quark and hybrid stars. The $f$ mode frequency ($f_{f_{1.4}}$) of the canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ compact star, obtained with different composition, is quite correlated with the canonical radius ($R_{1.4}$) and tidal deformability ($\Lambda_{1.4}$) while $f_{p_{1.4}}$ is well correlated with slope parameter of the symmetry energy. We also show that $f_{g_{1.4}}$ of the HSs varies almost linearly with $\Lambda_{1.4}$. Should $g$ modes be detected, they could not only support the existence of HSs, but $f_g$ could be useful to understand the strength of quark repulsion in HSs.</description>

Abstract: Considering the nonfactorizable QED corrections, the branching ratios and ratios of branching ratios $R(D_{s}^{({\ast})})$ for the semileptonic $\overline{B}_{s}$ ${\to}$ $D_{s}^{(\ast)} {\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decays are reevaluated. It is found that (a) the QED contributions can enhance the branching ratios and reduce the ratios $R(D_{s}^{({\ast})})$. (b) The $SU(3)$ flavor symmetry holds basically well in the ratios $R(D)$-$R(D^{\ast})$ for the semileptonic charmed $\overline{B}_{u,d,s}$ decays. (c) The current theoretical uncertainties of branching ratios ${\cal B}(\overline{B}_{s} {\to} D_{s}^{\ast} {\ell} \bar{\nu}_{\ell})$ from the form factors are very large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the axion production from the electron-nucleon scattering, i.e., the $eN\to e N a$ processes, being $N$ the proton and neutron. We simultaneously include three different types of axion interaction couplings within the chiral effective field theory, namely the axion-nucleon-nucleon couplings $g_{aNN}$, axion-photon-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ and axion-photon-vector meson resonances couplings $g_{\rho a\gamma}$ and $g_{\omega a\gamma}$. Vast inputs from the lattice QCD and hadron phenomenological studies are used to fix the unknown couplings. The relative strengths of different axion interactions in the $eN\to e N a$ processes are then revealed. We provide detailed predictions for the differential cross sections with respect to various angles and axion energy, as well as the total cross sections, both for the Kim-Shifman-Vainstein-Zakharov (KSVZ) and Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axion models.</description>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may form before cosmological first-order phase transitions, leading to inevitable collisions between PBHs and bubble walls. In this Letter, we have simulated for the first time the co-evolution of an expanding scalar wall passing through a black hole with full numerical relativity. This black hole-bubble wall collision yields multiple far-reaching phenomena, including the PBH mass growth, gravitational wave radiations, and momentum recoil that endows PBHs with additional velocities, approximately doubling the formation rate for PBH binaries and hence strengthening the observational constraints on the PBH abundances.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>

Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description when the EFT is generated via the interaction with heavy fields in UV theories.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a charged confining holographic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical and quantum chaos of closed strings on a recently constructed charged confining holographic background. The confining background corresponds to the charged soliton, which is a solution of minimal $d=5$ gauged supergravity. The solution has a compact spacelike direction with a Wilson line on a circle and asymptotes to $AdS_5$ with a planar boundary. For the classical case, we analyze the chaos using the power spectrum, Poincar\'{e} sections, and Lyapunov exponents, finding that both energy and charge play constructive effects on enhancing the chaotic nature of the system. We similarly analyze quantum chaos using the distribution of the spectrum's level-spacing and out-of-time-ordered correlators and thoroughly investigate the effects of charge and energy. A gradual transition from a chaotic to an integrable regime is obtained as the energy and charge increase from lower to higher values, with charge playing a subdominant role.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the impact of neutrino mass hierarchies on neutrino mass constraints in light of recent DESI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results from DESI combined with cosmic microwave background data give the tightest constraints on the sum of neutrino masses to date. However, these analyses approximate the neutrino mass hierarchy by three degenerate-mass (DM) neutrinos, instead of the normal (NH) and inverted hierarchies (IH) informed by terrestrial neutrino oscillation experiments. Given the stringency of the upper limits from DESI data, we test explicitly whether the inferred neutrino constraints are robust to the choice of neutrino mass ordering using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. For Planck data alone, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies while showing a strong dependence on the assumed lower bound of the prior, confirming previous studies. For the combined Planck and DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, we find that assuming NH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$) or IH ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.16\,\mathrm{eV}$) loosens the Bayesian upper limits compared to the DM approximation ($M_\mathrm{tot} &lt; 0.086\,\mathrm{eV}$). The frequentist analysis shows that the different neutrino models fit the data equally well and the loosening of the constraints can thus be attributed to the lower bounds induced by NH and IH. Overall, we find that the DM hierarchy presents a good approximation to the physically motivated hierarchies also for Planck+DESI data as long as the corresponding lower neutrino mass bounds are imposed.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rods and Clock in a Gravitational Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Chiral and isospin breaking in the two-flavor Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schwinger model with two massive fermions is a nontrivial theory for which no analytical solution is known. The strong coupling limit of the theory allows for different semiclassical approximations to extract properties of its low-lying spectrum. In particular, analytical results exist for the fermion condensate, the fermion mass dependence of the pseudoscalar meson mass or its decay constant. These approximations, nonetheless, are not able to quantitatively predict isospin breaking effects in the light spectrum, for example. In this paper we use lattice simulations to test various analytical predictions, and study isospin breaking effects from nondegenerate quark masses. We also introduce a low-energy effective field theory based on a nonlinear $\sigma$ model with a dilaton field, which leads to the correct fermion mass dependence of the pion mass, the correct $\sigma$-to-$\pi$ mass ratio and a prediction of the isospin breaking effects, which we test numerically.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>
