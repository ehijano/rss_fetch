      <title>Dependence of Microstructure Classification Accuracy on Crystallographic Data Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are increasingly being used to analyze and classify material microstructures, motivated by the possibility that they will be able to identify relevant microstructural features more efficiently and impartially than human experts. While up to now convolutional neural networks have mostly been applied to light optimal microscopy and scanning electron microscope micrographs, application to EBSD micrographs will be increasingly common as rational design generates materials with unknown textures and phase compositions. This raises the question of how crystallographic orientation should be represented in such a convolutional neural network, and whether this choice has a significant effect on the network's analysis and classification accuracy. Four representations of orientation information are examined and are used with convolutional neural networks to classify five synthetic microstructures with varying textures and grain geometries. Of these, a spectral embedding of crystallographic orientations in a space that respects the crystallographic symmetries performs by far the best, even when the network is trained on small volumes of data such as could be accessible by practical experiments.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Chiral Pairing enables Topological Superconductivity in Triangular Lattices without Spin-Orbit Coupling and Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a pathway to topological superconductivity in monolayer triangular lattices through long-range pairing without requiring spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, contrasting conventional frameworks reliant on superconductivity and spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking. Berry curvature analysis reveals spontaneous TRS-breaking-induced peaks or valleys under long-range pairing, signaling nontrivial topology superconducting state. Notably, the increase in the long-range pairing strength only changes the size of the energy band-gap, without triggering a topological phase transition. This characteristic is verified by calculating Berry curvature and topological edge states. In zigzag and armchair-edge ribbons of finite width, the topological edge states are regulated by the ribbon boundary symmetry and the interact range of long-range pairing. Under nearest-neighbor pairing, the topological edge states maintain particle-hole symmetry and matches the corresponding Chern number. However, next-nearest-neighbor and third-nearest-neighbor pairings break the particle-hole symmetry of the topological edge states in armchair-edge ribbon. This work proposes a mechanism for realizing topological superconductivity without relying on spin-orbit coupling and magnetic field, offering a theoretical foundation for simplifying the design of topological quantum devices.</description>

      <title>GO-Diff: Data-free and amortized global structure optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce GO-Diff, a diffusion-based method for global structure optimization that learns to directly sample low-energy atomic configurations without requiring prior data or explicit relaxation. GO-Diff is trained from scratch using a Boltzmann-weighted score-matching loss, leveraging only the known energy function to guide generation toward thermodynamically favorable regions. The method operates in a two-stage loop of self-sampling and model refinement, progressively improving its ability to target low-energy structures. Compared to traditional optimization pipelines, GO-Diff achieves competitive results with significantly fewer energy evaluations. Moreover, by reusing pretrained models across related systems, GO-Diff supports amortized optimization - enabling faster convergence on new tasks without retraining from scratch.</description>

      <title>Rippled Moire Superlattices for Decoupled Ferroelectric Bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry considerations suggest that moire superlattices formed by twisted two-dimensional materials should preserve overall inversion symmetry. However, experiments consistently report robust ferroelectricity in systems such as twisted bilayer h-BN, posing a fundamental discrepancy between theory and experiment regarding its microscopic origin. Here, using large-scale finite-field molecular dynamics simulations, we challenge the prevailing defect-pinning hypothesis and instead identify an out-of-plane bending field, induced by in-plane compressive strain, as the key symmetry-breaking mechanism. This strain-induced rippling drives spatially heterogeneous interlayer sliding and distorts the moire domain wall network, resulting in a four-state ferroelectric system. Remarkably, we show this mechanism can be harnessed at the nanoscale, where localized nanobubbles designate the moire lattice's fundamental hexagonal domain clusters as the smallest individually addressable ferroelectric bits, thereby imposing local control on an otherwise globally defined structure. Our findings establish a geometry-driven framework for understanding and engineering moire ferroelectrics, offering not only a route toward ultra-high-density, rewritable memory, but also a strategy for locally tuning the moire potential itself, a critical step for manipulating emergent correlated and topological quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Finite Element Modeling of Irradiation and Thermal Behavior Demonstrated on a Fuel-Assembly Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a modeling framework to represent the thermomechanical behavior of complex materials based on micromechanical dynamics. The framework is applied to nuclear fuel rod elements composed of Zircaloy-2 cladding tubes and spacer grids under typical Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) conditions. Thermal expansion and thermal creep are incorporated through a VPSC-FEM coupling with the finite element solver Code_Aster, enabling analysis of in-reactor behavior under combined thermal, mechanical, and irradiation loading. The model captures anisotropic deformation driven by crystallographic texture and prismatic slip activity under radial loading. Thermal creep, being stress-sensitive, contributes to early-stage stress relaxation and strain accumulation, leading to higher strain compared to the irradiation-only case. The interaction of thermal creep with irradiation mechanisms modifies the stress distribution and clearance evolution, with relaxation governed by prismatic slip. For fuel rod components, irradiation-induced mechanisms dominate the long-term clearance behavior, whereas thermal effects remain relevant in contact dynamics during thermal preloading. The stress-strain response is found to be more sensitive to micromechanical processes than to elastic constants. This high-resolution formulation enables predictive modeling of spacer-cladding interaction and provides a foundation for developing reduced-order models.</description>

      <title>Probing non-Markovian qubit noise and modeling Post Markovian Master Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the noise characteristics of quantum processors is crucial when achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, typical qubit designs are often studied under the Markovian approximation, which does not fully capture realistic dynamics. Factors such as qubit-qubit coupling and extended bath correlation times can introduce significant non-Markovian effects into the noise processes. In this study, we employ the Post-Markovian Master Equation (PMME) formalism to characterize memory effects in the noise dynamics. We further experimentally validate the PMME framework using superconducting qubits on an IBM Quantum device, demonstrating clear non-Markovian behavior during circuit execution. Additionally, we quantify the crosstalk effect using an information-theoretic approach and reveal that crosstalk can dominate the observed non-Markovian effects in current quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>A finite element method using a bounded auxiliary variable for solving the Richards equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Richards equation, a nonlinear elliptic parabolic equation, is widely used to model infiltration in porous media. We develop a finite element method for solving the Richards equation by introducing a new bounded auxiliary variable to eliminate unbounded terms in the weak formulation of the method. This formulation is discretized using a semi-implicit scheme and the resulting nonlinear system is solved using Newton's method. Our approach eliminates the need of regularization techniques and offers advantages in handling both dry and fully saturated zones. In the proposed techniques, a non-overlapping Schwarz domain decomposition method is used for modeling infiltration in layered soils. We apply the proposed method to solve the Richards equation using the Havercamp and van Genuchten models for the capillary pressure. Numerical experiments are performed to validate the proposed approach, including tests such as modeling flows in fibrous sheets where the initial medium is totally dry, two cases with fully saturated and dry regions, and an infiltration problem in layered soils. The numerical results demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the proposed numerical method. The numerical solutions remain positive in the presence of totally dry zones. The numerical investigations clearly demonstrated the capability of the proposed method to effectively predict the dynamics of flows in unsaturated soils.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Ultrasonic Weld Characterization Using Hierarchical Wave Modeling and Diffusion-Driven Distribution Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings (resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e., industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD) real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions, i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end solution for automated weld inspection on real data.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Space Attention for Learning Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data. However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space Attention (RSA), a framework designed to capture long-range interactions in the Fourier domain. RSA can be integrated with any existing local or semi-local MLIP framework. The central contribution of this work is the mapping of a linear-scaling attention mechanism into Fourier space, enabling the explicit modeling of long-range interactions such as electrostatics and dispersion without relying on predefined charges or other empirical assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method as a long-range correction to the MACE backbone across diverse benchmarks, including dimer binding curves, dispersion-dominated layered phosphorene exfoliation, and the molecular dipole density of bulk water. Our results show that RSA consistently captures long-range physics across a broad range of chemical and materials systems.

      <title>First-Principles Exploration of Pentagonal TiN$_8$ and MoN$_8$ Monolayers as New Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quest for robust, intrinsically magnetic topological materials exhibiting the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is a central challenge in condensed matter physics and the application of revolutionary electronics. However, progress has been hampered by the limited number of candidate materials, which often suffer from poor stability and complex synthesis. Here, we introduce a new paradigm by exploring the emergent magnetism and nontrivial band topology in the largely overlooked family of two-dimensional (2D) pentagonal MN$_8$ monolayers. Employing first-principles calculations, we reveal that these systems host out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground states, a key feature that unlocks nontrivial topological properties driven by the localized $d$-orbitals of the embedded transition metals. Remarkably, we identify TiN$_8$ as a QAH insulator characterized by a Chern number of $C=-1$. Even more strikingly, MoN$_8$ is predicted to be a rare high-Chern-number QAH insulator, boasting a Chern number of $C=2$. Our findings establish the penta-MN$_8$ family as a fertile and versatile platform for realizing exotic topological quantum states. This work not only significantly expands the material landscape for magnetic topological insulators but also provides a solid theoretical foundation for designing next-generation spintronic and quantum computing devices.</description>

      <title>Neural Triangular Transport Maps: A New Approach Towards Sampling in Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics; yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN). We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and \emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins). Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings) affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Material Property Prediction with Deep Learning and Single-Descriptor electronic Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to its high scalability and computational efficiency, machine learning methods have been increasingly integrated into various scientific research domains, including ab initio-based materials design. It has been demonstrated that, by incorporating modern machine learning algorithms, one can predict material properties with practically acceptable accuracy. However, one of the most significant limitations that restrict the widespread application of machine learning is its lack of transferability, as a given framework is typically applicable only to a specific property. The origin of this limitation is rooted in the fact that a material's properties are determined by multiple degrees of freedom -- and their complex interplay -- associated with nuclei and electrons, such as atomic type, structural symmetry, and the number and quantum states of the valence electrons, among others. The inherent complexity rules out the possibility of a single machine learning framework providing a full description of these critical quantities. In this paper, we develop a universal machine learning framework based solely on a physically grounded and theoretically rigorous descriptor -- electronic charge density. Our framework not only enables accurate prediction of eight different material properties (with R$^2$ values up to 0.94), but also demonstrates outstanding multi-task learning capability, as prediction accuracy improves when more target properties are incorporated into a single training process, thereby indicating excellent transferability. These results represent a significant step toward realizing the long-standing goal of a universal machine learning framework for the unified prediction of all material properties.</description>

      <title>Design of an Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope array layout with differential programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current optimization of ground-based Cherenkov telescopes arrays, also called Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescope (IACT) arrays, relies on brute-force human-driven approaches based on large simulations requiring both high amount of storage and long computation time. To explore the full phase space of telescope positioning of a given array even more simulations would be required. To optimize any array layout, we explore the possibility of developing a differential program with surrogate models of IACT arrays based on high-level instrument response functions (IRFs). The simulation time of a single telescope to a cosmic-ray event can be significantly reduced with its instrument response function or with generative models. However, it is not straight forward to model the array of telescopes from a set of single telescope surrogate models as the array is a stereoscopic imaging system. The complexity increases as well if the telescopes in the array are of different types. Additionally, the optimum of the array layout depends on the scientific use case. Current array layout optimization are obtained by minimizing the sensitivity of the array, a metric that depends on several high-level parameters such as the trigger efficiency, the energy and angular resolution, as well as the background rejection capability. The variety of telescopes types in IACT arrays, such as in the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), not only extends the sensitive energy range but also allows for cross-calibration of the instruments. Therefore, the optimal array layout is not only which minimizes sensitivity but also which reduces the systematic uncertainties. We focus on the optimization of a telescope array based on the SST-1M IACTs in Hanle, Ladakh India aiming at building a generic optimization pipeline for future ground-based cosmic-ray observatories</description>

      <title>APRIL: Auxiliary Physically-Redundant Information in Loss - A physics-informed framework for parameter estimation with a gravitational-wave case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>Efficient Wall-Modelled Large Eddy Simulation of Rotors using Homogenized Lattice Boltzmann Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the dynamic forces acting on rotors as well as their wake effects presents a significant challenge for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) due to high Reynolds numbers and a large range of spatio-temporal scales. The present work proposes a novel blade-resolved wall-modeled large eddy simulation (WMLES) approach based on the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM).
  A homogenized hybrid regularized recursive collision scheme targeting the filtered Brinkman--Navier--Stokes equations is combined with a novel wall-model. This is implemented in the context of a platform-transparent framework for fluid-structure interaction in the open source LBM framework OpenLB.
  Convergence order and accuracy are validated against both experimental and numerical data for a model wind turbine, demonstrating excellent agreement for integral forces and wake velocity profiles. Computational efficiency and parallel scalability was investigated by roofline analysis and weak scaling studies for up to 384 rotors resolved by 41 billion lattice cells on the Karolina supercomputer.
  The proposed framework enables efficient blade-resolved WMLES of entire wind farms and offers a new methodology for other complex wall-modeled fluid-structure interaction applications.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann Boundary Conditions for Flow, Convection-Diffusion and MHD Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general derivation is proposed for several boundary conditions arisen in the lattice Boltzmann simulations of various physical problems. Pair-wise moment conservations are proposed to enforce the boundary conditions with given macroscopic quantities, including the velocity and pressure in flow simulations, concentration in convection-diffusion (CD) simulations, as well as magnetic field components in magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. Additionally, the CD and MHD simulations might involve the Robin boundary condition for surface reactions and a Robin-like boundary condition for thin walls with finite electrical conductivities, respectively, both of which can be written in a form with a variable flux term. In this case, the proposed boundary scheme takes the flux term as an increment to the bounced distribution function and a reference frame transformation is used to obtain a correction term for moving boundaries. Spatial interpolation and extrapolation are used for arbitrary boundary locations between computational grid points. Due to using the same approach in derivations, the obtained boundary schemes for different physical processes in a coupled simulation are compatible for arbitrary boundary-to-grid distances (not limited to the popular half-grid boundary layout) and arbitrary moving speeds. Simulations using half-grid and full-grid boundary layouts for flat boundaries are conducted for demonstrations and validations. Moving boundaries are simulated in hydrodynamic and MHD flows, while static boundaries are used in the CD simulations with surface reactions. The numerical and analytical solutions are in excellent agreement in the studied cases. The proposed boundary schemes are also applied in simulating fully coupled MHD pipe flows of a curved boundary with various boundary-to-grid distances and excellent agreement with analytical solutions is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Tuning Layer Orbital Hall Effect via Spin Rotation in Ferromagnetic Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orbitronics, which leverages the angular momentum of atomic orbitals for information transmission, provides a novel strategy to overcome the limitations of electronic devices. Unlike electron spin, orbital angular momentum (OAM) is strongly influenced by crystal field effects and band topology, making its orientation difficult to manipulate with external fields. In this work, by using first principle calculations, we investigate quantum anomalous Hall insulators (QAHIs) as a model system to study the layer orbital Hall effect (OHE). Due to band inversion, only one valley remains orbital polarization, and thus the OHE originates from a single valley. Based on stacking symmetry analysis, we investigated both AA and AB stacking configurations, which possess mirror and inversion symmetries, respectively. The excitation of OAM exhibits valley selectivity, determined jointly by valley polarization and orbital polarization. In AA stacking, the absence of inversion center gives rise to intrinsic orbital polarization, leading to OAM excitations from different valleys in the two layers. In contrast, AB stacking is protected by inversion symmetry, which enforces valley polarization and causes OAM in both layers to originate from the same valley. Furthermore, the direction of spin polarization tunes the sign of the Berry curvature, thereby dictating the transport of OAM. As a result, in bilayer antiferromagnetic QAHI systems, orbital currents display a distinct layer-contrasting behavior in both flow direction and OAM accumulation.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Transformation Matrices: A Block Decomposition Approach for Efficient Gate Reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm designed to approximate quantum transformation matrix with a restricted number of gates by using the block decomposition technique. Addressing challenges posed by numerous gates in handling large qubit transformations, the algorithm provides a solution by optimizing gate usage while maintaining computational accuracy. Inspired by the Block Decompose algorithm, our approach processes transformation matrices in a block-wise manner, enabling users to specify the desired gate count for flexibility in resource allocation. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the algorithm in approximating transformations with significantly fewer gates, enhancing quantum computing efficiency for complex calculations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Prediction of SO(3)-Equivariant Hamiltonian Matrices via SO(2) Local Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the task of predicting Hamiltonian matrices to accelerate electronic structure calculations, which plays an important role in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Motivated by the inherent relationship between the off-diagonal blocks of the Hamiltonian matrix and the SO(2) local frame, we propose a novel and efficient network, called QHNetV2, that achieves global SO(3) equivariance without the costly SO(3) Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. This is achieved by introducing a set of new efficient and powerful SO(2)-equivariant operations and performing all off-diagonal feature updates and message passing within SO(2) local frames, thereby eliminating the need of SO(3) tensor products. Moreover, a continuous SO(2) tensor product is performed within the SO(2) local frame at each node to fuse node features, mimicking the symmetric contraction operation. Extensive experiments on the large QH9 and MD17 datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance across a wide range of molecular structures and trajectories, highlighting its strong generalization capability. The proposed SO(2) operations on SO(2) local frames offer a promising direction for scalable and symmetry-aware learning of electronic structures. Our code will be released as part of the AIRS library https://github.com/divelab/AIRS.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Learning via Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian learning (HL), enabling precise estimation of system parameters and underlying dynamics, plays a critical role in characterizing quantum systems. However, conventional HL methods face challenges in noise robustness and resource efficiency, especially under limited measurements. In this work, we present \textit{Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Hamiltonian Learning (iPINN-HL)}, an approach that incorporates the Schr\"{o}dinger equation as a soft constraint via a loss function penalty into the ML procedure. This formulation allows the model to integrate both observational data and known physical laws to infer Hamiltonian parameters with greater accuracy and resource efficiency. We benchmark iPINN-HL against a deep-neural-network-based quantum state tomography method (denoted as DNN-HL) and demonstrate its effectiveness across several different scenarios, including one-dimensional spin chains, cross-resonance gate calibration, crosstalk identification, and real-time compensation to parameter drift. Our results show that iPINN-HL can approach the Heisenberg limit and exhibits robustness to noises, while outperforming DNN-HL in accuracy and resource efficiency. Therefore, iPINN-HL is a powerful and flexible framework for quantum system characterization for practical tasks.</description>

      <title>Jenga-Krotov algorithm: Efficient compilation of multi-qubit gates for exchange-only qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exchange-only (EO) qubits, implemented in triple-quantum-dot systems, offer a compelling platform for scalable semiconductor-based quantum computing by enabling universal control through purely exchange interactions. While high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated, the synthesis of efficient multi-qubit operations-such as the Toffoli gate-remains a key bottleneck. Conventional gate decompositions into elementary operations lead to prohibitively long and error-prone pulse sequences, limiting practical deployment. In this work, we introduce a gradient-based optimization algorithm, Jenga-Krotov (JK), tailored to discover compact, high-fidelity EO gate sequences. Applying JK to the Toffoli gate, we reduce the number of required exchange unitaries from 216 (in direct decomposition) to 92, and compress the time steps required from 162 to 50, all while maintaining target fidelity. Under realistic noise, the accumulated gate error from our optimized sequence is an order of magnitude lower than that of conventional approaches. We have also applied the JK algorithm to other multi-qubit gates and algorithm. For the Fredkin gate, it reduces the number of time steps from 200 to 104 and the number of exchange unitaries from 276 to 172. For the quantum Fourier transform, it compresses the sequence from 180 to 80 time steps and from 237 to 202 exchange unitaries. These results demonstrate that the JK algorithm is a general and scalable strategy for multi-qubit gate synthesis in EO architectures, potentially facilitating realization of multi-qubit algorithms on semiconductor platforms.</description>

      <title>Self-attention enabled quantum path analysis of high-harmonic generation in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) in solids provides a powerful platform to probe ultrafast electron dynamics and interband--intraband coupling. However, disentangling the complex many-body contributions in the HHG spectrum remains challenging. Here we introduce a machine-learning approach based on a Transformer encoder to analyze and reconstruct HHG signals computed from a one-dimensional Kronig--Penney model. The self-attention mechanism inherently highlights correlations between temporal dipole dynamics and high-frequency spectral components, allowing us to identify signatures of nonadiabatic band coupling that are otherwise obscured in standard Fourier analysis. By combining attention maps with Gabor time--frequency analysis, we extract and amplify weak coupling channels that contribute to even-order harmonics and anomalous spectral features. Our results demonstrate that multi-head self-attention acts as a selective filter for strong-coupling events in the time domain, enabling a physics-informed interpretation of high-dimensional quantum dynamics. This work establishes Transformer-based attention as a versatile tool for solid-state strong-field physics, opening new possibilities for interpretable machine learning in attosecond spectroscopy and nonlinear photonics.</description>
