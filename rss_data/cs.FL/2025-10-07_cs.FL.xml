      <title>Unreliability in Practical Subclasses of Communicating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems of communicating automata are prominent models for peer-to-peer message-passing over unbounded channels, but in the general scenario, most verification properties are undecidable. To address this issue, two decidable subclasses, Realisable with Synchronous Communication (RSC) and k-Multiparty Compatibility} (k-MC), were proposed in the literature, with corresponding verification tools developed and applied in practice. Unfortunately, both RSC and k-MC are not resilient under failures: (1) their decidability relies on the assumption of perfect channels and (2) most standard protocols do not satisfy RSC or k-MC under failures. To address these limitations, this paper studies the resilience of RSC and k-MC under two distinct failure models: interference and crash-stop failures. For interference, we relax the conditions of RSC and k-MC and prove that the inclusions of these relaxed properties remain decidable under interference, preserving their known complexity bounds. We then propose a novel crash-handling communicating system that captures wider behaviours than existing multiparty session types (MPST) with crash-stop failures. We study a translation of MPST with crash-stop failures into this system integrating RSC and k-MC properties, and establish their decidability results. Finally, by verifying representative protocols from the literature using RSC and k-MC tools extended to interferences, we evaluate the relaxed systems and demonstrate their resilience.</description>

      <title>Intersection and Union Hierarchies of Deterministic Context-Free Languages and Pumping Lemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.09383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of finite intersections and finite unions of deterministic context-free (dcf) languages. Earlier, Wotschke [J. Comput. System Sci. 16 (1978) 456--461] demonstrated that intersections of $(d+1)$ dcf languages are in general more powerful than intersections of $d$ dcf languages for any positive integer $d$ based on the separation result of the intersection hierarchy of Liu and Weiner [Math. Systems Theory 7 (1973) 185--192]. The argument of Liu and Weiner, however, works only on bounded languages of particular forms, and therefore Wotschke's result is not directly extendable to other non-bounded languages. To deal with a wide range of languages for the non-membership to the intersection hierarchy, we circumvent the specialization of their proof technics and devise a new and practical technical tool: two pumping lemmas for finite unions of dcf languages. Since the family of dcf languages is closed under complementation and also under intersection with regular languages, these pumping lemmas help us establish the non-membership relation of languages formed by finite intersections of target languages. We also concern ourselves with a relationship to deterministic limited automata of Hibbard [Inf. Control 11 (1967) 196--238] in this regard.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Semantics for Jumping Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11849v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jumping automata are finite automata that read their input in a non-sequential manner, by allowing a reading head to ``jump'' between positions on the input, consuming a permutation of the input word. We argue that allowing the head to jump should incur some cost. To this end, we propose four quantitative semantics for jumping automata, whereby the jumps of the head in an accepting run define the cost of the run. The four semantics correspond to different interpretations of jumps: the \emph{absolute distance} semantics counts the distance the head jumps, the \emph{reversal} semantics counts the number of times the head changes direction, the \emph{Hamming distance} measures the number of letter-swaps the run makes, and the \emph{maximum jump} semantics counts the maximal distance the head jumps in a single step,
  We study these measures, with the main focus being the \emph{boundedness problem}: given a jumping automaton, decide whether its (quantitative) language is bounded by some given number $k$. We establish the decidability and complexity for this problem under several variants.</description>
