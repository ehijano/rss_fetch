      <title>A Universal Analytic Model for Gravitational Lensing by Self-Interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for analytically calculating gravitational lensing by self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos. Leveraging the universal behavior of SIDM halos during gravothermal evolution, we calibrate the lensing potential using a fluid simulation, normalizing the evolution time to align with established scenarios. From this potential, we derive explicit equations for the deflection angle and surface density profile, quantifying their deviations from numerical results. Our model builds on the parametric approach of arXiv:2305.16176, providing refinements in the deep core-collapse regime and enabling more comprehensive lensing studies. We explore characteristic lensing features, including critical curves and caustics, for SIDM halos in isolation and within a main halo, tracking their evolution through the gravothermal phase. We also examine signatures in the self-similar regime of core collapsed halos and highlight the role of baryonic effects in realistic halos. The efficiency of our model enables large-scale lensing studies, and we make our implementation publicly available on GitHub to support further research.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter we first describe the early history of primordial black hole (PBH) research. We then discuss their possible formation mechanisms, including critical collapse from inflationary fluctuations and various types of phase transition. We next describe the numerous constraints on the number density of PBHs from various quantum and astrophysical processes. This was the main focus of research until recently but there is currently a shift of emphasis to the search for evidence for PBHs. We end by discussing this evidence, with particular emphasis on their role as dark matter candidates, sources of gravitational waves and seeds for supermassive black holes and early cosmic structures.</description>

      <title>Peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters in a IllustrisTNG simulation based on mock observations of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the largest self-gravitational systems in the Universe. They are valuable probes of the structure growth of the Universe when we estimate their peculiar velocities with the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effects. We investigate whether there is a systematic offset between the peculiar velocities ($v_{\rm z,kSZ}$) estimated with the kSZ effect and the true velocities of halos. We first created mocks of the 2D maps of SZ effects in seven frequency bands for galaxy clusters spanning a broad range of masses in TNG 300-3. We then derived the line-of-sight (LOS) peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters by applying an analytical formula to fit the spectra of the SZ effect. We find that the analytical formula-fitting method tends to overestimate the peculiar velocities of galaxy clusters, regardless of whether they approach us or recede from us. However, when galaxy clusters larger than 500 km/s were excluded, the slopes of the relations between $v_{\rm z,kSZ}$ and the real LOS velocities of galaxy clusters ($v_{\rm z,halo}$) were consistent with unity within the errors. Additionally, we further accounted for observational noise for different-aperture telescopes under different precipitable water vapor. The slopes for most cases are consistent with unity within the errors, and the errors of the slopes slightly increase with higher observation noise. The $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ exhibits no obvious trend with increasing concentration and $M_{\rm 200}$. It is noteworthy that the $|v_{\rm z,kSZ}-v_{\rm z,halo}|$ is relatively high for galaxy clusters with strong active galactic nucleus feedback and high star formation rates. This indicates that these physical processes affect the cluster dynamic state and may reflect on the peculiar velocity estimated from the kSZ effect.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the performance of the Minimally Informed foreground cleaning method for CMB polarization observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical foreground substraction is crucial to retrieve the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization out of the observed data. Recent efforts have been carried out towards the development of a minimally informed component separation method to handle a priori unknown foreground spectral energy distributions (SEDs), while being able to estimate both cosmological, foreground, and potentially instrumental parameters, jointly. In this paper, we develop a semi-analytical performance forecasting framework for the minimally informed method and we validate it by comparing its results against direct sampling of the harmonic-based likelihood and the pixel domain implementation MICMAC. We then use the forecasting tool to demonstrate the robustness of the bias correction procedure introduced in the minimally informed approach. We find that a data-driven approach based on the currently available observational data is enough to efficiently regularize the bias of the method.</description>

      <title>Status of early dark energy after DESI: the role of $\Omega_m$ and $r_s H_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EDE model is one of the promising solutions to the long-standing Hubble tension. This paper investigates the status of several EDE models in light of recent BAO observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and their implications for resolving the Hubble tension. The DESI Y1 BAO results deviate from the CMB and Type Ia supernova (SNeIa) observations in their constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m$ and the product of the sound horizon and the Hubble constant $r_s H_0$. Meanwhile, these EDE models happen to tend towards this deviation. Therefore, in this work, it is found that DESI Y1 BAO results strengthen the preference for EDE models and help to obtain a higher $H_0$. Even considering the Pantheon+ observations for SNeIa, which have an opposite tendency, DESI still dominates the preference for EDE. This was unforeseen in past SDSS BAO measurements and therefore emphasizes the role of BAO and SNeIa measurements in Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Reducing false positives in strong lens detection through effective augmentation and ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research studies the impact of high-quality training datasets on the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in detecting strong gravitational lenses. We stress the importance of data diversity and representativeness, demonstrating how variations in sample populations influence CNN performance. In addition to the quality of training data, our results highlight the effectiveness of various techniques, such as data augmentation and ensemble learning, in reducing false positives while maintaining model completeness at an acceptable level. This enhances the robustness of gravitational lens detection models and advancing capabilities in this field. Our experiments, employing variations of DenseNet and EfficientNet, achieved a best false positive rate (FP rate) of $10^{-4}$, while successfully identifying over 88 per cent of genuine gravitational lenses in the test dataset. This represents an 11-fold reduction in the FP rate compared to the original training dataset. Notably, this substantial enhancement in the FP rate is accompanied by only a 2.3 per cent decrease in the number of true positive samples. Validated on the KiDS dataset, our findings offer insights applicable to ongoing missions, like Euclid.</description>

      <title>Loop Blow-Up Inflation: a novel way to inflate with the K\"ahler moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topic of this talk is a new inflationary model in the context of Type IIB string compactifications called Loop Blow-Up Inflation, presented in arXiv:2403.04831. The original Blow-Up Inflation model, whose potential was purely non-perturbative, suffers from the $\eta$-problem, being sensitive to string-loop corrections. If these corrections are introduced in the nflationary potential, they become dominant over the non-perturbative contributions as soon as the inflaton is displaced from its minimum. Therefore, the inflationary potential takes a new inverse-power law behavior. We show that slow-roll inflation is not ultimately spoiled and focus on the post-inflationary history in different scenarios of microscopic Standard Model (SM) realization. Each of them gives precise predictions for the spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio in agreement with CMB data .The model also predicts an amount of dark radiation potentially observable by next-generation CMB experiments. This article is a contribution to the proceedings of the Second General Meeting of the COST Action CA21106 Cosmic WISPers.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Asymmetries: from the early Universe to BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large primordial lepton flavor asymmetries with almost vanishing total baryon-minus-lepton number can evade the usual BBN and CMB constraints if neutrino oscillations lead to perfect flavor equilibration. Solving the momentum averaged quantum kinetic equations (QKEs) describing neutrino oscillations and interactions, we perform the first systematic investigation of this scenario, uncovering a rich flavor structure in stark contradiction to the assumption of simple flavor equilibration. We find (i) a particular direction in flavor space, $\Delta n_e \simeq -2/3 \, (-1) \Delta n_\mu$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass hierarchy, in which the flavor equilibration is efficient and primordial asymmetries are essentially unconstrained, (ii) a minimal washout factor, $\Delta n_e^2|_\mathrm{BBN} \leq 0.03 \, (0.016) \sum_\alpha \Delta n_\alpha^2|_{\mathrm{ini}}$ yielding a conservative estimate for the allowed primordial asymmetries in a generic flavor direction, and (iii) particularly strong or weak washout if one of the initial flavor asymmetries vanishes due to non-adiabatic muon- or electron-driven MSW transitions. These results open up the possibility of a first-order QCD phase transition facilitated by large lepton asymmetries as well as baryogenesis from large and compensated $\Delta n_e =- \Delta n_\mu$ asymmetries. Our first-principles approach of deriving momentum averaged QKEs includes collision terms beyond the damping approximation, energy transfer between the neutrino and electron-photon plasma, and provides a fast and reliable way to investigate the impact of primordial lepton asymmetries at the time of BBN. We publicly release the Mathematica code COFLASY-M on GitHub which solves the QKEs numerically.</description>

      <title>Matter-Dark Matter Coincidence and Mirror World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Why matter and dark matter contents of the universe are of the same order of magnitude, is one of the puzzles of modern cosmology. At the face of it, this would seem to point towards a basic similarity between matter and dark matter, suggesting perhaps the widely discussed mirror world picture as an ideal setting for a discussion of this issue. Here we outline a new and simple mirror world scenario to explain this puzzle. Our model uses Affleck-Dine mechanism to generate baryon asymmetry and dark matter relic density leading to an asymmetric dark matter picture. We find that for a certain parameter range of the model, the mirror electron is the unique possibility for dark matter whereas in the complementary parameter range, the mirror baryons constitute the dark matter. In either case, the mirror photon must have mass in the MeV range for consistency with observations. For the case of mirror electron dark matter, the model predicts a lower bound on the amount of dark radiation i.e. $\Delta N_{eff} \geq 0.007$.</description>

      <title>The holographic space-time model of inflation and its predictions for the CMB primordial spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1998 Carlip and Solodukhin independently conjectured the equality between fluctuations in the modular Hamiltonian of black holes and its expectation value. Banks and Zurek's 2021 work generalized this observation to any causal diamonds. We use this observation to calculate the precise normalization of primordial scalar and tensor power spectra in the Holographic Space-time (HST) model of inflation. In previous work Banks and Fischler outlined the general calculation of inflationary power spectra in this model, which we review here. Its conceptual basis is radically different from field theoretic inflation and it has no Transplanckian problems, but its predictions for power spectra will be shown to fit extant data equally well, and the tensor-to-scalar ratio agrees with experimental observations.

      <title>A Stacked Analysis of GeV Gamma-Ray Emission from SPT-SZ Galaxy Clusters with 16 Years of Fermi-LAT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a statistically significant detection of cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from a stacked sample of SPT-SZ selected galaxy clusters using 16.4 years of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope's Large Area Telescope (LAT). By analyzing a population of clusters with individual Test Statistic (TS) values $&lt;$ 9.0, we identify a robust cumulative signal with a TS of 75.2, corresponding to approximately 8.4$\sigma$ significance. In contrast, clusters with TS $&lt;$ 4.0 yield a weaker cumulative signal of TS = 9.65, consistent with background fluctuations. The derived $\gamma$-ray spectrum is well characterized by a power law model with a best-fit spectral index of $-2.59 \pm 0.20$ and an integrated flux of $1.67^{+1.35}_{-1.07} \times 10^{-11}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The spectral index matches hadronic cosmic-ray interaction predictions but may also include contributions from AGNs within the galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The correspondence of generalised entropic cosmology theory with $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ modified gravity and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This talk is based on the collaboration with Sergei D. Odintsov. We investigate the correspondence between modified gravity theories and general entropic cosmology theory. Such a theory is proposed by an analogy with Jacobson's work, where the Einstein equation was derived from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We compare FLRW equations obtained in entropic gravity with those in modified gravity theories. It is found the correspondence of $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravities and general entropic gravity. We regard the $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$ gravity theories as effective local theories corresponding to the entropic gravity theories and we investigate the gravitational waves. The obtained equation of the gravitational wave is identical to that in Einstein's gravity except that the gravitational coupling is modified by the functional form of the functions $F(T)$ and $F(Q)$. It is interesting that in the case of the Tsallis entropic cosmology, the gravitational coupling becomes small or large, which may suppress or enhance the emission of the gravitational wave.</description>

      <title>Bounds on variations of the strange quark mass from Big Bang nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of a variation of the strange nucleon matrix element $\langle N| m_s \bar{s}s|N\rangle$ on the abundances of the light elements produced in the Big Bang. For that, we vary the nucleon mass in the leading eight reactions that involve neutrons, protons and the four lightest nuclei. We use various available Big Bang nucleosynthesis codes and find that the measured deuterium and $^4$He abundances set strict limits on the nucleon mass variations. This translates into an upper bound of possible variations of the strange quark mass, $\left| \Delta m_s/m_s \right| \leq 5.1\%$.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in the revised Deser-Woodard nonlocal theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity by reformulating the related field equations within a suitable tetrad frame. This transformation significantly simplifies the treatment of the ensuing differential problem while preserving the characteristics of the original gravitational theory. We then focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum. Hence, we demonstrate that the gravitational theory under study admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse power-law correction to the Schwarzschild $g_{tt}$ metric function and a first-order perturbation of the $g_{rr}$ Schwarzschild component. Then, through a stepwise methodology, we analytically solve the full dynamics of the theory, finally leading to the reconstruction of the nonlocal distortion function, within which the new black hole solutions arise. Furthermore, we analyze the geometric properties of the obtained solutions and quantify the deviations from the Schwarzschild prediction. This work provides new insights into compact object configurations and advances our understanding of nonlocal gravity theories in the strong-field regime at astrophysical scales.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger detection of black hole binaries in dark matter spikes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inspiral of a high mass-ratio black hole binary located in the nucleus of a galaxy, where the primary central black hole is surrounded by a dense dark matter spike formed through accretion during the black hole growth phase. Within this spike, dark matter undergoes strong self-annihilation, producing a compact source of $\gamma$-ray radiation that is highly sensitive to spike density, while the binary emits gravitational waves at frequencies detectable by LISA. As the inspiralling binary interacts with the surrounding dark matter particles, it alters the density of the spike, thereby influencing the $\gamma$-ray flux from dark matter annihilation. We demonstrate that the spike self-annihilation luminosity decreases by $10\%$ to $90\%$ of its initial value, depending on the initial density profile and binary mass ratio, as the binary sweeps through the LISA band. This presents a new opportunity to indirectly probe dark matter through multi-messenger observations of galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>A Search for Dark Matter Annihilation in Stellar Streams with the Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar streams are remnants of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies that have been tidally disrupted by the gravitational potential of their host galaxy. Streams originating from dwarfs can be particularly compelling targets for indirect dark matter (DM) searches, as dwarfs are believed to be highly DM-dominated systems. Although these streams are expected to lose most of their DM during the tidal stretching process, a significant amount may still remain in their core. If DM is composed of WIMPs, their annihilation within the streams' cores could produce a detectable gamma-ray signal. In this study, we analyze nearly 15 years of data from the Large Area Telescope aboard NASA's Fermi satellite (Fermi-LAT) to search for potential WIMP annihilation signals from the direction of 11 stellar streams selected using DM-motivated criteria. No gamma-ray emission is detected from any of the streams in our sample. In the absence of a signal, we place the first constraints on the WIMP parameter space based on these objects for two representative annihilation channels. Individual DM limits are first computed and then combined across all streams. The most reliable combined constraints, derived from a golden sample and using a benchmark description of their DM content, are $O(10)$ times above the thermal relic cross-section for the $bb$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ annihilation channels. We also explore how these constraints vary under more conservative or optimistic yet realistic assumptions, finding variations of up to a few orders of magnitude. This large systematic uncertainty stems from key model limitations, which can and should be addressed in future observations and simulations to produce more robust DM limits from streams. Despite uncertainties, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using stellar streams for DM searches and highlights their significant potential to uncover the properties of DM particles.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes from Effective Field Theory of Stochastic Single Field Inflation at NNNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalization of stochastic inflation in a model-independent single-field framework and its impact on primordial black hole (PBH) formation. We show how the Langevin equations for the "soft" modes in quasi de Sitter background is described by the Infra-Red (IR) contributions of scalar perturbations, and the subsequent Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution for the stochastic duration ${\cal N}$, significantly modify in the present EFT picture. An explicit perturbative analysis of the distribution function by implementing the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism is performed up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (NNNLO) for both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion dominated regimes. In the drift-dominated limit, we perturbatively analyse the local non-Gaussianity parameters $(f_{\rm NL}, g_{\rm NL}, \tau_{\rm NL})$ with the EFT-induced modifications. In the diffusion-dominated limit, we numerically compute the probability distribution featuring exponential tails at each order of perturbative treatment.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on a modified-gravity model with an exponential function of the curvature using the expansion history, the RSD, and the Pantheon+SH0ES data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a well-motivated $f(R)$ modified-gravity model, in which an exponential function of the curvature is included, in this paper we implement a statistical data analysis to set constraints on the parameters of the model, taking into account an analytic approximate solution for the expansion rate, $H(z)$. In the analysis based on the Markov chain Markov based on the expansion rate evolution, the standardized SN distance modulus and the redshift space distortion observational data, we find that the preferred value for the perturbative parameter, $b$, quantifying the deviation of the $f(R)$ model from $\Lambda$CDM, lives in a region that excludes $b = 0$ at $\gtrsim 3.5 \sigma$ C.L., and that the predicted current value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, locates in between the two observational results currently under scrutiny from Planck and SH0ES collaborations. Under the implemented approximate solution, and with the constraints obtained for the parameters, the proposed $f(R)$ model successfully reproduces the observational data and the predicted evolution of interesting cosmological parameters resemble the results of $\Lambda$CDM, as expected, while an oscillatory behavior of the dark energy equation of state is observed, pointing to deviation from the concordance cosmological model. The results presented here reinforce the conclusion that the $f(R)$ modified-gravity model represents a viable alternative to describe the evolution of the Universe, evading the challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Multi-probe cosmology with unWISE galaxies and ACT DR6 CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of the CMB lensing power spectra measured from the Data Release 6 of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Planck PR4, cross-correlations between the ACT and Planck lensing reconstruction and galaxy clustering from unWISE, and the unWISE clustering auto-spectrum. We obtain 1.5% constraints on the matter density fluctuations at late times parametrised by the best constrained parameter combination $S_8^{\rm 3x2pt}\equiv\sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.4}=0.815\pm0.012$. The commonly used $S_8\equiv\sigma_8 (\Omega_m/0.3)^{0.5}$ parameter is constrained to $S_8=0.816\pm0.015$. In combination with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements we find $\sigma_8=0.815\pm 0.012$. We also present sound-horizon-independent estimates of the present day Hubble rate of $H_0=66.4^{+3.2}_{-3.7} \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ from our large scale structure data alone and $H_0=64.3^{+2.1}_{-2.4}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ in combination with uncalibrated supernovae from Pantheon+. Using parametric estimates of the evolution of matter density fluctuations, we place constraints on cosmic structure in a range of high redshifts typically inaccessible with cross-correlation analyses. Combining lensing cross- and auto-correlations, we derive a 3.3% constraint on the integrated matter density fluctuations above $z=2.4$, one of the tightest constraints in this redshift range and fully consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM model fit to the primary CMB from Planck. Combining with primary CMB observations and using the extended low redshift coverage of these combined data sets we derive constraints on a variety of extensions to the $\Lambda$CDM model including massive neutrinos, spatial curvature, and dark energy. We find in flat $\Lambda$CDM $\sum m_\nu&lt;0.12$ eV at 95% confidence using the LSS data, BAO measurements from SDSS and primary CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Baryon-free $S_8$ tension with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately modelling matter power spectrum effects at small scales, such as baryonic feedback, is essential to avoid significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters with cosmic shear. However, Stage IV surveys like LSST will be so precise that significant information can still be extracted from large scales alone. In this work, we simulate LSST Y1-like mock data and perform a cosmic shear analysis, considering different models of baryonic feedback. To focus on large scales, we apply physically motivated scale cuts which account for the redshift dependence of the multipoles in the tomographic bin. Our main focus is to study the changes in the constraining power of $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ parameters and assess possible effects on the tension with Planck measurements. We find that the $S_8$ tension is clearly detectable at $k_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}=0.20\,h\rm Mpc^{-1}$ in the analysis where we imposed a DES-sized tension, and at $k_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}=0.10\,h\rm Mpc^{-1}$ with a KiDS-sized tension, regardless of whether an incorrect model for baryons is assumed. However, to achieve these results, LSST will need high precision measurement of the redshift distributions, with photo-$z$ biases of the order of $10^{-3}$. Without this, the ability to constrain cosmological parameters independently of baryonic feedback - particularly regarding the $S_8$ tension - will be compromised.</description>

      <title>Lopsided and Bulging Distribution of Satellites around Paired Halos. II. 3D Analysis and Dependence on Projection and Selection Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of subhalos in the vicinity of dark matter halo pairs in the Illustris-TNG simulation. The satellites around halo pairs with separations $d_{\text{sep}} &gt; 0.5~h^{-1} \text{Mpc}$ exhibit a non-uniform distribution, which is a combined result of two distinct features: the "bulging" distribution, characterized by an overabundance along the pairwise direction, and the ''lopsided'' distribution, which shows an overabundance in the region between the paired halos. The bulging signal is stronger for halo pairs that are more widely separated and involve less massive halos, while the lopsidedness strengthens as the halo mass increases. Both signals depend weakly on halo mass ratio, and are primarily contributed by subhalos that are relatively distant from host halos. These measurements can be broadly reproduced by the overlap effect, provided the spatial alignment of halos is properly taken into account. Our results imply that the lopsidedness and bulging distribution may arise from two distinct origins: the former is caused simply by the overlap of two closely placed halos, while the latter is driven by the alignment of halos with large-scale filamentary structures. We examine the impact of projection and selection effects by conducting the same analysis of satellite distribution in two dimensions and in a mock catalog that replicates the selection effects of the SDSS galaxy sample. We find that the 3D-to-2D projection significantly suppresses the bulging distribution, with particularly strong effects at large pair separations, low halo masses, and large halo mass ratios.</description>

      <title>From the string vacuum to FLRW or de Sitter via $\alpha'$ corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first make more precise a recent "Hamiltonian" reformulation of the Hohm-Zwiebach approach to the tree-level, $O(d,d)$-invariant string cosmology equations at all orders in the $\alpha'$ expansion, and recall how it allows to give a simple characterization of a large class of cosmological scenarios connecting, through a non-singular bounce, two duality-related perturbative solutions at early and late times. We then discuss the effects of adding to the action a non-perturbative, $O(d,d)$-breaking, dilaton potential $V(\phi)$. The resulting cosmological solutions, assumed to approach at early times the perturbative string vacuum (with vanishing curvature and string coupling), can stabilize the dilaton at late times and simultaneously approach either a matter-dominated FLRW cosmology or a de-Sitter-like inflationary phase, depending on initial conditions and on the properties of $V(\phi)$ at moderate-coupling. We also identify a general mechanism for generating isotropic late-time attractors from a large basin of anisotropic initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter Interaction: Scenario for the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15977v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a model for Dark Energy - Dark Matter interaction, based on a decaying process of the former into the latter. The dynamical equations are constructed following a kinetic formulation, which separates the interacting fluctuations from an equilibrium distribution of both species. The emerging dynamical picture consists of coupled equations, which are specialized in the case of a Dark Energy equation of state parameter; we deal with a modified Lambda Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, which is investigated versus a possible interpretation of the Hubble tension. Using an optimized set of the model's free parameters, it can be shown that the obtained Hubble parameter can, in principle, address the tension. We then use the most recent datasets from late Universe sources and compressed information from the Cosmic Microwave Background data to constrain the free parameters and compare the addressed scenario to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The study outlines how our proposal is preferred by the data in all cases, based on fit quality, while also alleviating the tension.</description>
