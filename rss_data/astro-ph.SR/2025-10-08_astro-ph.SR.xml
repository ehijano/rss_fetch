      <title>A Deep Look into the Intermediate-Age Open Cluster NGC 2506: What Binary Systems Reveal About Cluster Distance and Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using high-precision observations from the space-based \textit{Gaia} and \textit{TESS} missions, complemented by ground-based spectroscopic data and multi-band photometric surveys, we perform a detailed investigation of the Galactic open cluster NGC~2506. We present a new analysis of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC~2506, using joint fits to the radial velocities (RVs) and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of five double-lined binary systems, including two eclipsing binaries. The analysis yields self-consistent estimates of the cluster's age, distance, and extinction, based on 18 free parameters: 10 stellar masses, 5 orbital inclinations, and common values for age, distance, and $A_V$. The SED fitting incorporates stellar isochrones, and the resulting parameters are examined through HR diagrams (R--$T_{\rm eff}$, R--M, and M--$T_{\rm eff}$) to assess evolutionary consistency. The age we derive for the cluster is $1.94 \pm 0.03$ Gyr for an assumed [Fe/H] = -0.30, and a fitting formula is given for extrapolation to other metallicities. The distance we find from the SED fitting is $3189 \pm 53$ pc, and this is to be compared with our own inference from the Gaia data which is $3105 \pm 75$ pc, based on 919 stars identified as cluster members. Our results demonstrate the power of binary systems in tightly constraining cluster-wide age and distance at this evolutionary stage. This approach represents one of the most accurate characterizations of an intermediate-age open cluster using multiple binary systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the rapidly varying white dwarf ZTF 1851+1714</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on phase-resolved optical spectroscopy and photometry in the R and B bands of the white dwarf candidate ZTF 185139.81+171430.3. The source has been reported to be variable with a large amplitude of close to 1 magnitude, in the R band, and a short period of 12.37 min. We confirm this period and interpret it as the spin period of the white dwarf. The optical spectrum shows emission lines from hydrogen and helium superposed on a featureless continuum. The continuum changes shape throughout a cycle, such that it is redder when the source is bright. There is tentative evidence for Doppler shifts in the emission lines during the spin cycle with an amplitude of a few tens of km s$^{-1}$. Notably, the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines exhibit different radial velocity amplitudes, suggesting that they come from different emission regions. We also identify a candidate orbital period of 1.00 hr, based on potential orbital sidebands. These features - Doppler shifts modulated at the spin frequency, brightness variations, and continuum shape changes - are consistent with the accretion curtain model, in which material is funneled from a truncated inner disc along magnetic field lines onto the magnetic poles of the white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Radiation magnetohydrodynamics modeling of an impulsively driven chromospheric jet in the solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a numerical simulation of an impulsively driven chromospheric jet in the solar atmosphere using the non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations coupled with frequency- and angle-averaged radiation transport equations. These include the dynamics of the radiation energy density and radiation flux. The jet is initiated by a localized Gaussian pulse applied to the vertical velocity component in the upper chromosphere (y = 1.75 Mm), producing a collimated plasma structure that exhibits characteristics similar to macrospicules. We focus on the formation and evolution of the chromospheric jet as it propagates through an optically thin region encompassing the upper chromosphere and solar corona, where both the Planck-averaged absorption and Rosseland-averaged scattering opacities are low. Although radiation transport terms only slightly affect the jet's morphology, they play a significant role in governing radiative processes in the corona. In particular, radiation transport contributes to the dissipation of the chromospheric jet, which effectively acts as a radiative cooling mechanism as the jet evolves through the optically thin solar corona.</description>

      <title>Ensemble seismic study of the properties of the core of Red Clump stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red clump stars still pose open questions regarding several physical processes, such as the mixing around the core, or the nuclear reactions, which are ill-constrained by theory and experiments. The oscillations of red clump stars, which are of mixed gravito-acoustic nature, allow us to directly investigate the interior of these stars and thereby better understand their physics. In particular, the measurement of their period spacing is a good probe of the structure around the core. We aim to explain the distribution of period spacings in red clump stars observed by Kepler by testing different prescriptions of core-boundary mixing and nuclear reaction rate. Using the MESA stellar evolution code, we computed several grids of core-helium burning tracks, with varying masses and metallicities. Each of these grids have been computed assuming a certain core boundary mixing scheme, or carbon-alpha reaction rate. We then sampled these grids, in a Monte-Carlo fashion, using observational spectroscopic metallicities and seismic masses priors, in order to retrieve a period spacing distribution that we compared to the observations. We found that the best fitting distribution was obtained when using a "maximal overshoot" core-boundary scheme, which has similar seismic properties as a model whose modes are trapped outside a semi-convective region, and which does not exhibit core breathing pulses at the end of the core-helium burning phase. If no mode trapping is assumed, then no core boundary mixing scheme is compatible with the observations. Moreover, we found that extending the core with overshoot worsens the fit. Additionally, reducing the carbon-alpha reaction rate (by around 15%) improves the fit to the observed distribution. Finally, we noted that an overpopulation of early red clump stars with period spacing values around 250s is predicted by the models but not found in the observations.</description>

      <title>A chemodynamical study of $r$-process-enhanced stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $r$-process enrichment in the Galaxy still remains elusive with regard to its nucleosynthesis conditions and the astrophysical sites where it occurs. As part of ongoing efforts to pinpoint the origin of chemically peculiar $r$-process-enhanced (RPE) stars, we concentrate in this study on the kinematics of RPE stars to investigate possible variations in the $r$-process enrichment among the Galactic components. We calculate the orbital parameters of a sample of 472 metal-poor RPE stars and associate them to the Galactic bulge, disk and halo populations using a physically motivated classification based on apocenter distance and maximum absolute vertical height of the orbit. We show that the Toomre diagram does not properly separate stars in the disk and halo components when they are on highly eccentric and/or retrograde orbits. The Galactic disk and halo share a similar fraction of RPE stars, in contrast to the earlier perception that the majority of RPE stars belong to the halo. We find that the stars most likely to be accreted belong to the halo. However, 3/4 of the stars lie in a mixed-zone. The inner disk, inner halo and outer halo stars exhibit similar abundance trends for the n-capture elements.</description>

      <title>Understanding an origin of palladium in metal-poor stars based on the non-LTE analysis of Pd~I lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palladium is one of poorly observed neutron-capture elements. Abundance determinations for stellar samples covering a broad metallicity range are needed for better understanding the mechanisms of Pd synthesis during the Galaxy evolution. We aim to obtain accurate abundances of Pd for the Sun and the sample of metal-poor stars based on the non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) line formation for Pd~I. We present a new, comprehensive model atom of Pd~I. Abundances of Pd, Sr, Ba, and Eu were derived for 48 stars from the non-LTE analyses of high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra provided by the ESO archives. Non-LTE leads to weakened Pd~I lines and positive non-LTE abundance corrections growing from 0.2~dex for the solar lines up to 0.8~dex for the lines in the most luminous star of the sample. Depending on a treatment of inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms, the solar non-LTE abundance amounts to log eps = 1.61+-0.02 to 1.70+-0.02 and agrees within the error bars with the meteoritic abundance log eps_met = 1.65. Non-LTE largely removes the discrepancies in the LTE abundances between the giant and dwarf stars of similar metallicities. Palladium tightly correlates with Eu in the -1.71 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -0.56 range indicating the r- and s-process contributions to Pd synthesis of approximately 70% and 30%, respectively. Palladium is of pure r-process origin in our two r-II stars, and a dominant contribution of the r-process to the Pd abundances is found for another two very metal-poor (VMP, [Fe/H] &lt; -2) stars. The two VMP stars, which are strongly enhanced with Sr relative to Ba and Eu, reveal also enhancements with Pd. We propose that the source of extra Sr and Pd in these stars are VMP, fast rotating massive stars. Non-LTE is essential for obtaining the observational constraints to future models of the Galactic Pd evolution.</description>

      <title>Disk fraction among free-floating planetary-mass objects in Upper Scorpius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPs) have been detected through direct imaging within several young, nearby star-forming regions. The properties of circumstellar disks around these objects may provide a valuable probe into their origin, but is currently limited by the small sizes of the sample explored. We aim to perform a statistical study of the occurrence of circumstellar disks down to the planetary-mass regime. We performed a systematic survey of disks among the population identified in the 5-10 Myr-old Upper Scorpius association (USC), restricted to members outside the younger, embedded Ophiuchus region and with estimated masses below 105 M_Jup. We took advantage of unWISE photometry to search for mid-infrared excesses in the WISE (W1-W2) color. We implemented a Bayesian outlier detection method that models the photospheric sequence and computes excess probabilities for each object, enabling statistically sound estimation of disk fractions. We explore disk fractions across an unprecedentedly fine mass grid, reaching down to objects as low as ~6 M_Jup assuming 5 Myr or ~8 M_Jup assuming 10 Myr, thus extending the previous lower boundary of disk fraction studies. Depending on the age, our sample includes between 17 and 40 FFPs. We confirm that the disk fraction steadily rises with decreasing mass and exceeds 30% near the substellar-to-planetary mass boundary at ~13 M_Jup. We find hints of a possible flattening in this trend around 25-45 M_Jup, potentially signaling a transition in the dominant formation processes. This change of trend should be considered with caution and needs to be confirmed with more sensitive observations. Our results are consistent with the gradual dispersal of disks over time, as disk fractions in Upper Scorpius appear systematically lower than those in younger regions.</description>

      <title>Modeling gravitational wave sources in the MillenniumTNG simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Edited) We introduce a flexible framework for building gravitational wave (GW) event catalogs in hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. Our framework couples the state-of-the-art binary population synthesis code SEVN with Arepo-GW -- a module fully integrated into the moving-mesh code Arepo -- to assign merger events of binary compact objects to stellar particles in simulations by stochastically sampling merger tables generated with SEVN. Arepo-GW supports both on-the-fly operation, producing event catalogs during simulations, and post-processing, using snapshots from existing runs. The algorithm is fully parallel and can be readily adapted to outputs from other simulation codes. To demonstrate the capabilities of our new framework, we applied Arepo-GW in post-processing to simulations from the MillenniumTNG suite, including its flagship box. We investigate key properties of the resulting GW event catalog, built on SEVN predictions, focusing on comoving merger rates, formation efficiencies, delay-time distributions, and progenitor mass and metallicity distributions. We also examine how these properties vary with simulated volume. We find that GW progenitor rates closely track simulated star formation histories and are generally consistent with current observational constraints at low redshift, aside from a factor of $\sim 4.5$ excess in binary black hole mergers. Moreover, our binary black hole merger rates decline more slowly with redshift than current observational estimates for $z \lesssim 1$. Finally, the analysis of progenitor mass functions across different formation channels reveals only mild redshift evolution, while the binary black hole mass function displays features compatible with current observational determinations. These findings highlight the potential of our novel framework to enable detailed predictions for upcoming GW surveys within a full cosmological context.</description>

      <title>New ultralight scalar particles and the mass-radius relation of white dwarfs -- the important role of Sirius B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the equation of state for two classes of new ultralight particles, a scalar field coupling to electrons and a light $\mathbb{Z}_\mathcal{N}$ QCD axion field coupling to nucleons. Both are potential candidates for dark matter. Using the scalar modified equations of state, we calculate models for white dwarf stars and compare their radii and masses with observed mass-radius data. The comparison results in stringent constraints on the masses of the particles and the coupling parameters. For a wide range of particle masses and coupling parameters, constraints from the white dwarf equation of state surpass existing limits, outperforming also dedicated laboratory searches. The remarkable accuracy of modern white-dwarf mass-radius relation data, exemplified by Sirius B, now allows stringent tests of dense-matter physics and constraints on new particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Walk on the Retrograde Side (WRS) project. II. Chemistry to disentangle in situ and accreted components in Thamnos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the first systematic and dedicated high-resolution chemical analysis of the Thamnos substructure, a candidate relic of the process of hierarchical merger of the Milky Way. The analysis is perfomed in comparison with the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) remnant, within the fully self-consistent and homogeneous framework established by the WRS project. We analyse high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with UVES at VLT for 212 Red Giant Branch stars classified as candidate members of Thamnos and GSE, based on selections in the space of the integrals of motion. We derive precise abundances for 16 atomic species. Compared to GSE, stars attributed to the Thamnos substructure are, on average, more metal-poor, yet most of them show relatively higher [X/Fe] abundance ratios in several elements, like Na, Mg, Al, Ca, Cu, Zn, as well as lower [Eu/Fe]. The majority of candidate Thamnos stars show chemical signatures more consistent with the in situ Milky Way halo rather than a typical low-mass accreted dwarf galaxy. Our findings are further supported by comparisons with tailored galactic chemical evolution models, which fall short in reproducing the observed enhancement in the $\alpha$-elements, but are able to fit the more metal-poor component present in the Thamnos substructure. These results confirm a high level of contamination in the Thamnos substructure from the in situ population and to a lesser degree from GSE, while still leaving room for a genuine accreted population from a small disrupted dwarf galaxy.</description>

      <title>Influence of Solar Sails on Magnetic Field Measurements in Space Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar sail technology is ready to be deployed in a satellite mission carrying a science-grade magnetometer. In preparation for such a mission, it is essential to characterize the interactions between the sail and the ambient plasma that could affect the magnetometer readings. The solar wind magnetic field is a key parameter in space weather prediction, because it governs the energy-releasing magnetic reconnection process at Earth's magnetopause. This paper investigates the influence of solar sails on the ambient magnetic field, particularly focusing on two critical electromagnetic effects: eddy currents and magnetic pileup. We find the induced eddy currents in the metallic sail can significantly perturb the local magnetic field at high frequencies. We also suggest that magnetic pileup can influence the spacecraft's environment when the sail size is comparable to the electron kinetic scales of the surrounding plasma. This research provides an initial guide for determining when sail-plasma interactions could impact magnetometer performance.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing the Properties and Evolutionary Fates of Black Hole and Wolf-Rayet X-ray Binaries as Potential Gravitational Wave Sources for the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IC 10 X-1, NGC 300 X-1, and Cyg X-3 represent a unique class of X-ray binaries consisting of a stellar-mass black hole (BH) accreting material from a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star companion. These systems are particularly intriguing due to their short orbital periods (less than 1.5 d), making them promising progenitors of gravitational wave (GW) sources detectable by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) network. With a newly implemented prescription for accretion efficiency in the standard Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) framework and a corrected treatment of dynamical tides, we present for the \textit{first} time detailed binary evolution models to diagnose their properties at different evolutionary states and evaluate their fates as potential GW sources detectable by the LVK network. With additional constraints on the observed properties of IC 10 X-1 and NGC 300 X-1, we determine that the upper limit of the BH mass in these systems (IC 10 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 25\, M_\odot$, NGC 300 X-1: $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 15\, M_\odot$) is much lower than previously estimated. Both systems are expected to form binary black holes (BBHs) that will merge within a Hubble time, unless the BH in NGC 300 X-1 has a mass of $9\,M_\odot$, the lower limit estimated in a previous study based on the continuum-fitting method employing a relativistic slim-disc model. For Cyg X-3, we find that the upper limit on the BH spin magnitude cannot exceed 0.6. Interestingly, the WR star in Cyg X-3 is likely to form a lower-mass gap BH, and the resulting binary BH system will merge within the Hubble time.</description>

Abstract: Background: The $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ reaction is of special interest in three different applications. First, in Boron Neutron Capture Therapy due to the presence of $^{35}Cl$ in brain and skin tissue. Second, it is involved in the creation of $^{36}S$, whose astrophysical origin remains unresolved. Third, in the designing of fast nuclear reactors of new generation based on molten salts. Purpose: To measure the $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ cross-section from thermal energy to 120 keV, determine the resonance parameters in this range and Maxwellian Averaged Cross-Section (MACS). Method: We made use of the Time-of-Flight technique with microMEGAS detectors at Experimental Area 2 (EAR-2) of n\_TOF facility at CERN. The $^{10}B(n, \alpha)^{7}Li$ and $^{235}U(n, f)$ reactions were used as references. Rutherford Back-scattering Spectrometry technique was performed at Centro Nacional de Aceleradores (CNA) in Sevilla, in order to accurately determine the masses of the irradiated samples. Results: We obtain a thermal cross-section of $0.470 \pm 0.009$ barns. The $1/v$ energy dependence of the cross-section is observed up to the first resonance at 0.398 keV, the resonances up to 120 keV are analyzed and MACS calculated for $k_{B} T$ from 1 to 100 keV. Conclusions: The $^{35}Cl(n, p)^{35}S$ cross-section has been obtained over a wide energy range for the first time, with high accuracy across the aforementioned range. The thermal cross-section and first two resonances are in agreement with latest evaluation in ENDF/B-VIII.1, while lower resonance strength was found for high energy resonances. These data are used to calculate the MACS for different $k_{B} T$.</description>

      <title>Is the high-energy environment of K2-18b special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: K2-18b lies near the radius valley that separates super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, marking a key transitional regime in planetary and atmospheric composition. The system offers a valuable opportunity to study how M-dwarf high-energy stellar radiation influences atmospheric stability and the potential for sustaining volatile species, especially important in the context of the upcoming ELT and its ANDES spectrograph. This study characterizes the high-energy environment of K2-18 with X-ray observations from eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, Chandra, and XMM-Newton. We derive a representative 0.2-2 keV X-ray flux with an APEC thermal plasma model fitted with the Bayesian X-ray Analysis (BXA). With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star, we estimate the photo-evaporation mass loss of exoplanet K2-18b using the energy-limited model. In addition, we examine the thermal structure of the system based on a hydrodynamic model. In 100 ks XMM-Newton observations we identified K2-18 as a very faint X-ray source with $\mathrm{F_X = 10^{-15}\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$, with an activity level of (Lx/Lbol) $\sim 10^{-5}$. A small flare has been detected during the observation. The planet is irradiated by an X-ray flux of $\mathrm{F_{pl,X} = 12\pm3\ erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The X-ray flux measurement of K2-18 gives important limitations for atmospheric escape and photochemical modeling of its exoplanets. Despite its near orbit around an M-dwarf star, K2-18b's low activity level environment suggests that it can retain an atmosphere, supporting recent tentative detections of atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Radial Velocity Analysis I: Vision Transformers as a Robust Alternative for Detecting Planetary Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme precision radial velocity (EPRV) surveys usually require extensive observational baselines to confirm planetary candidates, making them resource-intensive. Traditionally, periodograms are used to identify promising candidate signals before further observational investment, but their effectiveness is often limited for low-amplitude signals due to stellar jitter. In this work, we develop a machine learning (ML) framework based on a Transformer architecture that aims to detect the presence and likely period of planetary signals in time-series spectra, even in the presence of stellar activity. The model is trained to classify whether a planetary signal exists and assign it to one of several discrete period and amplitude bins. Injection-recovery tests on randomly selected 100 epoch observation subsets from NEID solar data (2020-2022 period) show that for low-amplitude systems ($&lt;$1 ms$^{-1}$), our model improves planetary candidate identification by a factor of two compared to the traditional Lomb-Scargle periodogram.
  Our ML model is built on a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that processes reduced representations of solar spectrum observations to predict the period and semi-amplitude of planetary signal candidates. By analyzing multi-epoch spectra, the model reliably detects planetary signals with semi-amplitudes as low as 65 cms$^{-1}$. Even under real solar noise and irregular sampling, it identifies signals down to 35 cms$^{-1}$. Comparisons with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram demonstrate a significant improvement in detecting low-amplitude planetary candidates, particularly for longer orbital periods. These results underscore the potential of machine learning to identify planetary candidates early in EPRV surveys, even from limited observational counts.</description>

      <title>Polka-dotted Stars II: Starspots and obliquities of Kepler-17 and Kepler-63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starspots trace stellar magnetic activity and influence both stellar evolution and exoplanet characterization. While occultation-based spot analyses have been applied to individual systems, comparative studies remain limited. We apply the StarryStarryProcess Bayesian surface-mapping framework to archival Kepler light curves of two planet hosts, Kepler-63 and Kepler-17, extending the validation established on TOI-3884 (Paper I). Across both systems, we infer characteristic spot radii smaller than 10 degrees. The latitudinal spot distributions of these G dwarfs show bimodal belts: Kepler-63 near 30 degrees and Kepler-17 near 15 degrees. Our analysis yields stellar obliquity measurements in excellent agreement with previous studies, validating our methodology and demonstrating that transit-based surface mapping can simultaneously recover planetary parameters, stellar orientations, and magnetic morphologies. Together, these results reveal a range of stellar geometries from nearly aligned (Kepler-17) to highly misaligned (Kepler-63).</description>

      <title>Fomalhaut's debris disc is not dominated by primordial Plutos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in debris-disc science is that we do not know the masses of debris discs, nor the sizes of the largest debris bodies. This is because modern observations can only detect objects up to centimetre sizes, whilst larger planetesimals, which dominate disc mass, remain hidden. We must therefore use other arguments, such as dynamics, to indirectly infer disc masses and body sizes. This paper presents a new method, applicable to narrow debris discs like Fomalhaut. We argue that such discs cannot be too massive, nor the largest bodies too large, otherwise they would self-scatter and the disc would be much broader than observed. Using n-body dynamics and collisional theory, we demonstrate that the mass of Fomalhaut's disc cannot be dominated by primordial Plutos. Instead, if the mass is dominated by primordial bodies, then they should have radii below $300^{+80}_{-70}$ km ($0.3 \pm 0.1$ RPluto) and above $5^{+20}_{-4}$ km. Such bodies would each have less than 1 per cent the mass of Pluto. Our conclusions are robust to additional physics, including shepherding planets and collisional damping. Our results provide independent, dynamical support for the idea that the masses of bright debris discs are dominated by objects smaller than Pluto.</description>

      <title>Distribution of Europium in The Milky Way Disk; Its Connection to Planetary Habitability and The Source of The R-Process</title>

Abstract: The energy provided in the radioactive decay of thorium (Th) and uranium (U) isotopes, embedded in planetary mantles, sustains geodynamics important for surface habitability such as the generation of a planetary magnetic dynamo. In order to better understand the thermal evolution of nearby exoplanets, stellar photospheric abundances can be used to infer the material composition of orbiting planets. Here we constrain the intrinsic dispersion of the r-process element europium (Eu) (measured in relative abundance [Eu/H]) as a proxy for Th and U in local F, G, and K type dwarf stars. Adopting stellar-chemical data from two high quality spectroscopic surveys, we have determined a small intrinsic scatter of 0.025 dex in [Eu/H] within the disk. We further investigate the stellar anti-correlation in [Eu/$\alpha$] vs [$\alpha$/H] at late metallicities to probe in what regimes planetary radiogenic heating may lead to periods of extended dynamo collapse. We find that only near-solar metallicity stars in the disk have Eu inventories supportive of a persistent dynamo in attendant planets, supporting the notion of a ``metallicity Goldilocks zone'' in the galactic disk. The observed anti-correlation further provides novel evidence regarding the nature of r-processes injection by substantiating $\alpha$ element production is decoupled from Eu injection. This suggests either a metallicity-dependent r-process in massive core-collapse supernovae, or that neutron-star merger events dominate r-process production in the recent universe.</description>

      <title>Investigating dusty Red Supergiant outflows in Westerlund 1 with 3D Hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations towards Westerlund 1 revealed extensive nebular emission associated with the cluster. Given the age of the region and proximity of that material to massive stars it cannot be primordial star forming gas and the origin is uncertain. We aim to determine whether the nebular emission in Westerlund 1 could be due to ablation flows from Red Supergiant (RSG) stars embedded in the cluster wind driven by the Wolf-Rayet stars in the cluster core. We also aim to explore the efficiency of mass-loading for the RSG wind in this scenario. We use 3D hydrodynamic simulations with the \textsc{pion} code to study the interaction between the cluster and RSG winds. We compare with the JWST observations by generating synthetic dust-emission maps. We find that the ablation flow morphology is consistent with the observations towards Westerlund 1, with clumps and instabilities. Synthetic observations at 11 $\mu$m predict fluxes in the ablation flow of $\sim1000-6000$ MJy ster$^{-1}$ which is consistent with the unsaturated components of the JWST F1130W observations in the vicinity of the red supergiants in the region. This good agreement is achieved without any consideration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have a known 11.3 $\mu$m feature that appears in the F1130W band. This suggests that the ablation flow is PAH depleted. Ablation of RSG winds can explain the observed nebulosity in Westerlund 1, at least in the vicinity of the RSGs. Further observations are encouraged to enable detailed studies of these interactions.</description>

      <title>Determining the 3D Dynamics of Solar Flare Magnetic Reconnection</title>

Abstract: Solar flares are major space weather events that result from the explosive conversion of stored magnetic energy into bulk motion, plasma heating, and particle acceleration. While the standard flare model has proven highly successful in explaining key morphological features of flare observations, many aspects of the energy release are not yet understood. In particular, the turbulent three-dimensional structure of the flare current sheet is thought to play an important role in fast reconnection, particle acceleration, and bursty dynamics. Although direct diagnosis of the magnetic field dynamics in the corona remains highly challenging, rich information may be gleaned from flare ribbons, which represent the chromospheric imprints of reconnection in the corona. Intriguingly, recent solar imaging observations have revealed a diversity of fine structure in flare ribbons that hints at corresponding complexity in the reconnection region. We present high-resolution three-dimensional MHD simulations of an eruptive flare and describe our efforts to interpret fine-scale ribbon features in terms of the current sheet dynamics. In our model, the current sheet is characterized by many coherent magnetic structures known as plasmoids. We derive a model analogue for ribbons by generating a time series of field-line length maps (L-maps) and identifying abrupt shortenings as flare reconnection events. We thereby demonstrate that plasmoids imprint transient 'spirals' along the analogue of the ribbon front, with a morphology consistent with observed fine structure. We discuss the implications of these results for interpreting SolO, IRIS, and DKIST observations of explosive flare energy release.</description>

      <title>Thick Disks around White Dwarfs viewed 'Edge-off': Effects on Transit Properties and Infrared Excess</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) host dust/debris disks formed from the tidal disruption of asteroids and planetesimals. Several studies indicate that the disks can attain significant vertical heights through collisional cascade. In this work I model the effects of geometrically thick disks on two primary observables: photometric transits by the disk when viewed at high inclinations and infrared dust emission. Specifically, I consider disks with a Gaussian vertical profile with scale heights comparable to or larger than the WD radius. I primarily focus on inclinations $\gtrsim$$87$ degrees (`edge-off'), which can produce significant transits with moderate disk thickness. Both the transit depth and color become strong functions of inclination, and I explore their dependence on the disk parameters. I show that such a setup can produce the recently discovered reddening in the transit of WD J1013$-$0427. Moving to infrared emission, I show that the contribution from the heated inner rim can be substantial even at high inclinations. It can potentially explain the infrared excess observed in two transiting debris systems, WD 1145$+$017 and WD 1232$+$563, consistently with the transits. The other two important radiation components are the optically thin dust emission from the disk's outer layers and the optically thick emission from the backwarmed disk interior. Extending my analysis to G29-38 shows that the former can adequately produce the silicate emission feature with optically thin dust mass of $&gt;$$10^{17}$ grams. The inner dense layers, on the other hand, allow the disk to contain orders of magnitude larger net dust mass. Overall, I show that thick disk effects can be significant and should be taken into account. I motivate detailed studies to quantify the effects accurately.</description>

Properties of this fundamental process are poorly described near the solar poles. Here we report the first out-of-ecliptic remote-sensing observations of the south pole of the Sun from a high-latitude campaign of the Solar Orbiter spacecraft which reveal spatial and temporal evolution of supergranular convective cells. The supergranular cells have spatial scales of 20--40 Mm. From eight days of observations starting on 2025 March 16, our analysis shows that the magnetic network migrates poleward, on average, at high latitudes (above 60\textdegree), with speeds in the range of 10--20 m s$^{-1}$, depending on the structures being tracked. These results shed light on the buildup of the polar magnetic field that is central to our understanding of the solar cycle and the heliospheric magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Solar Wind Forecast Using Magnetic Maps That Include Helioseismic Far-Side Information</title>

Abstract: To model the structure and dynamics of the heliosphere well enough for high-quality forecasting, it is essential to accurately estimate the global solar magnetic field used as inner boundary condition in solar wind models. However, our understanding of the photospheric magnetic field topology is inherently constrained by the limitation of systematically observing the Sun from only one vantage point, Earth. To address this challenge, we introduce global magnetic field maps that assimilate far-side active regions derived from helioseismology into solar wind modeling. Through a comparative analysis between the combined surface flux transport and helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model (FARM) magnetic maps and the base surface flux transport model without far-side active regions (SFTM), we assess the feasibility and efficacy of incorporating helioseismic far-side information in space weather forecasting. We are employing the Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind (WSA) model for statistical evaluation and leveraging the EUropean Heliospheric FOrecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA), a three-dimensional heliospheric MHD model, to analyze a case study. Using the WSA model, we show that including far-side magnetic data improves solar wind forecasts for 2013-2014 by up to 50% in correlation and 3% in root mean square error and mean absolute error, especially near Earth and Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory - Ahead (STEREO-A). Additionally, our 3D modeling shows significant localized differences in heliospheric structure that can be attributed to the presence or absence of active regions in the magnetic maps used as input boundaries. This highlights the importance of including far-side information to more accurately model and predict space weather effects caused by solar wind, solar transients, and geomagnetic disturbances.</description>

      <title>Abundance of strontium in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc</title>

Abstract: Aims. We have determined Sr abundance in a sample of 31 red giant branch stars located in the Galactic globular cluster 47 Tuc with the aim to identify potential differences in the Sr abundance between first population (1P, Na-poor) and second population (2P, Na-rich) stars. Methods. We derived the Na and Sr abundances from the archival spectra obtained with the UVES spectrograph. To do this, we used 1D ATLAS9 model atmospheres and a 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium spectral synthesis method. Particular attention was paid to assessing the potential impact of CN line blending on the obtained Sr abundances. Furthermore, we evaluated the potential influence of convection on the Sr line formation by using 3D hydrodynamical model atmospheres computed with the CO5BOLD code. Results. Our results suggest a weak correlation between the abundances of Sr and Na. Together with a similar correlation between the abundances of Zr and Na determined in our previous study, our analysis of Sr suggests that polluters that have enriched 2P stars with light elements may have produced some s-process elements as well. The mean Sr abundance determined in 31 red giant branch stars of 47~Tuc is $\langle {\rm [Sr/Fe]} \rangle = 0.18\pm0.08$ (the error denotes the standard deviation due to the star-to-star abundance scatter). This value is within the range of the Sr abundance variation that is observed in Galactic field stars of similar metallicity. The mean [Sr/Zr] abundance ratio in our sample stars suggests that the two s-process elements could have been synthesized by either low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars ($M=1-4 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) or massive ($M=10-20 {\rm M}_{\odot}$) fast-rotating ($v_{\rm rot}=200-300$ km/s) stars.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a New $\beta$-Scaling of the Tearing Instability in Weakly Collisional Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear tearing instability in weakly collisional plasmas using a non-ideal gyrotropic-MHD framework, uncovering a previously unknown scaling relation for the instability growth rate in high-$\beta$ environments. Even starting from an isotropic equilibrium, our analysis reveals a $\beta$-dependence, with the maximum growth rate scaling as $\sigma_\mathrm{max} \tau_a \propto \beta^{-1/4}$, challenging the long-held assumption of $\beta$-independence inherent in classical MHD formulations. This novel scaling emerges due to self-consistent fluctuations in pressure anisotropy, dynamically induced by perturbations in velocity and magnetic fields. Increasing plasma-$\beta$ always suppresses the instability, whereas a background pressure anisotropy can either enhance or further suppress it, depending on its sign: for $p_{\parallel,0} &lt; p_{\perp,0}$ the instability is strengthened, while for $p_{\parallel,0} &gt; p_{\perp,0}$ it is weakened. Importantly, this effect is not limited to low-collisionality plasmas at high $\beta$; it can also manifest in more collisional environments once the strict assumption of pressure isotropy is relaxed. This finding has profound implications for various astrophysical contexts characterized by high $\beta$ and varying degrees of collisionality, including the solar corona and heliospheric current sheets, planetary magnetospheres, as probed by space missions, and the intracluster medium, where magnetic reconnection critically impacts magnetic field evolution and cosmic ray transport. Our results therefore question the universality of the widely-accepted plasmoid-mediated fast reconnection paradigm and underscore the necessity of incorporating pressure anisotropy effects into reconnection models for accurate representation of astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>Type Ibn supernovae from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors</title>

Abstract: Ultra-stripped supernovae are core-collapse supernovae from progenitors that lose a significant fraction of mass because of the binary interactions with their compact companion stars. Ultra-stripped supernovae have been connected to fast-evolving faint Type Ib or Ic supernovae. Here, we show that in some cases ultra-stripped supernovae can result in Type Ibn supernovae. Progenitors of ultra-stripped supernovae may trigger violent silicon burning shortly before the core collapse, leading to mass ejection that results in a dense circumstellar matter. By taking an ultra-stripped supernova progenitor that loses 0.2 Msun at 78 days before the core collapse, we compute the light-curve evolution of the ultra-stripped supernova within the dense circumstellar matter. The core collapse results in a supernova explosion with an ejecta mass of 0.06 Msun and an explosion energy of 9e49 erg. Because the dense circumstellar matter is more massive than the supernova ejecta, the ejecta are immediately decelerated and the light curve is powered mainly by the circumstellar interaction. Therefore, this ultra-stripped supernova is likely observed as a Type Ibn supernova. We suggest that some Type Ibn supernovae may originate from ultra-stripped supernova progenitors losing significant mass shortly before their explosion due to violent silicon burning.</description>

      <title>Magnetars in Binaries as the Engine of Actively Repeating Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12119</link>

Abstract: The association between FRB 20200428D and the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 makes magnetars the leading engine of cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, there is a list of puzzles for this magnetar-for-all-FRBs scenario: known Galactic magnetars are all isolated and none of them are active repeaters; some cosmological repeaters have extremely high repetition rates but without any measurable spin-related periodicity; some show long-term periodic active windows; and some show diverse rotation measure (RM) evolution patterns, such as quasi-periodic fluctuations, sign reversals, and abrupt RM flares. Here we propose a unified theoretical framework for FRBs within the framework of magnetar engine: Most active repeating FRBs originate from magnetars in binary systems with nearly aligned rotation and magnetic axes, some of which with a triple-aligned geometry, i.e. with an alignment with the orbital axis as well; whereas apparent non-repeaters and inactive repeaters originate from magnetars in isolated systems or in binaries with a misaligned geometry. By studying various magnetar formation channels using population syntheses, we show that a few percent of magnetars in the universe can be in binary systems, most with a massive star companion and some with aligned geometry. We suggest that such binary systems can account for the rich phenomenology of active repeaters. We suggest that the existence of a companion helps to maintain the aligned geometry and that the companion may play an active role in triggering FRBs in an active repeater source.</description>

      <title>The impact of Alfvenic shear flow on magnetic reconnection and turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental and omnipresent energy conversion process in plasma physics. Novel observations of fields and particles from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have shown the absence of reconnection in a large number of current sheets in the near-Sun solar wind. Using near-Sun observations from PSP Encounters 4 to 11 (Jan 2020 to March 2022), we investigate whether reconnection onset might be suppressed by velocity shear. We compare estimates of the tearing mode growth rate in the presence of shear flow for time periods identified as containing reconnecting current sheets versus non-reconnecting times, finding systematically larger growth rates for reconnection periods. Upon examination of the parameters associated with reconnection onset, we find that 85% of the reconnection events are embedded in slow, non-Alfvenic wind streams. We compare with fast, slow non-Alfvenic, and slow Alfvenic streams, finding that the growth rate is suppressed in highly Alfvenic fast and slow wind and reconnection is not seen in these wind types, as would be expected from our theoretical expressions. These wind streams have strong Alfvenic flow shear, consistent with the idea of reconnection suppression by such flows. This could help explain the frequent absence of reconnection events in the highly Alfvenic, near-Sun solar wind observed by PSP. Finally, we find a steepening of both the trace and magnitude magnetic field spectra within reconnection periods in comparison to ambient wind. We tie this to the dynamics of relatively balanced turbulence within these reconnection periods and the potential generation of compressible fluctuations.</description>

      <title>A Link Between Rocky Planet Density and Host Star Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planets and their host stars form from the same cloud of gas and dust, so we assume that their chemical compositions are linked. However, a clear correlation between rocky planet interior properties and host star chemistry remains elusive for planets around FGK dwarfs, and non-existent for planets around M dwarfs because cool stars frequently lack detailed chemical information. Here, we investigate the relationship between small (R$_{P}$ $\leq$ 1.8 R$_{\oplus}$) planet densities and host star elemental abundances. We use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V/Milky Way Mapper and an accompanying data-driven framework to obtain abundances for FGK and M dwarf hosts of 22 rocky planets. We find that planet densities exhibit a strong, inverse relationship to [Mg/Fe] abundances of FGK hosts (p = 0.001). This correlation becomes more significant with the addition of M dwarf hosts (p = 0.0005). If we assume that rocky planets have terrestrial-like compositions, this suggests that low [Mg/Fe] environments form planets with larger Fe-rich cores and thus higher densities. The thick disk planets in our sample help anchor this trend, illustrating the importance of sampling exoplanet properties across a range of host star populations. This finding highlights the connection between Galactic chemical evolution and rocky planet formation, and indicates that Earth-like planet compositions may vary significantly across different regions of the Galaxy.</description>
