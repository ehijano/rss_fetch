      <title>Physical limits on galvanotaxis depends on cell morphology and orientation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galvanotaxis is believed to be driven by the redistribution of transmembrane proteins and other molecules, referred to as "sensors", through electrophoresis and electroosmosis. Here, we update our previous model of the limits of galvanotaxis due to stochasticity of sensor movements to account for cell shape and orientation. Computing the Fisher information, we find that cells in principle possess more information about the electric field direction when their long axis is parallel to the field, but that for weak fields maximum-likelihood estimators of the field direction may actually have lower variability when the cell's long axis is perpendicular to the field. In an alternate possibility, we find that if cells instead estimate the field direction by taking the average of all the sensor locations as its directional cue ("vector sum"), this introduces a bias towards the short axis, an effect not present for isotropic cells. We also explore the possibility that cell elongation arises downstream of sensor redistribution. We argue that if sensors migrate to the cell's rear, the cell will expand perpendicular the field - as is more commonly observed - but if sensors migrate to the front, the cell will elongate parallel to the field.</description>

      <title>Learning a phenomenological theory for contact-interactions between motile cells from collision experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The migration behavior of colliding cells is critically determined by transient contact-interactions. During these interactions, the motility machinery, including the front-rear polarization of the cell, dynamically responds to surface protein-mediated transmission of forces and biochemical signals between cells. While biomolecular details of such contact-interactions are increasingly well understood, it remains unclear what biophysical interaction mechanisms govern the cell-level dynamics of colliding cells and how these mechanisms vary across cell types. Here, we develop a phenomenological theory based on eleven candidate contact-interaction mechanisms coupling cell position, shape, and polarity. Using high-throughput micropattern experiments, we detect which of these phenomenological contact-interactions captures the interaction behaviors of cells. We find that various cell types - ranging from mesenchymal to epithelial cells - are accurately captured by a single model with only two interaction mechanisms: polarity-protrusion coupling and polarity-polarity coupling. The qualitatively different interaction behaviors of distinct cells, as well as cells subject to molecular perturbations of surface protein-mediated signaling, can all be quantitatively captured by varying the strength and sign of the polarity-polarity coupling mechanism. Altogether, our data-driven phenomenological theory of cell-cell interactions reveals polarity-polarity coupling as a versatile and general contact-interaction mechanism, which may underlie diverse collective migration behavior of motile cells.</description>
