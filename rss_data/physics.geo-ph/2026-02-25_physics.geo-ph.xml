      <title>The UK and Ireland Geophysical Array -- Concept and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific exploration of the UK and Ireland's subsurface has made important contributions to scholarship and prosperity for people and the planet, including economic growth, sustainable use of natural resources, storage of greenhouse gases, and inspiring curiosity about the Earth beneath our feet. This article outlines a vision for an array of seismological instruments spanning the UK and Ireland, UKI Array, augmented by other types of geophysical sensors, to maximise the value offered by existing equipment pools. The mission is to research natural phenomena and structure in the deep and shallow Earth, to solve problems concerning hazards and resources, to connect scientists to schools and the broader public, and thus to inspire a new generation to learn about geophysics. The vision was created through a community driven process of engagement and participation. This paper describes the concept and design of the UKI-Array; a companion paper discusses related opportunities and potential applications.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of natural remanence records in fine-grained particles returned from asteroid Ryugu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles collected from the asteroid Ryugu by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft offer a unique opportunity to investigate the magnetic record of the primitive solar system, as any terrestrial magnetic contamination is minimal and can be accounted for. In previous studies, stepwise alternating field demagnetization (AFD) measurements of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) records have been conducted on seven Ryugu particles. However, due to the limited number of samples, there is no consensus regarding the interpretation of the results of these measurements. To address this problem, we performed stepwise AFD measurements of the NRM on 28 Ryugu particles. Twenty-three of the particles exhibited one or two stable NRM components, whereas the remaining five did not. Isothermal remanent magnetization-based paleointensity values derived from stable NRM components varied by more than one order of magnitude. These NRM characteristics were consistent with those observed in previous studies. Therefore, as a reflection of the original nature of the NRM record, some Ryugu particles exhibited stable NRM components, whereas others did not. The Ryugu particles investigated in this study and those from a previous study exhibited spatially inhomogeneous NRM directions within individual particles, constraining the NRM acquisition time to before the final solidification of the current Ryugu particles. A mechanism of remanence acquisition that can explain the observed NRM characteristics is a chemical remanent magnetization associated with the growth of framboidal magnetite during aqueous alteration in Ryugu's parent body.</description>

      <title>The Oxygen Valve on Hydrogen Escape Since the Great Oxidation Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Great Oxidation Event (GOE) was a $200$ Myr transition circa 2.4 billion years ago that converted the Earth's anoxic atmosphere to one where molecular oxygen (O$_2$) was abundant (volume mixing ratio $&gt;10^{-4}$). This significant rise in O$_2$ is thought to have substantially throttled hydrogen (H) escape and the associated water (H$_2$O) loss. Atmospheric estimations from the GOE onward place O$_2$ concentrations ranging between 0.1% to 150% PAL, where PAL is the present atmospheric level of 21% by volume. In this study we use WACCM6, a three-dimensional Earth System Model to simulate Earth's atmosphere and predict the diffusion-limited escape rate of hydrogen due to varying O$_2$ post-GOE. We find that O$_2$ indirectly acts as a control valve on the amount of hydrogen atoms reaching the homopause in the simulations: less O$_2$ leads to decreased O$_3$ densities that reduce local tropical tropopause temperatures by up to 17 K, which increases H$_2$O freeze-drying and thus reduces the primary source of hydrogen in the considered scenarios. The maximum differences between all simulations in the total H mixing ratio at the homopause and the associated diffusion-limited escape rates are a factor of 3.2 and 4.7, respectively. The prescribed CH$_4$ mixing ratio (0.8 ppmv) sets a minimum diffusion escape rate of $\approx 2 \times 10^{10}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$, effectively a negligible rate when compared to pre-GOE estimates ($\sim10^{12}-10^{13}$ mol H yr$^{-1}$). Because the changes in our predicted escape rates are comparatively minor, our numerical predictions support geological evidence that the majority of Earth's hydrogen escape occurred prior to the GOE. Our work demonstrates that estimations of how the hydrogen escape rate evolved through Earth's history requires 3D chemistry-climate models which include a global treatment of water vapour microphysics.</description>
