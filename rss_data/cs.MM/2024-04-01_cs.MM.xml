      <title>ConvBench: A Multi-Turn Conversation Evaluation Benchmark with Hierarchical Capability for Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents ConvBench, a novel multi-turn conversation evaluation benchmark tailored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Unlike existing benchmarks that assess individual capabilities in single-turn dialogues, ConvBench adopts a three-level multimodal capability hierarchy, mimicking human cognitive processes by stacking up perception, reasoning, and creativity. Each level focuses on a distinct capability, mirroring the cognitive progression from basic perception to logical reasoning and ultimately to advanced creativity. ConvBench comprises 577 meticulously curated multi-turn conversations encompassing 215 tasks reflective of real-world demands. Automatic evaluations quantify response performance at each turn and overall conversation level. Leveraging the capability hierarchy, ConvBench enables precise attribution of conversation mistakes to specific levels. Experimental results reveal a performance gap between multi-modal models, including GPT4-V, and human performance in multi-turn conversations. Additionally, weak fine-grained perception in multi-modal models contributes to reasoning and creation failures. ConvBench serves as a catalyst for further research aimed at enhancing visual dialogues.</description>

      <title>HGT: Leveraging Heterogeneous Graph-enhanced Large Language Models for Few-shot Complex Table Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Table understanding (TU) has achieved promising advancements, but it faces the challenges of the scarcity of manually labeled tables and the presence of complex table structures.To address these challenges, we propose HGT, a framework with a heterogeneous graph (HG)-enhanced large language model (LLM) to tackle few-shot TU tasks.It leverages the LLM by aligning the table semantics with the LLM's parametric knowledge through soft prompts and instruction turning and deals with complex tables by a multi-task pre-training scheme involving three novel multi-granularity self-supervised HG pre-training objectives.We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of HGT, showing that it outperforms the SOTA for few-shot complex TU on several benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Creating Aesthetic Sonifications on the Web with SIREN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SIREN is a flexible, extensible, and customizable web-based general-purpose interface for auditory data display (sonification). Designed as a digital audio workstation for sonification, synthesizers written in JavaScript using the Web Audio API facilitate intuitive mapping of data to auditory parameters for a wide range of purposes.
  This paper explores the breadth of sound synthesis techniques supported by SIREN, and details the structure and definition of a SIREN synthesizer module. The paper proposes further development that will increase SIREN's utility.</description>

      <title>Language Model Beats Diffusion -- Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05737v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are the dominant models for generative tasks in language, they do not perform as well as diffusion models on image and video generation. To effectively use LLMs for visual generation, one crucial component is the visual tokenizer that maps pixel-space inputs to discrete tokens appropriate for LLM learning. In this paper, we introduce MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for both videos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this new tokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image and video generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing video tokenizer on two more tasks: (1) video compression comparable to the next-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2) learning effective representations for action recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Multi-view Representation Learning via Distilled Disentangling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-view representation learning aims to derive robust representations that are both view-consistent and view-specific from diverse data sources. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of existing approaches in this domain, highlighting a commonly overlooked aspect: the redundancy between view-consistent and view-specific representations. To this end, we propose an innovative framework for multi-view representation learning, which incorporates a technique we term 'distilled disentangling'. Our method introduces the concept of masked cross-view prediction, enabling the extraction of compact, high-quality view-consistent representations from various sources without incurring extra computational overhead. Additionally, we develop a distilled disentangling module that efficiently filters out consistency-related information from multi-view representations, resulting in purer view-specific representations. This approach significantly reduces redundancy between view-consistent and view-specific representations, enhancing the overall efficiency of the learning process. Our empirical evaluations reveal that higher mask ratios substantially improve the quality of view-consistent representations. Moreover, we find that reducing the dimensionality of view-consistent representations relative to that of view-specific representations further refines the quality of the combined representations.
