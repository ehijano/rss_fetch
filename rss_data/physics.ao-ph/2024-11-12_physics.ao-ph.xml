      <title>Are Deep Learning Methods Suitable for Downscaling Global Climate Projections? Review and Intercomparison of Existing Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise for downscaling global climate change projections under different approaches, including Perfect Prognosis (PP) and Regional Climate Model (RCM) emulation. Unlike emulators, PP downscaling models are trained on observational data, so it remains an open question whether they can plausibly extrapolate unseen conditions and changes in future emissions scenarios. Here we focus on this problem as the main drawback for the operationalization of these methods and present the results of 1) a literature review to identify state-of-the-art DL models for PP downscaling and 2) an intercomparison experiment to evaluate the performance of these models and to assess their extrapolation capability using a common experimental framework, taking into account the sensitivity of results to different training replicas. We focus on minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation over Spain, a region with a range of climatic conditions with different influential regional processes. We conclude with a discussion of the findings, limitations of existing methods, and prospects for future development.</description>

      <title>Tackling extreme urban heat: a machine learning approach to assess the impacts of climate change and the efficacy of climate adaptation strategies in urban microclimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat becomes a priority for climate adaptation efforts. High temperatures concentrated in urban heat can drive increased risk of heat-related death and illness as well as increased energy demand for cooling. However, estimating the effects of urban heat is an ongoing field of research typically burdened by an imprecise description of the built environment, significant computational cost, and a lack of high-resolution estimates of the impacts of climate change. Here, we present open-source, computationally efficient machine learning methods that can improve the accuracy of urban temperature estimates when compared to historical reanalysis data. These models are applied to residential buildings in Los Angeles, and we compare the energy benefits of heat mitigation strategies to the impacts of climate change. We find that cooling demand is likely to increase substantially through midcentury, but engineered high-albedo surfaces could lessen this increase by more than 50%. The corresponding increase in heating demand complicates this narrative, but total annual energy use from combined heating and cooling with electric heat pumps in the Los Angeles urban climate is shown to benefit from the engineered cooling strategies under both current and future climates.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-based Denoising of Surface Solar Irradiance simulated with Monte Carlo Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating radiative transfer in the atmosphere with Monte Carlo ray tracing provides realistic surface irradiance in cloud-resolving models. However, Monte Carlo methods are computationally expensive because large sampling budgets are required to obtain sufficient convergence. Here, we explore the use of machine learning for denoising direct and diffuse surface solar irradiance fields. We use Monte Carlo ray tracing to compute pairs of noisy and well-converged surface irradiance fields for an ensemble of cumulus cloud fields and solar angles, and train a denoising autoencoder to predict the well-converged irradiance fields from the noisy input. We demonstrate that denoising diffuse irradiance from 1 sample per pixel (per spectral quadrature point) is an order of magnitude faster and twice as accurate as ray tracing with 128 samples per pixel, illustrating the advantage of denoising over larger sampling budgets. Denoising of direct irradiance is effective in sunlit areas, while errors persist on the edges of cloud shadows. For diffuse irradiance, providing additional atmospheric information such as liquid water paths and solar angles to train the denoising algorithm reduces errors by approximately a factor of two. Our results open up possibilities for coupled Monte Carlo ray tracing with computational costs approaching those of two-stream-based radiative transfer solvers, although future work is needed to improve generalization across resolutions and cloud types.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Deep Learning Parameterizations for Ocean Subgrid Eddy Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to computational constraints, climate simulations cannot resolve a range of small-scale physical processes, which have a significant impact on the large-scale evolution of the climate system. Parameterization is an approach to capture the effect of these processes, without resolving them explicitly. In recent years, data-driven parameterizations based on convolutional neural networks have obtained promising results. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of these parameterizations developed using data from ocean simulations. The parametrizations account for the effect of mesoscale eddies toward improving simulations of momentum, heat, and mass exchange in the ocean. Our results provide several insights into the properties of data-driven parameterizations based on neural networks. First, their performance can be substantially improved by increasing the geographic extent of the training data. Second, they learn nonlinear structure, since they are able to outperform a linear baseline. Third, they generalize robustly across different CO2 forcings, but not necessarily across different ocean depths. Fourth, they exploit a relatively small region of their input to generate their output. Our results will guide the further development of ocean mesoscale eddy parameterizations, and multiscale modeling more generally.</description>

      <title>Forecast error growth: A dynamic-stochastic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a history of simple forecast error growth models designed to capture the key properties of error growth in operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. We propose here such a scalar model that relies on the previous ones and incorporates multiplicative noise in a nonlinear stochastic differential equation (SDE). We analyze the properties of the SDE, including the shape of the error growth curve for small times and its stationary distribution, and prove well-posedness and positivity of solutions. We then fit this model to operational NWP error growth curves, showing good agreement with both the mean and probabilistic features of the error growth. These results suggest that the dynamic-stochastic error growth model proposed herein and similar ones could play a role in many other areas of the sciences that involve prediction.</description>

      <title>HiHa: Introducing Hierarchical Harmonic Decomposition to Implicit Neural Compression for Atmospheric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large climate models has created the requirement of storing and transferring massive atmospheric data worldwide. Therefore, data compression is essential for meteorological research, but an efficient compression scheme capable of keeping high accuracy with high compressibility is still lacking. As an emerging technique, Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has recently acquired impressive momentum and demonstrates high promise for compressing diverse natural data. However, the INR-based compression encounters a bottleneck due to the sophisticated spatio-temporal properties and variability. To address this issue, we propose Hierarchical Harmonic decomposition implicit neural compression (HiHa) for atmospheric data. HiHa firstly segments the data into multi-frequency signals through decomposition of multiple complex harmonic, and then tackles each harmonic respectively with a frequency-based hierarchical compression module consisting of sparse storage, multi-scale INR and iterative decomposition sub-modules. We additionally design a temporal residual compression module to accelerate compression by utilizing temporal continuity. Experiments depict that HiHa outperforms both mainstream compressors and other INR-based methods in both compression fidelity and capabilities, and also demonstrate that using compressed data in existing data-driven models can achieve the same accuracy as raw data.</description>

      <title>Representing and Analysing Conceptual Understanding of Cloud Physics Using Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution in conceptual understanding of cloud physics among learners from diverse academic backgrounds, using the mathematical framework of graph theory. We provide a diagnosis of the changes occurring along a learner's journey in cloud physics, and of the structure of the discipline and its inherent conceptual complexities. Overall, our results both qualify and quantify the epistemological shift in the description of the life-cycle of a cloud (from the general physics of the water cycle to detailed description of cloud microphysical processes) as learners mature in their understanding of the discipline. A triangulation of data sources with a panel of experts in the discipline complements and confirms our findings. These can be used by lecturers to tailor their teaching towards the identified expert-like concepts, and by students to anticipate the main complexities in the field during their learning process.</description>

      <title>A dual-pairing summation-by-parts finite difference framework for nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust and stable high order numerical methods for solving partial differential equations are attractive because they are efficient on modern and next generation hardware architectures. However, the design of provably stable numerical methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws pose a significant challenge. We present the dual-pairing (DP) and upwind summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference (FD) framework for accurate and robust numerical approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. The framework has an inbuilt "limiter" whose goal is to detect and effectively resolve regions where the solution is poorly resolved and/or discontinuities are found. The DP SBP FD operators are a dual-pair of backward and forward FD stencils, which together preserve the SBP property. In addition, the DP SBP FD operators are designed to be upwind, that is they come with some innate dissipation everywhere, as opposed to traditional SBP and collocated discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods which can only induce dissipation through numerical fluxes acting at element interfaces. We combine the DP SBP operators together with skew-symmetric and upwind flux splitting of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. Our semi-discrete approximation is provably entropy-stable for arbitrary nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The framework is high order accurate, provably entropy-stable, convergent, and avoids several pitfalls of current state-of-the-art high order methods. We give specific examples using the in-viscid Burger's equation, nonlinear shallow water equations and compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to verify accuracy and demonstrate the robustness of our numerical framework.</description>

      <title>Stochastic parameterisation: the importance of nonlocality and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic parameterisations deployed in models of the Earth system frequently invoke locality assumptions such as Markovianity or spatial locality. This work highlights the impact of such assumptions on predictive performance. Both in terms of short-term forecasting and the representation of long-term statistics, we find locality assumptions to be detrimental in idealised experiments. We show, however, that judicious choice of Markovian parameterisation can mitigate errors due to assuming Markovianity. We propose a simple modification to Markovian parameterisations, which yields significant improvements in predictive skill while reducing computational cost. We further note a divergence between parameterisations which perform best in short-term prediction and those which best represent time-invariant statistics, contradicting the popular concept of seamless prediction in Earth system modelling.</description>

      <title>Lightning declines over shipping lanes following regulation of fuel sulfur emissions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07207v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aerosol interactions with clouds represent a significant uncertainty in our understanding of the Earth system. Deep convective clouds may respond to aerosol perturbations in several ways that have proven difficult to elucidate with observations. Here, we leverage the two busiest maritime shipping lanes in the world, which emit aerosol particles and their precursors into an otherwise relatively clean tropical marine boundary layer, to make headway on the influence of aerosol on deep convective clouds. The recent seven-fold change in allowable fuel sulfur by the International Maritime Organization allows us to test the sensitivity of the lightning to changes in ship plume aerosol size distributions. We find that, across a range of atmospheric thermodynamic conditions, the previously documented enhancement of lightning over the shipping lanes has fallen by over 40%. The enhancement is therefore at least partially aerosol-mediated, a conclusion that is supported by observations of droplet number at cloud base, which show a similar decline over the shipping lane. These results have fundamental implications for our understanding of aerosol-cloud interactions, suggesting that deep convective clouds are impacted by the aerosol number distribution in the remote marine environment.</description>

      <title>Emergent vorticity asymmetry of one and two-layer shallow water system captured by a next-order balanced model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasigeostrophic (QG) system has served as a useful simplified model for understanding geophysical physical fluid phenomena. The fact that it is based on only one prognostic variable $\textrm{ -- }$ potential vorticity (PV) $\textrm{ -- }$ is a simplification that has facilitated much theoretical understanding. However, although QG captures many geophysical turbulence phenomena, it misses important features that occur in shallow water systems at finite Rossby numbers, even those that are "balanced". For example, QG does not capture the emergent vorticity asymmetry or the finite divergence of the velocity fields. Here we present a next-order-in-Rossby extension of QG in the single-layer and multi-layer shallow water context: SWQG$^{+1}$. A freely decaying simulation shows that SWQG$^{+1}$ can capture the negatively skewed vorticity found in simulations of the shallow water model in the same setting. We also extend the model to the multi-layer configuration. Simulation of nonlinear evolution of a baroclinically unstable jet in SWQG$^{+1}$ shows that it can capture vorticity asymmetry and finite divergence of strain-driven fronts. We propose here that SWQG$^{+1}$ could be a useful intermediate model for theoretical and numerical study of the balanced dynamics of geophysical physical fluid dynamics, with possible applications for forward and inverse modeling of atmospheres and oceans on Earth and other planets.</description>

      <title>Regularization of the ensemble Kalman filter using a non-parametric, non-stationary spatial model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14318v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sample covariance matrix of a random vector is a good estimate of the true covariance matrix if the sample size is much larger than the length of the vector. In high-dimensional problems, this condition is never met. As a result, in high dimensions the Ensemble Kalman Filter's (EnKF) ensemble does not contain enough information to specify the prior covariance matrix accurately. This necessitates the need for regularization of the analysis (observation update) problem. We propose a regularization technique based on a new spatial model. The model is a constrained version of the general Gaussian process convolution model. The constraints include local stationarity and smoothness of local spectra. We regularize EnKF by postulating that its prior covariances obey the spatial model. Placing a hyperprior distribution on the model parameters and using the likelihood of the prior ensemble data allows for an optimized use of both the ensemble and the hyperprior. The respective estimator is shown to be consistent. Its neural Bayes implementation proved to be both accurate and computationally efficient. In simulation experiments, the new technique led to substantially better EnKF performance than several existing techniques.</description>

      <title>Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological properties of the spectrum of shallow-water waves on a rotating spherical body are established. Particular attention is paid to its spectral flow, i.e. the modes whose frequencies transit between the Rossby and inertia-gravity wavebands as the zonal wave number is varied. Organising the modes according to the number of zeros of their meridional velocity, we conclude that the net number of modes transiting between the shallow-water wavebands on the sphere is null, in contrast with the Matsuno spectrum. This difference can be explained by a miscount of zeros under the $\beta$-plane approximation. We corroborate this result with the analysis of Delplace et al (2017) by showing that the curved metric discloses a pair of degeneracy points in the Weyl symbol of the wave operator, non-existent under the $\beta$-plane approximation, each of them bearing a Chern number $-1$.</description>

      <title>Generative Data Assimilation of Sparse Weather Station Observations at Kilometer Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data assimilation of observational data into full atmospheric states is essential for weather forecast model initialization. Recently, methods for deep generative data assimilation have been proposed which allow for using new input data without retraining the model. They could also dramatically accelerate the costly data assimilation process used in operational regional weather models. Here, in a central US testbed, we demonstrate the viability of score-based data assimilation in the context of realistically complex km-scale weather. We train an unconditional diffusion model to generate snapshots of a state-of-the-art km-scale analysis product, the High Resolution Rapid Refresh. Then, using score-based data assimilation to incorporate sparse weather station data, the model produces maps of precipitation and surface winds. The generated fields display physically plausible structures, such as gust fronts, and sensitivity tests confirm learnt physics through multivariate relationships. Preliminary skill analysis shows the approach already outperforms a naive baseline of the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh system itself. By incorporating observations from 40 weather stations, 10% lower RMSEs on left-out stations are attained. Despite some lingering imperfections such as insufficiently disperse ensemble DA estimates, we find the results overall an encouraging proof of concept, and the first at km-scale. It is a ripe time to explore extensions that combine increasingly ambitious regional state generators with an increasing set of in situ, ground-based, and satellite remote sensing data streams.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>

Abstract: A universal theory of linear instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion, and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Impact of array interactions and control scheme on the wave sheltering performance of various wave energy converter archetypes for offshore wind turbines</title>

Abstract: Wave energy converter farms have the potential to reduce wave-induced fatigue loads on offshore wind turbines, reducing material, production, transportation, and wave energy converter farms have the potential to reduce wave-induced fatigue loads on offshore wind turbines, reducing material, production, transportation, and installation costs. Wave energy converters (WECs) dampen incoming waves, producing a sheltering effect for downstream bodies. This work compares the sheltering effect of three wave energy converter architectures (all rated for the same power production) and one floating breakwater. The near-field wave-body interactions and the far-field energy balance are modeled using linear potential flow theory in a boundary element method solver coupled with a spectral action balance model. Array interactions as well as the effect of different WEC control schemes on the wave field are also investigated. Finally, a relationship between wave height reduction and reduction in fatigue damage over the turbine lifetime is defined. Near-field interactions affected the far-field performance between 5% and 60% depending on configuration, control scheme, and architecture. The six-body arrays of oscillating surge, point absorber, and breakwater architectures performed similarly, providing up to 5.70% wave height reduction after 0.5 nautical miles. Finally, small reductions in wave height (2%) were observed to have large reductions in monopile fatigue damage due to wave loading over the turbine lifetime (10%)..</description>
