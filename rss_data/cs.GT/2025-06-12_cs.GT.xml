      <title>Improved Approximate EFX Guarantees for Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, a new line of work in fair allocation has focused on EFX allocations for \((p, q)\)-bounded valuations, where each good is relevant to at most \(p\) agents, and any pair of agents share at most \(q\) relevant goods. For the case \(p = 2\) and \(q = \infty\), such instances can be equivalently represented as multigraphs whose vertices are the agents and whose edges represent goods, each edge incident to exactly the one or two agents for whom the good is relevant. A recent result of \citet{amanatidis2024pushing} shows that for additive $(2,\infty)$ bounded valuations, a \((\nicefrac{2}{3})\)-EFX allocation always exists. In this paper, we improve this bound by proving the existence of a \((\nicefrac{1}{\sqrt{2}})\)-\(\efx\) allocation for additive \((2,\infty)\)-bounded valuations.</description>

      <title>Competition Complexity in Multi-Item Auctions: Beyond VCG and Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We quantify the value of the monopoly's bargaining power in terms of competition complexity--that is, the number of additional bidders the monopoly must attract in simple auctions to match the expected revenue of the optimal mechanisms (c.f., Bulow and Klemperer, 1996, Eden et al., 2017)--within the setting of multi-item auctions. We show that for simple auctions that sell items separately, the competition complexity is $\Theta(\frac{n}{\alpha})$ in an environment with $n$ original bidders under the slightly stronger assumption of $\alpha$-strong regularity, in contrast to the standard regularity assumption in the literature, which requires $\Omega(n \cdot \ln \frac{m}{n})$ additional bidders (Feldman et al., 2018). This significantly reduces the value of learning the distribution to design the optimal mechanisms, especially in large markets with many items for sale. For simple auctions that sell items as a grand bundle, we establish a constant competition complexity bound in a single-bidder environment when the number of items is small or when the value distribution has a monotone hazard rate. Some of our competition complexity results also hold when we compete against the first best benchmark (i.e., optimal social welfare).</description>

      <title>Beyond Nash Equilibrium: Bounded Rationality of LLMs and humans in Strategic Decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used in strategic decision-making settings, yet evidence shows that, like humans, they often deviate from full rationality. In this study, we compare LLMs and humans using experimental paradigms directly adapted from behavioral game-theory research. We focus on two well-studied strategic games, Rock-Paper-Scissors and the Prisoner's Dilemma, which are well known for revealing systematic departures from rational play in human subjects. By placing LLMs in identical experimental conditions, we evaluate whether their behaviors exhibit the bounded rationality characteristic of humans. Our findings show that LLMs reproduce familiar human heuristics, such as outcome-based strategy switching and increased cooperation when future interaction is possible, but they apply these rules more rigidly and demonstrate weaker sensitivity to the dynamic changes in the game environment. Model-level analyses reveal distinctive architectural signatures in strategic behavior, and even reasoning models sometimes struggle to find effective strategies in adaptive situations. These results indicate that current LLMs capture only a partial form of human-like bounded rationality and highlight the need for training methods that encourage flexible opponent modeling and stronger context awareness.</description>

      <title>Metritocracy: Representative Metrics for Lite Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common problem in LLM evaluation is how to choose a subset of metrics from a full suite of possible metrics. Subset selection is usually done for efficiency or interpretability reasons, and the goal is often to select a ``representative'' subset of metrics. However, ``representative'' is rarely clearly defined. In this work, we use ideas from social choice theory to formalize two notions of representation for the selection of a subset of evaluation metrics. We first introduce positional representation, which guarantees every alternative is sufficiently represented at every position cutoff. We then introduce positional proportionality, which guarantees no alternative is proportionally over- or under-represented by more than a small error at any position. We prove upper and lower bounds on the smallest number of metrics needed to guarantee either of these properties in the worst case. We also study a generalized form of each property that allows for additional input on groups of metrics that must be represented. Finally, we tie theory to practice through real-world case studies on both LLM evaluation and hospital quality evaluation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced V2X Communication Using Game-Theory Based Adaptive MAC Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication system featuring adaptive Medium Access Control (MAC) using game theory. Our approach integrates dynamic transmission power control, dynamic beacon rates, contention window adaptation, and implicit acknowledgment mechanisms within a Manhattan-like grid-based mobility scenario. Simulations are conducted in a circular coverage area, incorporating refined signal propagation models and probabilistic vehicle mobility with boundary reflection. The results demonstrate effective beacon delivery with average delays under 0.35 s and packet loss rates less than 1% in high-density conditions specifically, with up to 80 vehicles operating within a 250 m radius. Key innovations include game theory-based environment-aware transmission parameter adaptation and a scalable design suited for interference-prone V2X deployments.</description>

      <title>Average-Case Analysis of Iterative Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08144v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Iterative voting is a natural model of repeated strategic decision-making in social choice theory when agents have the opportunity to update their votes prior to finalizing the group decision. Prior work has analyzed the efficacy of iterative plurality on the welfare of the chosen outcome at equilibrium, relative to the truthful vote profile, via an adaptation of the price of anarchy. However, prior analyses have only studied the worst- and average-case performances when agents' preferences are distributed by the impartial culture. This work extends average-case analysis comprehensively across three alternatives and distinguishes under which of agents' preference distributions iterative plurality improves or degrades asymptotic welfare.</description>
