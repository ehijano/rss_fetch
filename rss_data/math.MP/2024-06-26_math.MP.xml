      <title>The Laplace Transform and Quantum Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Laplace transform that maps the topological recursion (TR) wavefunction to its $x$-$y$ swap dual is defined. This transform is then applied to the construction of quantum curves. General results are obtained, including a formula for the quantisation of many spectral curves of the form $e^xP_2(e^y) - P_1(e^y) = 0$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are coprime polynomials; an important class that contains interesting spectral curves related to mirror symmetry and knot theory that have, heretofore, evaded the general TR-based methods previously used to derive quantum curves. As an application, the quantum spectral curve for the Gromov-Witten theory of the complex projective line is derived directly from the theory of TR. The results seem to suggest a link between the topological recursion and the Gromov-Witten invariants of the weighted complex projective line $\mathbb{P}[r]$.</description>

      <title>A representation-theoretical approach to higher-dimensional Lie--Hamilton systems: The symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4, \mathbb{R})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new procedure for the construction of higher-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems is proposed. This method is based on techniques belonging to the representation theory of Lie algebras and their realization by vector fields. The notion of intrinsic Lie-Hamilton system is defined, and a sufficiency criterion for this property given. Novel four-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4, \mathbb{R})$ are obtained and proved to be intrinsic. Two distinguished subalgebras, the two-photon Lie algebra $\mathfrak{h}_{6}$ and the Lorentz Lie algebra $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$, are also considered in detail. As applications, coupled time-dependent systems which generalize the Bateman oscillator and the one-dimensional Caldirola-Kanai models are constructed, as well as systems depending on a time-dependent electromagnetic field and generalized coupled oscillators. A superposition rule for these systems, exhibiting interesting symmetry properties, is obtained using the coalgebra method.</description>

      <title>Affine subgroups of the affine Coxeter group with the same Coxeter number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine subgroups having the same Coxeter number with the affine Coxeter groups W(An), W(Dn), and W(En) are constructed by graph folding technique. The affine groups W(Cn) and W(Bn) are obtained from the Coxeter groups W(A2n-1) and W(D2n-1) respectively. The affine groups W(E6), W(D6) and W(E8) lead to the affine groups W(F4), W(H3), and W(H4) respectively by graph folding. The latter two are the non-crystallographic groups where W(H3) plays a special role in the quasicrystallographic structures with icosahedral symmetry. A general construction of the affine dihedral subgroups is introduced, some of which, describe the existing planar quasicrystallography. In the construction of the root systems, sets of orthonormal vectors are used but a special non-orthogonal set of vectors in the formulation of the root system of W(An) is also introduced which has practical applications in the construction of the lattices An and An* and their Delone and Voronoi cells.</description>

      <title>Inverse variational problem for equations in the Riccati chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonstandard Lagrangian representations of Ricatti and Riccati-type equations that exist in the literature cannot be obtained using Helmholtz solution of the inverse problem. In this work we consider Riccati and higher-order Riccati equations and construct their standard Lagrangian representation by using a simple variant of the Helmholtz theory. We make use of the self-adjoint form of the linear equations corresponding to odd-order equations in the Riccati chain to provide a symmetry-based approach for the solution of inverse problem. Explicit results presented for Lagrangians of the first and third-order Riccati equations show that one cannot Hamiltonize the Riccati family of equations by the traditional method used in classical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Null Lagrangians in Schwarzian mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to standard and non-standard Lagrangians of classical mechanics, we consider, in this work, null Lagrangians that (i) identically satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equation and at the same time can be expressed as (ii) the total derivative of some scalar function. As an addendum to the properties in (i) and (ii) we find that null Lagrangians are also characterized by (iii) vanishing energy functions or Jacobi integrals. By working with higher-order SL(2;R) invariant Schwarzian derivatives introduced recently by Krivonos we demonstrate that these Schwarzians, especially the even-order ones, provide a natural basis to introduce higher-order null Lagrangians in Schwarzian mechanics.</description>

      <title>On Explicit Solutions for Coupled Reaction-Diffusion and Burgers-Type Equations with Variable Coefficients Through a Riccati System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the study of explicit solutions for generalized coupled reaction-diffusion and Burgers-type systems with variable coefficients. Including nonlinear models with variable coefficients such as diffusive Lotka-Volterra model, the Gray-Scott model, the Burgers equations. The equations' integrability (via the explicit formulation of the solutions) is accomplished by using similarity transformations and requiring that the coefficients fulfill a Riccati system. We present traveling wave type solutions, as well as solutions with more complex dynamics and relevant features such as bending. A Mathematica file has been prepared as supplementary material, verifying the Riccati systems used in the construction of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Polyadic supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a polyadic analog of supersymmetry by considering the polyadization procedure (proposed by the author) applied to the toy model of one-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The supercharges are generalized to polyadic ones using the $n$-ary sigma matrices defined in earlier work. In this way, polyadic analogs of supercharges and Hamiltonians take the cyclic shift block matrix form, and they can describe multidegenerated quantum states in a way that is different from the $N$-extended and multigraded SQM. While constructing the corresponding supersymmetry as an $n$-ary Lie superalgebra ($n$ is the arity of the initial associative multiplication), we have found new brackets with a reduced arity of $2\leq m&lt;n$ and a related series of $m$-ary superalgebras (which is impossible for binary superalgebras). In the case of even reduced arity $m$ we obtain a tower of higher order (as differential operators) even Hamiltonians, while for $m$ odd we get a tower of higher order odd supercharges, and the corresponding algebra consists of the odd sector only.</description>

      <title>The Calder\'on problem on Riemannian surfaces and of minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove two results. The first shows that the Dirichlet-Neumann map of the operator $\Delta_g+q$ on a Riemannian surface can determine its topological, differential, and metric structure. Earlier work of this type assumes a priori that the surface is a planar domain [36] or that the geometry is a priori known [29]. We will then apply this result to study a geometric inverse problem for determining minimal surfaces embedded in $3$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. In particular we will show that knowledge of the volumes of embedded minimal surfaces determine not only their topological and differential structure but also their Riemannian structure as an embedded hypersurface. Such geometric inverse problems are partially inspired by the physical models proposed by the AdS/CFT correspondence.
  The crucial ingredient in removing the planar domain assumption is the determination of the boundary trace of holomorphic functions from knowledge of the Dirichlet-Neumann map of $\Delta_g +q$. This requires a new type of argument involving Carleman estimates and construction of CGO whose phase functions are not Morse as in the case of [29]. We anticipate that these techniques could be of use for studying other inverse problems in geometry and PDE.</description>

      <title>A No-Go Theorem of Analytical Mechanics for the Second Law Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We follow the Boltzmann-Clausius-Maxwell (BCM) proposal to solve a long-standing problem of identifying the underlying cause of the second law (SL) of spontaneous irreversibility, a stochastic universal principle, as the mechanical equilibrium (stable or unstable) principle (Mec-EQ-P) of analytical mechanics of an isolated nonequilibrium system of any size. The principle leads to nonnegative system intrinsic (SI) microwork and SI-average macrowork dW during any spontaneous process. In conjuction with the first law, Mec-EQ-P leads to a generalized second law (GSL) dQ=dW&gt;0, where dQ=TdS is the purely stochastic SI-macroheat that corresponds to dS&gt;0 for T&gt;0 and dS&lt;0 for T&lt;0, where T is the temperature. The GSL supercedes the conventional SL formulation that is valid only for a macroscopic system for positive temperatures temperatures, but reformulates it to dS&lt;0 for negative temperatures. It is quite surprising that GSL is not only a direct consequence of intertwined mechanical and stochastic macroquantities through the first law but also remains valid for any arbitrary irreversible process in a system of any size as an identity for positive and negative temperatures. It also becomes a no-go theorem for GSL-violation unless we abandon Mec-EQ-P of analytical mechanics used in the BCM proposal, which will be catastrophic for theoretical physics. In addition, Mec-EQ-P also provides new insights into the roles of spontaneity, nonspontaneity, negative temperatures, instability, and the significance of dS&lt;0 due to nonspontaneity and inserting internal constraints.</description>

      <title>Junction conditions in a general field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known in the modified gravity scene that the calculation of junction conditions in certain complicated theories leads to ambiguities and conflicts between the various formulations. This paper introduces a general framework to compute junction conditions in any reasonable classical field theory and analyzes their properties. We prove that in any variational field theory, it is possible to define unambiguous and mathematically well-defined junction conditions either by interpreting the Euler-Lagrange differential equation as a distribution or as the extremals of a variational functional and these two coincide. We provide an example calculation which highlights why ambiguities in the existing formalisms have arisen, essentially due to incorrect usage of distributions. Relations between junction conditions, the boundary value problem of variational principles and Gibbons--Hawking--York-like surface terms are examined. The methods presented herein relies on the use of coordinates adapted to represent the junction surface as a leaf in a foliation and a technique for reducing the order of Lagrangians to the lowest possible in the foliation parameter. We expect that the reduction theorem can generate independent interest from the rest of the topics considered in the paper.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable non-unitary time evolution in quantum critical systems I: Effect of complex spacetime metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this series of works, we study exactly solvable non-unitary time evolutions in one-dimensional quantum critical systems ranging from quantum quenches to time-dependent drivings. In this part I, we are motivated by the recent works of Kontsevich and Segal [1] and Witten [2] on allowable complex spacetime metrics in quantum field theories. In general, such complex spacetime metrics will lead to non-unitary time evolutions. In this work, we study the universal features of such non-unitary time evolutions based on exactly solvable setups. Various physical quantities including entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and energy density at an arbitrary time can be exactly solved. Due to the damping effect introduced by the complex time, the excitations in the initial state are gradually damped out in time. The non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits universal features that are qualitatively different from the case of real-time evolutions. For instance, for an infinite system after a global quench, the entanglement entropy of the semi-infinite subsystem will grow logarithmically in time, in contrast to the linear growth in a real-time evolution. Moreover, we study numerically the time-dependent driven quantum critical systems with allowable complex spacetime metrics. It is found that the competition between driving and damping leads to a steady state with an interesting entanglement structure.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to establish the most essential connections of the eigenvalue problems for the Laplace operator, Lam\'{e} operator, Stokes operator, buckling operator and clamped plate operator. We show that the $k$-th Stokes (respectively, Laplace) eigenvalue is the limit of the $k$-th Lam\'{e} eigenvalue for the Dirichlet or traction boundary condition as the Lam\'{e} coefficient $\lambda$ tends to $+\infty$ (respectively, to $-\mu$). Furthermore, we establish the eigenvalue inequalities and three-term asymptotic formulas of the heat traces for the Laplace operator, the Lam\'{e} operator, the Stokes operator and buckling operator with the Dirichlet and traction boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the Schwarzian Field Theory as a finite measure on $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ and compute its generalised partition functions exactly using methods of stochastic analysis. The Schwarzian Field Theory has attracted recent attention due to its role in the analysis of the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev model and as the proposed holographic dual to Jackiw--Teitelboim gravity. In two companion papers by Losev, the predicted exact cross-ratio correlation functions for non-crossing Wilson lines and the large deviations are derived from the probability measure.}</description>

Abstract: We prove a large deviations principle for the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory at low temperatures. We demonstrate that the good rate function is equal to the action of the Schwarzian Field Theory, and we find its minimisers. In addition, we define an analogue of the H\"{o}lder condition on the functional space $\mathrm{Diff}^1(\mathbb{T})/\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ in terms of cross-ratio observables, characterise them in terms of the usual H\"{o}lder property on the space of continuous functions, and deduce the corresponding compact embedding theorem. We also show that the Schwarzian measure concentrates on functions satisfying the defined condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study correlation functions of the probabilistic Schwarzian Field Theory. We compute cross-ratio correlation functions exactly in the case when the corresponding Wilson lines do not intersect, confirming predictions made in the physics literature via limit of the conformal bootstrap and the DOZZ formula. Moreover, we prove that these correlation functions characterise the measure uniquely. We use them to define and compute the stress-energy tensor correlation functions, and demonstrate, in particular, that these agree with the results obtained earlier by formal differentiation of the partition function.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear electromagnetic generalization of the Kerr-Newman solution with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the two exact solutions of the Einstein-Nonlinear electrodynamics equations that generalize the Kerr-Newman solution. We determined the generalized electromagnetic potentials using the alignment between the tetrad vectors of the metric and the eigenvectors of the electromagnetic field tensor. It turns out that there are only two possible nonlinear electromagnetic generalizations of the Kerr-Newman geometry, corresponding to different electromagnetic potentials. The new solutions possess horizons and satisfy physical energy conditions such that they can represent black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic charges, characterized by the parameters of mass, angular momentum, charge, and one nonlinear parameter; the nonlinear parameter resembles the effect of a cosmological constant, negative or positive, such that the solutions are asymptotically AdS or dS. The canonical form of the electromagnetic nonlinear energy-momentum tensor is analyzed in relation with the energy conditions; it is shown that the conformal symmetry is broken by the electromagnetic nonlinear matter; the corresponding nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian as a function of the coordinates is presented as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of the spectral properties of the linear operator $H(\varepsilon)=-(\varepsilon^{2}\chi_{\Omega_{\varepsilon}}+\chi_{\Omega^{c}_{\varepsilon}})\Delta$ modeling, through the wave equation $(\partial_{tt}+H(\varepsilon))u=0$, the dynamics of acoustic waves in the presence of a small inhomogeneity of size $\varepsilon$ having high contrast $\varepsilon^{-2}$. In particular, we give precise results on the localization of the resonances of $H(\varepsilon)$ and their first-order $\varepsilon$-expansions; the latter are explicitly expressed in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Newton potential operator of the set $\Omega$ whose rescaling of size $\varepsilon$ defines $\Omega_{\varepsilon}$.</description>

      <title>An information-geometric approach for network decomposition using the q-state Potts model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex networks are critical in many scientific, technological, and societal contexts due to their ability to represent and analyze intricate systems with interdependent components. Often, after labeling the nodes of a network with a community detection algorithm, its modular organization emerges, allowing a better understanding of the underlying structure by uncovering hidden relationships. In this paper, we introduce a novel information-geometric framework for the filtering and decomposition of networks whose nodes have been labeled. Our approach considers the labeled network as the outcome of a Markov random field modeled by a q-state Potts model. According to information geometry, the first and second order Fisher information matrices are related to the metric and curvature tensor of the parametric space of a statistical model. By computing an approximation to the local shape operator, the proposed methodology is able to identify low and high information nodes, allowing the decomposition of the labeled network in two complementary subgraphs. Hence, we call this method as the LO-HI decomposition. Experimental results with several kinds of networks show that the high information subgraph is often related to edges and boundaries, while the low information subgraph is a smoother version of the network, in the sense that the modular structure is improved.</description>

      <title>Iso-BAE Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed as the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The rest of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <title>Field-Dependent Metrics and Higher-Form Symmetries in Duality-Invariant Theories of Non-Linear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a $4d$ theory of non-linear electrodynamics has equations of motion which are equivalent to those of the Maxwell theory in curved spacetime, but with the usual metric $g_{\mu \nu}$ replaced by a unit-determinant metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ which is a function of the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}$, if and only if the theory enjoys electric-magnetic duality invariance. Among duality-invariant models, the Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory is special because the associated metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$ produces identical equations of motion when it is coupled to the Maxwell theory via two different prescriptions which we describe. We use the field-dependent metric perspective to analyze the electric and magnetic $1$-form global symmetries in models of self-dual electrodynamics. This analysis suggests that any duality-invariant theory possesses a set of conserved currents $j^\mu$ which are in one-to-one correspondence with $2$-forms that are harmonic with respect to the field-dependent metric $h_{\mu \nu} ( F )$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of recurrence and transience for graphs over non-Archimedean ordered field. To do so we relate these graphs to random walks of directed graphs over the reals. In particular, we give a characterization of the real directed graphs which can arise is such a way. As a main result, we give characterization for recurrence and transience in terms of a quantity related to the capacity.</description>

Abstract: In an attempt to understand the origin and robustness of the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon entropic functional, we adopt a geometric approach and discuss the implications of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and of Dvoretzky's theorem on convex bodies for the choice of this functional form. We contrast these results with a more recent result on flowers of balls, which may be interpreted as suggesting the use of power-law entropies for some systems.</description>

      <title>Markovianity and non-Markovianity of Particle Bath with Dirac Dispersion Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decay rate of quantum particles in open quantum systems has traditionally been known as exponential, based on empirical predictions from experiments and theoretical predictions from the Markovian dynamics of the corresponding quantum states. However, both theoretical predictions and experimental observations suggest deviations from this exponential decay, particularly in the short and long time regimes. In this study, we explore the spontaneous emission of a single Dirac particle within an environment characterized by an energy spectrum with a gap $m$ and an energy cutoff $L$. Our results reveal that high-energy structures, such as the spectral cutoff $L$, play a critical role in driving the short-time non-exponential decay. In contrast, the long-time decay is predominantly influenced by low-energy structures, such as the Dirac gap $m$. Surprisingly, we find that in the limits where the energy cutoff $L$ is infinite and the energy gap $m$ is zero, the decay dynamics of massless Dirac particles exhibit Markovian behavior without the need for conventional approximations like the Born-Markov approximation. This work underscores the complex interplay between particle energy properties and decay dynamics, providing new insights into quantum decay processes.</description>

      <title>A Matrix Product State Model for Simultaneous Classification and Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a rapidly expanding field that merges the principles of quantum computing with the techniques of machine learning. One of the powerful mathematical frameworks in this domain is tensor networks. These networks are used to approximate high-order tensors by contracting tensors with lower ranks. Originally developed for simulating quantum systems, tensor networks have become integral to quantum computing and, by extension, to QML. Their ability to efficiently represent and manipulate complex, high-dimensional data makes them suitable for various machine learning tasks within the quantum realm. Here, we present a matrix product state (MPS) model, where the MPS functions as both a classifier and a generator. The dual functionality of this novel MPS model permits a strategy that enhances the traditional training of supervised MPS models. This framework is inspired by generative adversarial networks and is geared towards generating more realistic samples by reducing outliers. Additionally, our contributions offer insights into the mechanics of tensor network methods for generation tasks. Specifically, we discuss alternative embedding functions and a new sampling method from non-normalized MPSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish discrete trace formulas on a regular graph to relate its spectrum and non-backtracking walks. Our approach is based on the Chebyshev-type polynomials and we refer to this treatment as Chebyshev moment method. A key fact is that Chebyshev-type polynomials form a complete orthogonal basis with respect to the Kesten-McKay distribution. Based on this method, we further apply Cauchy's integral formula for holomorphic functions to prove the pre-trace formula for all regular graphs and the trace formula for finite regular graphs. We further apply our results to study the resolvent, heat and Schr\"odinger equations, Ihara zeta functions, and combinatorial enumeration problems on regular graphs.</description>

Abstract: We argue that a general system of scalar fields and gauge fields manifesting vacuum degeneracy induces a principal groupoid bundle over spacetime and that the pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism are encoded by the singular foliation canonically induced on the moduli space of scalar vacuum expectation values by the Lie groupoid structure. Recent mathematical results in the classification of singular foliations then provide a qualitative classification of the possible patterns of vacuum degeneracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the discrete evolution problem and the corresponding solution as a discrete Dyson series in order to rigorously derive a generalized discrete version of the Magnus expansion. We also systematically derive the discrete analogue of the pre-Lie Magnus expansion and express the elements of the discrete Dyson series in terms of a tridendriform algebra action. In the generic discrete case extra significant terms that are absent in the continuous or the linear discrete case appear in both Dyson and Magnus expansions. Based on the rigorous discrete derivation key links between quantum algebras, tridendriform and pre-Lie algebras are then established. This is achieved by examining tensor realizations of quantum groups, such as the Yangian. We show that these realizations can be expressed in terms of tridendriform and pre-Lie algebras actions. The continuous limit as expected provides the corresponding non-local charges of the Yangian as members of the pre-Lie Magnus expansion.</description>

      <title>A $(q,t)$-deformation of the 2d Toda integrable hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(q,t)$-deformation of the 2d Toda integrable hierarchy is introduced by enhancing the underlying symmetry algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(\infty)\simeq \text{q-W}_{1+\infty}$ to the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra. The difference-differential equations of the hierarchy are obtained from the expansion of $(q,t)$-bilinear identities, and two equations refining the 2d Toda equation are found in this way. The derivation of the bilinear identities follows from the isomorphism between the Fock representation of level $(2,0)$ of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra and the tensor product of the q-deformed Virasoro algebra with a $u(1)$ Heisenberg algebra. It leads to identify the $(q,t)$-deformed Casimir with the screening charges of the deformed Virasoro algebra. Due to the non-trivial coproduct, equations of the hierarchy no longer involve a single tau-function, but instead relate a set of different tau functions. We then define the universal refined tau function using the $L$-matrix of the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ algebra and interpret it as the generating function of the deformed tau functions. The equations of the hierarchy, written in terms of the universal refined tau function, combine into two-term quadratic equations similar to the $RLL$ equations.</description>

      <title>Breaking Consensus in Kinetic Opinion Formation Models on Graphons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose and investigate a strategy to prevent consensus in kinetic models for opinion formation. We consider a large interacting agent system, and assume that agent interactions are driven by compromise as well as self-thinking dynamics and also modulated by an underlying static social network. This network structure is included using so-called graphons, which modulate the interaction frequency in the corresponding kinetic formulation. We then derive the corresponding limiting Fokker Planck equation, and analyze its large time behavior. This microscopic setting serves as a starting point for the proposed control strategy, which steers agents away from mean opinion and is characterised by a suitable penalization depending on the properties of the graphon. We show that this minimalist approach is very effective by analyzing the quasi-stationary solutions mean-field model in a plurality of graphon structures. Several numerical experiments are also provided to show the effectiveness of the approach in preventing the formation of consensus steering the system towards a declustered state.</description>

      <title>Equality of critical parameters for percolation of Gaussian free field level-sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.07735v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider upper level-sets of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb Z^d$, for $d\geq 3$, above a given real-valued height parameter $h$. As $h$ varies, this defines a canonical percolation model with strong, algebraically decaying correlations. We prove that three natural critical parameters associated to this model, respectively describing a well-ordered subcritical phase, the emergence of an infinite cluster, and the onset of a local uniqueness regime in the supercritical phase, actually coincide. At the core of our proof lies a new interpolation scheme aimed at integrating out the long-range dependence of the Gaussian free field. Due to the strength of correlations, its successful implementation requires that we work in an effectively critical regime. Our analysis relies extensively on certain novel renormalization techniques that bring into play all relevant scales simultaneously. The approach in this article paves the way to a complete understanding of the off-critical phases for strongly correlated disordered systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.02151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the disordered monomer-dimer model on general finite graphs with bounded degrees. Under the finite fourth moment assumption on the weight distributions, we prove a Gaussian central limit theorem for the free energy of the associated Gibbs measure with a rate of convergence. The central limit theorem continues to hold under a nearly optimal finite $(2+\epsilon)$-moment assumption on the weight distributions if the underlying graphs are further assumed to have a uniformly subexponential volume growth. This generalizes a recent result by Dey and Krishnan (arXiv:2109.12716) who showed a Gaussian central limit theorem in the disordered monomer-dimer model on cylinder graphs. Our proof relies on the idea that the disordered monomer-dimer model exhibits a decay of correlation with high probability. We also establish a central limit theorem for the Gibbs average of the number of dimers where the underlying graph has subexponential volume growth and the edge weights are Gaussians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct optimal Hardy weights to subcritical energy functionals $h$ associated with quasilinear Schr\"odinger operators on locally finite graphs. Here, optimality means that the weight $w$ is the largest possible with respect to a partial ordering, and that the corresponding shifted energy functional $h-w$ is null-critical. Moreover, we show a decay condition of Hardy weights in terms of their integrability with respect to certain integral weights. As an application of the decay condition, we show that null-criticality implies optimality near infinity. We also briefly discuss an uncertainty-type principle and a Rellich-type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of multistate Landau-Zener model which cannot be solved by integrability conditions or other standard techniques. By analyzing analytical constraints on its scattering matrix and performing fitting to results from numerical simulations of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we find nearly exact analytical expressions of all its transition probabilities for specific parameter choices. We also determine the transition probabilities up to leading orders of series expansions in terms of the inverse sweep rate (namely, in the diabatic limit) for general parameter choices. We further show that this model can describe a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with couplings changing linearly in time. Our work presents a new route, i.e., analytical constraint plus fitting, to analyze those multistate Landau-Zener models which are beyond the applicability of conventional solving methods.</description>

      <title>Spectral Distribution of Twisted Laplacian on Typical Hyperbolic Surfaces of High Genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral distribution of the twisted Laplacian associated with uniform square-integrable bounded harmonic 1-form on typical hyperbolic surfaces of high genus. First, we estimate the spectral distribution by the supremum norm of the corresponding harmonic form. Subsequently, we show that the square-integrable bounded harmonic form exhibits a small supremum norm for typical hyperbolic surfaces of high genus. Based on these findings, we prove a uniform Weyl law for the distribution of real parts of the spectrum on typical hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Stability of solutions of stationary Boussinesq systems on weak-Morrey spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the asymptotic stability of steady solutions for the Boussinesq systems in the framework of Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces on $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n \geqslant 3$. In our strategy, we first establish the continuity for the long time of the bilinear terms associated with the mild solutions of the Boussinesq systems, i.e., the bilinear estimates by using only the norm of the present spaces. As a direct consequence, we obtain the existence of global small mild solutions and asymptotic stability of steady solutions of the Boussinesq systems in the class of continuous functions from $[0, \infty)$ to the Cartesian product of critical weak-Morrey spaces. Our techniques consist interpolation of operators, duality, heat semigroup estimates , Holder and Young inequalities in block spaces (based on Lorentz spaces) that are preduals of Morrey-Lorentz spaces.</description>

      <title>Talbot Effect for the Manakov System on the Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the Talbot effect for the multi-component linear and nonlinear systems of the dispersive evolution equations on a bounded interval subject to periodic boundary conditions and discontinuous initial profiles is investigated. Firstly, for a class of two-component linear systems satisfying the dispersive quantization conditions, we discuss the fractal solutions at irrational times. Next, the investigation to nonlinear regime is extended, we prove that, for the concrete example of the Manakov system, the solutions of the corresponding periodic initial-boundary value problem subject to initial data of bounded variation are continuous but nowhere differentiable fractal-like curve with Minkowski dimension 3/2 at irrational times. Finally, numerical experiments for the periodic initial-boundary value problem of the Manakov system, are used to justify how such effects persist into the multi-component nonlinear regime. Furthermore, it is shown in the nonlinear multi-component regime that the interplay of different components may induce subtle different qualitative profile between the jump discontinuities, especially in the case that two nonlinearly coupled components start with different initial profile.</description>

      <title>Absence of shift-invariant Gibbs states (delocalisation) for one-dimensional $\mathbb Z$-valued fields with Long-Range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a modification of the proof of our paper [CvELNR18], in the spirit of [FP81], shows delocalisation in the long-range Discrete Gaussian Chain, and generalisations thereof, for any decay power $\alpha&gt;2$ and at all temperatures. The argument proceeds by contradiction: any shift-invariant and localised measure (in the $L^1$ sense), is a convex combination of ergodic localised measures. But the latter cannot exist: on one hand, by the ergodic theorem, the average of the field over growing boxes would be almost surely bounded ; on the other hand the measure would be absolutely continuous with respect to its height-shifted translates, as a simple relative entropy computation shows. This leads to a contradiction and answers, in a non-quantitative way, an open question stated in a recent paper [G23] of C.Garban.</description>

      <title>Phase transition of a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line</title>

Abstract: Quantum walks are referred to as quantum analogs to random walks in mathematics. They have been studied as quantum algorithms in quantum information for quantum computers. There are two types of quantum walks. One is the discrete-time quantum walk and the other is the continuous-time quantum walk. We study a continuous-time quantum walk on the half line and challenge to find a limit theorem for it in this paper. As a result, approximate behavior of the quantum walker is revealed after the system of quantum walk gets updated in long time.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Memory into Propagation of 1-Electron Reduced Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any linear system where the unreduced dynamics are governed by unitary propagators, we derive a closed, time-delayed, linear system for a reduced-dimensional quantity of interest. We apply this method to understand the memory-dependence of $1$-electron reduced density matrices in time-dependent configuration interaction (TDCI), a scheme to solve for the correlated dynamics of electrons in molecules. Though time-dependent density functional theory has established that the $1$-electron reduced density possesses memory-dependence, the precise nature of this memory-dependence has not been understood. We derive a self-contained, symmetry/constraint-preserving method to propagate reduced TDCI electron density matrices. Our method preserves properties of density matrices such as Hermitian symmetry and constant trace. In numerical tests on two model systems ($\text{H}_2$ and $\text{HeH}^+$), we show that with sufficiently large time-delay (or memory-dependence), our method propagates reduced TDCI density matrices with high quantitative accuracy. We study the dependence of our results on time step and basis set. To implement our method, we derive the $4$-index tensor that relates reduced and full TDCI density matrices. Our derivation applies to any TDCI system, regardless of basis set, number of electrons, or choice of Slater determinants in the wave function. This derivation enables a proof that the trace of the reduced TDCI density matrix is constant and equals the number of electrons.</description>

      <title>A solvable non-unitary fermionic long-range model with extended symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a long-range version of the XX model, arising as the free-fermion point of the XXZ-type Haldane--Shastry (HS) chain. It has a description via non-unitary fermions, based on the free-fermion Temperley--Lieb algebra, and may also be viewed as an alternating $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ spin chain. Even and odd length behave very differently; we focus on odd length. The model is integrable, and we explicitly identify two commuting hamiltonians. While non-unitary, their spectrum is real by PT-symmetry. One hamiltonian is chiral and quadratic in fermions, while the other is parity-invariant and quartic. Their one-particle spectra have two linear branches, realising a massless relativistic dispersion on the lattice. The appropriate fermionic modes arise from 'quasi-translation' symmetry, which replaces ordinary translation symmetry. The model exhibits exclusion statistics, like the isotropic HS chain, with even more 'extended symmetry' and larger degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron Instantons on Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a homomorphism $\tau$ from a suitable finite group $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SU}(4)$ with image $\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$, we construct a cohomological gauge theory on a noncommutative resolution of the quotient singularity $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau$ whose BRST fixed points are $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-invariant tetrahedron instantons on a generally non-effective orbifold. The partition function computes the expectation values of complex codimension one defect operators in rank $r$ cohomological Donaldson-Thomas theory on a flat gerbe over the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}^\tau]$. We describe the generalized ADHM parametrization of the tetrahedron instanton moduli space, and evaluate the orbifold partition functions through virtual torus localization. If $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is an abelian group the partition function is expressed as a combinatorial series over arrays of $\mathsf{\Gamma}$-coloured plane partitions, while if $\mathsf{\Gamma}$ is non-abelian the partition function localizes onto a sum over torus-invariant connected components of the moduli space labelled by lower-dimensional partitions. When $\mathsf{\Gamma}=\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a finite abelian subgroup of $\mathsf{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, we exhibit the reduction of Donaldson-Thomas theory on the toric Calabi-Yau four-orbifold $\mathbb{C}^2/\,\mathsf{\Gamma}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ to the cohomological field theory of tetrahedron instantons, from which we express the partition function as a closed infinite product formula. We also use the crepant resolution correpondence to derive a closed formula for the partition function on any polyhedral singularity.</description>

      <title>Communication Complexity of Graph Isomorphism, Coloring, and Distance Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information, nonlocal games are particularly useful for differentiating classical, quantum, and non-signalling correlations. An example of differentiation is given by the principle of no-collapse of communication complexity, which is often interpreted as necessary for a feasible physical theory. It is satisfied by quantum correlations but violated by some non-signalling ones.
  In this work, we investigate this principle in the context of three nonlocal games related to graph theory, starting from the well-known graph isomorphism and graph coloring games, and introducing a new game, the vertex distance game, with a parameter $D\in\mathbb N$, that generalizes the former two to some extent. For these three games, we prove that perfect non-signalling strategies collapse communication complexity under favorable conditions. We also define a refinement of fractional isomorphism of graphs, namely D-fractional isomorphisms, and we show that this characterizes perfect non-signalling strategies for the vertex distance game. Surprisingly, we observe that non-signalling strategies provide a finer distinction for the new game compared to classical and quantum strategies since the parameter D is visible only in the non-signalling setting.</description>
