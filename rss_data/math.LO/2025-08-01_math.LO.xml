      <title>Convolution semigroups for automorphism dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initially motivated by Hrushovski's paper on definability patterns, we obtain homeomorphisms between Ellis semigroups related to natural actions of the automorphism groups of first order structures and certain collections of types and Keisler measures. Thus, we can transfer the semigroup operation from these Ellis semigroups to the corresponding collections of types and Keisler measures. By generalizing this transferred product, we obtain a new convolution operation for invariant types and measures in arbitrary first-order theories. We develop its general theory and prove several correspondence theorems between idempotent measures and closed subgroups of the automorphism group of a sufficiently large (so-called monster) model with respect to the relatively definable topology. Via the affine sort construction, we demonstrate that this new notion of convolution encodes the standard definable convolution operation over definable groups.</description>

      <title>Relational Algebraic Approach to the Real Numbers: The Least-Upper-Bound Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the investigation of a real number object, i.e., an object representing the real numbers, in categories of relations. Our axiomatization is based on a relation algebraic version of Tarski's axioms of the real numbers. It was already shown that the addition of such an object forms a dense, linear ordered abelian group. In the current paper we will focus on the least-upper-bound property of such an object.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Public Announcement Logic: Base-extension Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proof-theoretic semantics, and base-extension semantics in particular, can be seen as a logical realization of inferentialism, in which the meaning of expressions is understood through their use. We present a base-extension semantics for public announcement logic, building on earlier work giving a base-extension semantics for the modal logic $S5$, which in turn builds on earlier such work for $K$, $KT$, $K4$, and $S4$. These analyses rely on a notion of `modal relation' on bases. The main difficulty in extending the existing B-eS for $S5$ to public announcement logic is to account announcements of the form $[\psi]\phi$, which, in this setting, update the modal relations on bases. We provide a detailed analysis of two classical examples, namely the three-player card game and the muddy children puzzle. These examples illustrate how the inferentialist perspective requires fully explicit information about the state of the participating agents.</description>

      <title>The Mostowski Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23998v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1950, Novak and Mostowski showed that GB (G\"odel-Bernays theory of classes) is conservative over ZF, and therefore by G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem the consistency of ZF is unprovable in GB. In the same year Mostowski unveiled a contrasting result: GB provides a truth-definition for ZF-formulae. Here we first give an expository account of Mostowski's construction and surrounding results, and then we show that the construction bridges the domain of Tarski-style truth theories over PA with certain subsystems of second order arithmetic.</description>
