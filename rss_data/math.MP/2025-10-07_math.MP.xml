      <title>A Direct Approach for Detection of Bottom Topography in Shallow Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fast, stable, and direct analytic method to detect underwater channel topography from surface wave measurements, based on one-dimensional shallow water equations. The technique requires knowledge of the free surface and its first two time derivatives at a single instant $t^{\star}$ above the fixed, bounded open segment of the domain. We first restructure the forward shallow water equations to obtain an inverse model in which the bottom profile is the only unknown, and then discretize this model using a second-order finite-difference scheme to infer the floor topography. We demonstrate that the approach satisfies a Lipschitz stability and is independent of the initial conditions of the forward problem. The well-posedness of this inverse model requires that, at the chosen measurement time $t^{\star}$, the discharge be strictly positive across the fixed portion of the open channel, which is automatically satisfied for steady and supercritical flows. For unsteady subcritical and transcritical flows, we derive two empirically validated sufficient conditions ensuring strict positivity after a sufficiently large time. The proposed methodology is tested on a range of scenarios, including classical benchmarks and different types of inlet discharges and bathymetries. We find that this analytic approach yields high approximation accuracy and that the bed profile reconstruction is stable under noise. In addition, the sufficient conditions are met across all tests.</description>

      <title>Ballistic electron transport described by a generalized Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Schr\"odinger equation of arbitrary order for modeling charge transport in semiconductors operating in the ballistic regime. This formulation incorporates non-parabolic effects through the Kane dispersion relation, thereby extending beyond the conventional effective mass approximation. Building upon the framework introduced in G. E. Aliffi, G. Nastasi, V. Romano, {ZAMP} {76}, 155 (2025), we derive a hierarchy of models, each governed by a Schr\"odinger equation of increasing order. As in the standard second-order case, the problem is formulated on a finite spatial domain with suitable transparent boundary conditions. These conditions are designed to simulate charge transport in a quantum coupler where an active region -- representing the electron device -- is connected to leads acting as reservoirs. We investigate several analytical properties of the proposed models and derive a generalized expression for the current, valid for any order. This formula includes additional terms that account for interference effects arising from the richer wave structure inherent in higher-order Schr\"odinger equations, which are absent in the effective mass approximation. Numerical simulations of a resonant tunneling diode (RTD) illustrate the key features of the solutions and highlight the impact of the generalized formulation on device behavior.</description>

      <title>Dimension dependence of critical phenomena in long-range percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical mechanical systems at and near their points of phase transition are expected to exhibit rich, fractal-like behaviour that is independent of the small-scale details of the system but depends strongly on the dimension in which the model is defined. Moreover, many models are conjectured to have an upper critical dimension with important quantitative and qualitative differences between critical behaviour at, above, and below the upper critical dimension. For models with long-range interactions, one expects additional transitions between effectively long-range and effectively short-range regimes, with further marginal effects on the boundary of these two regimes, leading to (at least) eight qualitatively distinct forms of critical behaviour in total for each given model. We give a broad overview of these conjectures aimed at a general mathematical audience before surveying the significant recent progress that has been made towards understanding them in the context of long-range percolation.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetries in the theory of W-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a basic Lie superalgebra and $f$ be an odd nilpotent element in an $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ subalgebra of $\mathfrak{g}$. We provide a mathematical proof of the statement that the W-algebra $W^k(\mathfrak{g},F)$ for $F=-\frac{1}{2}[f,f]$ is a vertex subalgebra of the SUSY W-algebra $W_{N=1}^k(\mathfrak{g},f)$, and that it commutes with all weight $\frac{1}{2}$ fields in $W_{N=1}^k(\mathfrak{g},f)$. Note that it has been long believed by physicists \cite{MadRag94}. In particular, when $f$ is a minimal nilpotent, we explicitly describe superfields which generate $W^k_{N=1}(\mathfrak{g},f)$ as a SUSY vertex algebra and their OPE relations in terms of the $N=1$ $\Lambda$-bracket introduced in \cite{HK07}. In the last part of this paper, we define $N=2,3$, and small or big $N=4$ SUSY vertex operator algebras as conformal extensions of $W^k_{N=1}(\mathfrak{sl}(2|1),f_{\text{min}})$, $W^k_{N=1}(\mathfrak{osp}(3|2),f_{\text{min}})$, $W^k_{N=1}(\mathfrak{psl}(2|2),f_{\text{min}})$, and $W^k_{N=1}(D(2,1;\alpha)\oplus \mathbb{C},f_{\text{min}})$, respectively, for the minimal odd nilpotent $f_{\text{min}}$, and examine some examples.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomials of tensors via Grassmann integrals and distributions of roots for random Gaussian tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new definition of characteristic polynomials of tensors based on a partition function of Grassmann variables. This new notion of characteristic polynomial addresses general tensors including totally antisymmetric ones, but not totally symmetric ones. Drawing an analogy with matrix eigenvalues obtained from the roots of their characteristic polynomials, we study the roots of our tensor characteristic polynomial. Unlike standard definitions of eigenvalues of tensors of dimension $N$ giving $\sim e^{{\text{constant}} \, N}$ number of eigenvalues, our polynomial always has $N$ roots. For random Gaussian tensors, the density of roots follows a generalized Wigner semi-circle law based on the Fuss-Catalan distribution, introduced previously by Gurau [arXiv:2004.02660 [math-ph]].</description>

      <title>Polynomial Prethermal Lifetimes in Non Smoothly Driven Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum many-body lattice system with a local Hamiltonian subjected to a quasi-periodic driving with finite regularity. For sufficiently large driving frequencies, we prove that the system remains in a prethermal state for times growing polynomially with the frequency, and we show the optimality of this bound by constructing an explicit example that nearly saturates it. Within this prethermal regime, the dynamics is captured by an effective time-independent local Hamiltonian close to the undriven one. The proof relies on a non convergent normal form scheme, combined with original smoothing techniques for finitely differentiable local operators, and Lieb-Robinson bounds.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomials of non-Hermitian random band matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic local behavior of the second correlation functions of the characteristic polynomials of a certain class of Gaussian $N\times N$ non-Hermitian random band matrices with a bandwidth $W$. Given $W,N\to\infty$, we show that this behavior near the point in the bulk of the spectrum exhibits the crossover at $W\sim \sqrt{N}$: it coincides with those for Ginibre ensemble for $W\gg \sqrt{N}$, and factorized as $1\ll W\ll \sqrt{N}$. The result is the first step toward the proof of Anderson's type transition for non-Hermitian random band matrices.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical tunneling for some 1D Schr\"odinger operators with complex-valued potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the non-selfadjoint, semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator $\mathscr{L}(h) := -h^2\partial_x^2+e^{i\alpha}V$, where $\alpha \in (-\pi,\pi)$ and $V: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}_+$ is even and vanishes at exactly two (symmetric) non-degenerate minima. We establish a semiclassical tunneling result: the spectrum of $\mathscr{L}(h)$ near the origin is given by a sequence of algebraically simple eigenvalues which come in exponentially close pairs (within a $\mathscr{O}(e^{-S/h})$ distance where $S &gt; 0$ is explicit), each pair being separated from the others by a distance $\mathscr{O}(h)$. A one-term estimate of the gap between the two smallest eigenvalues in magnitude is derived; it reveals that, when $\alpha \neq 0$, they quickly rotate around each other as $h$ goes to $0$.</description>

      <title>The smallest eigenvalue of $\beta$-Laguerre and $\beta$-Jacobi ensembles and multivariate orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the smallest eigenvalue statistics of the $\beta$-Laguerre and $\beta$-Jacobi ensembles. Using Kaneko's integral formula, we show that the smallest eigenvalue marginal density and distribution functions of the two ensembles for any $\beta&gt;0$ can be represented in terms of multivariate Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials evaluated at a multiple of the identity, provided that the exponent of $x$ in the Laguerre and Jacobi weights is an integer. These representations are readily computable in explicit form using existing symbolic algorithms for multivariate orthogonal polynomials.
  From these expressions, we derive new differentiation formulas for the multivariate Laguerre and Jacobi polynomials. Furthermore, we derive explicit solutions to the Painleve V and VI differential equations associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the LUE and JUE. We provide numerical experiments and examples.</description>

      <title>Three-point functions in critical loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two-dimensional models of critical non-intersecting loops, there are $\ell$-leg fields that insert $\ell\in\mathbb{N}^*$ open loop segments and can have nonzero conformal spins, and diagonal fields that change the weights of closed loops. We conjecture an exact formula for 3-point functions of such fields on the sphere. In the cases of diagonal or spinless 2-leg fields, the conjecture agrees with known results from Conformal Loop Ensembles.
  We numerically compute 3-point functions in loop models on cylindrical lattices, using transfer matrix techniques. The results agree with the conjecture in almost all cases. We attribute the few discrepancies to difficulties that can arise in our lattice computation when the relevant modules of the unoriented Jones-Temperley-Lieb algebra have degenerate ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04702v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the previous study (Ishida, 2025), the author proved the uniqueness of short-range potential functions using the Enss-Weder time-dependent method (Enss and Weder, 1995) for a two-body quantum system described by time-decaying harmonic oscillators. In this study, we extend the result of Ishida (2025) to the $N$-body case. We use the approaches developed in Enss and Weder (1995), Weder (1996), and Valencia and Weder (2012) to prove that the high-velocity limit of the scattering operator uniquely determines all the pairwise interaction potentials among the $N$ particles, focusing respectively on each fixed pair of particles.</description>

      <title>Validity condition of normal form transformation for the $\beta$-FPUT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a validity condition for the normal form transformation to remove the non-resonant cubic terms in the $\beta$-FPUT system. We show that for a wave field with random phases, the normal form transformation is valid by dominant probability if $\beta \ll 1/N^{1+\epsilon}$, with $N$ the number of masses and $\epsilon$ an arbitrarily small constant. To obtain this condition, a bound is needed for a summation in the transformation equation, which we prove rigorously in the paper. The condition also suggests that the importance of the non-resonant terms in the evolution equation is governed by the parameter $\beta N$. We design numerical experiments to demonstrate that this is indeed the case for spectra at both thermal-equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium conditions. The methodology developed in this paper is applicable to other Hamiltonian systems where a normal form transformation needs to be applied.</description>

      <title>Space-time reversible graph rewriting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the mathematical tradition, reversibility requires that the evolution of a dynamical system be a bijective function. In the context of graph rewriting, however, the evolution is not even a function, because it is not even deterministic -- as the rewrite rules get applied at non-deterministically chosen locations. Physics, by contrast, suggests a more flexible understanding of reversibility in space-time, whereby any two closeby snapshots (aka `space-like cuts'), must mutually determine each other. We build upon the recently developed framework of space-time deterministic graph rewriting, in order to formalise this notion of space-time reversibility, and henceforth study reversible graph rewriting. We establish sufficient, local conditions on the rewrite rules so that they be space-time reversible. We provide an example featuring time dilation, in the spirit of general relativity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\mathcal{A},\mathrm{tr})$ be a von Neumann algebra with a faithful, normal trace $\mathrm{tr}:\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{C}.$ For each $a\in\mathcal{A},$ define \[ S(\lambda,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{tr}[\log((a-\lambda)^{\ast}(a-\lambda )+\varepsilon)],\quad\lambda\in\mathbb{C},~\varepsilon&gt;0, \] so that the limit as $\varepsilon\rightarrow0^{+}$ of $S$ is the log potential of the Brown measure of $a.$ Suppose that for a fixed $\lambda\in\mathbb{C},$ the function% \[ \varepsilon\mapsto\frac{\partial S}{\partial\varepsilon}(\lambda ,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{tr}[\log((a-\lambda)^{\ast}(a-\lambda)+\varepsilon )^{-1}] \] admits a real analytic extension to a neighborhood of $0$ in $\mathbb{R}.$ Then we will show that $\lambda$ is outside the spectrum of $a.$
  We will apply this result to several examples involving circular and elliptic elements, as well as free multiplicative Brownian motions. In most cases, we will show that the spectrum of the relevant element $a$ coincides with the support of its Brown measure.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms for Quantum Advantage in Global Optimization of Nonconvex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new theoretical mechanisms for quantum speedup in the global optimization of nonconvex functions, expanding the scope of quantum advantage beyond traditional tunneling-based explanations. As our main building-block, we demonstrate a rigorous correspondence between the spectral properties of Schr\"{o}dinger operators and the mixing times of classical Langevin diffusion. This correspondence motivates a mechanism for separation on functions with unique global minimum: while quantum algorithms operate on the original potential, classical diffusions correspond to a Schr\"{o}dinger operators with a WKB potential having nearly degenerate global minima. We formalize these ideas by proving that a real-space adiabatic quantum algorithm (RsAA) achieves provably polynomial-time optimization for broad families of nonconvex functions. First, for block-separable functions, we show that RsAA maintains polynomial runtime while known off-the-shelf algorithms require exponential time and structure-aware algorithms exhibit arbitrarily large polynomial runtimes. These results leverage novel non-asymptotic results in semiclassical analysis. Second, we use recent advances in the theory of intrinsic hypercontractivity to demonstrate polynomial runtimes for RsAA on appropriately perturbed strongly convex functions that lack global structure, while off-the-shelf algorithms remain exponentially bottlenecked. In contrast to prior works based on quantum tunneling, these separations do not depend on the geometry of barriers between local minima. Our theoretical claims about classical algorithm runtimes are supported by rigorous analysis and comprehensive numerical benchmarking. These findings establish a rigorous theoretical foundation for quantum advantage in continuous optimization and open new research directions connecting quantum algorithms, stochastic processes, and semiclassical analysis.</description>

      <title>Bloch Oscillations and Landau-Zener Transitions in Flat-Band Lattices with Quadratic and Linear Band Touchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bloch oscillations (BOs) describe the coherent oscillatory motion of electrons in a periodic lattice under a constant external electric field. Deviations from pure harmonic wave packet motion or irregular Bloch oscillations can occur due to Zener tunneling (Landau-Zener Transitions or LZTs), with oscillation frequencies closely tied to interband coupling strengths. Motivated by the interplay between flat-band physics and interband coupling in generating irregular BOs, here we investigate these oscillations in Lieb and Kagome lattices using two complementary approaches: coherent transport simulations and scattering matrix analysis. In the presence of unavoidable band touchings, half-fundamental and fundamental BO frequencies are observed in Lieb and Kagome lattices, respectively -- a behavior directly linked to their distinct band structures. When avoided band touchings are introduced, distinct BO frequency responses to coupling parameters in each lattice are observed. Scattering matrix analysis reveals strong coupling and potential LZTs between dispersive bands and the flat band in Kagome lattices, with the quadratic band touching enhancing interband interactions and resulting in BO dynamics that is distinct from systems with linear crossings. In contrast, the Lieb lattice -- a three level system -- shows independent coupling between the flat band and two dispersive bands, without direct LZTs occurring between the two dispersive bands themselves. Finally, to obtain a unifying perspective on these results, we examine BOs during a strain-induced transition from Kagome to Lieb lattices, and link the evolution of irregular BO frequencies to changes in band connectivity and interband coupling.</description>

      <title>Forward and backward problems for abstract time-fractional Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate forward and backward problems associated with abstract time-fractional Schr\"odinger equations $\mathrm{i}^\nu \partial_t^\alpha u(t) + A u(t)=0$, $\alpha \in (0,1)\cup (1,2)$ and $\nu\in\{1,\alpha\}$, where $A$ is a self-adjoint operator with compact resolvent on a Hilbert space $H$. This kind of equation, which incorporates the Caputo time-fractional derivative of order $\alpha$, models quantum systems with memory effects and anomalous wave propagation. We first establish the well-posedness of the forward problems in two scenarios: ($\nu=1,\,$ $\alpha \in (0,1)$) and ($\nu=\alpha,\,$ $\alpha \in (0,1)\cup (1,2)$). Then, we prove well-posedness and stability results for the backward problems depending on the two cases $\nu=1$ and $\nu=\alpha$. Our approach employs the solution's eigenvector expansion along with the properties of the Mittag-Leffler functions, including the distribution of zeros and asymptotic expansions. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of some open problems.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find an intriguing relation between the chiral algebra and the mixed Hodge structure of the Coulomb branch of four dimensional $\mathcal{N} = 2$ superconformal field theories. We identify the space of irreducible characters of the $\mathcal{N} = 4$ $SU(N)$ chiral algebra $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ by analytically computing the Wilson line Schur index, and imposing modular invariance. We further establish a map from the $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$ characters to the characters of the $\mathcal{T}_{p, N}$ chiral algebra. We extract the pure part of the mixed Hodge polynomial $PH_c$ of the Coulomb branch compactified on a circle, and prove that $PH_c$ encodes the representation theory of $\mathbb{V}[\mathcal{T}_{SU(N)}]$. We expect this to be a new entry of the 4D mirror symmetry framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an explicit particle method for the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation that conserves energy at the fully discrete level. The method features two key components: a deterministic and conservative particle discretization for the nonlinear Fokker-Planck operator (also known as the Lenard-Bernstein or Dougherty operator), and a second-order explicit time integrator that ensures energy conservation through an accuracy-justifiable correction. We validate the method on several plasma benchmarks, including collisional Landau damping and two-stream instability, demonstrating its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Machine Learning with Cartesian Natural Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomistic machine learning (ML) is a transformative tool for accurate and efficient investigation of material behavior at the atomic scale. While such models have been constructed within Cartesian space to harness geometric information and preserve intuitive physical representations, they face inherent challenges - primarily due to the lack of a systematic symmetry-preserving framework for representing arbitrary physical tensors. We address these challenges by proposing Cartesian Natural Tensor Networks (CarNet) as a general framework for atomistic ML. We first develop the theory of irreducible representations using Cartesian natural tensors (their creation, operation, as well as the decomposition and reconstruction of physical tensors such as the elastic constant tensor). Leveraging this machinery, we design an equivariant Cartesian model and demonstrate its exceptional performance across diverse atomistic ML tasks. CarNet enables the development of highly accurate and reliable interatomic potentials for both materials and molecular systems. Furthermore, structure-property relationships can be readily constructed for tensorial quantities ranging from simple properties like the dipole moment to arbitrary high-rank tensors with complex symmetries such as the elastic constant tensor -- capabilities that were previously inaccessible. This work removes theoretical barriers and unleashes the power of Cartesian approaches for advanced atomistic ML in the understanding and design of new materials.</description>

Abstract: We study the local bihamiltonian structures of the asymmetric rational reductions of the 2D-Toda hierarchy (RR2T) of types $(2,1)$ and $(1,2)$ at the full-dispersive level, and construct a three-dimensional generalized Frobenius manifold with non-flat unity associated with the $(2,1)$-type. Furthermore, we explicitly relate the $(2,1)$-type RR2T to the bi-graded Toda and constrained KP hierarchies via linear reciprocal and Miura-type transformations.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Turing Ensembles, Pareto's Law, and Creativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study integer-valued multiplicative dynamics driven by i.i.d. prime multipliers and connect their macroscopic statistics to universal codelengths. We introduce the Multiplicative Turing Ensemble (MTE) and show how it arises naturally - though not uniquely - from ensembles of probabilistic Turing machines. Our modeling principle is variational: taking Elias' Omega codelength as an energy and imposing maximum entropy constraints yields a canonical Gibbs prior on integers and, by restriction, on primes. Under mild tail assumptions, this prior induces exponential tails for log-multipliers (up to slowly varying corrections), which in turn generate Pareto tails for additive gaps. We also prove time-average laws for the Omega codelength along MTE trajectories. Empirically, on Debian and PyPI package size datasets, a scaled Omega prior achieves the lowest KL divergence against codelength histograms. Taken together, the theory-data comparison suggests a qualitative split: machine-adapted regimes (Gibbs-aligned, finite first moment) exhibit clean averaging behavior, whereas human-generated complexity appears to sit beyond this regime, with tails heavy enough to produce an unbounded first moment, and therefore no averaging of the same kind.</description>

      <title>Consistent kinetic modeling of compressible flows with variable Prandtl numbers: Double-distribution quasi-equilibrium approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A consistent kinetic modeling and discretization strategy for compressible flows across all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios is developed using the quasi-equilibrium approach within two of the most widely used double-distribution frameworks. The methodology ensures accurate recovery of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations, including all macroscopic moments and dissipation rates, through detailed hydrodynamic limit analysis and careful construction of equilibrium and quasi-equilibrium attractors. Discretization is performed using high-order velocity lattices with a static reference frame in a discrete velocity Boltzmann context to isolate key modeling aspects such as the necessary requirements on expansion and quadrature orders. The proposed models demonstrate high accuracy, numerical stability and Galilean invariance across a wide range of Mach numbers and temperature ratios. Separate tests for strict conservation and measurements of all dissipation rates confirm these insights for all Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios. Simulations on a sensitive two-dimensional shock-vortex interaction excellently reproduce viscous Navier-Stokes-Fourier-level physics. The proposed models establish an accurate, efficient and scalable framework for kinetic simulations of compressible flows with moderate supersonic speeds and discontinuities at arbitrary Prandtl numbers and specific heat ratios, offering a valuable tool for studying complex problems in fluid dynamics and paving the way for future extensions to the lattice Boltzmann context, by application of correction terms, as well as high-Mach and hypersonic regimes, employing target-designed reference frames.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bounds on the minimum orbital period for test objects around d-dimensional charged black holes in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We find numerically that the minimum orbital period decreases as the charge of the black hole increases. Thus, the upper limit is reached for an uncharged black hole, while the lower limit is attained for a maximally charged one. We then analytically derive the upper and lower bounds for the minimum orbital period. These results improve our understanding of dynamics around d-dimensional black holes and impose constraints on candidate gravity theories.</description>

Abstract: We determine the late-time dynamics of a generic spin ensemble with inhomogeneous broadening - equivalently, qubits with arbitrary Zeeman splittings - coupled to a dissipative environment with strength decreasing as $1/t$. The approach to the steady state follows a power law, reflecting the interplay between Hamiltonian dynamics and vanishing dissipation. The decay exponents vary non-analytically with the ramp rate, exhibiting a cusp singularity, and $n$-point correlation functions factorize into one- and two-point contributions. Our exact solution anchors a universality class of open quantum systems with explicitly time-dependent dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sphalerons in nonlinear Klein-Gordon models are unstable lump-like solutions that arise from a saddle point between true and false vacua in the energy functional. Numerical simulations are presented which show the sphaleron evolving into an accelerating kink-antikink pair whose separation approaches the speed of light asymptotically at large times. Utilizing a nonlinear collective coordinate method, an approximate analytical solution is derived for this evolution. These results indicate that an exact solution is expected to exhibit a gradient blow-up for large times,caused by energy concentrating at the flanks of the kink-antikink pair.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes which includes radiative perturbations of Minkowski space, we define a distinguished global Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields by means of the microlocal approach to non-elliptic Fredholm theory, working in the de,sc-pseudodifferential algebra due to Sussman. We extend the limiting absorption principle (the "$i\varepsilon$ prescription" for the Feynman propagator) to this setting. Motivated by the complicated Hamilton flow structure arising in this problem, we also prove a new localized radial point estimate in the spirit of Haber-Vasy which, under appropriate nondegeneracy assumptions, allows one to propagate microlocal regularity into a single radial point belonging to a larger radial set which can be a source, sink, or saddle for the Hamilton flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) provides a versatile framework for both quantum information processing and probing many-body entanglement. We reveal a fundamental tension between the error-correcting power of an AQEC and the hardness of code state preparation. More precisely, through a novel application of the Lov\'asz local lemma, we establish a fundamental trade-off between local indistinguishability and circuit complexity, showing that orthogonal short-range entangled states must be distinguishable via a local operator. These results offer a powerful tool for exploring quantum circuit complexity across diverse settings. As applications, we derive stronger constraints on the complexity of AQEC codes with transversal logical gates and establish strong complexity lower bounds for W state preparation. Our framework also provides a novel perspective for systems with Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type constraints.</description>

      <title>Quantum capacity amplification via privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate superadditivity of quantum capacity through private channels whose Choi-Jamiolkowski operators are private states. This perspective links the security structure of private states to quantum capacity and clarifies the role of the shield system: information encoded in the shield system that would otherwise leak to the environment can be recycled when paired with an assisting channel, thereby boosting capacity. Our main contributions are threefold: Firstly, we develop a general framework that provides a sufficient condition for capacity amplification, which is formulated in terms of the assisting channel's Holevo information. As examples, we give explicit, dimension and parameter dependent amplification thresholds for erasure and depolarizing channels. Secondly, assuming the Spin alignment conjecture, we derive a single-letter expression for the quantum capacity of a family of private channels that are neither degradable, anti-degradable, nor PPT; as an application, we construct channels with vanishing quantum capacity yet unbounded private capacity. Thirdly, we further analyze approximate private channels: we give an alternative proof of superactivation that extends its validity to a broader parameter regime, and, by combining amplification bounds with continuity estimates, we establish a metric separation showing that channels exhibiting capacity amplification have nonzero diamond distance from the set of anti-degradable channels, indicating that existing approximate (anti-)degradability bounds are not tight. We also revisit the computability of the regularized quantum capacity and modestly suggest that this fundamental question still remains open.</description>

      <title>Quantum Reverse Shannon Theorem Simplified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the quantum reverse Shannon theorem, a central result in quantum information theory that characterizes the resources needed to simulate quantum channels when entanglement is freely available. We derive a universal additive upper bound on the smoothed max-information in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi mutual information. This bound yields tighter single-shot results, eliminates the need for the post-selection technique, and leads to a conceptually simpler proof of the quantum reverse Shannon theorem. By consolidating and streamlining earlier approaches, our result provides a clearer and more direct understanding of the resource costs of simulating quantum channels.</description>

      <title>Novel frame changes for quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel, exotic types of frame changes for the calculation of quantum evolution operators. We detail in particular the biframe, in which a physical system's evolution is seen in an equal mixture of two different standard frames at once. We prove that, in the biframe, convergence of all series expansions of the solution is quadratically faster than in `conventional' frames. That is, if in laboratory frame or after a standard frame change the error at order $n$ of some perturbative series expansion of the evolution operator is on the order of $\epsilon^n$, $0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1$, for a computational cost $C(n)$ then it is on the order of $\epsilon^{2n+1}$ in the biframe for the same computational cost. We demonstrate that biframe is one of an infinite family of novel frames, some of which lead to higher accelerations but require more computations to set up initially, leading to a trade-off between acceleration and computational burden.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of defining the field strength of abelian potentials when the spacetime is a Poisson manifold, within the groupoidal approach. The natural definition in terms of gauge invariant momenta is proved to be equivalent to covariant and invariant tensors of a local symplectic groupoid representing a symplectic realization of the Poisson manifold. A Poisson Chern-Simons model is then proposed and its equations of motion are shortly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 4-dimensional Poincar\'e-Einstein manifolds whose conformal class contains a K\"ahler metric. Such Einstein metrics are non-K\"ahler and admit a Killing field extending to the conformal infinity, and the Einstein equation reduces to a Toda-type equation. When the Killing field integrates to an $\mathbb{S}^1$-action, we formulate a Dirichlet boundary value problem and establish existence and uniqueness theory. This construction provides a non-perturbative realization of infinite-dimensional families of new Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics whose conformal infinities are of non-positive Yamabe type.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing of Quantum Gibbs Samplers for Weakly-Interacting Quantum Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative quantum algorithms for state preparation in many-body systems are increasingly recognised as promising candidates for achieving large quantum advantages in application-relevant tasks. Recent advances in algorithmic, detailed-balance Lindbladians enable the efficient simulation of open-system dynamics converging towards desired target states. However, the overall complexity of such schemes is governed by system-size dependent mixing times. In this work, we analyse algorithmic Lindbladians for Gibbs state preparation and prove that they exhibit rapid mixing, i.e., convergence in time poly-logarithmic in the system size. We first establish this for non-interacting spin systems, free fermions, and free bosons, and then show that these rapid mixing results are stable under perturbations, covering weakly interacting qudits and perturbed non-hopping fermions. Our results constitute the first efficient mixing bounds for non-commuting qudit models and bosonic systems at arbitrary temperatures. Compared to prior spectral-gap-based results for fermions, we achieve exponentially faster mixing, further featuring explicit constants on the maximal allowed interaction strength. This not only improves the overall polynomial runtime for quantum Gibbs state preparation, but also enhances robustness against noise. Our analysis relies on oscillator norm techniques from mathematical physics, where we introduce tailored variants adapted to specific Lindbladians $\unicode{x2014}$ an innovation that we expect to significantly broaden the scope of these methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum Filtering at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pose and solve the problem of quantum filtering based on continuous-in-time quadrature measurements (homodyning) for the case where the quantum process is in a thermal state. The standard construction of quantum filters involves the determination of the conditional expectation onto the von Neumann algebra generated by the measured observables with the non-demolition principle telling us to restrict the domain (the observables to be estimated) to the commutant of the algebra. The finite-temperature case, however, has additional structure: we use the Araki-Woods representation for the measured quadratures, but the Tomita-Takesaki theory tells us that there exists a separate, commuting representation and therefore the commutant will have a richer structure than encountered in the Fock vacuum case. We apply this to the question of quantum trajectories to the Davies-Fulling-Unruh model. Here, the two representations are interpreted as the fields in the right and left Rindler wedges.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we prove that the universal and maximal abelian covers of a finite multi-graph have the same eigenvalues. This strengthens a recent result of Li, Magee, Sabri, and Thomas (2025), and answers one of their questions. Our proof relies on the theory of the matching polynomial of a graph, and we further prove new results about its Gallai--Edmonds decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity and time-reversal (PT) symmetry is shown as the natural cause of quasi-integrability of deformed integrable models. The condition for asymptotic conservation of quasi-conserved charges appear as a direct consequence of the PT-symmetric phase of the system, ensuring definite PT-properties of the corresponding Lax pair as well as that of the anomalous contribution. This construction applies to quasi-deformations of multiple systems such as KdV, NLSE and non-local NLSE.</description>

      <title>Generalization of nonlocally related partial differential equation systems: unknown symmetric properties and analytical solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry, which describes invariance, is an eternal concern in mathematics and physics, especially in the investigation of solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE). A PDE's nonlocally related PDE systems provide excellent approaches to search for various symmetries that expand the range of its known solutions. They composed of potential systems based on conservation laws and inverse potential systems (IPS) based on differential invariants. Our study is devoted to generalizing their construction and application in three-dimensional circumstances. Concretely, the potential of the algebraic gauge-constrained potential system is simplified without weakening its solution space. The potential system is extended via nonlocal conservation laws and double reductions. Afterwards, nonlocal symmetries are identified in the IPS.\@ The IPS is extended by the solvable Lie algebra and type \Rmnum{2} hidden symmetries. Besides, systems among equations can be connected via Cole-Hopf transformation.\@ Ultimately, established and extended systems embody rich symmetric properties and unprecedented analytical solutions, and may even further facilitate general coordinate-independent analysis in qualitative, numerical, perturbation, etc., this can be illustrated by several Burgers-type equations.</description>

Abstract: In the present paper we study the low density Bose gas in the thermodynamic limit interacting via two-body and three-body interaction potentials. We prove that the leading order of the ground state energy is entirely characterised by both the scattering length of the two-body potential and the scattering energy of the three-body potential. The corresponding result for two-body interactions was proven in seminal papers of Dyson (1957) and of Lieb-Yngvason (1998), and the result for three-body interactions was proven by Nam-Ricaud-Triay (2022). The present result resolves a conjecture of Nam-Ricaud-Triay (2022).</description>

Abstract: We study the ground state energy of trapped two-dimensional Bose gases with mean-field type interactions that can be attractive. We prove the stability of second kind of the many-body system and the convergence of the ground state energy per particle to that of a non-linear Schr\"odinger (NLS) energy functional. Notably, we can take any polynomial scaling of the interaction, and even exponential scalings arbitrarily close to the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, which is a drastic improvement on the best-known result for systems with attractive interactions. As a consequence of the stability of second kind we also obtain Bose-Einstein condensation for the many-body ground states for a much improved range of the diluteness parameter.</description>

Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11428v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kepler problem concerns a point particle in an attractive inverse square force. After a brief review of the classical and quantum versions of this problem, focused on their hidden $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$ symmetry, we discuss the quantum Kepler problem for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. We show that the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of bound states for this problem is unitarily equivalent, as a representation of $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$, to the Hilbert space of solutions of the Weyl equation on the spacetime $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$. This equation describes a massless left-handed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. We then form the fermionic Fock space on $\mathcal{H}$ and show this is unitarily equivalent to the Hilbert space of a massless left-handed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ free quantum field on $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$, again as representations of $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$. By modifying the Hamiltonian of this free field theory, we obtain the well-known "Madelung rules". These give a reasonable approximation to the observed filling of subshells as we consider elements with more and more electrons, and match the rough overall structure of the periodic table.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends the results regarding entropic convergence and the strong linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation (without external force) in [C. David Levermore. Entropic convergence and the linearized limit for the Boltzmann equation. Communications in Partial Differential Equations, 18(7-8):1231--1248, 1993] to the case of the Boltzmann equation with external force. Our starting point is the Boltzmann equation with an external force introduced in [Diogo Ars\'enio and Laure Saint-Raymond. From the Vlasov--Maxwell--Boltzmann System to Incompressible Viscous Electro-magneto-hydrodynamics, EMS Press, 2019], we then find new conditions on the force and rigorously prove the maintaining result by Levermore. More specifically, any sequence of DiPerna-Lions renormalized solutions of the Boltzmann equation with external force are shown to have fluctuations (about the global Maxwellian equilibrium $M$) that converge entropically (and hence strongly in $L^1$) to the solution of the linearized Boltzmann equation for any positive time, given that its initial fluctuations about $M$ converge entropically to the provided $L^2$ initial data of the linearized equation, where the force can be physically significant.</description>

      <title>The Chiral Anomaly of the Free Fermion in Functorial Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.04212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When trying to cast the free fermion in the framework of functorial field theory, its chiral anomaly manifests in the fact that it assigns the determinant of the Dirac operator to a top-dimensional closed spin manifold, which is not a number as expected, but an element of a complex line. In functorial field theory language, this means that the theory is twisted, which gives rise to an anomaly theory. In this paper, we give a detailed construction of this anomaly theory, as a functor that sends manifolds to infinite-dimensional Clifford algebras and bordisms to bimodules.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the correspondence between classical and quantum integrable theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.07600v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If we start from certain functional relations as definition of a quantum integrable theory, then we can derive from them a linear integral equation. It can be extended, by introducing dynamical variables, to become an equation with the form of Marchenko's. Then, we derive from the latter a classical (differential) Lax pair. We exemplify our method by focusing on the massive version of the ODE/IM (Ordinary Differential Equations/Integrable Models) correspondence from Quantum sine-Gordon (sG) with many moduli/masses to the classical sinh-Gordon (shG) equation, so describing, in a particular case, some super-symmetric gauge theories and the $AdS_3$ strong coupling scattering amplitudes/Wilson loops. Yet, we present it in a way which reveals its generality of application. In fact, we give some hints on how it works for spin chains.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Realization of Spherical T-Duality via $\star$-Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes an equivalence between two distinct frameworks for constructing and relating smooth manifolds: the geometric theory of \emph{$\star$-diagrams} and the string-theory-inspired notion of \emph{spherical T-duality}. We prove that for linear $\mathrm{S}^3$-bundles over the 4-sphere, the existence of a $\star$-diagram connecting two such bundles is equivalent to them forming a spherical T-dual pair. This result provides a concrete geometric realization of spherical T-duality, interpreting its abstract cohomological definitions in the language of differential geometry.
  To forge this connection, we introduce a higher-dimensional generalization of \emph{logarithmic transformations}. These topological surgeries change the diffeomorphism type of the homology $\Sigma\times \mathrm{S}^1$, where $\Sigma$ is a homotopy sphere. Forgetting the $\mathrm{S}^1$-factor, they realize the constructed spherical T-dualities. Furthermore, we show that the known isomorphisms in the equivariant K-theory and cohomology between the T-dual manifolds are a direct consequence of an underlying \emph{Morita equivalence} between the action groupoids naturally associated with the base manifolds in a $\star$-diagram.</description>

Abstract: We construct a van Est map for strict Lie 2-groups from the Bott-Shulman-Stasheff double complex of the strict Lie 2-group to the Weil algebra of its associated strict Lie 2-algebra. We show that, under appropriate connectedness assumptions, this map induces isomorphisms in cohomology. As an application, we differentiate the Segal 2-form on the loop group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a classification of the $regular$ soliton solutions of the KP hierarchy, referred to as the $KP solitons$, under the Gel'fand-Dickey $\ell$-reductions in terms of the permutation of the symmetric group. As an example, we show that the regular soliton solutions of the (good) Boussinesq equation as the 3-reduction can have $at ~most$ one resonant soliton in addition to two sets of solitons propagating in opposite directions. We also give a systematic construction of these soliton solutions for the $\ell$-reductions using the vertex operators. In particular, we show that the $non-crossing$ permutation gives the regularity condition for the soliton solutions.</description>

      <title>Random ordinate method for mitigating the ray effect in radiative transport equation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Discrete Ordinates Method (DOM) is the most widely used velocity discretization method for simulating the radiative transport equation. However, the ray effect is a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests that exhibit the ray effect, we observe low regularity in the velocity variable of the solution. To address this issue, we propose a Random Ordinate Method (ROM) to mitigate the ray effect. Compared to other strategies proposed in the literature for mitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) For benchmark tests that exhibit ray effect, the computational cost is lower than that of the DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to existing DOM-based code; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of the problem setup. A formal analysis is presented for the convergence orders of the error and bias. Numerical tests demonstrate the reduction in computational cost compared to DOM, as well as its effectiveness in mitigating the ray effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note we contribute two results to the theory of the $2D$ Euler equations in vorticity form on the full plane. First, we establish a generalized Lagrangian representation of weak (in general measure-valued) solutions, which includes and extends classical results on the Lagrangianity of weak solutions. Second, we construct nonlinear Markov processes which are uniquely determined by a selection of weak solutions from initial data in $L^1\cap L^p$, $p \geq 2$, and related spaces such as the classical and uniformly localized Yudovich space. It is well-known that for $p &lt;\infty$ weak solutions are in general not unique, which renders a suitable selection nontrivial.</description>

      <title>On the application of Lorentz-Finsler geometry to model wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent increasing interest in the study of Lorentz-Finsler geometry has led to several applications to model real-world physical phenomena. Our purpose is to provide a simple, step-by-step review on how to build and implement such a geometric model to describe the propagation of a classical wave satisfying Fermat's and Huygens' principles in an anisotropic and rheonomic (time-dependent) medium. The model is based on identifying the individual wave trajectories as lightlike pregeodesics of a specific Lorentz-Finsler metric, which obey a simple ODE system and can therefore be easily computed in real time.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Cosmic Anisotropy and its Ramifications I: Killing vector fields and constructing their metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the largest scales, the universe appears to be almost homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. In contrast, on smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropy become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence, and formation of structure in the universe. Moreover, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it necessary to explore the consequences of departure from the ideal, uniform universe on the fundamental level. Thus, in this work, the foundation of spatially homogeneous yet anisotropic universes is studied. Specifically, when given a 3D Lie algebra of \emph{desired} Killing vector fields (as would be the case for a homogeneous yet anisotropic universe), we provide an explicit construction for the metric that has exactly those as its Killing vector fields. This construction is presented accessibly, in a directly-usable, algorithmic fashion. Some examples demonstrating the construction are worked out, including a constructive method to separate out (cosmic) time dependence in spatially homogeneous, anisotropic cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Tessellation codes: encoded quantum gates by geometric rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize the symmetry groups of regular tessellations on two-dimensional surfaces of different constant curvatures, including spheres, Euclidean planes and hyperbolic planes, to encode a qubit or qudit into the physical degrees of freedom on these surfaces, which we call tessellation codes. We show that tessellation codes exhibit decent error correction properties by analysis via geometric considerations and the representation theory of the isometry groups on the corresponding surfaces. Interestingly, we demonstrate how this formalism enables the implementation of certain logical operations through geometric rotations of surfaces in real space, opening a new approach to logical quantum computation. We provide a variety of concrete constructions of such codes associated with different tessellations, which give rise to different logical groups. This formalism sheds a new light on quantum code and logical operation construction.</description>

Abstract: In these lectures we review two approaches to constructing particle actions from coset spaces of symmetry groups: non-linear realisations and coadjoint orbits. At the level of particle actions, we observe that they coincide. We also provide an introduction to symplectic geometry and we sketch the theory of coadjoint orbits for the Poincar\'e group.</description>

Abstract: Operator systems are the unital self-adjoint subspaces of the bounded operators on a Hilbert space. Complex operator systems are an important category containing the C*-algebras and von Neumann algebras, which is increasingly of interest in modern analysis and also in modern quantum physics (such as quantum information theory). They have an extensive theory, and have very important applications in all of these subjects. We present here the real case of the theory of (complex) operator systems, and also the real case of their remarkable tensor product theory, due in the complex case to Paulsen and his coauthors and students (such as Kavruk), building on pioneering earlier work of Kirchberg and others. We uncover several notable differences between the real and complex theory, including the absence of minimal and maximal functors in the category of real operator systems. We also develop very many foundational structural results for real operator systems, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic constructions in the subject. In the final two sections of our paper we study real analogues of the Kirchberg conjectures (and of several important related problems that have attracted much interest recently), and study the deep relationships between them.</description>

Abstract: The Lie algebra of symmetries generated by the left-moving current $j=\partial_-\phi$ in the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory is infinite dimensional, exhibiting mutually commuting subalgebras. The infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras define integrable deformations of the $2d$ single scalar conformal field theory which preserve the Poisson bracket structure. We study these mutually commuting subalgebras, finding general properties that the generators of such a subalgebra must satisfy. Along the way, we derive constraints on integrable equations of the Korteweg-de Vries type. We also confirm that the recently found $[j]=0,-1,-2$ mutually commuting subalgebras are infinite dimensional.</description>

      <title>Emergent random matrix universality in quantum operator dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high complexity of many-body quantum dynamics means that essentially all approaches either exploit special structure or are approximate in nature. One such approach--the memory function formalism--involves a carefully chosen split into fast and slow modes. An approximate model for the fast modes can then be used to solve for Green's functions $G(z)$ of the slow modes. Using a formulation in operator Krylov space known as the recursion method, we prove the emergence of a universal random matrix description of the fast mode dynamics. This is captured by the level-$n$ Green's function $G_n (z)$, which we show approaches universal scaling forms in the fast limit $n\to\infty$. Notably, this emergent universality can occur in both chaotic and non-chaotic systems, provided their spectral functions are smooth. This universality of $G_n (z)$ is precisely analogous to the universality of eigenvalue correlations in random matrix theory (RMT), even though there is no explicit randomness present in the Hamiltonian. At finite $z$ we show that $G_n (z)$ approaches the Wigner semicircle law, while if $G(z)$ is the Green's function of certain hydrodynamical variables, we show that at low frequencies $G_n (z)$ is instead governed by the Bessel universality class from RMT. As an application of this universality, we give a numerical method--the spectral bootstrap--for approximating spectral functions from Lanczos coefficients. Our proof involves a map to a Riemann-Hilbert problem which we solve using a steepest-descent-type method, rigorously controlled in the $n\to\infty$ limit. We are led via steepest-descent to a Coulomb gas optimization problem, and we discuss how a recent conjecture--the `Operator Growth Hypothesis--is linked to a confinement transition in this Coulomb gas. These results elevate the recursion method to a theoretically principled framework with universal content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variationality of the equation of conformal geodesics is an important problem in geometry with applications to general relativity. Recently it was proven that, in three dimensions, this system of equations for un-parametrized curves is the Euler-Lagrange equations of a certain conformally invariant functional, while the parametrized system in three dimensions is not variational. We demonstrate that variationality fails in higher dimensions for both parametrized and un-parametrized conformal geodesics, indicating that variational principle may be the selection principle for the physical dimension.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of two--dimensional dilaton gravity in its $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension based on the $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ Lie superalgebra. Within the BF theoretical framework, we analyze affine and superconformal boundary conditions for each case and systematically derive the associated asymptotic symmetry algebras. While the classical theory recovers the Virasoro algebra or its affine enhancement, the supersymmetric extension yields a classical $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal algebra, subject to dynamical symmetry breaking mechanisms induced by the dilaton supermultiplet. We find that the boundary behavior of the dilaton not only leads to a reduction of the full affine $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)_k$ symmetry down to $\tt{O} \tt{S} p(1|2)$, but also introduces an abelian extension through commuting modes. These results reveal a novel interplay between symmetry breaking and symmetry extension in low-dimensional supergravity. Our construction generalizes previous analyses of $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ dilaton gravity to the supersymmetric domain and offers a consistent foundation for investigating boundary dynamics beyond the Schwarzian regime.</description>

      <title>Real Non-Commutative Convexity I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13512v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convex sets, the real case of the recent and profound complex theory developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their memoir. Later results will be discussed in future papers. We develop here some of the infrastructure of real nc convexity, giving many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated nc convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of a noisy classical nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end quantum algorithm for simulating nonlinear dynamics described by a system of stochastic dissipative differential equations with a quadratic nonlinearity. The stochastic part of the system is modeled by a Gaussian noise in the equation of motion and in the initial conditions. Our algorithm can approximate the expected value of any correlation function that depends on $O(1)$ variables with rigorous bounds on the approximation error. The runtime scales polynomially with $\log{N}$, $t$, $J$, and $\lambda_1^{-1}$, where $N$ is the total number of variables, $t$ is the evolution time, $J$ is the nonlinearity strength, and $\lambda_1$ is the smallest dissipation rate. However, the runtime scales exponentially with a parameter quantifying inverse relative error in the initial conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous quantum algorithm capable of simulating strongly nonlinear systems with $J\gg \lambda_1$ at the cost poly-logarithmic in $N$ and polynomial in $t$. The considered simulation problem is shown to be BQP-complete, providing a strong evidence for a quantum advantage. We benchmark the quantum algorithm via numerical experiments by simulating a vortex flow in the 2D Navier Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonrelativistic limit of ground states to nonlinear Dirac equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the existence and properties of ground states, including both energy and action ground states, for nonlinear Dirac equations with power-type potentials. \begin{equation*} -i c\sum\limits_{k=1}^3\alpha_k\partial_k u +mc^2 \beta {u}- |{u}|^{p-2}{u}=\omega {u}. \end{equation*} We establish the existence of energy ground states and demonstrate that as the speed of light approaches infinity, both energy and action ground states converge to their counterparts in the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, we characterize the convergence rate of the ground state energy and investigate the equivalence between action and energy ground states.</description>

      <title>Instability of sphalerons in $\phi^4$ models with a false vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A one-parameter family of nonlinear (quartic) Klein-Gordon models having a sphaleron solution is studied. The sphaleron arises from a saddle point between true and false vacua in the energy functional. Its instability is shown be governed by a Heun differential equation after a change of variable. This allows an explicit formulation of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues to be obtained in terms of local Heun functions. Good approximations are found for certain ranges of the parameter.</description>

      <title>The LMO Spectrum: Factorization Homology and the E_3-Structure of the Jacobi Diagram Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the LMO spectrum, a categorification of the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki (LMO) invariant for 3-manifolds, using factorization homology. The theoretical foundation is our main algebraic result (Theorem A): the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, $\AJac$, possesses a homotopy $E_3$-algebra structure. This is a necessary condition for consistency within factorization homology, and the proof relies on the formality of the little 3-disks operad. A universal surgery formula is derived from the excision axiom (Theorem B), providing a computational basis independent of conjectural models. As an application (Theorem C), we construct an ``$H_1$-decorated LMO invariant'' that distinguishes the lens spaces $L(156, 5)$ and $L(156, 29)$, a pair that the classical LMO invariant fails to separate.</description>

      <title>Conifold gap and all-genus mirror symmetry for local $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Conifold Gap Conjecture asserts that the polar part of the Gromov-Witten potential of a Calabi-Yau threefold near its conifold locus has a universal expression described by the logarithm of the Barnes $G$-function. In this paper, I prove the Conifold Gap Conjecture for the local projective plane. The proof relates the higher genus conifold Gromov-Witten generating series of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ to the thermodynamics of a certain statistical mechanical ensemble of repulsive particles on the positive half-line. As a corollary, this establishes the all-genus mirror principle for local $\mathbb{P}^2$ through the direct integration of the BCOV holomorphic anomaly equations.</description>

      <title>Invariants and representations of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is considerable current interest in applications of generalised Lie algebras graded by an abelian group $\Gamma$ with a commutative factor $\omega$. This calls for a systematic development of the theory of such algebraic structures. We treat the representation theory and invariant theory of the $\Gamma$-graded general linear Lie $\omega$-algebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$, where $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ is any finite dimensional $\Gamma$-graded vector space. Generalised Howe dualities over symmetric $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebras are established, from which we derive the first and second fundamental theorems of invariant theory, and a generalised Schur-Weyl duality. The unitarisable $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$-modules for two ``compact'' $\ast$-structures are classified, and it is shown that the tensor powers of $V(\Gamma, \omega)$ and their duals are unitarisable for the two compact $\ast$-structures respectively. A Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra is constructed, which gives rise to a group functor corresponding to the general linear group in the $\Gamma$-graded setting. Using this Hopf $(\Gamma, \omega)$-algebra, we realise simple tensor modules and their dual modules by mimicking the classic Borel-Weil theorem. We also analyse in some detail the case with $\Gamma={\mathbb Z}^{\dim{V(\Gamma, \omega)}}$ and $\omega$ depending on a complex parameter $q\ne 0$, where $\mathfrak{gl}(V(\Gamma, \omega))$ shares common features with the quantum general linear (super)group, but is better behaved especially when $q$ is a root of unity.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>
