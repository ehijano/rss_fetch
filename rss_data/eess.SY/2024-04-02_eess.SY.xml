      <title>A Fast Convergence Algorithm for Iterative Adaptation of Feedforward Controller Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedforward control is a viable option for enhancing the response time and control accuracy of a wide variety of systems. Nevertheless, it is not able to compensate for the effects produced by modeling errors or disturbances. A solution to improve the feedforward performance is the use of an adaptation law that modifies the parameters of the feedforward control. In the case where real-time feedback is not possible, a solution is a run-to-run numerical optimization method that is fed with a cost based on a measured signal. Although the effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated, its performance is hindered by slow convergence. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on Pattern Search and Adaptive Coordinate Descent methods that makes use of the sensitivity of the feedforward controller to its parameters so that the convergence speed improves significantly. Like many algorithms, this is a local strategy so the algorithm might converge to a local minimum. Therefore, we present two versions, one without a learning rate and one with it. To compare them and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm, simulated results are shown on a well-known control problem in electromechanics: the soft-landing control of electromechanical switching devices.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work analyzes unobservable directions of Vision-aided Inertial Navigation System (VINS) and Lidar-aided Inertial Navigation System (LINS) nonlinear model. Under the assumption that there exist two features observed by the camera without occlusion, the unobservable directions of VINS are uniformly globally translation and global rotations about the gravity vector. The unobservable directions of LINS are same as VINS, while only one feature need to be observed.</description>

      <title>Managing power balance and reserve feasibility in the AC unit commitment problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating the AC power flow equations into unit commitment models has the potential to avoid costly corrective actions required by less accurate power flow approximations. However, research on unit commitment with AC power flow constraints has been limited to a few relatively small test networks. This work investigates large-scale AC unit commitment problems for the day-ahead market and develops decomposition algorithms capable of obtaining high-quality solutions at industry-relevant scales. The results illustrate that a simple algorithm that only seeks to satisfy unit commitment, reserve, and AC power balance constraints can obtain surprisingly high-quality solutions to this AC unit commitment problem. However, a naive strategy that prioritizes reserve feasibility leads to AC infeasibility, motivating the need to design heuristics that can effectively balance reserve and AC feasibility. Finally, this work explores a parallel decomposition strategy that allows the proposed algorithm to obtain feasible solutions on large cases within the two hour time limit required by typical day-ahead market operations.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Cardano-Lyapunov Feedback for PDEs with Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of inverse optimal control design for systems that are not affine in the control. In particular, we consider some classes of partial differential equations (PDEs) with quadratic convection and counter-convection, for which the L2 norm is a control Lyapunov function (CLF) whose derivative has either a depressed cubic or a quadratic dependence in the boundary control input. We also consider diffusive PDEs with or without linear convection, for which a weighted L2 norm is a CLF whose derivative has a quadratic dependence in the control input. For each structure on the derivative of the CLF, we achieve inverse optimality with respect to a meaningful cost functional. For the case where the derivative of the CLF has a depressed cubic dependence in the control, we construct a cost functional for which the unique minimizer is the unique real root of a cubic polynomial: the Cardano-Lyapunov controller. When the derivative of the CLF is quadratic in the control, we construct a cost functional that is minimized by two distinct feedback laws, that correspond to the two distinct real roots of a quadratic equation. We show how to switch from one root to the other to reduce the control effort.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Fairness-promoting Optimization Schemes of Photovoltaic Curtailments for Voltage Regulation in Power Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active power curtailment of photovoltaic (PV) generation is commonly exercised to mitigate over-voltage issues in power distribution networks. However, fairness concerns arise as certain PV plants may experience more significant curtailments than others depending on their locations within the network. Existing literature tackles this issue through fairness-promoting/aware optimization schemes. These schemes can be broadly categorized into two types. The first type maximizes an additional fairness objective along with the main objective of curtailment minimization. The second type is formulated as a feedback controller, where fairness is accounted for by assigning different weights (as feedback) in the curtailment minimization objective for each PV plant based on previous curtailment actions. In this work, we combine these two schemes and provide extensive analyses and comparisons of these two fairness schemes. We compare the performance in terms of fairness and net curtailments for several benchmark test networks.</description>

      <title>On Accessibility Fairness in Intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the operation of mobility systems so far has mostly focused on minimizing cost-centered metrics such as average travel time, distance driven, and operational costs. Whilst capturing economic indicators, such metrics do not account for transportation justice aspects. In this paper, we present an optimization model to plan the operation of Intermodal Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (I-AMoD) systems, where self-driving vehicles provide on-demand mobility jointly with public transit and active modes, with the goal to minimize the accessibility unfairness experienced by the population. Specifically, we first leverage a previously developed network flow model to compute the I-AMoD system operation in a minimum-time manner. Second, we formally define accessibility unfairness, and use it to frame the maximum-accessibility-fairness problem and cast it as a linear program. We showcase our framework for a real-world case-study in the city of Eindhoven, NL. Our results show that it is possible to reach an operation that is on average fully fair at the cost of a slight travel time increase compared to a minimum-travel-time solution. Thereby we observe that the accessibility fairness of individual paths is, on average, worse than the average values obtained from flows, setting the stage for a discussion on the definition of accessibility fairness itself.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order Koopman modeling and predictive control of nonlinear processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient data-driven predictive control approach for general nonlinear processes based on a reduced-order Koopman operator. A Kalman-based sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics method is employed to select lifting functions for Koopman identification. The selected lifting functions are used to project the original nonlinear state-space into a higher-dimensional linear function space, in which Koopman-based linear models can be constructed for the underlying nonlinear process. To curb the significant increase in the dimensionality of the resulting full-order Koopman models caused by the use of lifting functions, we propose a reduced-order Koopman modeling approach based on proper orthogonal decomposition. A computationally efficient linear robust predictive control scheme is established based on the reduced-order Koopman model. A case study on a benchmark chemical process is conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comprehensive comparisons are conducted to demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Climate Control Strategy for Electric Vehicles with Door-Opening Consideration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel climate control strategy for electric vehicles (EVs) by addressing door-opening interruptions, an overlooked aspect in EV thermal management. We create and validate an EV simulation model that incorporates door-opening scenarios. Three controllers are compared using the simulation model: (i) a hierarchical non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) with a unique coolant dividing layer and a component for cabin air inflow regulation based on door-opening signals; (ii) a single MPC controller; and (iii) a rule-based controller. The hierarchical controller outperforms, reducing door-opening temperature drops by 46.96% and 51.33% compared to single layer MPC and rule-based methods in the relevant section. Additionally, our strategy minimizes the maximum temperature gaps between the sections during recovery by 86.4% and 78.7%, surpassing single layer MPC and rule-based approaches, respectively. We believe that this result opens up future possibilities for incorporating the thermal comfort of passengers across all sections within the vehicle.</description>

      <title>Scalable second-order consensus of hierarchical groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by widespread dominance hierarchy, growth of group sizes, and feedback mechanisms in social species, we are devoted to exploring the scalable second-order consensus of hierarchical groups. More specifically, a hierarchical group consists of a collection of agents with double-integrator dynamics on a directed acyclic graph with additional reverse edges, which characterize feedback mechanisms across hierarchical layers. As the group size grows and the reverse edges appear, we investigate whether the absolute velocity protocol and the relative velocity protocol can preserve the system consensus property without tuning the control gains. It is rigorously proved that the absolute velocity protocol is able to achieve completely scalable second-order consensus but the relative velocity protocol cannot. This result theoretically reveals how the scalable coordination behavior in hierarchical groups is determined by local interaction rules. Moreover, we develop a hierarchical structure in order to achieve scalable second-order consensus for networks of any size and with any number of reverse edges.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric End-to-End Probabilistic Forecasting of Distributed Generation Outputs Considering Missing Data Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a nonparametric end-to-end method for probabilistic forecasting of distributed renewable generation outputs while including missing data imputation. Firstly, we employ a nonparametric probabilistic forecast model utilizing the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to model the probability distributions of distributed renewable generations' outputs. Secondly, we design an end-to-end training process that includes missing data imputation through iterative imputation and iterative loss-based training procedures. This two-step modeling approach effectively combines the strengths of the nonparametric method with the end-to-end approach. Consequently, our approach demonstrates exceptional capabilities in probabilistic forecasting for the outputs of distributed renewable generations while effectively handling missing values. Simulation results confirm the superior performance of our approach compared to existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Delay-Induced Watermarking for Detection of Replay Attacks in Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A state-feedback watermarking signal design for the detection of replay attacks in linear systems is proposed. The control input is augmented with a random time-delayed term of the system state estimate, in order to secure the system against attacks of replay type. We outline the basic analysis of the closed-loop response of the state-feedback watermarking in a LQG controlled system. Our theoretical results are applied on a temperature process control example. While the proposed secure control scheme requires very involved analysis, it, nevertheless, holds promise of being superior to conventional, feed-forward, watermarking schemes, in both its ability to detect attacks as well as the secured system performance.</description>

      <title>Orchestrating UAVs for Prioritized Data Harvesting: A Cross-Layer Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work describes the orchestration of a fleet of rotary-wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for harvesting prioritized traffic from random distributions of heterogeneous users with Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) capabilities. In a finite-horizon offline setting, the goal is to optimize the beam-forming design, the 3D UAV positioning and trajectory solution, and the user association/scheduling policy, to maximize the cumulative fleet-wide reward obtained by satisfying the quality-of-service mandates imposed on each user uplink request, subject to an average per-UAV mobility power constraint. With a probabilistic air-to-ground channel model, a multi-user MIMO uplink communication model with prioritized traffic, and a novel 3D mobility model for rotary-wing UAVs, the fleet-wide reward maximization problem is solved via a cross-layer optimization framework: first, K-means clustering is employed to obtain user clusters; then, equipped with a zero-forcing beam-forming design, the positions of the UAVs are optimized via two-stage grid search; next, treating these optimal positions as the graph vertices of a fully-connected mesh, the 3D UAV trajectories (i.e., graph edges) are designed via a learning based competitive swarm optimization algorithm, under an average UAV power consumption constraint, coupled with projected subgradient ascent for dual optimization; consequently, the user association/scheduling strategy is solved via a graphical branch-and-bound method on the underlying multiple traveling salesman problem. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed solution outperforms static UAV deployments, adaptive Voronoi decomposition techniques, and state-of-the-art iterative fleet control algorithms, with respect to user quality-of-service and per-UAV average power consumption.</description>

      <title>Optimal Bidding Strategies in Network-Constrained Demand Response: A Distributed Aggregative Game Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demand response has been a promising solution for accommodating renewable energy in power systems. In this study, we consider a demand response scheme within a distribution network facing an energy supply deficit. The utility company incentivizes load aggregators to adjust their pre-scheduled energy consumption and generation to match the supply. Each aggregator, which represents a group of prosumers, aims to maximize its revenue by bidding strategically in the demand response scheme. Since aggregators act in their own self-interest and their revenues and feasible bids influence one another, we model their competition as a network-constrained aggregative game. This model incorporates power flow constraints to prevent potential line congestion. Given that there are no coordinators and aggregators can only communicate with their neighbours, we introduce a fully distributed generalized Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm to determine the optimal bidding strategies for aggregators in this game. Within this algorithm, only estimates of the aggregate and certain auxiliary variables are communicated among neighbouring aggregators. We demonstrate the convergence of this algorithm by constructing an equivalent iteration using the forward-backward splitting technique.</description>

      <title>Steering game dynamics towards desired outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic behavior of agents in games, which captures how their strategies evolve over time based on past interactions, can lead to a spectrum of undesirable behaviors, ranging from non-convergence to Nash equilibria to the emergence of limit cycles and chaos. To mitigate the effects of selfish behavior, central planners can use dynamic payments to guide strategic multi-agent systems toward stability and socially optimal outcomes. However, the effectiveness of such interventions critically relies on accurately predicting agents' responses to incentives and dynamically adjusting payments so that the system is guided towards the desired outcomes. These challenges are further amplified in real-time applications where the dynamics are unknown and only scarce data is available. To tackle this challenge, in this work we introduce the SIAR-MPC method, combining the recently introduced Side Information Assisted Regression (SIAR) method for system identification with Model Predictive Control (MPC). SIAR utilizes side-information constraints inherent to game theoretic applications to model agent responses to payments from scarce data, while MPC uses this model to facilitate dynamic payment adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate the efficiency of SIAR-MPC in guiding the system towards socially optimal equilibria, stabilizing chaotic behaviors, and avoiding specified regions of the state space. Comparative analyses in data-scarce settings show SIAR-MPC's superior performance over pairing MPC with Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a powerful system identification method that finds models satisfying specific constraints.</description>

Abstract: We study non-parametric frequency-domain system identification from a finite-sample perspective. We assume an open loop scenario where the excitation input is periodic and consider the Empirical Transfer Function Estimate (ETFE), where the goal is to estimate the frequency response at certain desired (evenly-spaced) frequencies, given input-output samples. We show that under sub-Gaussian colored noise (in time-domain) and stability assumptions, the ETFE estimates are concentrated around the true values. The error rate is of the order of $\mathcal{O}((d_{\mathrm{u}}+\sqrt{d_{\mathrm{u}}d_{\mathrm{y}}})\sqrt{M/N_{\mathrm{tot}}})$, where $N_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is the total number of samples, $M$ is the number of desired frequencies, and $d_{\mathrm{u}},\,d_{\mathrm{y}}$ are the dimensions of the input and output signals respectively. This rate remains valid for general irrational transfer functions and does not require a finite order state-space representation. By tuning $M$, we obtain a $N_{\mathrm{tot}}^{-1/3}$ finite-sample rate for learning the frequency response over all frequencies in the $ \mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norm. Our result draws upon an extension of the Hanson-Wright inequality to semi-infinite matrices. We study the finite-sample behavior of ETFE in simulations.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Newton-Based Extremum Seeking for Multivariable Static Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A second-order Newton-based extremum seeking (SONES) algorithm is presented to estimate directional inflection points for multivariable static maps. The design extends the first-order Newton-based extremum seeking algorithm that drives the system toward its peak point. This work provides perturbation matrices to estimate the second- and third-order derivatives necessary for implementation of the SONES. A set of conditions are provided for the probing frequencies that ensure accurate estimation of the derivatives. A differential Riccati filter is used to calculate the inverse of the third-order derivative. The local stability of the new algorithm is proven for general multivariable static maps using averaging analysis. The proposed algorithm ensures uniform convergence toward directional inflection point without requiring information about the curvature of the map and its gradient. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Probability-Based Optimal Control Design for Soft Landing of Short-Stroke Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact forces during switching operations of short-stroke actuators may cause bouncing, audible noise and mechanical wear. The application of soft-landing control strategies to these devices aims at minimizing the impact velocities of their moving components to ultimately improve their lifetime and performance. In this paper, a novel approach for soft-landing trajectory planning, including probability functions, is proposed for optimal control of the actuators. The main contribution of the proposal is that it considers uncertainty in the contact position and hence the obtained trajectories are more robust against system uncertainties. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and transformed into a two-point boundary value problem for its numerical resolution. Simulated and experimental tests have been performed using a dynamic model and a commercial short-stroke solenoid valve. The results show a significant improvement in the expected velocities and accelerations at contact with respect to past solutions in which the contact position is assumed to be perfectly known.</description>

      <title>Research on Mechanism of Voltage Oscillation Caused by Repeated LVRT of Wind Turbine Based on Switched System Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical distance between the wind power collection sending end grid and the main grid is relatively long, lacking synchronous power supply support, showing the characteristics of weak grid. Therefore, the voltage oscillation phenomenon is easy to happen, threatening the safe and stable operation of the grid. Its dynamic process and evolution mechanism need to be studied urgently. This paper firstly analyzes conditions for voltage oscillations caused by repeated low voltage ride through (LVRT) of wind turbine through steady-state power flow calculation. Then, based on the switched system theory, considering the external connected impedance and internal control dynamics of the wind turbine, the switched system model for the grid-side converter (GSC) of wind turbine is established. After that, the relevant parameters are substituted to analyze the dynamic evolution process of each electrical quantity during the process that wind turbine repeatedly enters and exits LVRT, revealing the evolution mechanism of voltage oscillations. Finally, the voltage oscillation phenomenon of the grid-connected point of wind turbine is reproduced through simulation, verifying the correctness and effectiveness of theoretical analysis results. Furthermore, the main factors which influence characteristics of voltage oscillations are explored as well.</description>

Abstract: This brief gives a set of unified Lyapunov stability conditions to guarantee the predefined-time/finite-time stability of a dynamical systems. The derived Lyapunov theorem for autonomous systems establishes equivalence with existing theorems on predefined-time/finite-time stability. The findings proposed herein develop a nonsingular sliding mode control framework for an Euler-Lagrange system to analyze its stability, and its upper bound for the settling time can be arbitrarily determined a priori through predefined time constant.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Cyber Resilience: The Confluence of Game, Control, and Learning Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyber resilience is a complementary concept to cybersecurity, focusing on the preparation, response, and recovery from cyber threats that are challenging to prevent. Organizations increasingly face such threats in an evolving cyber threat landscape. Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of linear functions facilitates the calculation of their 2-induced norm and row and null spaces, hallmarks of linear control theory. In this work, we present a function representation that, similar to SVD, provides an upper bound on the 2-induced norm of bounded-input bounded-output functions, as well as facilitates the computation of generalizations of the notions of row and null spaces. Borrowing from the notion of "lifting" in Koopman operator theory, we construct a finite-dimensional lifting of inputs that relaxes the unitary property of the right-most matrix in traditional SVD, $V^*$, to be an injective, norm-preserving mapping to a slightly higher-dimensional space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project aims to revolutionize drone flight control by implementing a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent as a replacement for traditional linear Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers. The primary objective is to seamlessly transition drones between manual and autonomous modes, enhancing responsiveness and stability. We utilize the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning strategy within the Gazebo simulator to train the DRL agent. Adding a $20,000 indoor Vicon tracking system offers &lt;1mm positioning accuracy, which significantly improves autonomous flight precision. To navigate the drone in the shortest collision-free trajectory, we also build a 3 dimensional A* path planner and implement it into the real flight successfully.</description>

      <title>Worker Robot Cooperation and Integration into the Manufacturing Workcell via the Holonic Control Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Worker-Robot Cooperation is a new industrial trend, which aims to sum the advantages of both the human and the industrial robot to afford a new intelligent manufacturing techniques. The cooperative manufacturing between the worker and the robot contains other elements such as the product parts and the manufacturing tools. All these production elements must cooperate in one manufacturing workcell to fulfill the production requirements. The manufacturing control system is the mean to connect all these cooperative elements together in one body. This manufacturing control system is distributed and autonomous due to the nature of the cooperative workcell. Accordingly, this article proposes the holonic control architecture as the manufacturing concept of the cooperative workcell. Furthermore, the article focuses on the feasibility of this manufacturing concept, by applying it over a case study that involves the cooperation between a dual-arm robot and a worker. During this case study, the worker uses a variety of hand gestures to cooperate with the robot to achieve the highest production flexibility</description>

      <title>Convolutional Bayesian Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian filtering serves as the mainstream framework of state estimation in dynamic systems. Its standard version utilizes total probability rule and Bayes' law alternatively, where how to define and compute conditional probability is critical to state distribution inference. Previously, the conditional probability is assumed to be exactly known, which represents a measure of the occurrence probability of one event, given the second event. In this paper, we find that by adding an additional event that stipulates an inequality condition, we can transform the conditional probability into a special integration that is analogous to convolution. Based on this transformation, we show that both transition probability and output probability can be generalized to convolutional forms, resulting in a more general filtering framework that we call convolutional Bayesian filtering. This new framework encompasses standard Bayesian filtering as a special case when the distance metric of the inequality condition is selected as Dirac delta function. It also allows for a more nuanced consideration of model mismatch by choosing different types of inequality conditions. For instance, when the distance metric is defined in a distributional sense, the transition probability and output probability can be approximated by simply rescaling them into fractional powers. Under this framework, a robust version of Kalman filter can be constructed by only altering the noise covariance matrix, while maintaining the conjugate nature of Gaussian distributions. Finally, we exemplify the effectiveness of our approach by reshaping classic filtering algorithms into convolutional versions, including Kalman filter, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter and particle filter.</description>

      <title>Creating synthetic energy meter data using conditional diffusion and building metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in machine learning and increased computational power have driven progress in energy-related research. However, limited access to private energy data from buildings hinders traditional regression models relying on historical data. While generative models offer a solution, previous studies have primarily focused on short-term generation periods (e.g., daily profiles) and a limited number of meters. Thus, the study proposes a conditional diffusion model for generating high-quality synthetic energy data using relevant metadata. Using a dataset comprising 1,828 power meters from various buildings and countries, this model is compared with traditional methods like Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN) and Conditional Variational Auto-Encoders (CVAE). It explicitly handles long-term annual consumption profiles, harnessing metadata such as location, weather, building, and meter type to produce coherent synthetic data that closely resembles real-world energy consumption patterns. The results demonstrate the proposed diffusion model's superior performance, with a 36% reduction in Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score and a 13% decrease in Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence) compared to the following best method. The proposed method successfully generates high-quality energy data through metadata, and its code will be open-sourced, establishing a foundation for a broader array of energy data generation models in the future.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Transfer Policies for Parallel Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of load balancing in parallel queues by transferring customers between them at discrete points in time. Holding costs accrue as customers wait in the queue, while transfer decisions incur both fixed (setup) and variable costs proportional to the number and direction of transfers. Our work is primarily motivated by inter-facility patient transfers between hospitals during a surge in demand for hospitalization (e.g., during a pandemic). By analyzing an associated fluid control problem, we show that under fairly general assumptions including time-varying arrivals and convex increasing holding costs, the optimal policy in each period partitions the state-space into a well-defined $\textit{no-transfer region}$ and its complement, such that transferring is optimal if and only if the system is sufficiently imbalanced. In the absence of fixed transfer costs, an optimal policy moves the state to the no-transfer region's boundary; in contrast, with fixed costs, the state is moved to the no-transfer region's relative interior. We further leverage the fluid control problem to provide insights on the trade-off between holding and transfer costs, emphasizing the importance of preventing excessive idleness when transfers are not feasible in continuous-time. Using simulation experiments, we investigate the performance and robustness of the fluid policy for the stochastic system. In particular, our case study calibrated using data during the pandemic in the Greater Toronto Area demonstrates that transferring patients between hospitals could result in up to 27.7% reduction in total cost with relatively few transfers.</description>

      <title>Stochastic-Robust Planning of Networked Hydrogen-Electrical Microgrids: A Study on Induced Refueling Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-electrical (HE) microgrids are increasingly assuming an important role on the pathway toward decarbonization of energy and transportation systems. This paper studies networked HE microgrids planning (NHEMP), considering a critical but often-overlooked issue, i.e., the demand-inducing effect (DIE) associated with infrastructure development decisions. Specifically, higher refueling capacities will attract more refueling demand of hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs). To capture such interactions between investment decisions and induced refueling demand, we introduce a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set and build a trilevel stochastic-robust formulation. The upper-level determines optimal investment strategies for HE microgrids, the lower-level optimizes the risk-aware operation schedules across a series of stochastic scenarios, and, for each scenario, the middle-level identifies the "worst" situation of refueling demand within an individual DDU set to ensure economic feasibility. Then, an adaptive and exact decomposition algorithm, based on Parametric Column-and-Constraint Generation (PC&amp;CG), is customized and developed to address the computational challenge and to quantitatively analyze the impact of DIE. Case studies on an IEEE exemplary system validate the effectiveness of the proposed NHEMP model and the PC&amp;CG algorithm. It is worth highlighting that DIE can make an important contribution to the economic benefits of NHEMP, yet its significance will gradually decrease when the main bottleneck transits to other system restrictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scenario approach for solving chance-constrained optimization in time-coupled dynamic environments. Scenario generation methods approximate the true feasible region from scenarios generated independently and identically from the actual distribution. In this paper, we consider this problem in a dynamic environment, where the scenarios are assumed to be drawn sequentially from an unknown and time-varying distribution. Such dynamic environments are driven by changing environmental conditions that could be found in many real-world applications such as energy systems. We couple the time-varying distributions using the Wasserstein metric between the sequence of scenario-generating distributions and the actual chance-constrained distribution. Our main results are bounds on the number of samples essential for ensuring the ex-post risk in chance-constrained optimization problems when the underlying feasible set is convex or non-convex. Finally, our results are illustrated on multiple numerical experiments for both types of feasible sets.</description>

Abstract: Mine fleet management algorithms can significantly reduce operational costs and enhance productivity in mining systems. Most current fleet management algorithms are evaluated based on self-implemented or proprietary simulation environments, posing challenges for replication and comparison. This paper models the simulation environment for mine fleet management from a complex systems perspective. Building upon previous work, we introduce probabilistic, user-defined events for random event simulation and implement various evaluation metrics and baselines, effectively reflecting the robustness of fleet management algorithms against unforeseen incidents. We present ``OpenMines'', an open-source framework encompassing the entire process of mine system modeling, algorithm development, and evaluation, facilitating future algorithm comparison and replication in the field.

      <title>Smooth Information Gathering in Two-Player Noncooperative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for modeling two-player noncooperative games in which one player (the defender) is uncertain of the costs of the game and the second player's (the attacker's) intention but can preemptively allocate information-gathering resources to reduce this uncertainty. We obtain the defender's decisions by solving a two-stage problem. In Stage 1, the defender allocates information-gathering resources, and in Stage 2, the information-gathering resources output a signal that informs the defender about the costs of the game and the attacker's intent, and then both players play a noncooperative game. We provide a gradient-based algorithm to solve the two-stage game and apply this framework to a tower-defense game which can be interpreted as a variant of a Colonel Blotto game with smooth payoff functions and uncertainty over battlefield valuations. Finally, we analyze how optimal decisions shift with changes in information-gathering allocations and perturbations in the cost functions.</description>

Abstract: As a digital environment of interconnected virtual ecosystems driven by measured and synthesized data, the Metaverse has so far been mostly considered from its gaming perspective that closely aligns with online edutainment. Although it is still in its infancy and more research as well as standardization efforts remain to be done, the Metaverse could provide considerable advantages for smart robotized applications in the industry.Workflow efficiency, collective decision enrichment even for executives, as well as a natural, resilient, and sustainable robotized assistance for the workforce are potential advantages. Hence, the Metaverse could consolidate the connection between Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0. This paper identifies and puts forward potential advantages of the Metaverse for robotized applications and highlights how these advantages support goals pursued by the Industry 4.0 and Industry 5.0 visions.</description>

      <title>Metarobotics for Industry and Society: Vision, Technologies, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metarobotics aims to combine next generation wireless communication, multi-sense immersion, and collective intelligence to provide a pervasive, itinerant, and non-invasive access and interaction with distant robotized applications. Industry and society are expected to benefit from these functionalities. For instance, robot programmers will no longer travel worldwide to plan and test robot motions, even collaboratively. Instead, they will have a personalized access to robots and their environments from anywhere, thus spending more time with family and friends. Students enrolled in robotics courses will be taught under authentic industrial conditions in real-time. This paper describes objectives of Metarobotics in society, industry, and in-between. It identifies and surveys technologies likely to enable their completion and provides an architecture to put forward the interplay of key components of Metarobotics. Potentials for self-determination, self-efficacy, and work-life-flexibility in robotics-related applications in Society 5.0, Industry 4.0, and Industry 5.0 are outlined.</description>

      <title>Imposing Exact Safety Specifications in Neural Reachable Tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a verification tool that provides safety and performance guarantees for autonomous systems. It is widely adopted because of its ability to handle nonlinear dynamical systems with bounded adversarial disturbances and constraints on states and inputs. However, it involves solving a PDE to compute a safety value function, whose computational and memory complexity scales exponentially with the state dimension, making its direct usage in large-scale systems intractable. Recently, a learning-based approach called DeepReach, has been proposed to approximate high-dimensional reachable tubes using neural networks. While DeepReach has been shown to be effective, the accuracy of the learned solution decreases with the increase in system complexity. One of the reasons for this degradation is the inexact imposition of safety constraints during the learning process, which corresponds to the PDE's boundary conditions. Specifically, DeepReach imposes boundary conditions as soft constraints in the loss function, which leaves room for error during the value function learning. Moreover, one needs to carefully adjust the relative contributions from the imposition of boundary conditions and the imposition of the PDE in the loss function. This, in turn, induces errors in the overall learned solution. In this work, we propose a variant of DeepReach that exactly imposes safety constraints during the learning process by restructuring the overall value function as a weighted sum of the boundary condition and neural network output. This eliminates the need for a boundary loss during training, thus bypassing the need for loss adjustment. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in significantly improving the accuracy of learned solutions for challenging high-dimensional reachability tasks, such as rocket-landing and multivehicle collision-avoidance problems.</description>

      <title>A Center-of-Mass Shifting Aerial Manipulation Platform for Heavy-Tool Handling on Non-Horizontal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aerial vehicles equipped with manipulators can serve contact-based industrial applications, where fundamental tasks like drilling and grinding often necessitate aerial platforms to handle heavy tools. Industrial environments often involve non-horizontal surfaces. Existing aerial manipulation platforms based on multirotors typically feature a fixed CoM (Center of Mass) within the rotor-defined area, leading to a considerable moment arm between the EE (End-Effector) tip and the CoM for operations on such surfaces. Carrying heavy tools at the EE tip of the manipulator with an extended moment arm can lead to system instability and potential damage to the servo actuators used in the manipulator. To tackle this issue, we present a novel aerial vehicle tailored for handling heavy tools on non-horizontal surfaces. In this work, we provide the platform's system design, modeling, and control strategies. This platform can carry heavy manipulators within the rotor-defined area during free flight. During interactions, the manipulator can shift towards the work surface outside the rotor-defined area, resulting in a displaced CoM location with a significantly shorter moment arm. Furthermore, we propose a method for automatically determining the manipulator's position to reach the maximum CoM displacement towards the work surface. Our proposed concepts are validated through simulations that closely capture the developed physical prototype of the platform.</description>

      <title>Multiple Joint Chance Constraints Approximation for Uncertainty Modeling in Dispatch Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty modeling has become increasingly important in power system decision-making. The widely-used tractable uncertainty modeling method-chance constraints with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) approximation, can be overconservative and even turn an originally feasible problem into an infeasible one. This paper proposes a new approximation method for multiple joint chance constraints (JCCs) to model the uncertainty in dispatch problems, which solves the conservativeness and potential infeasibility concerns of CVaR. The proposed method is also convenient for controlling the risk levels of different JCCs, which is necessary for power system applications since different resources may be affected by varying degrees of uncertainty or have different importance to the system. We then formulate a data-driven distributionally robust chance-constrained programming model for the power system multiperiod dispatch problem and leverage the proposed approximation method to solve it. In the numerical simulations, two small general examples clearly demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method, and the results of the multiperiod dispatch problem on IEEE test cases verify its practicality.</description>

      <title>Gradient Methods for Scalable Multi-value Electricity Network Expansion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-value expansion planning (MEP), a general bilevel optimization model in which a planner optimizes arbitrary functions of the dispatch outcome in the presence of a partially controllable, competitive electricity market. The MEP problem can be used to jointly plan various grid assets, such as transmission, generation, and battery storage capacities; examples include identifying grid investments that minimize emissions in the absence of a carbon tax, maximizing the profit of a portfolio of renewable investments and long-term energy contracts, or reducing price inequities between different grid stakeholders. The MEP problem, however, is in general nonconvex, making it difficult to solve exactly for large real-world systems. Therefore, we propose a fast stochastic implicit gradient-based heuristic method that scales well to large networks with many scenarios. We use a strong duality reformulation and the McCormick envelope to provide a lower bound on the performance of our algorithm via convex relaxation. We test the performance of our method on a large model of the U.S. Western Interconnect and demonstrate that it scales linearly with network size and number of scenarios and can be efficiently parallelized on large machines. We find that for medium-sized 16 hour cases, gradient descent on average finds a 5.3x lower objective value in 16.5x less time compared to a traditional reformulation-based approach solved with an interior point method. We conclude with a large example in which we jointly plan transmission, generation, and storage for a 768 hour case on 100 node system, showing that emissions penalization leads to additional 40.0% reduction in carbon intensity at an additional cost of $17.1/MWh.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Optimization in Spatially Distributed Electrical Vehicle Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a spatially distributed demand for electrical vehicle recharging, that must be covered by a fixed set of charging stations. Arriving EVs receive feedback on transport times to each station, and waiting times at congested ones, based on which they make a selfish selection. This selection determines total arrival rates in station queues, which are represented by a fluid state; departure rates are modeled under the assumption that clients have a given sojourn time in the system. The resulting differential equation system is analyzed with tools of optimization. We characterize the equilibrium as the solution to a specific convex program, which has connections to optimal transport problems, and also with road traffic theory. In particular a price of anarchy appears with respect to a social planner's allocation. From a dynamical perspective, global convergence to equilibrium is established, with tools of Lagrange duality and Lyapunov theory. An extension of the model that makes customer demand elastic to observed delays is also presented, and analyzed with extensions of the optimization machinery. Simulations to illustrate the global behavior are presented, which also help validate the model beyond the fluid approximation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Behavior of Inter-Event Times in Planar Systems under Event-Triggered Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02090v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the asymptotic behavior of inter-event times in planar linear systems, under event-triggered control with a general class of scale-invariant event triggering rules. In this setting, the inter-event time is a function of the angle of the state at an event. This viewpoint allows us to analyze the inter-event times by studying the fixed points of the angle map, which represents the evolution of the angle of the state from one event to the next. We provide a sufficient condition for the convergence or non-convergence of inter-event times to a steady state value under a scale-invariant event-triggering rule. Following up on this, we further analyze the inter-event time behavior in the special case of threshold based event-triggering rule and we provide various conditions for convergence or non-convergence of inter-event times to a constant. We also analyze the asymptotic average inter-event time as a function of the angle of the initial state of the system. With the help of ergodic theory, we provide a sufficient condition for the asymptotic average inter-event time to be a constant for all non-zero initial states of the system. Then, we consider a special case where the angle map is an orientation-preserving homeomorphism. Using rotation theory, we comment on the asymptotic behavior of the inter-event times, including on whether the inter-event times converge to a periodic sequence. We illustrate the proposed results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>DANSE: Data-driven Non-linear State Estimation of Model-free Process in Unsupervised Learning Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet. In addition, we show that DANSE works for high-dimensional state estimation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Co-design of Storage and Control for Water Distribution Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Water distribution systems (WDSs) are typically designed with a conservative estimate of the ability of a control system to utilize the available infrastructure. The controller is designed and tuned after a WDS has been laid out, a methodology that may introduce unnecessary conservativeness in both system design and control, adversely impacting operational efficiency and increasing economic costs. To address these limitations, we introduce a method to simultaneously design infrastructure and develop control parameters, the co-design problem, with the aim of improving the overall efficiency of the system. Nevertheless, the co-design of a WDS is a challenging task given the presence of stochastic variables (e.g. water demands and electricity prices). In this paper, we propose a tractable stochastic co-design method to design the best tank size and optimal control parameters for WDS, where the expected operating costs are established based on Markov chain theory. We also give a theoretical result showing that the average long-run operating cost converges to the expected operating cost with probability~1. Furthermore, this method is not only applicable to greenfield projects for the co-design of WDSs but can also be utilized to improve the operations of existing WDSs in brownfield projects. The effectiveness and applicability of the co-design method are validated through three illustrative examples and a real-world case study in South Australia.</description>

Abstract: Markov chain-based modeling and Koopman operator-based modeling are two popular frameworks for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems. They share notable similarities from a computational and practitioner's perspective, especially for modeling autonomous systems. The first part of this paper aims to elucidate these similarities. For modeling systems with control inputs, the models produced by the two approaches differ. The second part of this paper introduces these models and their corresponding control design methods. We illustrate the two approaches and compare them in terms of model accuracy and computational efficiency for both autonomous and controlled systems in numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Transmission-level Fault Impacts on 3-phase and 1-phase Distribution IBR Operation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of inverter-based resources (IBRs) renders distribution systems susceptible to transmission-level faults. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of transmission-level faults on 3-phase and 1-phase distribution IBR operation. To evaluate distributed IBR tripping across various phases and locations on a distribution feeder, we conduct simulations of both symmetrical and unsymmetrical transmission faults at progressively greater electrical distances on a real-time transmission and distribution (T&amp;D) co-simulation platform. The IBR power-to-load ratios (PLRs) at 50%, 100%, and 300% are considered to emulate low, medium, and high IBR conditions. Our results indicate that, while 1-phase and 2-phase faults typically trigger fewer IBR trips when compared to 3-phase faults, a significant power imbalance arises from the tripping of 1-phase IBRs on the affected phases. The imbalance can result in significant power quality problems and unintended equipment tripping. It may be necessary to design fault-ride-through mechanisms specifically tailored to 1-phase IBRs to help mitigate the power imbalances caused by unbalanced faults.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Error Compensation for Reinforcement Learning with Quadratic Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The selection of a reward function in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has garnered significant attention because of its impact on system performance. Issues of significant steady-state errors often manifest when quadratic reward functions are employed. Although absolute-value-type reward functions alleviate this problem, they tend to induce substantial fluctuations in specific system states, leading to abrupt changes. In response to this challenge, this study proposes an approach that introduces an integral term. By integrating this integral term into quadratic-type reward functions, the RL algorithm is adeptly tuned, augmenting the system's consideration of reward history, and consequently alleviates concerns related to steady-state errors. Through experiments and performance evaluations on the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and lane change models, we validate that the proposed method effectively diminishes steady-state errors and does not cause significant spikes in some system states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), in particular high altitude platform stations (HAPS), with terrestrial networks, referred to as vHetNets, emerges as a promising future wireless network architecture for providing ubiquitous connectivity. In this context, optimizing the performance of vHetNets has become a paramount concern, particularly in harmonized spectrum vHetNets, where HAPS and terrestrial networks share the same frequency band, resulting in severe inter-/intra-tier interference. This paper provides a comparative analysis of different objective functions, specifically focusing on weighted sum rate (WSR), network-wide proportional fairness (NW-PF), and network-wide max-min fairness (NW-MMF), with an aim to design a joint user association scheme and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming weights in a vHetNet, operating in an urban area.

      <title>ANOCA: AC Network-aware Optimal Curtailment Approach for Dynamic Hosting Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With exponential growth in distributed energy resources (DERs) coupled with at-capacity distribution grid infrastructure, prosumers cannot always export all extra power to the grid without violating technical limits. Consequently, a slew of dynamic hosting capacity (DHC) algorithms have emerged for optimal utilization of grid infrastructure while maximizing export from DERs. Most of these DHC algorithms utilize the concept of operating envelopes (OE), where the utility gives prosumers technical power export limits, and they are free to export power within these limits. Recent studies have shown that OE-based frameworks have drawbacks, as most develop power export limits based on convex or linear grid models. As OEs must capture extreme operating conditions, both convex and linear models can violate technical limits in practice because they approximate grid physics. However, AC models are unsuitable because they may not be feasible within the whole region of OE. We propose a new two-stage optimization framework for DHC built on three-phase AC models to address the current gaps. In this approach, the prosumers first run a receding horizon multi-period optimization to identify optimal export power setpoints to communicate with the utility. The utility then performs an infeasibility-based optimization to either accept the prosumer's request or dispatch an optimal curtail signal such that overall system technical constraints are not violated. To explore various curtailment strategies, we develop an L1, L2, and Linf norm-based dispatch algorithm with an exact three-phase AC model. We test our framework on a 1420 three-phase node meshed distribution network and show that the proposed algorithm optimally curtails DERs while guaranteeing the AC feasibility of the network.</description>

      <title>Event Concealment and Concealability Enforcement in Discrete Event Systems Under Partial Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.03170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by privacy problems where the behavior of a system should not be revealed to an external curious observer, we investigate event concealment and concealability enforcement in discrete event systems modeled as non-deterministic finite automata under partial observation. Given a subset of secret events in a given system, concealability holds if the occurrence of all secret events remains hidden to a curious observer (an eavesdropper). A secret event is said to be (at least under some executions) unconcealable (inferable) if its occurrence can be indirectly determined with certainty after a finite number of observations. When concealability of a system does not hold (i.e., one or more secret events are unconcealable), we analyze how a defender, placed at the interface of the system with the eavesdropper, can be used to enforce concealability. The defender takes as input each observed event of the system and outputs a carefully modified event sequence (seen by the eavesdropper) using event deletion, insertion, or replacement. The defender is said to be C-enforceable if, following the occurrence of the secret events and regardless of subsequent activity generated by the system, it can always deploy a strategy to manipulate observations and conceal the events perpetually. We discuss systematic procedures to detect the presence of unconcealable secret events and verify C-Enforceability using techniques from state estimation and event diagnosis. We also propose a polynomial complexity construction for obtaining one necessary and one sufficient condition for C-Enforceability.</description>

      <title>Embed to Control Partially Observed Systems: Representation Learning with Provable Sample Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observed Markov decision processes (POMDPs) faces two challenges. (i) It often takes the full history to predict the future, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the horizon. (ii) The observation and state spaces are often continuous, which induces a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the extrinsic dimension. Addressing such challenges requires learning a minimal but sufficient representation of the observation and state histories by exploiting the structure of the POMDP.
  To this end, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm named Embed to Control (ETC), which learns the representation at two levels while optimizing the policy.~(i) For each step, ETC learns to represent the state with a low-dimensional feature, which factorizes the transition kernel. (ii) Across multiple steps, ETC learns to represent the full history with a low-dimensional embedding, which assembles the per-step feature. We integrate (i) and (ii) in a unified framework that allows a variety of estimators (including maximum likelihood estimators and generative adversarial networks). For a class of POMDPs with a low-rank structure in the transition kernel, ETC attains an $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity that scales polynomially with the horizon and the intrinsic dimension (that is, the rank). Here $\epsilon$ is the optimality gap. To our best knowledge, ETC is the first sample-efficient algorithm that bridges representation learning and policy optimization in POMDPs with infinite observation and state spaces.</description>

      <title>Towards a Multimodal Charging Network: Joint Planning of Charging Stations and Battery Swapping Stations for Electrified Ride-Hailing Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a multimodal charging network in which charging stations and battery swapping stations are jointly built to support an electric ride-hailing fleet synergistically. Our argument is based on the observation that charging an EV is a time-consuming burden, and battery swapping faces scaling issues due to its deployment costs. However, charging stations are cost-effective, making them ideal for scaling up EV fleets, while battery swapping stations offer quick turnaround and can be deployed in tandem with charging stations to improve fleet utilization and reduce operational costs. To fulfill this vision, we consider a ride-hailing platform that jointly builds charging and battery swapping stations to support an EV fleet. An optimization model is proposed to capture the platform's planning and operational decisions. In particular, the model incorporates essential components such as elastic passenger demand, spatial charging equilibrium, charging and swapping congestion, etc. The overall problem is formulated as a nonconcave program. Instead of pursuing the globally optimal solution, we establish a tight upper bound through relaxation and decomposition, allowing us to evaluate the solution optimality even in the absence of concavity. Through case studies for Manhattan, New York City, we find that joint planning of charging and battery swapping stations outperforms deploying only one of them, yielding a total profit that is 11.7% higher than swapping-only deployment under a limited budget, and 17.5% higher than charging-only deployment under a sufficient budget. These results underscore the complementary benefit between charging and battery swapping facilities.</description>

      <title>Information Theoretically Optimal Sample Complexity of Learning Dynamical Directed Acyclic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, the optimal sample complexity of learning the underlying interactions or dependencies of a Linear Dynamical System (LDS) over a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is studied. We call such a DAG underlying an LDS as dynamical DAG (DDAG). In particular, we consider a DDAG where the nodal dynamics are driven by unobserved exogenous noise sources that are wide-sense stationary (WSS) in time but are mutually uncorrelated, and have the same {power spectral density (PSD)}. Inspired by the static DAG setting, a metric and an algorithm based on the PSD matrix of the observed time series are proposed to reconstruct the DDAG. It is shown that the optimal sample complexity (or length of state trajectory) needed to learn the DDAG is $n=\Theta(q\log(p/q))$, where $p$ is the number of nodes and $q$ is the maximum number of parents per node. To prove the sample complexity upper bound, a concentration bound for the PSD estimation is derived, under two different sampling strategies. A matching min-max lower bound using generalized Fano's inequality also is provided, thus showing the order optimality of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>MLP Based Continuous Gait Recognition of a Powered Ankle Prosthesis with Serial Elastic Actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Powered ankle prostheses effectively assist people with lower limb amputation to perform daily activities. High performance prostheses with adjustable compliance and capability to predict and implement amputee's intent are crucial for them to be comparable to or better than a real limb. However, current designs fail to provide simple yet effective compliance of the joint with full potential of modification, and lack accurate gait prediction method in real time. This paper proposes an innovative design of powered ankle prosthesis with serial elastic actuator (SEA), and puts forward a MLP based gait recognition method that can accurately and continuously predict more gait parameters for motion sensing and control. The prosthesis mimics biological joint with similar weight, torque, and power which can assist walking of up to 4 m/s. A new design of planar torsional spring is proposed for the SEA, which has better stiffness, endurance, and potential of modification than current designs. The gait recognition system simultaneously generates locomotive speed, gait phase, ankle angle and angular velocity only utilizing signals of single IMU, holding advantage in continuity, adaptability for speed range, accuracy, and capability of multi-functions.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-Guaranteed Safety-Critical Control with Applications to Heterogeneous Platoons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00238v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies safety and feasibility guarantees for systems with tight control bounds. It has been shown that stabilizing an affine control system while optimizing a quadratic cost and satisfying state and control constraints can be mapped to a sequence of Quadratic Programs (QPs) using Control Barrier Functions (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLF). One of the main challenges in this method is that the QP could easily become infeasible under safety constraints of high relative degree, especially under tight control bounds. Recent work focused on deriving sufficient conditions for guaranteeing feasibility. The existing results are case-dependent. In this paper, we consider the general case. We define a feasibility constraint and propose a new type of CBF to enforce it. Our method guarantees the feasibility of the above mentioned QPs, while satisfying safety requirements. We demonstrate the proposed method on an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) problem for a heterogeneous platoon with tight control bounds, and compare our method to existing CBF-CLF approaches. The results show that our proposed approach can generate gradually transitioned control (without abrupt changes) with guaranteed feasibility and safety.</description>

      <title>A minimax optimal control approach for robust neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17584v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the adversarial training of neural ODEs from a robust control perspective. This is an alternative to the classical training via empirical risk minimization, and it is widely used to enforce reliable outcomes for input perturbations. Neural ODEs allow the interpretation of deep neural networks as discretizations of control systems, unlocking powerful tools from control theory for the development and the understanding of machine learning. In this specific case, we formulate the adversarial training with perturbed data as a minimax optimal control problem, for which we derive first order optimality conditions in the form of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We provide a novel interpretation of robust training leading to an alternative weighted technique, which we test on a low-dimensional classification task.</description>

      <title>EVORA: Deep Evidential Traversability Learning for Risk-Aware Off-Road Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traversing terrain with good traction is crucial for achieving fast off-road navigation. Instead of manually designing costs based on terrain features, existing methods learn terrain properties directly from data via self-supervision to automatically penalize trajectories moving through undesirable terrain, but challenges remain to properly quantify and mitigate the risk due to uncertainty in learned models. To this end, this work proposes a unified framework to learn uncertainty-aware traction model and plan risk-aware trajectories. For uncertainty quantification, we efficiently model both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by learning discrete traction distributions and probability densities of the traction predictor's latent features. Leveraging evidential deep learning, we parameterize Dirichlet distributions with the network outputs and propose a novel uncertainty-aware squared Earth Mover's distance loss with a closed-form expression that improves learning accuracy and navigation performance. For risk-aware navigation, the proposed planner simulates state trajectories with the worst-case expected traction to handle aleatoric uncertainty, and penalizes trajectories moving through terrain with high epistemic uncertainty. Our approach is extensively validated in simulation and on wheeled and quadruped robots, showing improved navigation performance compared to methods that assume no slip, assume the expected traction, or optimize for the worst-case expected cost.</description>

      <title>DiffTune-MPC: Closed-Loop Learning for Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has been applied to many platforms in robotics and autonomous systems for its capability to predict a system's future behavior while incorporating constraints that a system may have. To enhance the performance of a system with an MPC controller, one can manually tune the MPC's cost function. However, it can be challenging due to the possibly high dimension of the parameter space as well as the potential difference between the open-loop cost function in MPC and the overall closed-loop performance metric function. This paper presents DiffTune-MPC, a novel learning method, to learn the cost function of an MPC in a closed-loop manner. The proposed framework is compatible with the scenario where the time interval for performance evaluation and MPC's planning horizon have different lengths. We show the auxiliary problem whose solution admits the analytical gradients of MPC and discuss its variations in different MPC settings, including nonlinear MPCs that are solved using sequential quadratic programming. Simulation results demonstrate the learning capability of DiffTune-MPC and the generalization capability of the learned MPC parameters.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin of Autonomous Surface Vessels for Safe Maritime Navigation Enabled through Predictive Modeling and Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) play an increasingly important role in the safety and sustainability of open sea operations. Since most maritime accidents are related to human failure, intelligent algorithms for autonomous collision avoidance and path following can drastically reduce the risk in the maritime sector. A DT is a virtual representative of a real physical system and can enhance the situational awareness (SITAW) of such an ASV to generate optimal decisions. This work builds on an existing DT framework for ASVs and demonstrates foundations for enabling predictive, prescriptive, and autonomous capabilities. In this context, sophisticated target tracking approaches are crucial for estimating and predicting the position and motion of other dynamic objects. The applied tracking method is enabled by real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data and synthetic light detection and ranging (Lidar) measurements. To guarantee safety during autonomous operations, we applied a predictive safety filter, based on the concept of nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The approaches are implemented into a DT built with the Unity game engine. As a result, this work demonstrates the potential of a DT capable of making predictions, playing through various what-if scenarios, and providing optimal control decisions according to its enhanced SITAW.</description>

      <title>Discretionary Lane-Change Decision and Control via Parameterized Soft Actor-Critic for Hybrid Action Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on a crucial task in the field of autonomous driving, autonomous lane change. Autonomous lane change plays a pivotal role in improving traffic flow, alleviating driver burden, and reducing the risk of traffic accidents. However, due to the complexity and uncertainty of lane-change scenarios, the functionality of autonomous lane change still faces challenges. In this research, we conducted autonomous lane-change simulations using both deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and model predictive control (MPC). Specifically, we used the parameterized soft actor--critic (PASAC) algorithm to train a DRL-based lane-change strategy to output both discrete lane-change decisions and continuous longitudinal vehicle acceleration. We also used MPC for lane selection based on the smallest predictive car-following costs for the different lanes. For the first time, we compared the performance of DRL and MPC in the context of lane-change decisions. The simulation results indicated that, under the same reward/cost function and traffic flow, both MPC and PASAC achieved a collision rate of 0%. PASAC demonstrated a comparable performance to MPC in terms of average rewards/costs and vehicle speeds.</description>

      <title>Chattering Phenomena in Time-Optimal Control for High-Order Chain-of-Integrators Systems with Full State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-optimal control for high-order chain-of-integrators systems with full state constraints remains an open and challenging problem in the optimal control theory domain. The behaviors of optimal control in high-order problems lack precision characterization, even where the existence of the chattering phenomenon remains unknown and overlooked. This paper establishes a theoretical framework for chattering phenomena in the considered problem, providing novel findings on the uniqueness of state constraints inducing chattering, the upper bound on switching times in an unconstrained arc during chattering, and the convergence of states and costates to the chattering limit point. For the first time, this paper proves the existence of the chattering phenomenon in the considered problem. The chattering optimal control for 4th order problems with velocity constraints is precisely solved, providing an approach to plan strictly time-optimal snap-limited trajectories. Other cases of order $n\leq4$ are proved not to allow chattering. The conclusions correct the longstanding misconception in the industry regarding the time-optimality of S-shaped trajectories with minimal switching times.</description>

      <title>HyRRT-Connect: A Bidirectional Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees Motion Planning Algorithm for Hybrid Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a bidirectional rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm to solve the motion planning problem for hybrid systems. The proposed algorithm, called HyRRT-Connect, propagates in both forward and backward directions in hybrid time until an overlap between the forward and backward propagation results is detected. Then, HyRRT-Connect constructs a motion plan through the reversal and concatenation of functions defined on hybrid time domains, ensuring the motion plan thoroughly satisfies the given hybrid dynamics. To address the potential discontinuity along the flow caused by tolerating some distance between the forward and backward partial motion plans, we reconstruct the backward partial motion plan by a forward-in-hybrid-time simulation from the final state of the forward partial motion plan. By applying the reversed input of the backward partial motion plan, the reconstruction process effectively eliminates the discontinuity and ensures that as the tolerance distance decreases to zero, the distance between the endpoint of the reconstructed motion plan and the final state set approaches zero. The proposed algorithm is applied to an actuated bouncing ball example and a walking robot example so as to highlight its generality and computational improvement.</description>

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in solving relatively complex tasks, yet the deployment of RL systems in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges related to safety and robustness. This paper aims to identify and further understand those challenges thorough the exploration of the main dimensions of the safe and robust RL landscape, encompassing algorithmic, ethical, and practical considerations. We conduct a comprehensive review of methodologies and open problems that summarizes the efforts in recent years to address the inherent risks associated with RL applications.
  After discussing and proposing definitions for both safe and robust RL, the paper categorizes existing research works into different algorithmic approaches that enhance the safety and robustness of RL agents. We examine techniques such as uncertainty estimation, optimisation methodologies, exploration-exploitation trade-offs, and adversarial training. Environmental factors, including sim-to-real transfer and domain adaptation, are also scrutinized to understand how RL systems can adapt to diverse and dynamic surroundings. Moreover, human involvement is an integral ingredient of the analysis, acknowledging the broad set of roles that humans can take in this context.
  Importantly, to aid practitioners in navigating the complexities of safe and robust RL implementation, this paper introduces a practical checklist derived from the synthesized literature. The checklist encompasses critical aspects of algorithm design, training environment considerations, and ethical guidelines. It will serve as a resource for developers and policymakers alike to ensure the responsible deployment of RL systems in many application domains.</description>
