      <title>PHANTOM: Physics-Aware Adversarial Attacks against Federated Learning-Coordinated EV Charging Management System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) within distribution networks necessitates intelligent and adaptive control to maintain the grid's resilience and reliability. In this work, we propose PHANTOM, a physics-aware adversarial network that is trained and optimized through a multi-agent reinforcement learning model. PHANTOM integrates a physics-informed neural network (PINN) enabled by federated learning (FL) that functions as a digital twin of EVCS-integrated systems, ensuring physically consistent modeling of operational dynamics and constraints. Building on this digital twin, we construct a multi-agent RL environment that utilizes deep Q-networks (DQN) and soft actor-critic (SAC) methods to derive adversarial false data injection (FDI) strategies capable of bypassing conventional detection mechanisms. To examine the broader grid-level consequences, a transmission and distribution (T and D) dual simulation platform is developed, allowing us to capture cascading interactions between EVCS disturbances at the distribution level and the operations of the bulk transmission system. Results demonstrate how learned attack policies disrupt load balancing and induce voltage instabilities that propagate across T and D boundaries. These findings highlight the critical need for physics-aware cybersecurity to ensure the resilience of large-scale vehicle-grid integration.</description>

      <title>Protonic Nickelate Device Networks for Spatiotemporal Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computation in biological neural circuits arises from the interplay of nonlinear temporal responses and spatially distributed dynamic network interactions. Replicating this richness in hardware has remained challenging, as most neuromorphic devices emulate only isolated neuron- or synapse-like functions. In this work, we introduce an integrated neuromorphic computing platform in which both nonlinear spatiotemporal processing and programmable memory are realized within a single perovskite nickelate material system. By engineering symmetric and asymmetric hydrogenated NdNiO3 junction devices on the same wafer, we combine ultrafast, proton-mediated transient dynamics with stable multilevel resistance states. Networks of symmetric NdNiO3 junctions exhibit emergent spatial interactions mediated by proton redistribution, while each node simultaneously provides short-term temporal memory, enabling nanoseconds scale operation with an energy cost of 0.2 nJ per input. When interfaced with asymmetric output units serving as reconfigurable long-term weights, these networks allow both feature transformation and linear classification in the same material system. Leveraging these emergent interactions, the platform enables real-time pattern recognition and achieves high accuracy in spoken-digit classification and early seizure detection, outperforming temporal-only or uncoupled architectures. These results position protonic nickelates as a compact, energy-efficient, CMOS-compatible platform that integrates processing and memory for scalable intelligent hardware.</description>

      <title>Relaxation-based dynamical Ising machines for discrete tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical Ising machines are continuous dynamical systems that evolve from a generic initial state to a state strongly related to the ground state of the classical Ising model. We show that such a machine driven by the V${}_2$ dynamical model can solve exactly discrete tomography problems about reconstructing a binary image from the pixel sums along a discrete set of rays. In contrast to usual applications of Ising machines, targeting approximate solutions to optimization problems, the randomly initialized V${}_2$ model converges with high probability ($P_{\mathrm{succ}} \approx 1$) to an image precisely satisfying the tomographic data. For the problems with at most two rays intersecting at each pixel, the V${}_2$ model converges in internal machine time that depends only weakly on the image size. Our consideration is an example of how specific dynamical systems can produce exact solutions to highly non-trivial data processing tasks. Crucially, this solving capability arises from the dynamical features of the V${}_2$ model itself, in particular its equations of motion that enable non-local transitions of the discrete component of the relaxed spin beyond Hamming-neighborhood constraints, rather than from merely recasting the tomography problem in spin form.</description>

      <title>LIMO: Low-Power In-Memory-Annealer and Matrix-Multiplication Primitive for Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) underpins applications in science and engineering, ranging from logistics to electronic design automation. A classic example is the NP-complete Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Finding exact solutions for large-scale TSP instances remains computationally intractable; on von Neumann architectures, such solvers are constrained by the memory wall, incurring compute-memory traffic that grows with instance size. Metaheuristics, such as simulated annealing implemented on compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures, offer a way to mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck. This is accomplished by performing in-memory optimization cycles to rapidly find approximate solutions for TSP instances. Yet this approach suffers from degrading solution quality as instance size increases, owing to inefficient state-space exploration. To address this, we present LIMO, a mixed-signal computational macro that implements an in-memory annealing algorithm with reduced search-space complexity. The annealing process is aided by the stochastic switching of spin-transfer-torque magnetic-tunnel-junctions (STT-MTJs) to escape local minima. For large instances, our macro co-design is complemented by a refinement-based divide-and-conquer algorithm amenable to parallel optimization in a spatial architecture. Consequently, our system comprising several LIMO macros achieves superior solution quality and faster time-to-solution on instances up to 85,900 cities compared to prior hardware annealers. The modularity of our annealing peripherals allows the LIMO macro to be reused for other applications, such as vector-matrix multiplications (VMMs). This enables our architecture to support neural network inference. As an illustration, we show image classification and face detection with software-comparable accuracy, while achieving lower latency and energy consumption than baseline CiM architectures.</description>

      <title>interID -- An Ecosystem-agnostic Verifier Application for Self-sovereign Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-Sovereign Identity is a transformative paradigm in digital identity management, empowering individuals with full control over their credentials. However, the coexistence of diverse SSI ecosystems, such as the European Digital Identity and the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure, poses significant challenges for cross-ecosystem interoperability due to technological and trust framework differences. This paper introduces \textit{interID}, a modular credential verification application that addresses this fragmentation by orchestrating ecosystem-specific verifier services. Our key contributions include: (1) an ecosystem-agnostic orchestration layer that interfaces with multiple SSI verification services, (2) a unified API that abstracts underlying protocol complexities for service providers, and (3) a practical implementation that bridges three major SSI ecosystems: Hyperledger Indy/Aries, EBSI, and EUDI. Evaluation results demonstrate that interID successfully verifies credentials across all tested wallets with minimal performance overhead, while maintaining a flexible architecture that can be extended to accept credentials from additional SSI ecosystems. This work offers both a technical solution and architectural pattern for achieving interoperability in SSI verifier implementations.</description>

      <title>Joint UAV-UGV Positioning and Trajectory Planning via Meta A3C for Reliable Emergency Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) has been shown to be an effective method to establish communications in areas affected by disasters. However, ensuring good Quality of Services (QoS) while using as few UAVs as possible also requires optimal positioning and trajectory planning for UAVs and UGVs. This paper proposes a joint UAV-UGV-based positioning and trajectory planning framework for UAVs and UGVs deployment that guarantees optimal QoS for ground users. To model the UGVs' mobility, we introduce a road graph, which directs their movement along valid road segments and adheres to the road network constraints. To solve the sum rate optimization problem, we reformulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a novel asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) incorporated with meta-learning for rapid adaptation to new environments and dynamic conditions. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed Meta-A3C approach outperforms A3C and DDPG, delivering 13.1\% higher throughput and 49\% faster execution while meeting the QoS requirements.</description>

      <title>Splitwise: Collaborative Edge-Cloud Inference for LLMs via Lyapunov-Assisted DRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.</description>

      <title>A Domain-specific Language and Architecture for Detecting Process Activities from Sensor Streams in IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems are equipped with a large quantity of sensors providing real-time data about the current operations of their components, which is crucial for the systems' internal control systems and processes. However, these data are often too fine-grained to derive useful insights into the execution of the larger processes an IoT system might be part of. Process mining has developed advanced approaches for the analysis of business processes that may also be used in the context of IoT. Bringing process mining to IoT requires an event abstraction step to lift the low-level sensor data to the business process level. In this work, we aim to enable domain experts to perform this step using a newly developed domain-specific language (DSL) called Radiant. Radiant supports the specification of patterns within the sensor data that indicate the execution of higher level process activities. These patterns are translated to complex event processing (CEP) applications to be used for detecting activity executions at runtime. We propose a corresponding software architecture that enables online event abstraction from IoT sensor streams using the CEP applications. We evaluate these applications to monitor activity executions in smart manufacturing and smart healthcare. These evaluations are useful to inform the domain expert about the quality of activity detections based on the specified patterns and potential for improvement via additional or modified patterns and sensors.</description>
