      <title>Conjugate L-Subgroups of an L-group and their Applications to Normality and Normalizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the notion of the conjugate of an L-subgroup by an L-point has been introduced. Then, several properties of conjugate L-subgroups have been studied analogous to their group-theoretic counterparts. Also, the notion of conjugacy has been investigated in the context of normality of L-subgroups. Furthermore, some important relationships between conjugate L-subgroups and normalizer have also been established. Finally, the normalizer of an L-subgroup of an L-group has been defined by using the notion of conjugate L-subgroups.</description>

      <title>Connections between hyperlinearity, stability and character rigidity for higher rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be an irreducible lattice in a semisimple Lie group of real rank at least $2$. Suppose that $\Gamma$ has property (T;FD), that is, its finite dimensional representations have a uniform spectral gap. We show that if $\Gamma$ is (flexibly) Hilbert--Schmidt stable then: $(a)$ infinite central extensions $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ of $\Gamma$ are not hyperlinear, and $(b)$ every character of $\Gamma$ is either finite-dimensional or induced from the center (character rigidity). As a consequence, a positive answer to the following question would yield an explicit example of a non-hyperlinear group: If two representations of the modular group $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ almost agree on a specific congruence subgroup $H$ under a commensuration, must they be close to representations that genuinely agree on $H$?</description>

      <title>Finite groups with nearly half as many cyclic subgroups as elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose $C(G)$ denotes the set of all cyclic subgroups of a finite group $G$, and $\mathcal{O}_{2}(G)$ denotes the number of elements of order $2$ in $G$. In [Marius T., Finite groups with a certain number of cyclic subgroups. The American Mathematical Monthly 122.3 (2015): 275-276], an open problem was asked to classify the groups $G$ with $|C(G)|=|G|-r$, where $2 \leq r \leq |G|-1$. In this article, first we show that there are infinitely many groups $G$ with $|C(G)|=\frac{|G|}{p}$ for any prime $p$, or $|C(G)|=\frac{|G|}{2}+2^k, k\geq 0$. Then, we give a connection between $|C(G)|$ and $\mathcal{O}_{2}(G)$, and partially answer this open question by classifying finite groups $G$ having $\frac{|G|}{2}-1\leq |C(G)| \leq \frac{|G|}{2}+1$ for some fix values of $\mathcal{O}_{2}(G)$. Finally, we provide a complete list of finite groups $G$ having $|C(G)|=\frac{|G|+(2r+1)}{2}$ for $r\geq-1$.</description>

      <title>Faithful Burau-like representations of some rank two Garside groups and torus knot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a method to produce faithful representations of the groups $G(n,m)=\langle X, Y \ \vert \ X^m = Y^n \rangle$ in $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{C}[t^{\pm 1}, q^{\pm 1}])$. These groups are Garside groups and the Garside normal forms of elements of the corresponding monoid can be explicitly recovered from the matrices, in the spirit of Krammer's proof of the linearity of Artin's braid groups. We use this method to construct several explicit faithful representations of the above groups, among which a representation which generalizes the reduced Burau representation of $B_3 \cong G(2,3)$ to a large family of groups of the form $G(n,m)$ with $n$, $m$ coprime (which are torus knot groups). Like the Burau representation, this representation specializes to a representation of a reflection-like quotient that we previously introduced, called \textit{$2$-toric reflection group}. As a byproduct we get a "Burau representation" for some exceptional complex braid groups, which also shows that the latter embed into their Hecke algebra.</description>

      <title>Algebraic groups over free and hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an algebraic group over a group $G$ to be a variety - that is, a subset of $G^d$ defined by equations over $G$ - endowed with a group law whose coordinates can be expressed as word maps. In the case where $G$ is a torsion-free hyperbolic group and the underlying variety is irreducible we give a complete description of all algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>On regularity of profinite isomorphisms between cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds and the $A$-polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any isomorphism between the profinite completions of the fundamental groups of two cusped finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds is regular and peripheral regular. As an application, we show that the $A$-polynomial of prime knots in $S^3$ is a profinite invariant, up to possible mirror image.</description>

      <title>On a character correspondence associated to $\mathfrak{F}$-projectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conditions under which the head characters of a solvable group, as defined by I. M. Isaacs, behave well with respect to restriction. We also determine the intersection of the kernels of all head characters of the group. Using G. Navarro's definition of $\mathfrak{F}'$-characters, we generalize these results for any saturated formation $\mathfrak{F}$ containing the nilpotent groups.</description>

      <title>Pointwise-relatively-compact subgroups and trivial-weight-free representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pointwise-elliptic subset of a topological group is one whose elements all generate relatively-compact subgroups. A connected locally compact group has a dense pointwise-elliptic subgroup if and only if it is an extension by a compact normal subgroup of a semidirect product $\mathbb{L}\rtimes \mathbb{K}$ with connected, simply-connected Lie $\mathbb{L}$, compact Lie $\mathbb{K}$, with the commutator subgroup $\mathbb{K}'$ acting on the Lie algebra $Lie(\mathbb{L})$ with no trivial weights. This extends and recovers a result of Kabenyuk's, providing the analogous classification with $\mathbb{G}$ assumed Lie connected, topologically perfect, with no non-trivial central elliptic elements.</description>
