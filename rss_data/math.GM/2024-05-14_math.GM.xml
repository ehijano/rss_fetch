      <title>A class of explicit solutions for the Fermat problem for tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of explicit solutions for the problem of minimization of the function $f(x,y,z)=\sum_{i=1}^{4}\sqrt{(x-x_{i})^2+(y-y_{i})^2+(z-z_{i})^2},$ which gives the location of the unique stationary (Fermat-Torricelli) point for four non-collinear and non-coplanar points $A_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i},z_{i}),$ determining tetrahedra, which are derived by a proper class of isosceles tetrahedra having four equal edges and two equal opposite edges. This class of explicit solutions contains Mehlhos and Glastier's explicit solutions (theoretical constructions) obtained in \cite{Mehlhos:00} and \cite{Glastier:93}, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Simple Formula for Binomial Coefficients Revealed Through Polynomial Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit an unconventional formula for binomial coefficients by applying an underexplored property of polynomial encoding. The formula, $\binom{n}{k} = \left\lfloor\frac{(1 + 2^{n})^{n}}{2^{n k}}\right\rfloor \bmod{2^{n}}$, is valid for $n &gt; 0$ and $0 \leq k \leq n$. We relate this formula to existing mathematical methods via Kronecker substitution. Additionally, we generalize this formula to compute multinomial coefficients. A baseline computational complexity analysis identifies opportunities for optimization. We conclude by positing an open problem concerning the efficient computation of $\binom{n}{k}$ modulo $n$ using the formula.</description>

      <title>The number of inscribed and circumscribed graphs of a convex polyhedron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09552v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the paper we prove that the number of graphs inscribed into graph of a convex polyhedron and circumscribed around another graph does not exceed 4. For this we first studied Poncelet type problem about the number of convex $n$-gons inscribed into one convex $n$-gon and circumscribed around another convex $n$-gon. It is proved that their number is also at most 4. This contrasts with Poncelet type porisms where usually infinitude of such polygons is proved, provided that one such polygon already exists. An inequality involving ratio of lengths of line segments is used. Alternative way of using Maclaurin-Braikenridge's conic generation method is also discussed. Properties related to constructibility with straightedge and compass are also studied. A new proof, based on mathematical induction, of generalized Maclaurin- Braikenridge's theorem is given. We also gave examples of regular polygons and a polyhedron for which number 4 is realized.</description>
