      <title>Master Oscillator and Phase Reference Line Design for the PIP-II Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase averaging reference line system provides the RF phase reference, LO and clock signals to the LLRF and other accelerator sub-systems. The PIP-II linac has RF systems at three frequencies - 162.5 MHz, 325 MHz and 650 MHz. A temperature-stabilized, low-phase-noise oscillator is used as the master oscillator. Phase reference signals at 162.5 MHz, 325 MHz, and 650 MHz, along with LO signals at 182.5 MHz, 345 MHz, 670 MHz and LLRF clocks at 1320 MHz and 1300 MHz, are generated in temperature-controlled RF modules at each frequency section. A phase reference from each module travels to the next section, where it is doubled to produce required frequencies. The reference also travels alongside the accelerating cavities in the tunnel, allowing cavity probe and reference cables to temperature track and reduce measurement errors from temperature changes or phase drift.</description>

      <title>RFSoC Based LLRF System Design at ALS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at LBNL is upgrading several LLRF systems for its Linac and Sub-Harmonic Bunchers, where it is desired to have a unified LLRF system design to support various RF frequencies (at 125MHz, 500MHz and 3GHz) and configurations. This paper demonstrates an open-source, direct sampling RFSoC based LLRF system design, featuring: sample-to-sample Multi-Tile Synchronization, deterministic latency, digital up/down conversion, arbitrary waveform generation and acquisition, in-pulse closed loop control, timing and EPICS integration, modular RF frontend and hardware designs. Measured RF characteristics show that the RFSoC based LLRF system is able to meet the system requirements.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Optics Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This lecture provides an overview of the principles and methodologies involved in linear optics design. It aims to introduce key concepts such as the matrix formalism, the symplecticity, the quantities that are preserved in the single particle evolution, e.g., the Courant-Snyder invariant. It also covers the concept of beam emittance and matching conditions for an ensemble of particles. The goal is to equip readers with the foundational tools needed for both theoretical understanding and practical application in linear optics and accelerator design.</description>

      <title>Development of fault identification pipeline for SPIRAL2 LLRF data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPIRAL2 is a state-of-the-art superconducting linear accelerator for heavy ions. The radiofrequency operation of the linac can be disrupted by anomalies that affect its reliability. This work leverages fast, multivariate time series post-mortem data from the Low-Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) systems to differentiate anomaly groups. However, interpreting these anomalies traditionally relies on expert analysis, with certain behaviours remaining obscure even to experienced observers. By adopting the Time2Feat pipeline, this study explores the interpretability of anomalies through feature selection, paving the way for real-time state observers. Clustering dashboards are presented, allowing the use of multiple clustering algorithms easily configurable and tools to help for visualizing results. A case study on distinguishing electronic quenches and false quench alarms in postmortem data is highlighted. Thereby, a fast and reliable K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier is proposed.</description>

      <title>Low-impedance stripline kicker for the transverse instability suppression system of the synchrotron radiation facility "SKIF" light source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction of the new fourth generation synchrotron radiation facility (SRF) "SKIF" near Novosibirsk is nearing completion. "SKIF" uniqueness is ultra-low 75 pm natural emittance at 400 mA beam current and 3 GeV beam energy.
  Collective effects (beam interaction with the vacuum chamber) are the main obstacles of achieving such emittance and beam current. To suppress these effects the storage ring will be equipped with a bunch-by-bunch feedback system. Important components of the feedback system are a stripline (fast) kicker and a beam position monitor.
  The paper describes design of the low-impedance stripline kicker for SRF "SKIF" storage ring, optimized for the manufacturing and for the uniformity of the imparted transverse kick. The kicker qualities such as S-parameters, imparted transverse momentum, transfer and beam impedances are presented. The chosen length of the stripline kicker allows its use as a beam position monitor.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Waveform Synthesis through Echo-enabled Harmonic Generation Free-electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Attosecond pulse trains (APTs) are indispensable for probing electron dynamics at their intrinsic timescales. High harmonic generation (HHG) has long been a successful and widely used technique in producing extreme ultraviolet APTs. While in the soft X-ray regime, HHG suffers from low conversion efficiency and lacking flexibility in the waveform and spectrum control. Here in this study, based on the waveform synthesis of the echo-enabled harmonic generation (EEHG) free-electron laser (FEL), we propose a novel method that can generate soft X-ray APTs with high temporal and spectral tunability. EEHG scheme is well-known in forming phase-locked high harmonic bunching combs down to the soft X-ray regime. And We can facilitate successive FEL lasing in several different harmonic numbers and then perform the coherent waveform synthesis to generate soft X-ray APTs. Three-dimensional simulation results indicate that reproducible generation of coherent APTs in the soft X-ray regime with peak power of 3.5 GW and micropulse duration of 160 as can be achieved by five-harmonic synthesis. And the micropulse duration together with the spectral components of the APTs can be adjusted easily according to the programmable high harmonic bunching combs in the EEHG scheme. This method has the potential to establish a robust platform for attosecond sciences in the soft X-ray regime, which can enable unprecedented studies of electron dynamics in physical and chemical reactions, biological systems and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Xilinx RFSoC Platform for Low-Level RF Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Radio Frequency System-onChip (RFSoC) technology from Xilinx (AMD) has enabled the integration of high-speed data converters and programmable logic within a single package. RFSoC platforms are already widely adopted in telecommunications, radar, and satellite communications, where they promise reductions in system footprint and power consumption. However, their suitability for Low-Level RF (LLRF) control systems in accelerator environments - where stability requirements are critical - has not been quantitatively evaluated. This paper presents a comparative measurement-based assessment of RFSoC-based and conventional LLRF designs, focusing on signal fidelity, phase noise, latency, system complexity, and integration challenges. The advantages and challenges of adopting RFSoC-based direct conversion architectures are discussed, providing guidance for future LLRF system implementations.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Aperture Masking Interferometric Imaging: Demonstration with the JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for aperture masking interferometric (AMI) imaging at near-IR wavelengths using radio astronomical techniques. The method starts with derivation of interferometric visibilities from a Fourier transform of the interferograms. An iterative joint optimization process is then employed, using self-calibration of the interferometric element-based complex voltage gains (i.e. electric fields), and CLEAN deconvolution to obtain the source structure. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method using the NIRISS aperture masking interferometer on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) at 4.8~$\mu$m and 3.8~$\mu$m. Due to a number of effects (the large pixel size, charge migration, near-field optics), the method also requires an initial visibility-based amplitude normalization using observations of a well know point-source calibration star. We employ early science observations of the dusty binary Wolf-Rayet star WR137. Images with a dynamic range (peak/rms) of $\sim 240$ on the target, and $\sim 1000$ on the calibrator, are synthesized from a short integration. The self-calibration process determines the photon path-lengths through the optical system to each aperture using data on the target source itself, thereby representing an essentially 'real-time', precise wavefront error sensor. Four independent measures of the JWST mirror segment pistons (two wavelengths for two sources), agree to within 10~nm to 15~nm, comparable to the expected errors based on an analysis of closure phases on the calibrator star. Including a baseline-based phase correction improves the dynamic range of the final images by about 23\%.</description>

      <title>Experimental evidence of production of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on experimental evidence of the generation of directional muons from a laser-wakefield accelerator driven by a PW-class laser. The muons were generated following the interaction of a GeV-scale high-charge electron beam with a 2cm-thick Pb target and were detected using a Timepix3 detector placed behind a suitable shielding configuration. Data analysis indicates a $(99.1\pm0.5)$% confidence of muon detection over noise, in excellent agreement with numerical modelling. Extrapolation of the experimental setup to higher electron energies and charges suggests the potential to guide and separate from noise approximately $10^4$ muons/s onto cm$^2$-scale areas for applications using a 10 Hz PW laser. These results demonstrate the possibility of generating and transporting directional muon beams using high-power lasers and establish a foundation for the systematic application of laser-driven high-energy muon beams.</description>

      <title>Experimental Reconstruction of Source 4D Phase Space Without Prior Knowledge of Transfer Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04768v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a method for reconstructing the transverse 4D phase space of an electron beam at the time of emission from downstream diagnostics of the 4D phase space. This method does not rely on detailed knowledge of the beamline transport, besides assuming that linearity and symplecticity are satisfied. We apply this method to measure the transverse position and momentum phase space of electrons emitted from a spatially-structured alkali-antimonide cathode. This method can uncover local correlations between emission location and momentum spread. We formulate this method analytically and investigate resolution limits.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Models studies for laser-plasma accelerator electron source design through numerical optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing a high-quality plasma injector electron source driven by a laser beam relies on numerical parametric studies using particle-in-cell codes. The common input parameters to explore are laser characteristics, plasma species and density profiles produced by computational fluid dynamic studies. We demonstrate the construction of surrogate models using machine learning techniques for a laser-plasma injector (LPI) based on more than $3000$ particle-in-cell simulations of laser wakefield acceleration performed for sparsely spaced input parameters published by Drobniak [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams, 26, 091302, (2023)]. Surrogate models are relevant for LPI design and optimisation, as they are approximately $10^7$ times faster than PIC simulations. Their speed enables more efficient design studies by allowing extensive exploration of the input-output relationship without significant computational cost. We develop and compare the performance of three surrogate models, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision trees (DT) and Gaussian processes (GP). We show that using a simple and frugal MLP-based model trained on a reasonable-size random scan data set of 500 particles in cell simulations, we can predict beam parameters with a coefficient determination score $R^2=0.93$ . The best surrogate model is used to quickly find optimal working points and stability regions and get targeted electron beam energy, charge, energy spread and emittance using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation. This simple approach can serve more global design study of an LPI in a start-to-end linear laser-driven accelerator.on beam energy, charge and energy spread using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation</description>

Abstract: We discuss a concept of a lower-energy version of the Large Hadron-electron Collider (LHeC), delivering electron-hadron collisions concurrently to the hadron-hadron collisions at the high-luminosity LHC at CERN. Assuming the use of a 20 GeV electron Energy Recovery Linac (ERL), we report the results on the optimised beam dynamics, accelerator technologies, and detector constraints required for such a "phase-one" LHeC. Finally, we also discuss the ERL configurations and the possibility of delivering electron-hadron collisions during the planned {Run5} of the LHC, which opens excellent research capabilities - the unique scientific potential of the proposed facility is outlined.</description>

      <title>High brightness multi-MeV photon source driven by a petawatt-scale laser wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of a bright multi-MeV gamma source driven by a petawatt laser. The source generates on average $(1.2\pm0.6)\times10^9$ photons above 1 MeV per pulse, exceeding those of previous all-optical sources by a hundred times, and reached a peak spectral brightness of $(3.9 \pm 1.5)\times 10^{22}$ photons/mm$^2$/mrad$^2$/s/0.1%BW at $\epsilon_\gamma\approx11$ MeV. The source was produced by inverse Compton scattering of a laser wakefield accelerated GeV electron beam and its back-reflected driving laser pulse. Its performance is well described by a simple model of the laser and electron properties at the collision point that allows quantitative predictions and identifies clear strategies to further enhance radiation efficiency. Our results highlight the promise of this source for fundamental physics studies, as well as for applications of nuclear resonance fluorescence and nuclear transmutation.</description>
