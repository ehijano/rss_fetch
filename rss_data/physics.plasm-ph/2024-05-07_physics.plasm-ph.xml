      <title>Laser wakefield acceleration of ions with a transverse flying focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme electric fields created in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions could generate energetic ions far more compactly than traditional accelerators. Despite this promise, laser-plasma accelerators have remained stagnant at maximum ion energies of 100 MeV/nucleon for the last twenty years. The central challenge is the low charge-to-mass ratio of ions, which has precluded one of the most successful approaches used for electrons: laser wakefield acceleration. Here we show that a laser pulse with a focal spot that moves transverse to the laser propagation direction enables wakefield acceleration of ions to GeV energies in underdense plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations demonstrate that this relativistic-intensity "transverse flying focus" can trap ions in a comoving electrostatic pocket, producing a monoenergetic collimated ion beam. With a peak intensity of $10^{20}\,$W/cm$^2$ and an acceleration distance of $0.44\,$cm, we observe a proton beam with $23.1\,$pC charge, $1.6\,$GeV peak energy, and $3.7\,$% relative energy spread. This approach allows for compact high-repetition-rate production of high-energy ions, highlighting the capability of more generalized spatio-temporal pulse shaping to address open problems in plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Importance of Gas Heating in Capacitively Coupled Radiofrequency Plasma-assisted Synthesis of Carbon Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of diamond nanoparticles, a capacitively-coupled radio frequency (CCRF) flow-through plasma reactor was operated with methane argon gas mixtures. Signatures of the final product obtained microscopically and spectroscopically indicated that the product was an amorphous form of graphite. This result was consistent irrespective of combinations of the macroscopic reactor settings. To explain the observed synthesis output, measurements of C2 and gas properties were carried out by laser-induced fluorescence and optical emission spectroscopy. Strikingly, the results indicated a strong gas temperature gradient of 100 K per mm from the center of the reactor to the wall. Based on additional plasma imaging, a model of hot constricted region (filamentation region) was then formulated. It illustrated that, while the hot constricted region was present, the bulk of the gas was not hot enough to facilitate diamond sp3 formation: characterized by much lower reaction rates, when compared to sp2, sp3 formation kinetics are expected to become exponentially slow. This result was further confirmed by experiments under identical conditions but with a H2/CH4 mixture, where no output material was detected: if graphitic sp2 formation was expected as the main output material from the methane feedstock, atomic hydrogen would then be expected to etch it away in situ, such that the net production of that sp2-hybridized solid material is nearly a zero.</description>

      <title>Multiphysics Enabled Numerical Modeling of a Plasma Based Electrically Small VHF-UHF Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional model of a novel plasma based electrically small antenna is developed for investigating the gas properties and antenna parameters under a low pressure, low plasma temperature environment. The antenna exhibits dipole antenna-like behavior with wide-band impedance matching from $213-700$ MHz. Plasma is sustained by $0.9$ W of RF input power at $100$ MHz and the gas pressure is strategically controlled at $500$ mili-Torr. The simulated $S_{11}$ is verified against the available experimental data and further antenna parameters are extracted. The proposed ESA shows dipole-like radiation pattern with a radiation efficiency of $16\%$ at $700$ MHz. The performance metric for ESAs, the Chu-limit, is exceeded by this antenna with the $Bandwidth\times Efficiency$ reaching $0.168$ with a $ka$ of $0.5571$.The findings from this letter demonstrate the practicability of using COMSOL Multiphysics as a tool for predicting plasma behavior and antenna performance while the boundary conditions for all the coupled physics are respected.</description>

      <title>Hall effect on the joint cascades of magnetic energy and helicity in helical magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helical magnetohydrodynamic turbulence with Hall effects is ubiquitous in heliophysics and plasma physics, such as star formation and solar activities, and its intrinsic mechanisms are still not clearly explained. Direct numerical simulations reveal that when the forcing scale is comparable to the ion inertial scale, Hall effects induce remarkable cross helicity. It then suppresses the inverse cascade efficiency, leading to the accumulation of large-scale magnetic energy and helicity. The process is accompanied by the breaking of current sheets via filaments along magnetic fields. Using the Ulysses data, the numerical findings are separately confirmed. These results suggest a novel mechanism wherein small-scale Hall effects could strongly affect large-scale magnetic fields through cross helicity.</description>

      <title>Self-organization in collisionless, high-$\beta$ turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MHD equations, as a collisional fluid model that remains in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), have long been used to describe turbulence in myriad space and astrophysical plasmas. Yet, the vast majority of these plasmas, from the solar wind to the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, are only weakly collisional at best, meaning that significant deviations from LTE are not only possible but common. Recent studies have demonstrated that the kinetic physics inherent to this weakly collisional regime can fundamentally transform the evolution of such plasmas across a wide range of scales. Here we explore the consequences of pressure anisotropy and Larmor-scale instabilities for collisionless, $\beta \gg 1$ turbulence, focusing on the role of a self-organizational effect known as `magneto-immutability'. We describe this self-organization analytically through a high-$\beta$, reduced ordering of the CGL-MHD equations, finding that it is a robust inertial-range effect that dynamically suppresses magnetic-field-strength fluctuations, anisotropic-pressure stresses, and dissipation due to heat fluxes. As a result, the turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic fluctuations continues below the putative viscous scale to form a robust, nearly conservative, MHD-like inertial range. These findings are confirmed numerically via Landau-fluid CGL-MHD turbulence simulations that employ a collisional closure to mimic the effects of microinstabilities. We find that microinstabilities occupy a small ($\sim 5\%$) volume-filling fraction of the plasma, even when the pressure anisotropy is driven strongly towards its instability thresholds. We discuss these results in the context of recent predictions for ion-versus-electron heating in low-luminosity accretion flows and observations implying suppressed viscosity in ICM turbulence.</description>

      <title>On finite-dimensional smoothed-particle Hamiltonian reductions of the Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inclusion of spatial smoothing in finite-dimensional particle-based Hamiltonian reductions of the Vlasov equation are considered. In the context of the Vlasov-Poisson equation (and other mean-field Lie-Poisson systems), smoothing amounts to a convolutive regularization of the Hamiltonian. This regularization may be interpreted as a change of the inner product structure used to identify the dual space in the Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian formulation. In particular, the shape function used for spatial smoothing may be identified as the kernel function of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space whose inner product is used to define the Lie-Poisson Hamiltonian structure. It is likewise possible to introduce smoothing in the Vlasov-Maxwell system, but in this case the Poisson bracket must be modified rather than the Hamiltonian. The smoothing applied to the Vlasov-Maxwell system is incorporated by inserting smoothing in the map from canonical to kinematic coordinates. In the filtered system, the Lorentz force law and the current, the two terms coupling the Vlasov equation with Maxwell's equations, are spatially smoothed.</description>

      <title>Low-cost sensors and circuits for plasma education: characterizing power and illuminance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial applications of plasma have significantly increased beyond semiconductor manufacturing in recent years. This necessitates training a skilled workforce in plasma science and technology. However, an essential challenge to this end stems from the high cost of plasma devices and diagnostics. The limited access to plasma devices has hindered plasma education, particularly in the least developed countries. To this end, this paper demonstrates how low-cost sensors and circuits can be developed to enable inexpensive plasma experiments in laboratory environments. In particular, we show how to measure high voltage, current, and power from a cold-atmospheric plasma discharge. Additionally, we develop a low-cost illuminance sensor and demonstrate how it can be used to estimate the corresponding plasma power. The low-cost sensors and electronics presented in this paper can aid educators in characterizing plasma power versus plasma illuminance.</description>

Abstract: An analysis of precession fishbone, diamagnetic fishbone and internal kink mode in Tokamak plasmas is presented via solving the fishbone dispersion relation. Applying the dispersion relation to a typical EAST discharge, excitation of precession fishbone due to Neutral Beam Injection is successfully explained. The real frequency and growth rate of diamagnetic fishbone and internal kink mode are calculated, and the relevance of the diamagnetic branch is also discussed for the possible equilibrium profile.</description>

      <title>Beam-Plasma Dynamics in Finite-Length, Collisionless Inhomogeneous Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.01431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the streaming instability triggered by ion motion in a plasma system that is finite in length, collisionless, and inhomogeneous. Employing numerical simulations using Particle-In-Cell (PIC) techniques and kinetic equations, the study examines how inhomogeneity emerges from integrating a cold ion beam with a background plasma within a confined system. The findings suggest that steady ion flow can modify ion sound waves through acoustic reflections from system boundaries, leading to instability. Such phenomena are known to be a hydrodynamic effect. However, there are also signatures of the beam-driven ion sound instability where kinetic resonances play a pivotal role. The main objective is to understand the impact of a finite-length system on beam-plasma instability and to identify the wave modes supported in such configurations.</description>

      <title>Coherent high-frequency axial oscillations in a partially magnetized direct current magnetron discharge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High frequency oscillations are observed in a neon plasma of a direct current magnetron discharge. At low discharge currents, we see highly coherent 60 MHz fluctuations. Above a distinct current threshold, secondary 5 - 10 MHz fluctuations emerge in addition to turbulent fluctuations in the 60 - 100 MHz range. The oscillations in the total discharge current suggest axial wave propagation. A lower-hybrid wave theory is invoked to model the high frequency oscillations. We attribute the low frequency modes to a turbulence-driven inverse cascade process, as suggested by recent simulations.</description>

Abstract: With the advent of high repetition rate laser facilities, novel diagnostic tools compatible with these advanced specifications are required. This paper presents the design of an active gamma-ray spectrometer intended for these high repetition rate experiments, with particular emphasis on functionality within a PW level laser-plasma interaction chamber's extreme conditions. The spectrometer uses stacked scintillators to accommodate a broad range of gamma-ray energies, demonstrating its adaptability for various experimental setups. Additionally, it has been engineered to maintain compactness, electromagnetic pulse resistance, and ISO-5 cleanliness requirements while ensuring high sensitivity. The spectrometer has been tested in real conditions inside the PW-class level interaction chamber at the BELLA center, LBNL. The paper also outlines the calibration process thanks to a $^{60}$Co radioactive source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present direct observations of acoustic waves in warm dense matter. We analyze wave-number- and energy-resolved x-ray spectra taken from warm dense methane created by laser heating a cryogenic liquid jet. X-ray diffraction and inelastic free-electron scattering yield sample conditions of 0.3$\pm$0.1 eV and 0.8$\pm$0.1 g/cm$^3$, corresponding to a pressure of $\sim$13 GPa. Inelastic x-ray scattering was used to observe the collective oscillations of the ions. With a highly improved energy resolution of $\sim$50 meV, we could clearly distinguish the Brillouin peaks from the quasielastic Rayleigh feature. Data at different wave numbers were utilized to derive a sound speed of 5.9$\pm$0.5 km/s, marking a high-temperature data point for methane and demonstrating consistency with Birch's law in this parameter regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twisted photons can be emitted by free electrons in circular or spiral motion, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM) and possess a helical phase structure. However, classical radiation reaction (RR) effects has not been investigated as an accelerated electron emits vortex radiation during the interaction with a electromagnetic field. This work focuses on investigating the effects of radiation reaction on the production of twisted photons in the Nonlinear Inverse Thomson Scattering (NITS) process. Using the precise electron trajectory obtained by Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation with a circularly polarized (CP) plane-wave field, we find that the radiation reaction effects can be significant for a sufficiently long pulse of a plane wave. They observe modifications in the frequency, phase structure, rotational asymmetry of OAM density, and energy distribution of the vortex field due to radiation reaction. This finding could provide an unique signature for the detection of radiation reaction.</description>

Abstract: A direct current (DC) arc discharge is a widely used method for large-scale production of metal nanoparticles, core-shell particles, and carbon nanotubes. Here, we explore the growth of iron nanoparticles in a modified DC arc discharge. Iron particles are produced by the evaporation of an anode, made from low-carbon steel. Methane admixture into argon gas serves as a carbon source. Electron microscopy and elemental analysis suggest that hydrocarbons decompose on iron clusters forming a carbon shell, which inhibits iron particle growth until its full encapsulation, at which point the iron core growth is ceased. Experimental observations are explained using an aerosol growth model. The results demonstrate the path to manipulate metal particle size in a hydrocarbon arc environment.</description>

Abstract: Laser-driven ion acceleration provides ultra-short, high-charge, low-emittance beams, which are desirable for a wide range of high-impact applications. Yet after decades of research, a significant increase in maximum ion energy is still needed. This work introduces a quality-preserving staging concept for ultra-intense ion bunches that is seamlessly applicable from the non-relativistic plasma source to the relativistic regime. Full 3D particle-in-cell simulations prove robustness and capture of a high-charge proton bunch, suitable for readily available and near-term laser facilities.</description>

      <title>Safety first: Stability and dissipation of line-tied force-free flux tubes in magnetized coronae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetized plasma columns and extended magnetic structures with both footpoints anchored to a surface layer are an important building block of astrophysical dissipation models. Current loops shining in X-rays during the growth of plasma instabilities are observed in the corona of the Sun and are expected to exist in highly magnetized neutron star magnetospheres and accretion disk coronae. For varying twist and system sizes, we investigate the stability of line-tied force-free flux tubes and the dissipation of twist energy during instabilities using linear analysis and time-dependent force-free electrodynamics simulations. Kink modes ($m=1$) and efficient magnetic energy dissipation develop for plasma safety factors $q\lesssim 1$, where $q$ is the inverse of the number of magnetic field line windings per column length. Higher-order fluting modes ($m&gt;1$) can distort equilibrium flux tubes for $q&gt;1$ but induce significantly less dissipation. In our analysis, the characteristic pitch $\tilde{\mu}_0$ of flux tube field lines determines the growth rate ($\propto \tilde{\mu}_0^3$) and minimum wavelength of the kink instability ($\propto \tilde{\mu}_0^{-1}$). We use these scalings to determine a minimum flux tube length for the growth of the kink instability for any given $\tilde{\mu}_0$. By drawing analogies to idealized magnetar magnetospheres with varying regimes of boundary shearing rates, we discuss the expected impact of the pitch-dependent growth rates for magnetospheric dissipation in magnetar conditions.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by previous work on kinetic energy cascades in the ocean and atmosphere, we develop a spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool that can be used to study scales of variability in generalized dynamical systems. In particular, we use generalized time-frequency methods from signal analysis to broaden the applicability of frequency transfers from theoretical to practical applications such as the study of ocean or atmosphere data or simulation output. We also show that triad interactions in wavenumber used to study kinetic energy and enstrophy cascades can be generalized to study triad interactions in frequency or wavenumber-frequency. We study the effects of sweeping on the locality of frequency transfers and frequency triad interactions to better understand the locality of spatio-temporal frequency transfers. As an illustrative example, we use the spatio-temporal spectral transfer tool to study the results of a simulation of two-dimensional homogeneous isotropic turbulence. This simulated fluid is forced at a well-defined wavenumber and frequency with dissipation occurring at both large and small scales, making this one of the first studies of "modulated turbulence" in two dimensions. Our results show that the spatio-temporal transfers we develop in this paper are robust to potential practical problems such as low sampling rates or nonstationarity in time series of interest. We anticipate that this method will be a useful tool in studying scales of spatio-temporal variability in a wide range of fluids applications as higher resolution data and simulations become more widely available.</description>
