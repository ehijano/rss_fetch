      <title>Stability and Extension of Steady and Ranging Persistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a topological data analysis tool that has been widely generalized, extending its scope outside the field of topology. Among its extensions, steady and ranging persistence was developed to study a wide variety of graph properties. Precisely, given a feature of interest on graphs, it is possible to build two types of persistence (steady and ranging persistence) that follow the evolution of the feature along graph filtrations. This study extends steady and ranging persistence to other objects using category theory and investigates the stability of such persistence. In particular, a characterization of the features that induce balanced steady and ranging persistence is provided. The main results of this study are illustrated using a practical implementation for hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>A necessary condition for liftings of positive characteristic varieties with finite fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a necessary condition for the existence of characteristic zero liftings of certain smooth, proper varieties in positive characteristic, using \'etale homotopy theory and Wall's finiteness obstruction. For a variety with finite \'etale fundamental group pi, we define a notion of mod-l finite dominatedness based on the F_l-chain complex of the universal cover of its l-profinite \'etale homotopy type. We prove that such a variety can be lifted to characteristic zero only if this complex is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely generated projective F_l[pi]$-modules. This extends classical finiteness results in topology to the l-adic and algebro-geometric setting.</description>

      <title>p-adic congruences in iterated derivatives of the Weierstrass elliptic function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use homotopy theoretic methods to prove congruence relations of number theoretic interest. Specifically, we use the theory of $\mathbb E_\infty$ complex orientations to establish $p$-adic K\"ummer congruences among iterated derivatives of the Weierstrass elliptic function.
  The machinery of Ando, Hopkins, and Rezk was developed with the intended application of taking congruence relations as input and producing $\mathbb E_\infty$-orientations as output. We run their machine in reverse, using as input the recent results of Carmeli and the first author on the existence of $\mathbb E_\infty$-orientations of Tate fixed-point objects.</description>

      <title>The Gysin braid for $S^3$-actions on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth action of the sphere $\mathbb S^3$ on a manifold $M$, we have previously constructed a Gysin sequence relating the cohomology of the manifold $M$ and that of the orbit space $M/\mathbb S^3$. This sequence involves an exotic term depending on the subset $M^{\mathbb S^1}$.
  Notice that the orbit space is a stratified pseudomanifold, a kind of singular spaces where intersection cohomology applies. In the case where the the action is semi-free, the first author has already constructed a Gysin sequence relating the cohomology of $M$ and the intersection cohomology of $M/\mathbb S^3$.
  What happens if the action is not semi-free? This is the goal of this work.
  The situation is more complicated and we do not find a Gysin sequence but a Gysin braid relating the cohomology of $M$ and the intersection cohomology of $M/\mathbb S^3$. This braid also contains an exotic term depending this time on the intersection cohomology of $M^{\mathbb S^1}$.</description>

      <title>Homotopy of blow ups after looping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14531v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The homotopy theory of the blow up construction in algebraic and symplectic geometry is investigated via two approaches. The first approach introduces and develops fibrewise surgery theory, for which the fibrewise framing is characterized by the homotopy groups of a certain gauge group. This is used to obtain a homotopy decomposition of the based loop space on a blow up that holds $p$-locally for all but finitely many primes $p$ and holds rationally. The second approach is purely homotopy theoretic and obtains a homotopy decomposition of the based loop space on a blow up that holds integrally provided a certain condition is satisfied by an associated homotopy action.
  As applications, we obtain $p$-local homotopy decompositions of the based loop space of a focal genus $2$ manifold, improve an earlier result of the authors on the homotopy of manifolds stabilized by projective spaces, and obtain for blow-ups a refinement of the rational dichotomy.</description>

      <title>On the structure of the $RO(G)$-graded homotopy of $H\underline{M}$ for cyclic $p$-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of the $RO(G)$-graded homotopy Mackey functors of any Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum $H\underline{M}$ for $G$ a cyclic $p$-group. When $\underline{R}$ is a Green functor, we define orientation classes $u_V$ for $H\underline{R}$ and deduce a generalized gold relation. We deduce the $a_V,u_V$-isomorphism regions of the $RO(G)$-graded homotopy Mackey functors and prove two induction theorems. As applications, we compute the positive cone of $H\underline{\mathbb{A}}$, as well as the positive and negative cones of $H\underline{\mathbb{Z}}$. The latter two cones are essential to the slice spectral sequences of $MU^{((C_{2^n}))}$ and its variants.</description>

      <title>A synthetic approach to detecting $v_1$-periodic families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a simple proof that the unit map from the sphere spectrum to the connective image-of-$J$ spectrum $\mathrm{j}$ is surjective on homotopy groups. This is achieved using a novel $t$-structure on the category of $E$-synthetic spectra and a specific construction of $\mathbf{F}_p$- and BP-synthetic lifts of $\mathrm{j}$. These synthetic lifts then easily produce modified Adams and Adams--Novikov spectral sequences for $\mathrm{j}$ which we use the prove the above detection statement, all without ever calculating $\mathbf{F}_p$- or BP-homology nor the associated Ext groups.</description>

      <title>Topology Estimation of Simulated 4D Image Data by Combining Downscaling and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological analysis of four-dimensional (4D) image-type data is challenged by the immense size that these datasets can reach. This can render the direct application of methods, like persistent homology and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), impractical due to computational constraints. This study aims to estimate the topology type of 4D image-type data cubes that exhibit topological intricateness and size above our current processing capacity. The experiments using synthesised 4D data and a real-world 3D data set demonstrate that it is possible to circumvent computational complexity issues by applying downscaling methods to the data before training a CNN. This is achievable even when persistent homology software indicates that downscaling can significantly alter the homology of the training data. When provided with downscaled test data, the CNN can still estimate the Betti numbers of the original sample cubes with over 80\% accuracy, which outperforms the persistent homology approach, whose accuracy deteriorates under the same conditions. The accuracy of the CNNs can be further increased by moving from a mathematically-guided approach to a more vision-based approach where cavity types replace the Betti numbers as training targets.</description>

      <title>Structural Validation Of Synthetic Power Distribution Networks Using The Multiscale Flat Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of comparing a pair of geometric networks that may not be similarly defined, i.e., when they do not have one-to-one correspondences between their nodes and edges. Our motivating application is to compare power distribution networks of a region. Due to the lack of openly available power network datasets, researchers synthesize realistic networks resembling their actual counterparts. But the synthetic digital twins may vary significantly from one another and from actual networks due to varying underlying assumptions and approaches. Hence the user wants to evaluate the quality of networks in terms of their structural similarity to actual power networks. But the lack of correspondence between the networks renders most standard approaches, e.g., subgraph isomorphism and edit distance, unsuitable.
  We propose an approach based on the multiscale flat norm, a notion of distance between objects defined in the field of geometric measure theory, to compute the distance between a pair of planar geometric networks. Using a triangulation of the domain containing the input networks, the flat norm distance between two networks at a given scale can be computed by solving a linear program. In addition, this computation automatically identifies the 2D regions (patches) that capture where the two networks are different. We demonstrate through 2D examples that the flat norm distance can capture the variations of inputs more accurately than the commonly used Hausdorff distance. As a notion of stability, we also derive upper bounds on the flat norm distance between a simple 1D curve and its perturbed version as a function of the radius of perturbation for a restricted class of perturbations. We demonstrate our approach on a set of actual power networks from a county in the USA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,1)$-categories were introduced by Lurie, and they have various applications in higher category theory. Abell\'{a}n Garc\'{i}a and Stern gave a generalization to twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,2)$-categories. In this paper we introduce another simple model for twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of $(\infty,2)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of Hom complexes of graph homomorphisms whose codomains are cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is a polyhedral complex whose vertices are the graph homomorphisms $G\to H$ and whose edges connect the pairs of homomorphisms which differ in a single vertex of $G$. Hom complexes play an important role in an algebro-topological approach to the graph coloring problem. It is known that $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a disjoint union of points and circles when both $G$ and $H$ are cycles. We generalize this known result by showing that the same holds whenever $G$ is connected and $H$ is a cycle. To this end, we explicitly construct the universal cover of each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ and prove that it is contractible. Additionally, we provide a simple criterion to determine whether the connected component containing a given homomorphism is homotopy equivalent to a point or circle.</description>
