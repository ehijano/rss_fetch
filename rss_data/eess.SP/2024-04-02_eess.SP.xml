      <title>A spiking-domain implementation of electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic Structure Theory (EST) describes the behavior of electrons in matter and is used to predict material properties. Conventionally, this involves forming a Hamiltonian and solving the Schr\"odinger equation through discrete computation. Here, a new perspective to EST is provided by treating a perfectly crystalline material as a Linear Translation Invariant (LTI) system. The validity of this LTI-EST formalism is demonstrated by determining band structures for a one-dimensional chain of atoms, including the phenomenon of band structure folding in super cells. The proposed formalism allows for analytical traceability of band structure folding and offers computational advantage by bypassing the O(N) eigenvalue calculations. The spike-based computing nature of the proposed LTI-EST formalism is highlighted; thereby implying potential for material simulations solely in the spiking domain.</description>

      <title>Complex Neural Network based Joint AoA and AoD Estimation for Bistatic ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in wireless systems has emerged as a promising paradigm, offering the potential for improved performance, efficient resource utilization, and mutually beneficial interactions between radar sensing and wireless communications, thereby shaping the future of wireless technologies. In this work, we present two novel methods to address the joint angle of arrival and angle of departure estimation problem for bistatic ISAC systems. Our proposed methods consist of a deep learning (DL) solution leveraging complex neural networks, in addition to a parameterized algorithm. By exploiting the estimated channel matrix and incorporating a preprocessing step consisting of a coarse timing estimation, we are able to notably reduce the input size and improve the computational efficiency. In our findings, we emphasize the remarkable potential of our DL-based approach, which demonstrates comparable performance to the parameterized method that explicitly exploits the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model, while exhibiting significantly lower computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Communication Based Gradient Coding for Wireless Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate wireless federated learning (FL) in the presence of stragglers, where the power-constrained wireless devices collaboratively train a global model on their local datasets %within a time constraint and transmit local model updates through fading channels. To tackle stragglers resulting from link disruptions without requiring accurate prior information on connectivity or dataset sharing, we propose a gradient coding (GC) scheme based on cooperative communication. Subsequently, we conduct an outage analysis of the proposed scheme, based on which we conduct the convergence analysis. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed strategy in the presence of stragglers, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.</description>

      <title>SONIC: Synergizing VisiON Foundation Models for Stress RecogNItion from ECG signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress recognition through physiological signals such as Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has garnered significant attention. Traditionally, research in this field predominantly focused on utilizing handcrafted features or raw signals as inputs for learning algorithms. However, there is now a burgeoning interest within the community in leveraging large-scale vision foundation models (VFMs) like ResNet50, VGG19, and others. These VFMs are increasingly preferred due to their ability to capture complex features, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of stress recognition systems. However, no particular focus has been given on combining these VFMs. The combination of VFMs offers promising benefits by harnessing their collective knowledge to extract richer representations for improved stress recognition. So, to mitigate this research gap, we focus on combining different VFMs for stress recognition from ECG and propose SONIC, a novel framework that combines VFMs through their logits and training a fully connected network on the combined logits. Through extensive experimentation, SONIC showed the top performance against individual VFMs performance on the WESAD benchmark. With SONIC, we report state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in WESAD with 99.36% and 99.24% (stress vs non-stress) and 97.66% and 97.10% (amusement vs stress vs baseline) in accuracy and F1 respectively.</description>

      <title>Digital Twins for Supporting AI Research with Autonomous Vehicle Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twins (DTs), which are virtual environments that simulate, predict, and optimize the performance of their physical counterparts, are envisioned to be essential technologies for advancing next-generation wireless networks. While DTs have been studied extensively for wireless networks, their use in conjunction with autonomous vehicles with programmable mobility remains relatively under-explored. In this paper, we study DTs used as a development environment to design, deploy, and test artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that use real-time observations, e.g. radio key performance indicators, for vehicle trajectory and network optimization decisions in an autonomous vehicle networks (AVN). We first compare and contrast the use of simulation, digital twin (software in the loop (SITL)), sandbox (hardware-in-the-loop (HITL)), and physical testbed environments for their suitability in developing and testing AI algorithms for AVNs. We then review various representative use cases of DTs for AVN scenarios. Finally, we provide an example from the NSF AERPAW platform where a DT is used to develop and test AI-aided solutions for autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles for localizing a signal source based solely on link quality measurements. Our results in the physical testbed show that SITL DTs, when supplemented with data from real-world (RW) measurements and simulations, can serve as an ideal environment for developing and testing innovative AI solutions for AVNs.</description>

      <title>Wideband Channel Capacity Maximization With Beyond Diagonal RIS Reflection Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the promising beamforming gains offered by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), a new hardware architecture, known as \emph{beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS)}, has recently been proposed. This architecture enables controllable signal flows between the RIS elements, thereby providing greater design flexibility. However, the physics-imposed symmetry and orthogonality conditions on the non-diagonal reflection matrix make the design challenging. In this letter, we analyze how a BD-RIS can improve a wideband channel, starting from fundamental principles and deriving the capacity. Our analysis considers the effects of various channel taps and their frequency-domain characteristics. We introduce a new algorithm designed to optimize the configuration of the BD-RIS to maximize wideband capacity. The proposed algorithm has better performance than the benchmarks. A BD-RIS is beneficial compared to a conventional RIS in the absence of static path or when the Rician $\kappa$-factor is smaller than $10$.</description>

      <title>GI-Free Pilot-Aided Channel Estimation for Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently developed affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) can achieve full diversity in doubly selective channels, providing a comprehensive sparse representation of the delay-Doppler domain channel. Thus, accurate channel estimation is feasible by using just one pilot symbol. However, traditional AFDM channel estimation schemes necessitate the use of guard intervals (GI) to mitigate data-pilot interference, leading to spectral efficiency degradation. In this paper, we propose a GI-free pilot-aided channel estimation algorithm for AFDM systems, which improves spectral efficiency significantly. To mitigate the interference between the pilot and data symbols caused by the absence of GI, we perform joint interference cancellation, channel estimation, and signal detection iterately. Simulation results show that the bit error rate (BER) performance of the proposed method can approach the ideal case with perfect channel estimation.</description>

      <title>Automatic Modulation Classification using a Waveform Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive Radios (CRs) build upon Software Defined Radios (SDRs) to allow for autonomous reconfiguration of communication architectures. In recent years, CRs have been identified as an enabler for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) applications in which secondary users opportunistically share licensed spectrum. A major challenge for DSA is accurately characterizing the spectral environment, which requires blind signal classification. Existing work in this area has focused on simplistic channel models; however, more challenging fading channels (e.g., frequency selective fading channels) cause existing methods to be computationally complex or insufficient. This paper develops a novel blind modulation classification algorithm, which uses a set of higher order statistics to overcome these challenges. The set of statistics forms a signature, which can either be used directly for classification or can be processed using big data analytical techniques, such as principle component analysis (PCA), to learn the environment. The algorithm is tested in simulation on both flat fading and selective fading channel models. Results of this blind classification algorithm are shown to improve upon those which use single value higher order statistical methods.</description>

      <title>Robust Trajectory and Resource Optimization for Communication-assisted UAV SAR Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate joint 3-dimensional (3D) trajectory planning and resource allocation for rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensing. To support emerging real-time SAR applications and enable live mission control, we incorporate real-time communication with a ground station (GS). The UAV's main mission is the mapping of large areas of interest (AoIs) using an onboard SAR system and transferring the unprocessed raw radar data to the ground in real time. We propose a robust trajectory and resource allocation design that takes into account random UAV trajectory deviations. To this end, we model the UAV trajectory deviations and study their effect on the radar coverage. Then, we formulate a robust non-convex mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) such that the UAV 3D trajectory and resources are jointly optimized for maximization of the radar ground coverage. A low-complexity sub-optimal solution for the formulated problem is presented. Furthermore, to assess the performance of the sub-optimal algorithm, we derive an upper bound on the optimal solution based on monotonic optimization theory. Simulation results show that the proposed sub-optimal algorithm achieves close-to-optimal performance and not only outperforms several benchmark schemes but is also robust with respect to UAV trajectory deviations.</description>

      <title>A Backdoor Approach with Inverted Labels Using Dirty Label-Flipping Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-based machine learning systems frequently use public or third-party data, which might be inaccurate. This exposes deep neural network (DNN) models trained on such data to potential data poisoning attacks. In this type of assault, attackers can train the DNN model using poisoned data, potentially degrading its performance. Another type of data poisoning attack that is extremely relevant to our investigation is label flipping, in which the attacker manipulates the labels for a subset of data. It has been demonstrated that these assaults may drastically reduce system performance, even for attackers with minimal abilities. In this study, we propose a backdoor attack named 'DirtyFlipping', which uses dirty label techniques, "label-on-label", to input triggers (clapping) in the selected data patterns associated with the target class, thereby enabling a stealthy backdoor.</description>

      <title>Tunable X-band opto-electronic synthesizer with ultralow phase noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern communication, navigation, and radar systems rely on low noise and frequency-agile microwave sources. In this application space, photonic systems provide an attractive alternative to conventional microwave synthesis by leveraging high spectral purity lasers and optical frequency combs to generate microwaves with exceedingly low phase noise. However, these photonic techniques suffer from a lack of frequency tunability, and also have substantial size, weight, and power requirements that largely limit their use to laboratory settings. In this work, we address these shortcomings with a hybrid opto-electronic approach that combines simplified optical frequency division with direct digital synthesis to produce tunable low-phase-noise microwaves across the entire X-band. This results in exceptional phase noise at 10 GHz of -156 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset and fractional frequency instability of 1x10^-13 at 0.1 s. Spot tuning away from 10 GHz by 500 MHz, 1 GHz, and 2 GHz, yields phase noise at 10 kHz offset of -150 dBc/Hz, -146 dBc/Hz, and -140 dBc/Hz, respectively. The synthesizer architecture is fully compatible with integrated photonic implementations that will enable a versatile microwave source in a chip-scale package. Together, these advances illustrate an impactful and practical synthesis technique that shares the combined benefits of low timing noise provided by photonics and the frequency agility of established digital synthesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) provides a new electromagnetic response control solution, which can reshape the characteristics of wireless channels. In this paper, we propose a novel environment-aware codebook protocol for RIS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems. Specifically, we first introduce a channel training protocol which consists of off-line and on-line stages. Secondly, we propose an environment-aware codebook generation scheme, which utilizes the statistical channel state information and alternating optimization method to generate codewords offline. Then, in the on-line stage, we use these pre-designed codewords to configure the RIS, and the optimal codeword resulting in the highest sum rate is adopted for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Thirdly, we analyze the theoretical performance of the proposed protocol considering the channel estimation errors. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to verify our theoretical analysis and the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Model-Driven Deep Learning for Distributed Detection with Binary Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the realm of rapidly advancing wireless sensor networks (WSNs), distributed detection assumes a significant role in various practical applications. However, critical challenge lies in maintaining robust detection performance while operating within the constraints of limited bandwidth and energy resources. This paper introduces a novel approach that combines model-driven deep learning (DL) with binary quantization to strike a balance between communication overhead and detection performance in WSNs. We begin by establishing the lower bound of detection error probability for distributed detection using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion. Furthermore, we prove the global optimality of employing identical local quantizers across sensors, thereby maximizing the corresponding Chernoff information. Subsequently, the paper derives the minimum MAP detection error probability (MAPDEP) by inplementing identical binary probabilistic quantizers across the sensors. Moreover, the paper establishes the equivalence between utilizing all quantized data and their average as input to the detector at the fusion center (FC). In particular, we derive the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which measures the difference between the true posterior probability and output of the proposed detector. Leveraging the MAPDEP and KL divergence as loss functions, the paper proposes model-driven DL method to separately train the probability controller module in the quantizer and the detector module at the FC. Numerical results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves near-optimal performance with reduced complexity for Gaussian hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>From Learning to Analytics: Improving Model Efficacy with Goal-Directed Client Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is an appealing paradigm for learning a global model among distributed clients while preserving data privacy. Driven by the demand for high-quality user experiences, evaluating the well-trained global model after the FL process is crucial. In this paper, we propose a closed-loop model analytics framework that allows for effective evaluation of the trained global model using clients' local data. To address the challenges posed by system and data heterogeneities in the FL process, we study a goal-directed client selection problem based on the model analytics framework by selecting a subset of clients for the model training. This problem is formulated as a stochastic multi-armed bandit (SMAB) problem. We first put forth a quick initial upper confidence bound (Quick-Init UCB) algorithm to solve this SMAB problem under the federated analytics (FA) framework. Then, we further propose a belief propagation-based UCB (BP-UCB) algorithm under the democratized analytics (DA) framework. Moreover, we derive two regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, which increase logarithmically over the time horizon. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieve nearly optimal performance, with a gap of less than 1.44% and 3.12% under the FA and DA frameworks, respectively.</description>

      <title>Chebyshev and The Fast Fourier Transform Methods for Signal Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximation theorem is one of the most important aspects of numerical analysis that has evolved over the years with many different approaches. Some of the most popular approximation methods include the Lebesgue approximation theorem, the Weierstrass approximation, and the Fourier approximation theorem. The limitations associated with various approximation methods are too crucial to ignore, and thus, the nature of a specific dataset may require using a specific approximation method for such estimates. In this report, we shall delve into Chebyshev's polynomials interpolation in detail as an alternative approach to reconstructing signals and compare the reconstruction to that of the Fourier polynomials. We will also explore the advantages and limitations of the Chebyshev polynomials and discuss in detail their mathematical formulation and equivalence to the cosine function over a given interval [a, b].</description>

Abstract: Drones may be more advantageous than fixed cameras for quality control applications in industrial facilities, since they can be redeployed dynamically and adjusted to production planning. The practical scenario that has motivated this paper, image acquisition with drones in a car manufacturing plant, requires drone positioning accuracy in the order of 5 cm. During repetitive manufacturing processes, it is assumed that quality control imaging drones will follow highly deterministic periodic paths, stop at predefined points to take images and send them to image recognition servers. Therefore, by relying on prior knowledge about production chain schedules, it is possible to optimize the positioning technologies for the drones to stay at all times within the boundaries of their flight plans, which will be composed of stopping points and the paths in between. This involves mitigating issues such as temporary blocking of line-of-sight between the drone and any existing radio beacons; sensor data noise; and the loss of visual references. We present a self-corrective solution for this purpose. It corrects visual odometer readings based on filtered and clustered Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) data, as an alternative to direct Kalman fusion. The approach combines the advantages of these technologies when at least one of them works properly at any measurement spot. It has three method components: independent Kalman filtering, data association by means of stream clustering and mutual correction of sensor readings based on the generation of cumulative correction vectors. The approach is inspired by the observation that UWB positioning works reasonably well at static spots whereas visual odometer measurements reflect straight displacements correctly but can underestimate their length. Our experimental results demonstrate the advantages of the approach in the application scenario over Kalman fusion.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Design and Antenna Selection for Dynamic HRIS-aided Massive MIMO Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, a dynamic hybrid active-passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) is proposed to further enhance the massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) system, since it supports the dynamic placement of active and passive elements. Specifically, considering the impact of the hardware impairments (HWIs), we investigate the channel-aware configuration of the receive antennas at the base station (BS) and the active/passive elements at the HRIS to improve the reliability of system. To this end, we investigate the average mean-square-error (MSE) minimization problem for the HRIS-aided massive MIMO system by jointly optimizing the BS receive antenna selection matrix, the reflection phase coefficients, the reflection amplitude matrix, and the mode selection matrix of the HRIS under the power budget of the HRIS. To tackle the non-convexity and intractability of this problem, we first transform the binary and discrete variables into continuous ones, and then propose a penalty-based exact block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve these subproblems alternately. Numerical simulations demonstrate the great superiority of the proposed scheme over the conventional benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Green Probabilistic Semantic Communication with Rate Splitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the energy efficient design for probabilistic semantic communication (PSC) system with rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is investigated. Basic principles are first reviewed to show how the PSC system works to extract, compress and transmit the semantic information in a task-oriented transmission. Subsequently, the process of how multiuser semantic information can be represented, compressed and transmitted with RSMA is presented, during which the semantic compression ratio (SCR) is introduced to directly measure the computation overhead in a transmission task, and communication overhead is indirectly described as well. Hence, the problem of wireless resource allocation jointly considering the computation and communication consumption for the PSC system with RSMA is investigated. Both conventional wireless resource constraints and unique constraints on semantic communication are considered to maximize the energy efficiency (EE). Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Fluid Antenna Relay Assisted Communication Systems Through Antenna Location Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of resource allocation for fluid antenna relay (FAR) system with antenna location optimization. In the considered model, each user transmits information to a base station (BS) with help of FAR. The antenna location of the FAR is flexible and can be adapted to dynamic location distribution of the users. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem through jointly optimizing the antenna location and bandwidth allocation with meeting the minimum rate requirements, total bandwidth budget, and feasible antenna region constraints. To solve this problem, we obtain the optimal bandwidth in closed form. Based on the optimal bandwidth, the original problem is reduced to the antenna location optimization problem and an alternating algorithm is proposed. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the sum rate can be increased by up to 125% compared to the conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Network-Assisted Full-Duplex Cell-Free mmWave Networks: Hybrid MIMO Processing and Multi-Agent DRL-Based Power Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the network-assisted full-duplex (NAFD) cell-free millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, where the distribution of the transmitting access points (T-APs) and receiving access points (R-APs) across distinct geographical locations mitigates cross-link interference, facilitating the attainment of a truly flexible duplex mode. To curtail deployment expenses and power consumption for mmWave band operations, each AP incorporates a hybrid digital-analog structure encompassing precoder/combiner functions. However, this incorporation introduces processing intricacies within channel estimation and precoding/combining design. In this paper, we first present a hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing framework and derive explicit expressions for both uplink and downlink achievable rates. Then we formulate a power allocation problem to maximize the weighted bidirectional sum rates. To tackle this non-convex problem, we develop a collaborative multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm called multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MATD3) for NAFD cell-free mmWave networks. Specifically, given the tightly coupled nature of both uplink and downlink power coefficients in NAFD cell-free mmWave networks, the MATD3 algorithm resolves such coupled conflicts through an interactive learning process between agents and the environment. Finally, the simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel estimation methods within our hybrid MIMO processing paradigm, and demonstrate that our MATD3 algorithm outperforms both multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) and conventional power allocation strategies.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of RIS-Assisted Spatial Modulation for Downlink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the performance of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted spatial modulation (SM) downlink communication systems, focusing on the average bit error probability (ABEP). Notably, in scenarios with a large number of reflecting units, the composite channel can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution using the central limit theorem. The receiver utilizes a maximum likelihood detector to recover information in both spatial and symbol domains. In the proposed RIS-SM system, we analytically derive a closed-form expression for the union tight upper bound of ABEP, employing the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method. The validity of these results is rigorously confirmed through exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Movable Antenna-Aided Hybrid Beamforming for Multi-User Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this correspondence, we propose a movable antenna (MA)-aided multi-user hybrid beamforming scheme with a sub-connected structure, where multiple movable sub-arrays can independently change their positions within different local regions. To maximize the system sum rate, we jointly optimize the digital beamformer, analog beamformer, and positions of subarrays, under the constraints of unit modulus, finite movable regions, and power budget. Due to the non-concave/non-convex objective function/constraints, as well as the highly coupled variables, the formulated problem is challenging to solve. By employing fractional programming, we develop an alternating optimization framework to solve the problem via a combination of Lagrange multipliers, penalty method, and gradient descent. Numerical results reveal that the proposed MA-aided hybrid beamforming scheme significantly improves the sum rate compared to its fixed-position antenna (FPA) counterpart. Moreover, with sufficiently large movable regions, the proposed scheme with sub-connected MA arrays even outperforms the fully-connected FPA array.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates simultaneous transmission and reflection reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided physical layer security (PLS) in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where the base station (BS) transmits secrecy information with the aid of STAR-RIS against multiple eavesdroppers equipped with multiple antennas. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS and passive beamforming at the STAR-RIS, subject to the hardware constraint for STAR-RIS. To handle the coupling variables, a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is applied. In particular, the amplitudes and phases of STAR-RIS are divided into two blocks to simplify the algorithm design. Besides, by applying the Majorization-Minimization (MM) method, we derive a closed-form expression of the STAR-RIS's phase shifts. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, especially as the number of STAR-RIS elements increases.</description>

      <title>Joint Beam Scheduling and Beamforming Design for Cooperative Positioning in Multi-beam LEO Satellite Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperative positioning with multiple low earth orbit (LEO) satellites is promising in providing location-based services and enhancing satellite-terrestrial communication. However, positioning accuracy is greatly affected by inter-beam interference and satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. To select the best combination of satellites from visible ones and suppress inter-beam interference, this paper explores the utilization of flexible beam scheduling and beamforming of multi-beam LEO satellites that can adjust beam directions toward the same earth-fixed cell to send positioning signals simultaneously. By leveraging Cram\'{e}r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) to characterize user Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) positioning accuracy, the concerned problem is formulated, aiming at optimizing user positioning accuracy under beam scheduling and beam transmission power constraints. To deal with the mixed-integer-nonconvex problem, we decompose it into an inner beamforming design problem and an outer beam scheduling problem. For the former, we first prove the monotonic relationship between user positioning accuracy and its perceived signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to reformulate the problem, and then semidefinite relaxation (SDR) is adopted for beamforming design. For the outer problem, a heuristic low-complexity beam scheduling scheme is proposed, whose core idea is to schedule users with lower channel correlation to mitigate inter-beam interference while seeking a proper satellite-terrestrial topology geometry. Simulation results verify the superior positioning performance of our proposed positioning-oriented beamforming and beam scheduling scheme, and it is shown that average user positioning accuracy is improved by $17.1\%$ and $55.9\%$ when the beam transmission power is 20 dBw, compared to conventional beamforming and beam scheduling schemes, respectively.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Communication for Edge Video Analytics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and the increasing popularity of camera-equipped devices, many edge video analytics applications are emerging, calling for the deployment of computation-intensive AI models at the network edge. Edge inference is a promising solution to move the computation-intensive workloads from low-end devices to a powerful edge server for video analytics, but the device-server communications will remain a bottleneck due to the limited bandwidth. This paper proposes a task-oriented communication framework for edge video analytics, where multiple devices collect the visual sensory data and transmit the informative features to an edge server for processing. To enable low-latency inference, this framework removes video redundancy in spatial and temporal domains and transmits minimal information that is essential for the downstream task, rather than reconstructing the videos at the edge server. Specifically, it extracts compact task-relevant features based on the deterministic information bottleneck (IB) principle, which characterizes a tradeoff between the informativeness of the features and the communication cost. As the features of consecutive frames are temporally correlated, we propose a temporal entropy model (TEM) to reduce the bitrate by taking the previous features as side information in feature encoding. To further improve the inference performance, we build a spatial-temporal fusion module at the server to integrate features of the current and previous frames for joint inference. Extensive experiments on video analytics tasks evidence that the proposed framework effectively encodes task-relevant information of video data and achieves a better rate-performance tradeoff than existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04774v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio access networks (RANs) in monolithic architectures have limited adaptability to supporting different network scenarios. Recently, open-RAN (O-RAN) techniques have begun adding enormous flexibility to RAN implementations. O-RAN is a natural architectural fit for cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CFmMIMO) systems, where many geographically-distributed access points (APs) are employed to achieve ubiquitous coverage and enhanced user performance. In this paper, we address the decentralized pilot assignment (PA) problem for scalable O-RAN-based CFmMIMO systems. We propose a low-complexity PA scheme using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MA-DRL) framework in which multiple learning agents perform distributed learning over the O-RAN communication architecture to suppress pilot contamination. Our approach does not require prior channel knowledge but instead relies on real-time interactions made with the environment during the learning procedure. In addition, we design a codebook search (CS) scheme that exploits the decentralization of our O-RAN CFmMIMO architecture, where different codebook sets can be utilized to further improve PA performance without any significant additional complexities. Numerical evaluations verify that our proposed scheme provides substantial computational scalability advantages and improvements in channel estimation performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

Abstract: Classical graph matching aims to find a node correspondence between two unlabeled graphs of known topologies. This problem has a wide range of applications, from matching identities in social networks to identifying similar biological network functions across species. However, when the underlying graphs are unknown, the use of conventional graph matching methods requires inferring the graph topologies first, a process that is highly sensitive to observation errors. In this paper, we tackle the blind graph matching problem with unknown underlying graphs directly using observations of graph signals, which are generated from graph filters applied to graph signal excitations. We propose to construct sample covariance matrices from the observed signals and match the nodes based on the selected sample eigenvectors. Our analysis shows that the blind matching outcome converges to the result obtained with known graph topologies when the signal sampling size is large and the signal noise is small. Numerical results showcase the performance improvement of the proposed algorithm compared to matching two estimated underlying graphs learned from the graph signals.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), which simultaneously performs sensing and communication functions within a shared frequency band and hardware platform, has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless systems. Nevertheless, the weak echo signal received by the low-sensitivity ISAC receiver significantly constrains sensing performance in scenarios involving obstructed targets. Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has become a prospective solution by situationally manipulating the wireless propagations and amplifying the signals. In this paper, we investigate active RIS-empowered ISAC systems to enhance radar echo signal quality as well as communication performance. In particular, we focus on the joint design of the base station (BS) transmit precoding and the active RIS reflection beamforming to optimize the parameter estimation performance in terms of Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) subject to the communication users' signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and majorization-minimization (MM) is proposed to solve the formulated challenging non-convex problem. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the developed algorithm and the potential of employing active RIS in ISAC systems to enhance direct-of-arrival (DoA) estimation performance.</description>

Abstract: Digital twin channel (DTC) is the real-time mapping of a wireless channel from the physical world to the digital world, which is expected to provide significant performance enhancements for the sixth-generation (6G) air-interface design. In this work, we first define five evolution levels of channel twins with the progression of wireless communication. The fifth level, autonomous DTC, is elaborated with multi-dimensional factors such as methodology, characterization precision, and data category. Then, we provide detailed insights into the requirements and architecture of a complete DTC for 6G. Subsequently, a sensing-enhanced real-time channel prediction platform and experimental validations are exhibited. Finally, drawing from the vision of the 6G network, we explore the potential applications and the open issues in future DTC research.</description>

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects cognitive functions such as memory, thinking, and behavior. In this disease, there is a critical phase, mild cognitive impairment, that is really important to be diagnosed early since some patients with progressive MCI will develop the disease. This study delves into the challenging task of classifying Alzheimer's disease into four distinct groups: control normal (CN), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI), stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This classification is based on a thorough examination of PET scan images obtained from the ADNI dataset, which provides a thorough understanding of the disease's progression. Several deep-learning and traditional machine-learning models have been used to detect Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, three deep-learning models, namely VGG16 and AlexNet, and a custom Convolutional neural network (CNN) with 8-fold cross-validation have been used for classification. Finally, an ensemble technique is used to improve the overall result of these models. The results show that using deep-learning models to tell the difference between MCI patients gives an overall average accuracy of 93.13% and an AUC of 94.4%.</description>

      <title>A Robust UWOC-assisted Multi-hop Topology for Underwater Sensor Network Nodes</title>

Abstract: Underwater environment is substantially less explored territory as compared to earth surface due to lack of robust underwater communication infrastructure. For Internet of Underwater things connectivity, underwater wireless optical communication can play a vital role, compared to conventional radio frequency communication, due to longer range, high data rate, low latency, and unregulated bandwidth. This study proposes underwater wireless optical communication driven local area network UWOC LAN, comprised of multiple network nodes with optical transceivers. Moreover, the temperature sensor data is encapsulated with individual authentication identity to enhance the security of the framework at the user end. The proposed system is evaluated in a specially designed water tank of 4 meters. The proposed system evaluation analysis shows that the system can transmit underwater temperature data reliably in real time. The proposed secure UWOC LAN is tested within a communication range of 16 meters by incorporating multi hop connectivity to monitor the underwater environment.</description>

      <title>Visually Evaluating Generative Adversarial Networks Using Itself under Multivariate Time Series</title>

Abstract: Visually evaluating the goodness of generated Multivariate Time Series (MTS) are difficult to implement, especially in the case that the generative model is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We present a general framework named Gaussian GANs to visually evaluate GANs using itself under the MTS generation task. Firstly, we attempt to find the transformation function in the multivariate Kolmogorov Smirnov (MKS) test by explicitly reconstructing the architecture of GANs. Secondly, we conduct the normality test of transformed MST where the Gaussian GANs serves as the transformation function in the MKS test. In order to simplify the normality test, an efficient visualization is proposed using the chi square distribution. In the experiment, we use the UniMiB dataset and provide empirical evidence showing that the normality test using Gaussian GANs and chi sqaure visualization is effective and credible.</description>

      <title>Toward the application of XAI methods in EEG-based systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An interesting case of the well-known Dataset Shift Problem is the classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals in the context of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The non-stationarity of EEG signals can lead to poor generalisation performance in BCI classification systems used in different sessions, also from the same subject. In this paper, we start from the hypothesis that the Dataset Shift problem can be alleviated by exploiting suitable eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to locate and transform the relevant characteristics of the input for the goal of classification. In particular, we focus on an experimental analysis of explanations produced by several XAI methods on an ML system trained on a typical EEG dataset for emotion recognition. Results show that many relevant components found by XAI methods are shared across the sessions and can be used to build a system able to generalise better. However, relevant components of the input signal also appear to be highly dependent on the input itself.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy with Higher Utility by Exploiting Coordinate-wise Disparity: Laplace Mechanism can Beat Gaussian in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventionally, in a differentially private additive noise mechanism, independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise samples are added to each coordinate of the response. In this work, we formally present the addition of noise which is independent, but not identically distributed (i.n.i.d.) across the coordinates to achieve tighter privacy-accuracy trade-off by exploiting coordinate-wise disparity. In particular, we study the i.n.i.d. Gaussian and Laplace mechanisms and obtain the conditions under which these mechanisms guarantee privacy. The optimal choice of parameters that ensure these conditions are derived theoretically. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations demonstrate that the i.n.i.d. mechanisms achieve higher utility for the given privacy requirements compared to their i.i.d. counterparts. One of the interesting observations is that the Laplace mechanism outperforms Gaussian even in high dimensions, as opposed to the popular belief, if the irregularity in coordinate-wise sensitivities is exploited. We also demonstrate how the i.n.i.d. noise can improve the performance in the private empirical risk minimization through coordinate descent.</description>

      <title>Multi-Channel Orthogonal Transform-Based Perceptron Layers for Efficient ResNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a set of transform-based neural network layers as an alternative to the $3\times3$ Conv2D layers in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed layers can be implemented based on orthogonal transforms such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Hadamard transform (HT), and biorthogonal Block Wavelet Transform (BWT). Furthermore, by taking advantage of the convolution theorems, convolutional filtering operations are performed in the transform domain using element-wise multiplications. Trainable soft-thresholding layers, that remove noise in the transform domain, bring nonlinearity to the transform domain layers. Compared to the Conv2D layer, which is spatial-agnostic and channel-specific, the proposed layers are location-specific and channel-specific. Moreover, these proposed layers reduce the number of parameters and multiplications significantly while improving the accuracy results of regular ResNets on the ImageNet-1K classification task. Furthermore, they can be inserted with a batch normalization layer before the global average pooling layer in the conventional ResNets as an additional layer to improve classification accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A different method of discovering how neurons are connected to process information is presented here: Design a simple logic circuit that can perform a single, biologically advantageous function. Engineering concepts can be helpful in choosing the function and in designing the logic circuit. Several implementations of the method are reviewed to demonstrate how a biologically advantageous function can be chosen, how one simple network can generate major phenomena that are widely considered unrelated, and how one network design can lead to others that explain entirely different aspects of the brain. These results show that the method can benefit neuromorphic engineering as well as neuroscience, and that some brain functions can be carried out remarkably simply, at least in principle if not in the details.</description>

      <title>DANSE: Data-driven Non-linear State Estimation of Model-free Process in Unsupervised Learning Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the tasks of Bayesian state estimation and forecasting for a model-free process in an unsupervised learning setup. For a model-free process, we do not have any a-priori knowledge of the process dynamics. In the article, we propose DANSE -- a Data-driven Nonlinear State Estimation method. DANSE provides a closed-form posterior of the state of the model-free process, given linear measurements of the state. In addition, it provides a closed-form posterior for forecasting. A data-driven recurrent neural network (RNN) is used in DANSE to provide the parameters of a prior of the state. The prior depends on the past measurements as input, and then we find the closed-form posterior of the state using the current measurement as input. The data-driven RNN captures the underlying non-linear dynamics of the model-free process. The training of DANSE, mainly learning the parameters of the RNN, is executed using an unsupervised learning approach. In unsupervised learning, we have access to a training dataset comprising only a set of measurement data trajectories, but we do not have any access to the state trajectories. Therefore, DANSE does not have access to state information in the training data and can not use supervised learning. Using simulated linear and non-linear process models (Lorenz attractor and Chen attractor), we evaluate the unsupervised learning-based DANSE. We show that the proposed DANSE, without knowledge of the process model and without supervised learning, provides a competitive performance against model-driven methods, such as the Kalman filter (KF), extended KF (EKF), unscented KF (UKF), a data-driven deep Markov model (DMM) and a recently proposed hybrid method called KalmanNet. In addition, we show that DANSE works for high-dimensional state estimation.</description>

      <title>Random ISAC Signals Deserve Dedicated Precoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar systems typically employ well-designed deterministic signals for target sensing, while integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems have to adopt random signals to convey useful information. This paper analyzes the sensing and ISAC performance relying on random signaling in a multi-antenna system. Towards this end, we define a new sensing performance metric, namely, ergodic linear minimum mean square error (ELMMSE), which characterizes the estimation error averaged over random ISAC signals. Then, we investigate a data-dependent precoding (DDP) scheme to minimize the ELMMSE in sensing-only scenarios, which attains the optimized performance at the cost of high implementation overhead. To reduce the cost, we present an alternative data-independent precoding (DIP) scheme by stochastic gradient projection (SGP). Moreover, we shed light on the optimal structures of both sensing-only DDP and DIP precoders. As a further step, we extend the proposed DDP and DIP approaches to ISAC scenarios, which are solved via a tailored penalty-based alternating optimization algorithm. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DDP and DIP methods achieve substantial performance gains over conventional ISAC signaling schemes that treat the signal sample covariance matrix as deterministic, which proves that random ISAC signals deserve dedicated precoding designs.</description>

      <title>A Lightweight Architecture for Real-Time Neuronal-Spike Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrophysiological recordings of neural activity in a mouse's brain are very popular among neuroscientists for understanding brain function. One particular area of interest is acquiring recordings from the Purkinje cells in the cerebellum in order to understand brain injuries and the loss of motor functions. However, current setups for such experiments do not allow the mouse to move freely and, thus, do not capture its natural behaviour since they have a wired connection between the animal's head stage and an acquisition device. In this work, we propose a lightweight neuronal-spike detection and classification architecture that leverages on the unique characteristics of the Purkinje cells to discard unneeded information from the sparse neural data in real time. This allows the (condensed) data to be easily stored on a removable storage device on the head stage, alleviating the need for wires. Synthesis results reveal a &gt;95% overall classification accuracy while still resulting in a small-form-factor design, which allows for the free movement of mice during experiments. Moreover, the power-efficient nature of the design and the usage of STT-RAM (Spin Transfer Torque Magnetic Random Access Memory) as the removable storage allows the head stage to easily operate on a tiny battery for up to approximately 4 days.</description>

      <title>Joint Visibility Region and Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the joint visibility region (VR) detection and channel estimation (CE) problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems considering both the spherical wavefront effect and spatial non-stationary (SnS) property. Unlike existing SnS CE methods that rely on the statistical characteristics of channels in the spatial or delay domain, we propose an approach that simultaneously exploits the antenna-domain spatial correlation and the wavenumber-domain sparsity of SnS channels. To this end, we introduce a two-stage VR detection and CE scheme. In the first stage, the belief regarding the visibility of antennas is obtained through a VR detection-oriented message passing (VRDO-MP) scheme, which fully exploits the spatial correlation among adjacent antenna elements. In the second stage, leveraging the VR information and wavenumber-domain sparsity, we accurately estimate the SnS channel employing the belief-based orthogonal matching pursuit (BB-OMP) method. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms lead to a significant enhancement in VR detection and CE accuracy as compared to existing methods, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Brain-Computer-Interface (BCI) has been a hot research topic in the last few years that could help paralyzed people in their lives. Several researches were done to classify electroencephalography (EEG) signals automatically into English characters and words. Arabic language is one of the most used languages around the world. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no dataset for Arabic characters EEG signals. In this paper, we have created an EEG dataset for Arabic characters and named it ArEEG_Chars. Moreover, several experiments were done on ArEEG_Chars using deep learning. Best results were achieved using LSTM and reached an accuracy of 97%. ArEEG_Chars dataset will be public for researchers.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Antenna Based on User Distribution: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new six-dimensional (6D) movable antenna (6DMA) system for future wireless networks to improve the communication performance. Unlike the traditional fixed-position antenna (FPA) and existing fluid antenna/two-dimensional (2D) movable antenna (FA/2DMA) systems that adjust the positions of antennas only, the proposed 6DMA system consists of distributed antenna surfaces with independently adjustable three-dimensional (3D) positions as well as 3D rotations within a given space. In particular, this paper applies the 6DMA to the base station (BS) in wireless networks to provide full degrees of freedom (DoFs) for the BS to adapt to the dynamic user spatial distribution in the network. However, a challenging new problem arises on how to optimally control the 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces at the BS to maximize the network capacity based on the user spatial distribution, subject to the practical constraints on 6D antennas' movement. To tackle this problem, we first model the 6DMA-enabled BS and the user channels with the BS in terms of 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces. Next, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to search for the best 6D positions and rotations of all 6DMA surfaces by leveraging the Monte Carlo simulation technique. Specifically, we sequentially optimize the 3D position/3D rotation of each 6DMA surface with those of the other surfaces fixed in an iterative manner. Numerical results show that our proposed 6DMA-BS can significantly improve the network capacity as compared to the benchmark BS architectures with FPAs or 6DMAs with limited/partial movability, especially when the user distribution is more spatially non-uniform.</description>
