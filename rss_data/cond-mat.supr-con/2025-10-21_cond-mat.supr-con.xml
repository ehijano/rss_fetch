      <title>Marginal Influence of Anomalous Josephson Current on Odd-Frequency Spin-Triplet Pairing in Ferromagnetic Josephson Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine how an anomalous Josephson current influences odd-frequency superconducting correlations in two distinct Josephson junction geometries. The first configuration consists of two ferromagnetic layers sandwiched between conventional s-wave superconductors, with the magnetization vectors of the ferromagnets misaligned. The second involves three ferromagnetic layers embedded between two s-wave superconductors, with their magnetizations oriented along the x-, y-, and z-axes, respectively. In the first case, where the anomalous Josephson current is absent, odd-frequency spin-triplet correlations develop pronounced peaks at finite magnetization strengths in both the tunneling and transparent limits, while the equal-spin triplet component exhibits zeros at finite magnetizations in the transparent regime. In the second configuration, where an anomalous Josephson current is present, similar peaks in odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing appear at finite magnetizations under both transport regimes, and the spatial profile of these correlations remains largely unaffected by the current\rq{}s presence. The Josephson diode efficiency is finite and attains its maximum at magnetization values corresponding to the peaks of the anomalous current. Overall, our results demonstrate that the anomalous Josephson current has only a marginal effect on odd-frequency spin-triplet pairing, suggesting that the emergence of odd-frequency correlations and the Josephson diode effect are largely independent phenomena, contrary to some earlier conjectures.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature signatures of underlying superconductivity in the electron-doped Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform numerically exact determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model and analyze pairing tendencies by evaluating correlation functions at the imaginary-time midpoint ($\tau=\beta/2$), which suppresses high-frequency weight and emphasizes low-energy physics. Using this diagnostic, we identify clear finite-temperature signatures of underlying $d$-wave superconductivity for electron doping, while finding no clear indication upon cooling for hole doping. Our analysis enables direct comparison with ground-state DMRG, revealing consistent real-space pairing patterns. These results provide a practical route to bridge the gap between finite-temperature and ground-state numerically exact simulations of the Hubbard model despite the fermion sign problem.</description>

      <title>Tuning macroscopic phase frustration in multiorbital superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry-breaking (TRSB) superconductivity has been reported in a growing number of materials. In some cases, TRSB arises naturally from chiral superconductivity, but in many low-symmetry systems this explanation is not viable. In these latter cases, TRSB is often attributed to phase frustration among multiple superconducting gaps on different Fermi surfaces. Yet, the microscopic conditions enabling such frustration remain poorly understood. Here, inspired by the TRSB reported in the superconducting state of iron-based materials, we demonstrate that a minimal two-orbital model can support a TRSB superconducting state via phase frustration. We identify the key microscopic parameters that stabilize TRSB in d-electron systems with orthorhombic symmetry and provide a framework to systematically enlarge the region of parameter space within which TRSB is expected in materials with other electronic content and crystalline symmetries. Our results offer a simple and experimentally relevant route to understand and control TRSB in multiorbital superconductors.</description>

      <title>Zero resistance when metals mixed with insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A false zero resistance behavior was observed during our study on the search of superconductivity in Ge-doped GaNb4Se8. This zero resistance was proved to be caused by open-circuit in multi-phase samples comprised of metals and insulators by measuring with four-probe method. The evidence strongly suggests that the reported superconductivity in hydrides should be carefully re-checked.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Superconducting Diode Effect in the Asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a nonreciprocal supercurrent, has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications. However, most studies have focused on weakly correlated models, leaving the impact of strong electron-electron interactions on the SDE largely unexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by investigating the SDE in asymmetric band metals with Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interaction, which are exactly solvable due to their locality in Bloch momentum space. Through a combination of low-energy analysis and a numerical self-consistent approach, we demonstrate that HK interaction can enhance the SDE's quality factor. Our findings shed light on the role of strong electron-electron correlations in shaping the SDE.</description>

      <title>Anomalous terahertz nonlinearity in disordered s-wave superconductor close to the superconductor-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of the Higgs mode in superconductors using nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy is a key area of interest in condensed matter physics. We investigate the influence of disorder on the nonlinear terahertz response and the Higgs mode in NbN thin films with varying Ioffe-Regel parameters ($k_Fl$). In strongly disordered films near the superconductor-insulator transition (SIT), we observe an anomalous third-harmonic generation (THG) signal above $T_c$, which is absent in both cleaner superconducting and non-superconducting counterparts. The persistence of this normal-state THG signal in a high magnetic field excludes superconducting fluctuations as its origin. Below $T_c$, the THG intensity increases sharply, indicating a dominant contribution from the driven Higgs mode. The THG spectrum of the strongly disordered sample exhibits a broadened, multi-peak structure, which we attribute to quantum path interference between distinct channels involving unpaired electrons and Cooper pairs within emergent superconducting islands. Our findings not only demonstrate how disorder tunes the nonlinear terahertz response but also uncover a strong coupling between electrons responsible for normal-state THG and the superconducting Higgs mode below $T_c$ in strongly disordered samples.</description>

      <title>AtomBench: A Benchmark for Generative Atomic Structure Models using GPT, Diffusion, and Flow Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE), and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made publicly available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/atombench_inverse.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermometric sensing: Local vs. Remote approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermometry leveraging quantum sensors is investigated with an emphasis on fundamental precision bounds derived from quantum estimation theory. The proposed sensing platform consists of two dissimilar qubits coupled via capacitor, which induce quantum oscillations in the presence of a thermal environment. Thermal equilibrium states are modeled using the Gibbs distribution. The precision limits are assessed through the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the Hilbert-Schmidt Speed (HSS), serving as stringent criteria for sensor sensitivity. Systematic analysis of the dependence of QFI and HSS on tunable parameters -such as qubit energies and coupling strengths- provides optimization pathways for maximizing temperature sensitivity. Furthermore, we explore two distinct quantum thermometry paradigms: (I) local temperature estimation directly performed by Alice, who possesses the quantum sensor interfacing with the thermal bath, and (II) remote temperature estimation conducted by Bob, facilitated via quantum teleportation. In the latter scenario, temperature information encoded in the qubit state is transmitted through a single-qubit quantum thermal teleportation protocol. Our findings indicate that direct measurement yields superior sensitivity compared to remote estimation, primarily due to the inherent advantage of direct sensor-environment interaction. The analysis reveals that increasing Josephson energies diminishes sensor sensitivity, whereas augmenting the mutual coupling strength between the qubits enhances it.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Momentum-Resolved Static Spin Susceptibility in a Mott-Proximate Cuprate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the temperature dependence of the static spin susceptibility at $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$ and $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, 0)$ in a Mott-proximate cuprate model with an antinodal pseudogap -- a model system for high-temperature superconducting (HTSC) cuprates.
  The results show the susceptibility onset temperature tracks the critical temperature ($T_c$) of HTSCs with a comparable scale across the electron filling factor. Also, as the electron filling decreases and the chemical potential approaches the antinodal van Hove region, the susceptibility at $\mathbf{q}=(\pi,0)$ -- the axial particle-hole response -- grows markedly.
  The emergence of cuprate superconductivity correlates with a suppression of low-energy antinodal spin response and associated particle-hole excitations, which would otherwise dephase $d$-wave pairing, commonly attributed to spin fluctuations. In this context, the pseudogap partially suppresses antinodal spectral weight near $\omega = 0$, thereby reducing the low-$\omega$ particle-hole phase space.</description>

      <title>Kinetically-induced bound states in a frustrated Rydberg tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how particles bind into composite objects is a ubiquitous theme in physics, from the formation of molecules to hadrons in quantum chromodynamics and the pairing of charge carriers in superconductors. The formation of bound states usually originates from attractive interactions between particles. However, the binding can also arise purely from the motion of dopants due to kinetic frustration, which is potentially related to unconventional pairing in moir\'e materials. Here, we report the first direct observation of kinetically-induced bound states between holes and magnons using a Rydberg atom array quantum simulator of the bosonic $t$-$J$ model in frustrated ladders and 2D lattices. First, we demonstrate the formation of mobile one-hole-one-magnon bound states. We then construct three-particle one-hole-two-magnon bound states and reveal the underlying binding mechanism by observing kinetically-induced singlet correlations. Finally, we investigate how mobile dopants structure their magnetic environment in a spin-balanced 2D triangular lattice, showing that a hole induces $120^\circ$ antiferromagnetic order, while a doublon dopant generates in-plane ferromagnetic correlations. Our results demonstrates compelling evidence of kinetically-induced binding, opening a new avenue to understand novel pairing mechanisms in correlated quantum materials like superconductors in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Giant thermal modulation via a semiconductor-superconductor photonic field-effect heat transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a groundbreaking demonstration of thermal modulation in a field-effect-controllable semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structure, wherein the heating mechanism is exclusively radiative. The architecture comprises two reservoirs separated by $\sim 1$ mm and interconnected via a completely non-galvanic electrical circuit, enabling the transfer of black-body radiation from the hot to the cold reservoir. Our device utilizes a superconducting Josephson field-effect transistor to achieve magnetic-field-free gate-tunable regulation of heat currents within the circuit. While prior studies have indicated the potential for electrostatic modulation of thermal transport properties, our framework demonstrates a temperature modulation of up to $\sim 45$ mK, exceeding prior findings by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, it proves a thermal transimpedance of $\sim 20$ mK/V at a bath temperature of $30$ mK. The development of such systems holds substantial promise for advancing heat management and routing in quantum chips and radiation sensors, as it enables precise nonlocal control of heat flow towards a designated structure, even when the heat source is distant and non-galvanically coupled.</description>

      <title>Fluxoid valve effect in full-shell nanowire Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of supercurrent valve based on full-shell nanowires. These hybrid wires consist of a semiconductor core fully wrapped in a thin superconductor shell and subjected to an axial magnetic field. Due to the tubular shape of the shell, the superconductor phase acquires an integer number $n$ of $2\pi$ twists or \textit{fluxoids} that increases in steps with applied flux. By connecting two such hybrid wires, forming a Josephson junction (JJ), a flux-modulated supercurrent develops. If the two superconducting sections of the JJ have different radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, they can develop equal or different fluxoid numbers $n_1,n_2$ depending on the field. If $n_1\neq n_2$ the supercurrent is blocked, while it remains finite for $n_1=n_2$. This gives rise to a fluxoid valve effect controlled by the applied magnetic field or a gate voltage at the junction. We define a fluxoid-valve quality factor that is perfect for cylindrically symmetric systems and decreases as this symmetry is reduced. We further discuss the role of Majorana zero modes at the junction when the full-shell nanowires are in the topological superconducting regime.</description>

      <title>Eliashberg theory prediction of critical currents in superconducting thin films under DC electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting thin metallic films, functioning as supercurrent gate-tunable transistors, have considerable potential for future quantum electronic devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive microscopic quantitative mechanism that elucidates the control or suppression of supercurrents in thin films remains elusive. Focusing on NbN, a prototypical material, and starting from a phenomenological ansatz that links the critical electric field with the kinetic energy parameter needed to break Cooper pairs, we provide a quantitative analysis of the critical current using Eliashberg theory in the dirty limit without adjustable parameters. The critical kinetic energy value is identified, corresponding to the maximum supercurrent that can flow in the thin film. The peak in supercurrent density as a function of the Cooper pairs' kinetic energy arises from the interplay between the increase in supercurrent due to increased kinetic energy and the depairing effect when the kinetic energy becomes sufficiently large. The critical value of the pair's kinetic energy is subsequently employed to estimate the critical value of an external electric field required to suppress superconductivity in the sample. This estimation is in parameter-free agreement with the experimental observations. Although the disorder reduces the temperature dependence of the gating effect on the critical current, at the same time, it increases the unscreened critical electric field needed to suppress superconductivity. This enables the proposal of methods to control and reduce the critical field value necessary to suppress superconductivity in superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Induced phase transitions and spontaneous symmetry breaking based on the renormalized Ginzburg-Landau theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present theoretical investigations of phase transitions and critical phenomena in materials through the lens of second-order Ginzburg-Landau theory, in conjunction with considerations of symmetry groups and thermal fluctuations. By addressing the residual effects after a renormalization process, a small number of macroscopic degrees of freedom can effectively replace the infinite number of microscopic degrees of freedom, emphasizing the significant role of dimensionality and the intrinsic characteristics of the system in understanding and analyzing transitions. We highlight several non-universal characteristics of continuous phase transitions near the transition temperature, including the non-monotonic relationship between the critical temperature and dimensionality, as well as the enhancement or disappearance of the specific heat jump in complex superconductors. While the resulting expressions for thermodynamic quantities are complex for one-dimensional systems, obeying Mermin-Wagner's theorem, they are considerably simplified for two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Strong enhancement of d-wave superconductivity in an extended checkerboard Hubbard ladder</title>

Abstract: By employing the density-matrix renormalization group method, we study an extended checkerboard Hubbard model on the two-leg ladder, which includes an intraplaquette nearest-neighbour attraction V. The simulated results show that V plays a significant role in enhancing the d-wave superconductivity when the electron density is close to half-filling. In the homogeneous case t'=t (t and t' are the intraplaquette and interplaquette hopping integrals), large critical |Vc| is required to induce the superconducting ground state. With decreasing t', |Vc| is substantially diminished and the pair state has a nearly C4 symmetry. In the extremely inhomogeneous case t'&lt;0.2t, the system transits to the d-wave superconducting phase at V\sim-0.3t and V\sim-0.4t for U=8t and U=12t, respectively, accompanying with a shift of spin and single-particle excitations from gapless to gapped type.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall conductivity of electron-doped cuprates: Electrons and phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently become clear that phonons generate a sizable thermal Hall effect in cuprates, whether they are undoped, electron-doped or hole-doped (inside the pseudogap phase). At higher doping, where cuprates are reasonably good metals, mobile electrons also generate a thermal Hall effect, the thermal equivalent of the standard electrical Hall effect. Here we show that in the cleanest crystals of the electron-doped cuprate Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_{x}$CuO$_{4}$, at high doping, the phonon and electron contributions to the thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ are of comparable magnitude, but of opposite sign. In samples of lower quality, phonons dominate $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$, resulting in a negative $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ at all temperatures. The fact that the negative phononic $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ in the metallic state is similar in magnitude and temperature dependence to that found in the insulating state at lower doping rules out any mechanism based on skew scattering of phonons off charged impurities, since a local charge should be screened in the metallic regime. The phononic $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ is found to persist over the entire doping range where antiferromagnetic correlations are known to be significant, suggesting that such correlations may play a role in generating the phonon thermal Hall effect in electron-doped cuprates. If the same mechanism is also at play in hole-doped cuprates, the presence of a phononic $\kappa_{\rm {xy}}$ below (and only below) the critical doping $p^{\star}$ would be evidence that spin correlations are a property of the pseudogap phase.</description>

      <title>Interplay of correlations and Majorana mode from local solution perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasiparticle spectrum of a hybrid system, comprising a correlated (Anderson-type) quantum dot coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire hosting the Majorana boundarymodes. From the exact solution of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, we uncover a subtle interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the Majorana mode. Our analytical expressions show that the spectral weight of the leaking Majorana mode is sensitive to both the quantum dot energy level and the repulsive potential. We compare our results with estimations by L.S. Ricco et al. Phys. Rev. B 99, 155159 (2019) obtained for the same hybrid structure using the Hubbard-type decoupling scheme, and analytically quantify the spectral weight of the zero-energy (topological) mode coexisting with the finite-energy (trivial) states of the quantum dot. We also show that empirical verification of these spectral weights could be feasible through spin-polarized Andreev spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Giant and robust Josephson diode effect in multiband topological nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically predict the giant and robust Josephson diode effect in quasi-one-dimensional topological Majorana nanowires in the regime with multiple subbands, which is expected to be relevant for the real experiment. In the multiband regime, the Majorana bound states and conventional Andreev bound states can naturally coexist, and respectively contribute to the fractional and conventional parts in the Josephson effect, with the former/latter having 4$\pi$/2$\pi$-periodicity. We show that the interplay between the two types of bound modes can produce a robust and giant diode effect in the deep topological phase regime. Notably, we unveil a novel spin parity exchange mechanism, occurring only in the multiband regime, which leads to a robust high efficiency plateau of the giant diode effect. This effect is a nontrivial consequence of the balanced Fermi moment shifts of the multiple subbands in tuning the external magnetic field. Our finding highlights the subband engineering as a powerful tool to optimize the Josephson diode effect realistically and provides a new feasible signature to identify topological phase regime in superconducting nanowires.</description>
