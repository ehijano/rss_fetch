      <title>Fracture and size effect in mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resort to variational methods to evaluate the asymptotic behavior of fine metamaterials as a function of cell size. To zeroth order, the metamaterial behaves as a micropolar continuum with both displacement and rotation degrees of freedom, but exhibits linear-elastic fracture mechanics scaling and therefore no size effect. To higher order, the overall energetics of the metastructure can be characterized explicitly in terms of the solution of the zeroth-order continuum problem by the method of {\Gamma}-expansion. We present explicit expressions of the second-order correction for octet frames. As an application, we evaluate the compliance of double-cantilever octet specimens to second order and use the result to elucidate the dependence of the apparent toughness of the specimen on cell size. The analysis predicts the discreteness of the metamaterial lattice to effectively shield the crack-tip, a mechanism that we term lattice shielding. The theory specifically predicts anti-shielding, i. e., coarser is weaker, in agreement with recent experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic potential of a uniformly charged disk through Green's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All existing derivations of the electrostatic potential of a uniformly charged disk are technically rather involved. In an old and now almost forgotten publication, Duffin and McWhirter proposed a method for calculating the electrostatic potentials of planar bodies by a skillful application of Green's theorem. It is shown that this method significantly simplifies the problem of calculating the electrostatic potential of a uniformly charged disk and makes it an almost trivial task.</description>

      <title>A convolutional model for estimating the junction temperatures of SiC MOSFET transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The junction temperature is a very important parameter for monitoring power electronics converters based on MOSFET transistors. They offer the possibility of switching at relatively higher frequencies than other transistors like IGTBTs. However, the electrical parameters of MOSFETs are highly thermally dependent. The thermo-dependence of MOSFET electrical parameters is rarely taken into consideration when implementing control strategies, for many technological reasons, such as the difficulty of measuring the junction temperature. In practice, the junction temperature of transistors is inaccessible for direct measurement. The presence of a gel covering the chips, that provides electrical and thermal insulation, makes measurement by infrared thermography impossible. Furthermore, direct thermocouple measurement cannot be implemented due to the electromagnetic disturbances in the environment. Several researchers have attempted to correlate chip temperature with thermosensitive electrical parameters. In the present work, a thermal convolutive model has been developed to estimate the junction temperatures of two MOSFET transistors belonging to the same electronic circuit from external temperature measurements in two well-chosen locations (far away enough from the junction to avoid electromagnetic interference), using also the measured power dissipated on each chip. The thermal coupling between the two transistors has been considered in the form of mutual transmittances. The model was first calibrated using three-dimensional numerical simulations in COMSOL Multiphysics, followed by an experimental study. The results are very promising, illustrating the robustness of the convolutional model.</description>

      <title>Action principles for dissipative, non-holonomic Newtonian mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10616v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A methodology for deriving dual variational principles for the classical Newtonian mechanics of mass points in the presence of applied forces, interaction forces, and constraints, all with a general dependence on particle velocities and positions, is presented. Methods for incorporating constraints are critically assessed. General theory, as well as explicitly worked out variational principles for a dissipative system (due to Lorenz) and a system with anholonomic constraints (due to Pars) are demonstrated. Conditions under which a (family of) dual Hamiltonian flow(s), as well as a constant(s) of motion, may be associated with a conservative or dissipative, and possibly constrained, primal system naturally emerge in this work.</description>

      <title>Simple model for the kinetics of stimuli-responsive gels with porous structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stimuli-responsive gels are the gels that vary the volume depending on environmental conditions. It has been reported that the stimuli-responsive gel with an inhomogeneous structure exhibits faster volume change than the gel without it. It is understood as a difference in the transfer dynamics of the solvent, though, there are few models for discussing the effect of inhomogeneity explicitly. In this paper, we propose a simple model for the kinetics of volume change by introducing inhomogeneity as the probability distribution for a random variable that characterizes the structure. Under this framework, we demonstrate that inhomogeneity actually increases the rate of volume change. Furthermore, through analysis of a simplified example, we show that some features that are often seen in experiments can be reproduced by the model. This model provides a simple equation for the time series of volume change that can be used to characterize the experimental data based on a simple physical picture of the phenomenon.</description>
