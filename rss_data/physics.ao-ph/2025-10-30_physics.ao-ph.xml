      <title>Finding optimal Noah-MP parameterizations for the characterization of surface heat fluxes in the Iberian Peninsula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Land surface models (LSMs) play a crucial role in characterizing land-atmosphere interactions by providing boundary conditions to regional climate models (RCMs). This is particularly true over the Iberian Peninsula (IP), where a water-limited regime governs much of the territory. We optimize the configuration of the Noah land surface model with multiparameterization options (Noah-MP) for characterizing heat fluxes in the IP when the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model v3.9.1 is used as an RCM. We perform 70 one-year simulations using 35 Noah-MP combinations, for a dry year (2005) and a wet year (2010). Land-surface heat fluxes and soil moisture from WRF/Noah-MP are evaluated against FLUXNET station data and the CERRA-Land reanalysis. In general, WRF/Noah-MP reproduces soil moisture and surface heat fluxes well over the IP, especially under wetter conditions. Clustering identifies an optimal configuration from 10 groups (A to J). The Noah-MP options with greatest impact are canopy stomatal resistance (CRS), surface exchange coefficient for heat (SFC), soil-moisture factor controlling stomatal resistance (BTR), runoff and groundwater (RUN), and surface resistance to evaporation/sublimation (RSF); dynamic vegetation (DVEG) also matters. Several configurations performed reasonably; experiment s27I (Jarvis CRS, Chen97 SFC, CLM-type BTR, BATS RUN, and adjusted Sellers RSF for wet soils) provides a particularly good characterization of heat fluxes over the IP.</description>

      <title>Fire Behavior Monitoring using MeteoSat Third Generation, FCI-FireDyn algorithm: Rate Of Spread and Burnt Area Dynamics for large fire event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents FCI-FireDyn, a new algorithm developed to monitor wildfire dynamics using the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) onboard the Meteosat Third Generation satellite. Leveraging the high temporal resolution of FCI (10-minute full-disk observations), the algorithm derives fire arrival time maps, rate of spread (ROS), and Burn Area (BA) evolution at sub-kilometer spatial resolution and 2-minute temporal intervals. The method combines threshold-based MWIR detection, spatio-temporal interpolation to reconstruct fire front progression and ROS fields at 175 m resolution. FCI-FireDyn was tested on three major fire events in Southern Europe (Portugal, Greece, and France) from the 2024 2025 seasons. The retrieved BA and Fire Growth Rate show good agreement with reference datasets from EFFIS, Copernicus EMS, and PT-FireSprd, with total final BA deviations below 20%. The algorithm captures distinct propagation phases, including acceleration episodes that precede FRP peaks, highlighting a potential for NRT fire behavior monitoring. Despite limitations due to FCI spatial resolution, results demonstrate that it provides sufficient spatio-temporal coverage to estimate front-scale fire dynamics. FCI-FireDyn thus represents a proof of concept for deriving high-frequency fire behavior metrics from geostationary observations to support operational and modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Graph Networks for Accurate Weather Forecasting via Lightweight Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure. Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends, weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in the supplementary materials.</description>
