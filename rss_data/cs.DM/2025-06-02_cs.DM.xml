      <title>Cartesian Prime Graphs and Cospectral Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing larger families of connected cospectral graphs from two given cospectral families of sizes $p$ and $q$. The resulting family size depends on the Cartesian primality of the input graphs and can be one of $pq$, $p + q - 1$, or $\max(p, q)$, based on the strictness of the applied conditions. Under the strictest condition, our method generates $O(p^3q^3)$ new cospectral triplets, while the more relaxed conditions yield $\varOmega(pq^3 + qp^3)$ such triplets. We also use the existence of specific cospectral families to establish that of larger ones.</description>

      <title>A first view on the density of 5-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $k$-planar graphs are generalizations of planar graphs that can be drawn in the plane with at most $k &gt; 0$ crossings per edge. One of the central research questions of $k$-planarity is the maximum edge density, i.e., the maximum number of edges a $k$-planar graph on $n$ vertices may have. While there are numerous results for the classes of general $k$-planar graphs for $k\leq 2$, there are only very few results for increasing $k=3$ or $4$ due to the complexity of the classes. We make a first step towards even larger $k&gt;4$ by exploring the class of $5$-planar graphs. While our main tool is still the discharging technique, a better understanding of the structure of the denser parts leads to corresponding density bounds in a much simpler way.
  We first apply a simplified version of our technique to outer $5$-planar graphs and use the resulting density bound to assert that the structure of maximally dense $5$-planar graphs differs from the uniform structure when $k$ is small. As the central result of this paper, we then show that simple $5$-planar graphs have at most $\frac{340}{49}(n-2) \approx 6.94(n-2)$ edges, which is a drastic improvement from the previous best bound of $\approx8.3n$. This even implies a small improvement of the leading constant in the Crossing Lemma $cr(G) \ge c \frac{m^3}{n^2}$ from $c=\frac{1}{27.48}$ to $c=\frac{1}{27.19}$. To demonstrate the potential of our new technique, we also apply it to other graph classes, such as 4-planar and 6-planar graphs.</description>

      <title>On the maximum number of edges of outer k-planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the maximum number of straight-line segments connecting $n$ points in convex position in the plane, so that each segment intersects at most $k$ others. This question can also be framed as the maximum number of edges of an outer $k$-planar graph on $n$ vertices. We outline several approaches to tackle the problem with the best approach yielding an upper bound of $(\sqrt{2}+\varepsilon)\sqrt{k}n$ edges (with $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ for sufficiently large $k$). We further investigate the case where the points are arbitrarily bicolored and segments always connect two different colors (i.e., the corresponding graph has to be bipartite). To this end, we also consider the maximum cut problem for the circulant graph $C_n^{1,2,\dots,r}$ which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Computational Search for Minimal Obstruction Graphs for the Lov\'{a}sz--Schrijver SDP Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lift-and-project relaxations of the stable set polytope of graphs generated by $\text{LS}_+$, the SDP lift-and-project operator devised by Lov\'{a}sz and Schrijver. In particular, we focus on searching for $\ell$-minimal graphs, which are graphs on $3\ell$ vertices whose stable set polytope has rank $\ell$ with respect to $\text{LS}_+$. These are the graphs which are the most challenging for the $\text{LS}_+$ operator according to one of the main complexity measures (smallest graphs with largest $\text{LS}_+$-rank). We introduce the notion of $\text{LS}_+$ certificate packages, which is a framework that allows for efficient and reliable verification of membership of points in $\text{LS}_+$-relaxations. Using this framework, we present numerical certificates which (combined with other results) show that there are at least $49$ $3$-minimal graphs, as well as over $4000$ $4$-minimal graphs. This marks a significant leap from the $14$ $3$-minimal and $588$ $4$-minimal graphs known before this work, with many of the newly-discovered graphs containing novel structures which helps enrich and recalibrate our understanding of $\ell$-minimal graphs. Some of this computational work leads to interesting conjectures. We also find all of the smallest vertex-transitive graphs with $\text{LS}_+$-rank $\ell$ for every $\ell \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Functionality and Symmetric Difference -- Two Intriguing Graph Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functionality ($\mathrm{fun}$) is a graph parameter that generalizes graph degeneracy defined by Alecu et al. [JCTB, 2021]. They research the relation of functionality to many other graphs parameters (tree-width, clique-width, VC-dimension, etc.). Extending their research, we completely characterize the functionality of random graph $G(n,p)$ for all possible $p$. We provide matching (up to a constant factor) lower and upper bound for a large range of $p$. It follows from our bounds for $G(n,p)$, that the maximum functionality (roughly $\sqrt{n}$) is achieved for $p \approx 1/\sqrt{n}$. We complement this by showing that every graph $G$ on $n$ vertices have $\mathrm{fun}(G) \le O(\sqrt{ n \ln n})$ and we give a nearly matching $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$-lower bound provided by incident graphs of projective planes. Previously known lower bounds for functionality were only logarithmic in the number of vertices.
  Further, we study a related graph parameter symmetric difference ($\mathrm{sd}$), the minimum of $|N(u) ~\Delta~ N(v)|$ over all pairs of vertices of the ``worst possible'' induced subgraph. It was observed by Alecu et al. that $\mathrm{fun}(G) \le \mathrm{sd}(G)+1$ for every graph $G$. They asked whether the functionality of interval graphs is bounded. Recently, Dallard et al. [RiM, 2024] answered this positively and they constructed an interval graph $G$ with $\mathrm{sd}(G) = \Theta(\sqrt[4]{n})$ (even though they did not mention the explicit bound), i.e., they separate the functionality and symmetric difference of interval graphs. We show that $\mathrm{sd}$ of interval graphs is at most $O(\sqrt[3]{n})$ and we provide a different example of an interval graph $G$ with $\mathrm{sd}(G) = \Theta(\sqrt[4]{n})$. Further, we show that $\mathrm{sd}$ of circular arc graphs is $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Complexity of Multi-Objective Integer Network Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>Feedback Arc Sets and Feedback Arc Set Decompositions in Weighted and Unweighted Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any arc-weighted oriented graph $D=(V(D), A(D),w)$, we write
  ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ to denote the minimum weight of a feedback arc set in $D$. In this paper, we consider upper bounds on ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ for arc-weight oriented graphs $D$ with bounded maximum degrees and directed girth. We obtain such bounds by introducing a new parameter ${\rm fasd}(D)$, which is the maximum integer such that $A(D)$ can be partitioned into ${\rm fasd}(D)$ feedback arc sets. This new parameter seems to be interesting in its own right.
  We obtain several bounds for both ${\rm fas}_w(D)$ and ${\rm fasd}(D)$ when $D$ has maximum degree $\Delta(D)\le \Delta$ and directed girth $g(D)\geq g$. In particular, we show that if $\Delta(D)\leq~4$ and $g(D)\geq 3$, then ${\rm fasd}(D) \geq 3$ and therefore ${\rm fas}_w(D)\leq \frac{w(D)}{3}$ which generalizes a tight bound for an unweighted oriented graph with maximum degree at most 4. We also show that ${\rm fasd}(D)\geq g$ and ${\rm fas}_w(D) \leq \frac{w(D)}{g}$ if $\Delta(D)\leq 3$ and $g(D)\geq g$ for $g\in \{3,4,5\}$ and these bounds are tight. However, for $g=10$ the bound ${\rm fasd}(D)\geq g$ does not always hold when $\Delta(D)\leq 3$. Finally we give some bounds for the cases when $\Delta$ or $g$ are large.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hilbert Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hilbert transform has been one of the foundational transforms in signal processing, finding it's way into multiple disciplines from cryptography to biomedical sciences. However, there does not exist any quantum analogue for the Hilbert transform. In this work, we introduce a formulation for the quantum Hilbert transform (QHT)and apply it to a quantum steganography protocol. By bridging classical phase-shift techniques with quantum operations, QHT opens new pathways in quantum signal processing, communications, sensing, and secure information hiding.</description>
