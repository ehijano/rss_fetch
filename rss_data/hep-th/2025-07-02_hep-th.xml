      <title>Observational Signatures of Pseudoaxion Resonances: Transient Geometry and Axion-Graviton Conversion in String-Theoretic Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel observational strategy for the detection of pseudoaxions, emerging as transient resonances tied explicitly to the evolution of internal geometry in string theory and brane-world cosmologies. Building upon our previous work identifying pseudoaxions as resulting from topologically transient cycles-pseudo-cycles-revealed by persistent homology, we detail how cosmological expansion and geometric flattening in compactified extra dimensions dynamically modulate pseudoaxion parameters. These modulations trigger resonant phenomena, distinct from standard axion scenarios, such as enhanced axion-graviton conversion and observable gravitational wave polarisation asymmetries. We explicitly describe how geometric transitions within Calabi-Yau manifolds and D-brane configurations determine these resonance conditions. Finally, we discuss the clear, experimentally distinguishable signatures these transient pseudoaxions produce, focusing on gravitational wave observations, and outline observational tests within current and future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Orthogonality of Q-Functions up to Wrapping in Planar N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct orthogonality relations in the Separation of Variables framework for the sl(2) sector of planar N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. Specifically, we find simple universal measures that make Q-functions of operators with different spins vanish at all orders in perturbation theory, prior to wrapping corrections. To analyze this rank-one sector, we relax some of the assumptions thus far considered in the Separation of Variables framework. Our findings may serve as guidelines for extending this formalism to other sectors of the theory as well as other integrable models</description>

      <title>Quantum K-theory levels in physics and math</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to describe the basics of a dictionary between Chern-Simons levels in three-dimensional gauged linear sigma models (GLSMs) and the (coincidentally-named) Ruan-Zhang levels for twisted quantum K-theory in mathematics. Each defines a twisting of quantum K-theory, and our proposed dictionary identifies these two twistings, in the cases of projective spaces, Grassmannians, and flag manifolds. We verify the dictionary by realizing the Coulomb branch equations as symbols of certain differential operators annihilating a twisted version of the I function associated to the abelianized GLSM theory, and also by comparing the geometric window for Chern-Simons levels to an analogous window for the Ruan-Zhang levels. In the process, we interpret the geometric window for the Chern-Simons levels in terms of equalities of I and J functions. This provides a fuller mathematical understanding of some special cases in the physics literature. We also make conjectures for twisted quantum K-theory of gerbes, following up earlier conjectures on ordinary quantum K-theory of gerbes.</description>

      <title>Sparsity in the numerical six-point bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper contributes to an ongoing effort to extend the conformal bootstrap beyond its traditional focus on systems of four-point correlation functions. Recently, it was demonstrated that semidefinite programming can be used to formulate a six-point generalisation of the numerical bootstrap, yielding qualitatively new, rigorous bounds on CFT data. However, the numerical six-point bootstrap requires solving SDPs involving infinite-dimensional matrices, which has so far limited its applicability and hindered scalability in early implementations. This work overcomes the challenges by using sparse matrix decompositions to exploit the banded structure of the underlying SDP. The result is a rewriting of one-dimensional six-point bootstrap problems as effectively two-dimensional standard mixed correlator four-point bootstrap computations. As application, novel bounds whose extremal correlators interpolate between the six-point functions of the generalised free fermion and boson are derived. The extremal interpolations are matched with perturbative deformations of the massive free boson in AdS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Non-linear asymptotic symmetries in warped AdS$_3$ holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warped AdS$_3$ backgrounds provide set-ups to study holography beyond AdS and, in particular, holography for near-extremal Kerr black holes. A certain $U(1)$ charged warped BTZ background supported by pure NS-NS flux was constructed in string theory in arXiv:2111.02243. While older works found, in absence of $U(1)$ charges, that the warped black holes' thermal entropy obeys a Cardy formula, the addition of $U(1)$ charges in arXiv:2111.02243 leads to the universal entropy formula in a $J\bar{T}$-deformed CFT and not to the charged Cardy formula. In this article, we explore further the implications of this result for warped AdS$_3$ holography. We compute the asymptotic symmetries of the warped BTZ background of arXiv:2111.02243 and obtain an infinite-dimensional non-linear Poisson algebra that can be linearized, after a non-linear redefinition of generators, to two commuting copies of the $(Virasoro\times U(1)Kac-Moody)$ algebra. The algebra matches the symmetry algebra of a symmetric product orbifold of $J\bar{T}$-deformed CFTs. We contrast the results with those for a similar warped BTZ background supported by both NS-NS and RR flux.</description>

      <title>Hotter and Colder Than Unruh: Probing the Kappa Rindler Vacuum with an Accelerated Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the response of an accelerated Unruh-DeWitt detector to a one-parameter family of "kappa Rindler" vacua, which generalize the standard Unruh effect. These states, parameterized by $\kappa$, continuously interpolate between the Rindler ($\kappa \to 0$) and Minkowski ($\kappa=1$) vacua. We find the detector registers a perfect thermal bath at a tunable temperature $T_\kappa = \kappa T_U$. This result establishes a framework for environments perceived as both "hotter" ($\kappa&gt;1$) and "colder" ($\kappa&lt;1$) than the standard Unruh temperature. We establish this thermality by demonstrating the KMS condition for the Wightman function and by analyzing the associated particle creation process. Furthermore, we visualize the spacetime structure of the created field quanta, revealing an intuitive link between the $\kappa$-controlled symmetry of the modes and the perceived temperature. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for a modulated Unruh effect, bridging formal QFT with clear visual intuition.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel Methods for Multiloop Calculations in Curved Spacetime: Nonzero Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper we have presented a general formalism for computing Feynman diagrams for scalar fields in curved spacetime at any loop order using heat kernel methods. The main technique used is the expansion of the fully off-diagonal heat kernel in Riemann normal coordinates. In this work we extend this to include fields of nonzero spin, in particular spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions.</description>

      <title>Symmetry theta angles and topological Witten effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of $\theta$ angles in quantum field theory that we call symmetry $\theta$ angles. Unlike conventional $\theta$ angles whose definition depends on a choice of a path integral, symmetry $\theta$ angles are intrinsic parameters of a quantum field theory that depend only on its symmetries. A frequent consequence of symmetry $\theta$ angles is a phenomenon we call the topological Witten effect, which is a generalization of the standard Witten effect. Topological Witten effects modify which charged operators are attached to topological operators as a function of $\theta$. Physically, topological Witten effects induce generalized Aharonov-Bohm effects. We show that these new $\theta$ angles and Witten effects can appear in many familiar field theories.</description>

      <title>Chiral higher-spin symmetry of the celestial twistor sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chiral higher-spin symmetry of the celestial twistor sphere via the chiral higher-spin algebras $\mathfrak{ca}$ associated with certain holomorphic higher-spin theories in twistor space. The chiral higher-spin algebras $\mathfrak{ca}$ are non-unitary $W_{1+\infty}[\mathfrak{g}]$ algebras in the sense that their higher-spin generators can have negative conformal dimensions. We study $\mathfrak{ca}$ up to first order in quantum correction. In particular, we show that the $\mathfrak{ca}$ associated with anomaly-free holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories are associative themselves, while the chiral algebras associated with anomalous holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories only become associative upon enlarging $\mathfrak{ca}$ by introducing suitable axionic currents. Furthermore, we compute four-dimensional form factors -- interpreted as genuine scattering amplitudes in the integrable sector -- via correlation functions of some chiral CFTs that can source higher-spin currents of $\mathfrak{ca}$ on the celestial twistor sphere. Notably, we observe that higher-spin form factors do not always vanish, suggesting the existence of some mysterious bulk theories.</description>

      <title>Double Copy Map for Double Field Theory on an Arbitrary Constant Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double field theory (DFT) can be constructed up to third order as the double copy of Yang- Mills theory. In this construction, one starts with Yang-Mills theory on Minkowski space and the resulting DFT action is also defined on Minkowski space. In this work, I extend this double copy procedure to obtain a DFT action on a constant DFT background starting from two Yang-Mills actions constructed around nontrivial background gauge fields on Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>Coexisting Flux String Vacua from Numerical K\"ahler Moduli Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of K\"ahler moduli stabilisation in Type IIB flux compactifications, combining advanced numerical techniques with analytical methods. Our JAX-based computational framework enables efficient scanning of the UV parameter space, while incorporating $\alpha'$ corrections, loop and non-perturbative effects, as well as uplift contributions to the scalar potential. The implementation features rigorous vacuum validation protocols derived from analytic results. We apply our methods to explicit flux compactifications on more than 80,000 Calabi-Yau threefolds with $h^{1,1}\leq 6$ K\"ahler moduli. By systematically scanning over a wide range of values of the flux superpotential $W_0$ and the string coupling $g_s$, we find explicit realisations of every established K\"ahler moduli stabilisation scenario: for $10^{-15} \leq |W_0| \leq 10^{-2}$ we obtain both KKLT-like and K\"ahler uplifted vacua, while for the broader range $10^{-1} \leq |W_0| \leq 10^2$ we recover LVS as well as LVS-like hybrid solutions. Notably, we discover significant parameter regions where multiple vacua coexist within a single flux potential, including novel configurations pairing AdS, Minkowski, and dS minima with different volume hierarchies. These findings enable, for the first time, the analysis of vacuum decay processes within fixed flux configurations, complementing the established theory of transitions between distinct flux vacua and decays towards decompactification.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative resolutions and pre-quotients of Calabi-Yau double covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following an earlier proposal arXiv:2307.02038 to apply the GLSM formalism to understand the so-called non-commutative resolution, this paper takes one important step further to extend this formalism to a much larger class of non-commutative resolutions. The proposal was initially motivated by the discovery of a new class of mirror pairs singular Calabi-Yau varieties arXiv:2003.07148, given by certain branched double covers over toric varieties of MPCP type. The overarching problem was to understand these mirror pairs from the viewpoint of homological mirror symmetry arXiv:alg-geom/9411018. In the present paper, we propose two main results along this line. First, one new insight is that the `gauge-fixing' condition on the branching locus of the double cover used in arXiv:2003.07148 can be relaxed in an interesting way. This turns out to produce GLSMs that describe a much larger class of non-commutative resolutions, leading to $A$-periods for a larger class of non-commutative resolutions, as well as the GKZ systems for their $A$-periods. Second, we show that the $A$-periods can also be realized as $A$-periods of a certain smooth CICY family in a toric variety of MPCP type, such that a suitable finite quotient of this family recovers the double cover CY we have started with. We call this CICY family the `pre-quotient' of the double cover CY. This realization strongly suggests that pre-quotient may provide an important approach for understanding homological mirror symmetry for singular double cover CY varieties and non-commutative resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the potential experimental relevance of magnetically affected heavy-quark diffusion, we consider here a five-dimensional nonlinear Einstein-Born-Infeld-dilaton model to not only holographically model the QCD thermodynamics in a magnetic background, but also to probe the charged inner structure of a heavy quarkonium. The dual model's gravitational equations of motion can be solved in analytical form via the potential reconstruction method. Using a variety of tools -- spectral functions, hydrodynamic expansions or hanging strings -- we study the anisotropic diffusion constants and heavy-quark number susceptibility, each time reporting closed form expressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Celestial holography suggests, among other things, that collinear singularities of graviton scattering amplitudes are described by the OPEs of some putative dual CFT. One of the great successes has been the insight that this duality is true at tree-level which led to the discovery of new infinite dimensional symmetry algebras of tree-level amplitudes in flat space closely related to w$_{1+\infty}$. This thesis studies these celestial chiral algebras in the light of twistor theory and derives tree-level deformations thereof induced by non-trivial background geometries that solve some form of the self-dual Einstein equations.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds on field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime: purity vs scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study perturbative unitarity bounds on the field-space curvature in de Sitter spacetime, using the momentum-space entanglement approach recently proposed by Pueyo, Goodhew, McCulloch, and Pajer. As an illustration, we perform a perturbative computation of the purity in two-scalar models and compare the resulting unitarity bounds with those obtained via a flat space approximation. In particular, we find that perturbative unitarity imposes an upper bound on the field-space curvature of the Hubble scale order, in addition to a bound analogous to the flat space result. This reflects the thermal nature of de Sitter spacetime. We also discuss generalizations to higher-dimensional field spaces.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Universe from Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a single constrained scalar field with non-minimal coupling to gravity can give rise to an accelerating Universe. First, we consider this model in the absence of external matter. In the original Jordan frame, we show that the dynamics of space-time is independent of the value of the cosmological constant. We find analytical solutions, which include evolution from a radiation dominated-like universe to an exponential expansion, as well as evolution that starts with super-Hubble expansion and then relaxes towards an exponential expansion of the Universe. We also show that the scalar perturbations of this theory are well-behaved in the Jordan frame. Furthermore, we perform the formulation of the corresponding theory in the Einstein frame, and analyse the corresponding accelerating solutions. Second, we consider the model in the presence of matter. We find that the matter does not affect the evolution of the universe if minimally coupled to the scalar field. In other words, in the Jordan frame, in order to influence the evolution of the space-time, the matter should be non-minimally coupled to the constrained scalar, while it may be minimally coupled to gravity. We show that in this case, the solutions are similar to the free case, and, in addition, allow for the phantom-like equation of state. Finally, we consider the theory in the minimal frame, in which the matter is minimally coupled to both gravity and the constrained scalar, and show that among other possibilities, the phantom-like equation of state can still be satisfied in this minimal frame.</description>

      <title>Finite-cutoff Holographic Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for holographic thermodynamics in finite-cutoff holography, extending the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence to incorporate a finite radial cutoff in the bulk and a $T^2$-deformed CFT on the boundary. We formulate the first laws of thermodynamics for a Schwarzschild-AdS (SAdS) black hole with a Dirichlet cutoff on the quasilocal boundary and its dual deformed CFT, introducing the deformation parameter as a thermodynamic variable. The holographic Euler relation for the deformed CFT and its equation of state are derived, alongside the Smarr relation for the bulk. We show that the Rupert teardrop coexistence curve defines a phase space island where deformation flow alters states, with up to three deformed CFTs or cut-off SAdS sharing a same phase transition temperature, one matching the seed CFT or original SAdS. These results offer insights into gravitational thermodynamics with boundary constraints and quantum gravity in finite spacetime regions.</description>

      <title>Singularities of massless scattering and cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partial flag varieties arise in the context of massless scattering kinematics. They can be associated to both spinor-helicity variables and momentum twistor variables in two separate yet natural ways. Here we report on evidence at five and six points that the cluster algebras associated to these partial flag varieties contain information relevant to non-dual conformal massless scattering amplitudes and related observables. At five points both spinor-helicity and momentum twistor cluster structures capture similar information about symbol alphabets. At six points we demonstrate that the momentum twistor structure captures a larger subset of the alphabet compared to the spinor-helicity one. We also observe that the associated cluster structures correctly predict the appearance of certain triples of symbol letters related to cluster mutation relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrates that the single-field inflation field system exhibits a symmetry that constrains its evolution via the Ward identity even for non-attractor inflation. By analyzing loop diagram structures, we derive a superhorizon conserved quantity directly related to the two-point correlation function of curvature perturbations, generalizing previous one-loop results to arbitrary loop orders. This symmetry-based approach provides a framework for understanding quantum conservation laws beyond the leading perturbative order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schwarzschild solution describes a classical static black hole in general relativity. When general relativity is extended by including semiclassical corrections in the form of a renormalized energy-momentum tensor, the horizon of the Schwarzschild black hole disappears and is replaced by a wormhole. We study the stability of this quantum corrected static Schwarzschild solution in semiclassical gravity by using it as the initial data of a dynamical evolution. We find that the quantum corrected solution is unstable and that the wormhole can expand or collapse when perturbed. In vacuum, the wormhole expands, but in the presence of even a small amount of classical matter, the wormhole collapses, forming a horizon and evolving to an evaporating black hole.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>

      <title>Covariant Lie Derivatives and (Super-)Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The slightly subtle notion of covariant Lie derivatives of \textit{bundle-valued} differential forms is crucial in many applications in physics, notably in the computation of conserved currents in gauge theories, and yet the literature on the topic has remained fragmentary. This note provides a complete and concise mathematical account of covariant Lie derivatives on a spacetime (super-)manifold $M,$ defined via choices of lifts of spacetime vector fields to principal $G$-bundles over it, or equivalently, choices of covariantization correction terms on spacetime. As an application in the context of (super-)gravity, two important examples of covariant Lie derivatives are presented in detail, which have not appeared in unison and direct comparison: $\bf{(i)}$ The natural covariant Lie derivative relating (super-)diffeomorphism invariance to local translational (super-)symmetry, and $\bf{(ii)}$ the Kosmann Lie derivative relevant to the description of isometries of (super-)gravity backgrounds. Finally, we use the latter to rigorously justify the usage of the traditional (non-covariant) Lie derivative on coframes and associated fields in dimensional reduction scenarios along abelian $G$-fibers, an issue which has thus far remained open for topologically non-trivial spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Trace Anomaly and Confinement in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate confinement in QCD as an entropic surface phenomenon. Quark and gluon quantum information is localized on a two-dimensional transverse sheet of radius $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ where the von Neumann entropy of the vacuum attains its maximum. Lattice QCD determinations of scalar (trace) gravitational form factors fix both $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and the transverse trace-anomaly density $\rho_h(R_{\mathrm{EE}})$ with percent-level accuracy, enabling a parameter-free mechanical entropy $S_{\mathrm{EE}}(y)=c_h\,y$ that grows linearly with rapidity $y$. The associated entropy gradient changes sign at $R_{\mathrm{EE}}$: it repels color fields for $r&lt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$ and attracts them for $r&gt;R_{\mathrm{EE}}$, trapping partons at all scales -- UV and IR -- in contrast to Wilson's area law, which probes only long distances. Squaring the entropy density, as required by unitarity, yields $\sigma\propto y^{\delta}$. World data demand $\delta=2$ for elastic $pp\,(p\bar p)$ scattering and heavy-quark photoproduction, but a softer $\delta=0.387$ for $\phi$ photoproduction, all two orders of magnitude below the Froissart--Martin bound. These results provide the first confinement criterion derived directly from nonperturbative QCD, unifying the trace anomaly, entanglement entropy, and high-energy scattering within a single quantitative framework.</description>

Abstract: In this talk, we review recent results in testing spacetime symmetries in gravitational physics. Topics discussed include new signals for hypothetical Lorentz and diffeomorphism symmetry violations in short-range gravity tests. We review results for multipole expansions that predict extra polarizations for gravitational waves. Both explicit and spontaneous spacetime-symmetry breaking origins are considered. We also discuss recent numerical results for black hole solutions in a vector field model of spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Power-Law Bounces in $f(R)$ Gravity: Analysis of the Ekpyrosis and Accelerating Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker spacetime within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity using a compact, model-independent dynamical systems approach. By assuming a power-law scale factor, we explore ekpyrotic and accelerating solutions to address the big bang singularity. Our analysis demonstrates that a cosmological bounce, characterized by a transition from contraction to expansion, possibly avoids the singularity without directly using the Raychaudhuri equation, unlike previous approaches using specific $f(R) \simeq R^n$ forms. We identify a key fixed point in the phase space corresponding to the bounce, supported by perturbation analysis and qualitative description of trajectories in the phase space. The results suggest that $f(R)$ gravity provides a robust framework for non-singular cosmologies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the structure and representation theory of finite-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-graded Lie algebras, including the corresponding root systems and Verma, irreducible, and Harish-Chandra modules. This extends the familiar theory for finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebras to a much wider class of Lie algebras, and opens up for advances and applications in areas relying on ad-hoc approaches. Physically relevant examples are afforded by the Heisenberg and conformal Galilei algebras, including the Schr\"odinger algebras, whose $\mathbb{Z}$-graded structures are yet to be fully exploited.</description>

Abstract: Carrollian field theories are usually understood as limits of relativistic theories. In this note, we use Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles equipped with a principal connection to construct Carrollian sigma models intrinsically. The resulting theories are neither ``electric'' nor ``magnetic'' in the usual sense. As a physically suggestive example, we derive a Carrollian wave equation governing the dynamics of a scalar field on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise calculation of gravitational wave (GW) and particle emissions from cosmic string networks is of significant theoretical and experimental interest. In this Letter, we perform numerical simulations of near-global and local string networks, comparing the GW spectra predictions from both lattice field simulation and the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation methods. We find the discrepancy between the GW spectra computed via the NG approximation and the lattice field simulation is negligible for near-global string and grow with increasing gauge coupling. Additionally, we confirm that particle emission significantly dominates energy emission, with the ratio of GW energy to particle energy approximately $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ for both near-global and local string scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight dark matter refers to the lightest potential dark matter candidates. We will focus on the mass range that has been studied using astrophysical and cosmological observations, corresponding to a mass $10^{-24} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m \lesssim 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{eV}$. We will discuss the motivations for this mass range. The most studied model in this range corresponds to a minimally coupled, single, classical, spin-0 field comprising all dark matter. However, the work exploring extensions of this model (for example, higher spin, self-coupled, multiple field, and mixed models) will be one of the focuses of this review. The phenomenology associated with ultralight dark matter is rich and includes linear effects on the primordial power spectrum, core structures forming at the center of halos, nonlinear effects resulting in heating of stellar distributions, and non-relativistic effects relating to pulsar signals and black hole superradiance, to name a few. This set of effects has been studied using an equally extensive set of numerical tools. We will summarize the most common ones and discuss their applications and limitations. Ultralight dark matter also has a wide variety of observational constraints, including halo mass functions, the Lyman-alpha forest, halo density profiles, stellar dynamics, and black hole spins. We will review them focusing on the observations made, the method of study, and the major systematics. We will end with a discussion of the current status of the field and future work needed.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of rescattering effect on vector mesons spin alignment at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin alignment of vector mesons in heavy-ion collisions provides a novel probe of quark polarization and hadronization mechanism in quark-gluon plasma. Hadronic rescattering may affect the measured spin alignment of vector mesons due to non-uniform rescattering probability in non-central heavy-ion collisions. Using the UrQMD model, we systematically investigated the hadronic rescattering effect on the measurement of $\rho_{00}$, the spin alignment parameter, for $K^{*0}$, $\phi$, and $\rho^{0}$ mesons in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 7.7 - 200 GeV. Our results reveal that the measurable $\rho_{00} - 1/3$ remains unaffected for $\phi$, while shows significantly negative (positive) deviations for $K^{*0}$ and $\rho^0$ with respect to the reaction (production) plane. Quantitatively, the maximum deviation reaches $-0.0056$ ($0.0268$) for $K^{*0}$ and $-0.0122$ ($0.0414$) for $\rho^{0}$ with respect to the reaction (production) plane. Notably, the deviations in $\rho_{00}$ for both $K^{*0}$ and $\rho^{0}$ increase monotonically with increasing collision energy. These findings underscore the critical necessity of accounting for rescattering effects when interpreting spin alignment measurements of short-lived vector mesons in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: Based on considerations of quantum gravity, global symmetries which lead to axions as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons after low scale symmetry breaking cannot be exact at the Planck scale. Here, we show that Planck-suppressed terms which yield this symmetry breaking may provide a non-inflationary misalignment mechanism which can generate coherent oscillations of the axion and axion-like particle (ALP) fields at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Lecture Notes on Operator Algebras and Quantum Field Theory</title>

Abstract: Lecture notes prepared for the EMS--IAMP Spring School ``Symmetries and Measurement in Quantum Field Theory''. This set of lecture notes covers four lectures: 1. Operator Algebras and Quantum Field Theory, 2. Tomita-Takesaki Modular Theory of von Neumann Algebras and the Bisognano-Wichmann/Borchers Theorem, 3. Local Covariant Quantum Field Theory, 4. Temperature and Entropy-Area Relation of Quantum Fields near Horizons of Dynamical Black Holes. The basic aim is to provide an introduction into some of the contemporary concepts and methods of quantum field theory in the operator-algebraic framework (lectures 1 to 3), and to illustrate (in lecture 4) how they may be applied in a theme of both perpetual and current interest - the ``thermodynamics'' (and also, the ``information content'') of quantum matter in the vicinity of black holes. While the topic of ``measurement'' in quantum field theory is not covered in these lectures (this topic has been presented in the lectures of Chris Fewster [arXiv:2504.17437]), the topic of``symmetry'' in quantum field theory does make an appearance: On one hand, in the form of the geometric action of Tomita-Takesai modular objects associated with certain operator algebras and states as stated in the theorems by Bisognano-Wichmann, and by Borchers, and on the other hand, in the form of local general covariance.
  The Spring School took place at the University of York, UK, April 7-11, 2025, organized by C.J. Fewster, D.W. Janssen and K. Rejzner, and funded by EPSRC Grant EP/Y000099/1 to the University of York, the European Mathematical Society, the International Association of Mathematical Physics, and COST Action (European Cooperation in Science and Technology) CA23115: Relativistic Quantum Information. The material presented in these notes is an expanded version of the material presented during the lectures by the author.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Periodic Motion near Higher-Derivative Einstein-\AE ther Black Holes</title>

Abstract: Higher-derivative modifications of general relativity are generically expected from effective field theory approaches to quantum gravity, and they arise naturally in Lorentz-violating theories such as Einstein-Ether gravity. In this work, we investigate black hole spacetimes within Einstein-Ether theory supplemented by quadratic curvature corrections, including terms proportional to $R^2$, $R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu}$, and $R_{\mu\nu\lambda\rho} R^{\mu\nu\lambda\rho}$. We derive the corrected static, spherically symmetric metric perturbatively and examine its effects on the geodesic structure and gravitational wave emission. In particular, we analyze periodic timelike orbits in this background and compute the associated tensor-mode gravitational waveforms using the quadrupole approximation. Our results demonstrate that even small higher-derivative corrections can induce distinguishable shifts in the orbital dynamics and imprint characteristic phase modulations and harmonic deformations in the gravitational wave signal. These effects modify the frequency spectrum and amplitude envelope of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ in a manner sensitive to the coupling constants $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$, and the Ether parameter $c_{13}$. The resulting signatures provide a potential observational window into ultraviolet deviations from general relativity and Lorentz symmetry in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Black holes and wormholes in Deser-Woodard gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deser-Woodard gravity is a modified theory of gravity in which nonlocality plays a central role. In this context, nonlocality is consequence of the inverse of the d'Alembertian operator $\square^{-1}$ in the effective action. Here, analytic black hole and wormhole solutions are built in the revised Deser-Woodard theory following a recent approach, where a special tetrad frame simplifies the complicated field equations of the theory. From deviations of the Schwarzschild metric and Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, one obtains trasversable wormholes, singular black holes and a regular black hole as solutions of the vacuum field equations of the theory. Also, the auxiliary fields, which are responsible for the nonlocality, are computed. And even for a regular black solution, in which spacetime does not contain a curvature singularity, the corresponding auxiliary fields diverge at the event horizon.</description>

Abstract: We prove that irreducible Calabi-Yau varieties of a fixed dimension, admitting a fibration by abelian varieties or primitive symplectic varieties of a fixed analytic deformation class, are birationally bounded. We prove that there are only finitely many deformation classes of primitive symplectic varieties of a fixed dimension, admitting a Lagrangian fibration. We also show that fibered Calabi-Yau 3-folds are bounded. Conditional on the generalized abundance or hyperk\"ahler SYZ conjecture, our results prove that there are only finitely many deformation classes of hyperk\"ahler varieties, of a fixed dimension, with $b_2 \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Running Quantum Computers in Discovery Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using quantum computers in conjunction with classical machine learning to discover instances of interesting quantum many-body dynamics. Concretely, an ``interest function'' is defined for a given circuit (family) instance that can be evaluated on a quantum computer. The circuit is then adapted by a classical learning agent to maximize interest. We illustrate this approach using two examples and show numerically that, within a sufficiently general circuit family, two simple interest functions based on (i) classifiability of evolved states and (ii) spectral properties of the unitary circuit, are maximized by discrete time crystals (DTCs) and dual-unitary circuits, respectively. For (i), we also simulate the adaptive optimization and show that it indeed finds DTCs with high probability. Our study suggests that learning agents with access to quantum-computing resources can discover new phenomena in many-body quantum dynamics, and establishes the design of good interest functions as a future research paradigm for quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological scaling of precursor domain walls</title>

Abstract: Domain wall (DW) networks have a large impact on cosmology and present interesting dynamics that can be controlled by various scaling regimes. In the first stage after spontaneous breaking of the discrete symmetry, the network is seeded with `DW precursors', the zeros of a tachyonic field. At sufficiently weak coupling, this stage can be quite long. The network is then driven to a non-relativistic scaling regime: in flat spacetime the correlation length grows like $L\sim t^{\kappa}$ with $\kappa=1/2$. We focus on the precursor regime in cosmology, assuming a power-law scale factor $a\propto t^\alpha$. We obtain the scaling exponent as a function of the external parameter, $\kappa(\alpha)$, by explicit computation in $1+1$ and $2+1$ dimensions, and find a smooth transition from nonrelativistic scaling with $\kappa\simeq 1/2$ for $\alpha\lesssim1/2$ to DW gas regime $\kappa \simeq \alpha$ for $\alpha\gtrsim1/2$, confirming previous arguments. The precise form of the transition $\kappa(\alpha)$ is surprisingly independent of dimension, suggesting that similar results should also be valid in $3+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>A time operator and the time-of-arrival problem in quantum field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Newton-Wigner states and operator are widely accepted to provide an adequate notion of spatial localization of a particle in quantum field theory on a spacelike hypersurface. Replacing the spacelike with a timelike hypersurface, we construct one-particle states of massive Klein-Gordon theory that are localized on the hypersurface in the temporal as well as two spatial directions. This addresses the longstanding problem of a "time operator" in quantum theory. It is made possible by recent advances in quantization on timelike hypersurfaces and the introduction of evanescent particles. As a first application of time-localized states, we consider the time-of-arrival problem. Our results are in accordance with semiclassical expectations of causal propagation of massless and massive particles. As in the Newton-Wigner case, localization is not perfect, but apparent superluminal propagation is exponentially suppressed.</description>

      <title>Super-$\mathrm{Lie}_\infty$ T-Duality and M-Theory</title>

Abstract: Super $L_\infty$-algebras unify extended super-symmetry with rational classifying spaces for higher flux densities: The super-invariant super-fluxes which control super $p$-branes and their supergravity target super-spaces are, together with their (non-linear) Bianchi identities, neatly encoded in (non-abelian) super-$L_\infty$ cocycles. These are the rational shadows of flux-quantization laws (in ordinary cohomology, K-theory, Cohomotopy, iterated K-theory, etc).
  We first review, in streamlined form while filling some previous gaps, double-dimensional reduction/oxidation and 10D superspace T-duality along higher-dimensional super-tori. We do so tangent super-space wise, by viewing it as an instance of adjunctions (dualities) between super-$L_\infty$-extensions and -cyclifications, applied to the avatar super-flux densities of 10D supergravity. In particular, this yields a derivation, at the rational level, of the traditional laws of "topological T-duality" from the super-$L_\infty$ structure of type II superspace. At this level, we also discuss a higher categorical analog of T-duality involving M-branes.
  Then, by considering super-space T-duality along all 1+9 spacetime dimensions while retaining the 11th dimension as in F-theory, we find the M-algebra appearing as the complete brane-charge extension of the fully T-doubled/correspondence super-spacetime. On this backdrop, we recognize the "decomposed" M-theory 3-form on the "hidden M-algebra" as an M-theoretic lift of the Poincar\'e super 2-form that controls superspace T-duality as the integral kernel of the super Fourier-Mukai transform. This provides the super-space structure of an M-theory lift of the doubled/correspondence space geometry, which controls T-duality.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi entropy of single-character CFTs on the torus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonperturbative approach to calculate the R\'enyi entropy of a single interval on the torus for single-character (meromorphic) conformal field theories. Our prescription uses the Wro\'nskian method of Mathur, Mukhi, and Sen [Nucl. Phys. B312, 15 (1989)], in which we construct differential equations for torus conformal blocks of the twist two-point function. As an illustrative example, we provide a detailed calculation of the second R\'enyi entropy for the $\rm E_{8,1}$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model. We find that the $\mathbb Z_2$ cyclic orbifold of a meromorphic conformal field theory (CFT) results in a four-character CFT which realizes the toric code modular tensor category. The $\mathbb Z_2$ cyclic orbifold of the $\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model, however, yields a three-character CFT since two of the characters coincide. We then compute the torus conformal blocks and find that the twist two-point function, and therefore the R\'enyi entropy, is two-periodic along each cycle of the torus. The second R\'enyi entropy for a single interval of the $\rm E_{8,1}$ WZW model has the universal logarithmic divergent behavior in the decompactification limit of the torus, as expected as well as the interval approaches the size of the cycle of the torus. Furthermore, we see that the $q$-expansion is UV finite, apart from the leading universal logarithmic divergence. We also find that there is a divergence as the size of the entangling interval approaches the cycle of the torus, suggesting that gluing two tori along an interval the size of a cycle is a singular limit.</description>

      <title>Holographic QCD phase diagram for a rotating plasma in the Hawking-Page approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effect of rotation and finite chemical potential in the confinement/deconfinement transition of strongly interacting matter. The holographic description consists of a five-dimensional geometry that contains a black hole (BH) in the deconfined (plasma) phase. The geometry is equipped with some cut-off that introduces an infrared energy scale. We consider two possibilities: the so-called hard wall and soft wall AdS/QCD models. The transition between the plasma and hadronic phases is represented holographically as a Hawking-Page transition between geometries with and without a black hole. The gravitational dual of the rotating plasma at finite density is given by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) charged anti-de Sitter (AdS) BH with non-zero angular momentum. This analysis provides the critical temperature of deconfinement as a function of the quark chemical potential and the plasma rotational velocity. For the case of very low temperatures, the dependence of the critical values of the chemical potential for the transition to occur at $ T \to 0 $ on the rotation is found.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18573v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian and its symmetries for a time-reversal symmetry broken three dimensional Weyl superconductor. In the limit of vanishing pairing potential, we specify that this Hamiltonian is invariant under two sets of continues symmetries, i.e. the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry and the $U(1)_A$ axial symmetry. Although a pairing of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer type spontaneously breaks both of these symmetries, we show that a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov type pairing spontaneously breaks only the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry (that is then restored via the well-known scalar phase mode of superconductivity). Consequently, in the former case, two Nambu-Goldstone modes are required in the system to restore the broken symmetries. We indicate that one of these two modes is an emergent pseudo-scalar phase mode. We also demonstrate that such a phase mode leads to a pseudo-Meissner effect.</description>

Abstract: We study the $1+1$ flat spacetime dynamics of a classical field configuration corresponding to an ensemble of sine-Gordon kinks and antikinks, semi-classically coupled to a quantum field. This coupling breaks the integrability of the sine-Gordon model resulting in the background's decay into quantum radiation as kink-antikink pairs annihilate. We find evidence that, on average, the energy of the ensemble scales as $t^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;1$ and independent of the coupling strength or the mass of the quantum field. The generalization of this result to domain wall networks in higher spacetime dimensions could be relevant to particle production in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Macdonald deformation of Vogel's universality and link hyperpolynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vogel's universality implies a unified description of the adjoint sector of representation theory for simple Lie algebras in terms of three parameters $\alpha,\beta,\gamma$, which are homogeneous coordinates of Vogel's plane. Actually this is true (if at all) only for a piece of representation theory captured by knot/Chern-Simons theory, where some irreducible representations are often undistinguishable and combined into new ``universally-irreducible" entities (uirreps). We consider from this point of view the recently discovered Macdonald deformation of quantum dimensions, for which a kind of universality holds for the ADE series. The claim is that universal are not Macdonald dimensions themselves, but their products with Littlewood-Richardson coefficients, which themselves are functions of $q$ and $t$ in Macdonald theory. These products are precisely what arises in knot/refined Chern-Simons theory. Actually, we consider the simplest decomposition of adjoint square into six uirreps and obtain the universal formulas for hyperpolynomials of the Hopf link and, more generally, of the torus links $T[2,2n]$.</description>

Abstract: We advance the loop calculus in momentum loop space to the Yang-Mills gradient flow, deriving momentum loop equations for the Wilson loop. These equations possess fixed points corresponding to superpositions of Wilson loops associated with classical Yang-Mills solutions. We identify two distinct classes of solutions: one converging toward a trivial free-field configuration (vanishing field strength) and another converging toward configurations characterized by self-dual field strengths. Both solutions exhibit spontaneous stochasticity, analogous to the turbulent solutions found in the Navier-Stokes equations. We explicitly express these Wilson loops as averages over algebraic structures equivalent to random walks on compact complex manifolds, effectively representing string theories with nonlinear target spaces defined by the momentum loop. Finally, we discuss the potential connection of the self-dual solution to the confining phase in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Extremal couplings, graviton exchange, and gluon scattering in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremal cubic couplings in AdS relate bulk fields such that $\Delta_i+\Delta_j=\Delta_k$. Such couplings lead to divergent 3-point Witten diagrams, and do not occur in theories with maximal supersymmetry. We consider the simplest theories where such coupling are non-zero, which is type IIB string theory with $N$ D3 branes probing various configurations of sevenbranes, which are dual to certain 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs. At large $N$, the low energy effective theory is supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$ with a singularity, whose fixed point locus is $AdS_5\times S^3$. These theories have infinite towers of graviton modes, as well as gluon modes on the sevenbranes. We compute the nonzero coupling between these modes, which is in general (super)-extremal. We use these couplings to compute the graviton exchange term in the holographic correlator of gluon KK modes $\langle22pp\rangle$, which appears at the same order $1/N^2$ as 1-loop gluon exchange, and receives contributions from a whole tower of graviton modes. We use this graviton exchange term to compute the unmixing of the single trace graviton modes with double traces of gluon modes, which explains the divergent 3-point diagrams. Finally, for $\langle 2222\rangle$ for the simplest 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory, we use supersymmetric localization and the new graviton exchange term to completely fix the correlator at order $1/N^2$.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

Abstract: In this note we explore the chaotic behavior of non-integrable QFTs and compare them to integrable ones. We choose as prototypes the double sine-Gordon and the sine-Gordon models. We analyze their discrete spectrum determined by a truncation method. We examine the map of the corresponding energy eigenvalues to the eigenvalues of the random matrix theory (RMT) Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). This is done by computing the following properties: (a) The distribution of the adjacent spacings and their ratios (b) Higher order spacings and ratios (c) Pair correlations (d) Spectral form factors and (e) Spectral rigidity. For these properties we determine the differences between the integrable and non-integrable theories and verify that the former admits a Poisson behavior and the latter GOE (apart from the spectral rigidity).</description>

      <title>R-symmetries, anomalies and non-invertible defects from non-BPS branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a holographic realization of symmetry operators for symmetries associated to isometries in terms of non-BPS Kaluza-Klein monopoles. Their existence is supported by dualities, and their action can be inferred by consistency with well-known String Theory constructions. We use our proposal to describe the $U(1)$ superconformal R-symmetry of the Klebanov-Witten 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory dual to Type IIB String Theory on $AdS_5\times T^{1,1}$. We precisely reproduce the expectations from field theory, including the 't Hooft self-anomaly of the R-symmetry and the mixed 't Hooft anomaly with the baryonic symmetry. For a choice of boundary conditions, the R-symmetry becomes non-invertible and the worldvolume action for the non-BPS Kaluza-Klein monopole precisely accounts for this.</description>

Abstract: The influence of a possible low gravity scale, concretely through the presence of extra dimensions or additional species, on radiation properties of micro black holes is investigated. In particular, the suppression of evaporation through the so-called memory-burden effect is shown to be stronger, occurs earlier and with sharper transition compared to the canonical Planck-scale regime. It is furthermore shown how this affects the possibility of light primordial black hole dark matter, constraints on which may weaken substantially and allow them to be as light as $10^{-5}\,M_{\rm P}$, thereby lying in the particle regime.</description>

      <title>Properties of a Majorana fermion ensemble with exciton-like mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering the relativistic scenario, we dedicate our study to the relativistic quantum description of one-dimensional Majorana fermions. Thus, we focus on aspects related to exciton-like particles. Seeking to reach our purpose, one analyzes the relativistic quantum mechanical system characterized by an effective mass distribution. In this context, we adopt an exciton-like position-dependent mass without impurity, i.e., without electromagnetic interactions. From this perspective, one notes results of noteworthy interest as consequences of the theory adopted. For instance, we highlight that, even without interaction, exciton-like Majorana fermions manifest theoretically bound states. Also, we construct a Majorana fermion ensemble with effective mass immersed in a thermal reservoir. That allows for a thorough investigation of the thermodynamic properties of the system. Among the thermodynamic characteristics studied in the canonical ensemble, we focus on the Helmholtz free energy, mean energy, entropy, and heat capacity. The numerical results obtained for these thermodynamic properties corroborate the validity of the Dulong-Petit law for our system.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei as a New Probe of Inelastic Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish thermodynamic stability and gauge invariance in the magnetovortical matter of Dirac fermions under the coexistent rotation and strong magnetic field. The corresponding partition function reveals that the orbital contribution to bulk thermodynamics preponderates over the conventional contribution from anomaly-related spin effects. This orbital preponderance macroscopically manifests itself in the sign inversion of the induced charge and current in the magnetovortical matter, and can be tested experimentally as the flip of the angular momentum polarization of magnetovortical matter when the magnetic field strength is increased.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also compare these findings against earlier results for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can identify clear differences between phase transitions of first and second order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories and provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Scattering, Emergent Interactions of Solitons in the Zakharov-Kuznetsov Equation through Conservative and non-Conservative Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, originally a three dimensional mathematical model of plasma with a uniform magnetic field, is a direct extension of the KdV equation into higher dimensions and is a typical quasi-integrable system. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study the collision of soliton solutions in the 2+1 dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation. PINNs are able to successfully solve the equations in the forward process, and the solutions are obtained using a mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation, taking into account conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper form of the equation can be successfully derived from a given training data. However, the situation becomes intractable in the collision process. The forward analysis result no longer adheres to the laws of conservation, and is better described as a dynamically incompatible field configuration (DIFC) than a solution to the system. Conservative PINNs have thus been introduced for this purpose, and in this paper we succeed in obtaining solutions that satisfy conservation laws. The inverse analysis suggests a different equation in which the coefficients exhibit significant changes, implying an emergence of temporary interactions. With these modulated coefficients, we recalculate the equation and confirm that the adherence to the laws of conservation has unquestionably improved.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions due to Euclidean gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Ising-like models to probe the thermal nature of Euclidean spacetime backgrounds. We determine which properties of the background -- curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature -- play a role in phase transitions. The geometries we use are Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS). Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature -- or Euclidean gravity -- increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature. Separately, since the selected geometries are position-dependent, the Ising-like models constructed on them are inhomogeneous, whereby they generalize the standard Ising model. We find that a consequence of this is that criticality does not correspond to maximal correlation lengths and scale invariance.</description>

      <title>Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code transformation to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state encoded in the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ surface code. A logical $T$ gate can be implemented in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code by gate teleportation. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding transformations between topological codes.</description>

      <title>RG-stable parameter relations of a scalar field theory in absence of a symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of tree-level relations among the parameters of a quantum field theory with respect to renormalization group (RG) running is typically explained by the existence of a symmetry. We examine a toy model of a quantum field theory of two real scalars in which a tree-level relation among the squared-mass parameters of the scalar potential appears to be RG-stable without the presence of an appropriate underlying symmetry. The stability of this relation with respect to renormalization group running can be explained by complexifying the original scalar field theory. It is then possible to exhibit a symmetry that guarantees the relations of relevant beta functions of squared-mass parameters of the complexified theory. Among these relations, we can identify equations that are algebraically identical to the corresponding equations that guarantee the stability of the relations among the squared-mass parameters of the original real scalar field theory where the symmetry of the complexified theory is no longer present.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the classical and quantum dynamics of $f(R)$ gravity's rainbow in the presence of a perfect fluid, employing Schutz's formalism to establish a well-defined notion of time. In the classical regime, we derive and solve the equations of motion, obtaining both analytical and numerical solutions. Through canonical quantisation, we formulate the Schr\"{o}dinger-Wheeler-DeWitt (SWD) equation for the quantum model. By solving its eigenfunctions, we construct the wave function of the Universe and obtain analytical solutions in scenarios dominated by stiff matter. Our results highlight the impact of rainbow gravity on quantum evolution, particularly in modifying the structure of the wave function and shaping the transition from the quantum to the classical regime.</description>

      <title>Beta function without UV divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12483v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct the beta function in the functorial formulation of two-dimensional quantum field theories (FQFT). A key feature of this approach is the absence of ultraviolet divergences. We show that, nevertheless, in the FQFT perturbation theory, the local observables of deformed theories acquire logarithmic dimension, leading to a conformal anomaly. The beta function arises in the functorial approach as an infinitesimal transformation of the partition function under the variation of the metric's conformal factor, without ultraviolet divergences, UV cutoff, or the traditional renormalization procedure.</description>

      <title>Probing "Continuous Spin" QED with Rare Atomic Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An intriguing and elementary possibility is that familiar massless particles like the photon could be "continuous spin" particles (CSP) with a small but non-zero spin Casimir $\rho$. In this case, the familiar two polarization states of the photon are accompanied by an infinite tower of integer spaced helicity modes, with couplings dictated entirely by Lorentz symmetry and the parameter $\rho$. We present a formalism for computing bound state atomic transitions for scalar QED when $\rho \neq 0$, employing path integral methods not often used for bound state computations, but that readily generalize to the CSP case. We compute several illustrative amplitudes and show that $\rho\neq 0$ opens new decay channels for atomic transitions with rates controlled by $\rho\alpha/\omega$ for transition frequency $\omega$. These new channels can appreciably modify the rates of "forbidden" transitions. For example, the lifetime of the hydrogen $2s$ state would be affected at $O(1)$ for $\rho\sim 0.1$ eV, suggesting new directions for fundamental tests of QED in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Local Baryon Number at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal theory in which baryon number is spontaneously broken at the low scale predicts new fermions, one of which is a dark matter candidate, from gauge anomaly cancellation. We discuss the production mechanisms and decays of these new fermions, which include channels with multi-leptons, and channels with long-lived charged fermions that can give rise to exotic signatures with 'kinked' tracks at the Large Hadron Collider. We evaluate the contraints on the theory from current LHC searches and measurements, and briefly comment on the excess in top pair production at threshold recently reported by CMS. We also discuss predictions for the $h \to \gamma Z_B$ decay, where $h$ is the SM-like Higgs and $Z_B$ is the new gauge boson associated with baryon number.</description>

      <title>On the Probability of the Initial Conditions for Inflation and Slow Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent studies based on numerical relativity simulations claim that slow contraction/ekpyrosis is strongly preferred over inflation as the smoothing mechanism that brought the universe into the homogeneous, isotropic and flat state we observe today on large scales. In this paper, we evaluate the likelihood of the initial conditions employed in the aforementioned simulations by estimating the probability that a free scalar field dominating the universe at the beginning of inflation or ekpyrosis will be sufficiently homogeneous on scales comparable to the Hubble radius at that time. We explore the space of parameters that characterize the initial power spectrum of the scalar field, finding that either can be more likely than the other for a fixed choice of parameters. On the other hand, when we extremize over these parameters, we find that the maximal probability for inflation is much higher than that of ekpyrosis.</description>

      <title>Quantum cosmological perturbations in bouncing models with mimetic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the power spectrum of cosmological perturbations originated from quantum vacuum fluctuations in bouncing scenarios proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology} in the framework of mimetic cosmology. We show that all physically relevant models produce scale invariant spectral indices, and amplitudes compatible with observations provided that the bounce occurs at length scales $t_0$ inside the physically reasonable interval $10^5 l_p &lt; t_0 &lt; 10^9 l_p$. We also show that by slightly modifying the scalar field potential proposed in Ref.~\cite{chamseddine2014cosmology}, we can also obtain the observed red-tilted spectral index, with the same amplitude constraints. Hence, mimetic cosmology provides reasonable bouncing cosmological models without the need of any background quantum effect.</description>

      <title>Regular Vaidya solutions of effective gravitational theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the dynamics of spherically symmetric spacetimes beyond general relativity through exact solutions of the field equations of second-order effective gravitational theories defined solely in terms of the symmetries of the problem in 4 or more dimensions. We prove the existence of regular Vaidya solutions that represent the formation or change in mass of regular black holes (or black hole mimickers) due to the gravitational collapse or accretion of radiation, with the time-reverse of these processes being also included as solutions. Our treatment and results are remarkable in their simplicity and the possibilities they provide for novel theoretical applications and discoveries in the context of regular gravitational collapse. For instance, we illustrate how modifications of the gravitational dynamics can cure curvature singularities through what can be interpreted as an energy transfer between matter and gravitational degrees of freedom. As another application, we show how to incorporate spacetimes frequently used in the literature, designed geometrically to represent the formation and disappearance of regular black holes, as fully dynamical solutions within this formalism.</description>

      <title>Classification of Toda-type tt*-structures and $\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$-fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify Toda-type tt*-structures in terms of the anti-symmetry condition. A Toda-type tt*-structure is a flat bundle whose flatness condition is the tt*-Toda equation (Guest-Its-Lin). We show that the Toda-type tt*-structure can be described as a fixed point of $e^{\sqrt{-1}\frac{2\pi}{n+1}}$-multiplication and this ``intrinsic'' description reduces the possibilities of the anti-symmetry condition to only two cases. We give an application to the relation between tt*-Toda equations and representation theory.</description>
