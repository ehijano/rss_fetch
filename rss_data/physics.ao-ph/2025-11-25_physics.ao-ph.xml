      <title>A multiresolution weather dataset for the Southwestern South Atlantic (2017-2018)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Southwestern South Atlantic (SWSA) is a key region for climate research and renewable energy assessment, yet high-resolution meteorological data are scarce. We present a multiresolution dataset spanning February 2017--November 2018, combining Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) simulations with Sentinel-1A/B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) wind fields processed using the CMOD5 model. WRF outputs were generated every 30 minutes for three nested domains (9 km, 3 km, 1 km) through 975 short-term simulations. SAR/CMOD5 wind fields are provided at 500 m and 1 km resolution across 104 acquisition dates. Validation shows strong agreement: daily spatial averages of 10 m wind speed yield RMSE and MAE below 3 m/s on over 93% of acquisition days, while more than 91.5% of pixel-level residuals fall within $\pm$3 m/s. In situ measurements from the Itaja\'{i} buoy further confirmed the reliability of both sources. The dataset supports regional climate studies, wind energy resource assessment, and machine-learning applications in forecasting and downscaling, with usage examples included to aid practical adoption.</description>

      <title>Characterization of precipitation-induced radon progeny deposition events using a city-scale sensor network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networks of radiation detectors provide a platform for real-time radioactive source detection and identification in urban environments. Detection algorithms in these systems must adapt to naturally-occurring changes in background, which requires well-characterized relationships between precipitation events and their corresponding radiological signature. We present a description of rain-induced radon progeny deposition events occurring in Chicago from September 2023 through February 2024. We measure ambient gamma radiation levels, precipitation rate, temperature, pressure and relative humidity in a network of sensor nodes. For each identified precipitation period, we decompose spectra into static- and radon-associated components as defined by a non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm. We find a consistent power-law relationship between a precipitation-dependent peak of the radon progeny proxy (RPP) and the peak strength of radon-associated NMF component for most precipitation events. We conduct a case study of a rainfall period with abnormally high levels of implied radon progeny concentration and describe its temporal and spatial evolution. We hypothesize this phenomenon is due to the air mass path that intersects a uranium-rich region of Wyoming. Finally, we cluster precipitation events into three distinct categories. One category roughly corresponds to events with deep low-pressure systems and high relative radon concentration, while another is characteristic of light stratiform rain with slightly higher temperatures and intermediate relative radon concentration. The third category contains a weak-gradient or lake breeze convection showers with intermittent precipitation and low relative radon concentration. These findings suggest that radiological anomaly detection could be improved by training unique background models corresponding to each category of meteorological event.</description>

      <title>Measuring fluxes between wave and geostrophic features in rotating non-hydrostatic flows with variable stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A challenge in physical oceanography is quantifying the energy content of waves and balanced flows and the fluxes that connect these reservoirs with their sources and sinks. Methodological limitations have prevented decompositions for realistic flows with non-hydrostatic motions and variable stratification.
  We present a framework that separates the flow into wave and geostrophic components using the principle that waves have no Eulerian available potential vorticity signature. Starting from new expressions for available energy and potential vorticity conservation, we construct a basis of wave and geostrophic modes, complete and orthogonal with respect to quadratic approximations of the conserved quantities. Using the resulting non-hydrostatic projection operators, the nonlinear equations of motion are expressed as coupled wave and geostrophic equations, quantifying cascade and transfer fluxes of wave and geostrophic energy.
  We apply the method to non-hydrostatic mid-ocean simulations with geostrophic mean-flow, near-inertial, and tidal forcing. From these experiments, we construct source-sink-reservoir diagrams for exact and quadratic fluxes, quantifying the fluxes between geostrophic and wave components. Because the cascade fluxes obey total energy conservation, we construct energy flow diagrams within the wave and geostrophic reservoirs and diagnose nonlocal transfers. The simulations show a geostrophic inverse cascade, a forward wave cascade, and a direct transfer of geostrophic to wave energy, with no indication of a forward geostrophic cascade. The mean-flow-only simulation shows weak spontaneous wave emission during spin-up, which diminishes to zero. Finally, we evaluate the decomposition by comparing linearized and fully conserved available potential vorticity, finding that errors become significant at scales below 15\,km.</description>

      <title>The Albedo Problem and Cloud Cover on Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of transiting hot Jupiters have revealed a mismatch between the values of the Bond versus geometric albedos. In the planetary science literature, the ratio of these quantities is known as the phase integral. It has been extensively measured for the Solar System planets and shown to generally be non-unity in value. We use existing Cassini data of Jupiter to derive bandpass-integrated geometric albedos and phase integrals in the CHEOPS, TESS and Ariel bandpasses, demonstrating that these quantities vary markedly across these different wavelength ranges. By performing a population study of geometric albedos and phase integrals, we demonstrate that atmospheres with partial cloud cover may be identified using measurements of the phase integral if its measured uncertainty is $\sim 0.1$, which corresponds to an uncertainty of $\sim 3\%$ on the optical/visible secondary eclipse depth. The upcoming Ariel space mission will conduct an unprecedented statistical survey of cloud cover on hot Jupiters via the simultaneous measurement of $\sim 100$ infrared phase curves and optical secondary eclipses. Whenever available, the shape of optical phase curves of reflected light will directly constrain the phase integral, spherical albedo, degree of cloud cover and scattering asymmetry factor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been great progress in improving numerical weather prediction and climate models using machine learning. However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($&lt;10\%$) against collocated radar measurements. Code and data are available on our project page https://cloud4d.jacob-lin.com/.</description>

      <title>Nonautonomous modelling in Energy Balance Models of climate. Limitations of averaging and climate sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from a classical Budyko-Sellers-Ghil energy balance model for the average surface temperature of the Earth, a nonautonomous version is designed by allowing the solar irradiance and the cloud cover coefficients to vary with time in a fast timescale, and to exhibit chaos in a precise sense. The dynamics of this model is described in terms of three existing nonautonomous equilibria, the upper one being attracting and representing the present temperature profile. The theory of averaging is used to compare the nonautonomous model and its time-averaged version. We analyse the influence of the qualitative properties of the time-dependent coefficients and develop physically significant error estimates close to the upper attracting solution. Furthermore, previous concepts of two-point response and sensitivity functions are adapted to the nonautonomous context and used to value the increase in temperature when a forcing caused by CO2 and other emissions intervenes.</description>

      <title>Reduced Cloud Cover Errors in a Hybrid AI-Climate Model Through Equation Discovery And Automatic Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04358v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud-related parameterizations remain a leading source of uncertainty in climate projections. Although machine learning holds promise for Earth system models (ESMs), many data-driven parameterizations lack interpretability, physical consistency, and smooth integration into ESMs. Here, a two-step method is presented to improve a climate model with data-driven parameterizations. First, we incorporate a physically consistent cloud cover parameterization -- derived from storm-resolving simulations via symbolic regression, preserving interpretability while enhancing accuracy -- into the ICON global atmospheric model. Second, we apply the gradient-free Nelder-Mead optimizer to automatically recalibrate the hybrid model against Earth observations, tuning in nested stages (2-, 7-, 30- and 365-day runs) to ensure stability and tractability. The tuned hybrid model substantially reduces long-standing biases in cloud cover -- particularly over the Southern Ocean (by 75%) and subtropical stratocumulus regions (by 44%) -- and remains robust under +4K surface warming. These results demonstrate that interpretable machine-learned parameterizations, paired with practical tuning, can efficiently and transparently strengthen ESM fidelity.</description>

      <title>Bivariate DeepKriging for Large-scale Spatial Interpolation of Wind Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High spatial resolution wind data are essential for a wide range of applications in climate, oceanographic and meteorological studies. Large-scale spatial interpolation or downscaling of bivariate wind fields having velocity in two dimensions is a challenging task because wind data tend to be non-Gaussian with high spatial variability and heterogeneity. In spatial statistics, cokriging is commonly used for predicting bivariate spatial fields. However, the cokriging predictor is not optimal except for Gaussian processes. Additionally, cokriging is computationally prohibitive for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a method, called bivariate DeepKriging, which is a spatially dependent deep neural network (DNN) with an embedding layer constructed by spatial radial basis functions for bivariate spatial data prediction. We then develop a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method based on bootstrap and ensemble DNN. Our proposed approach outperforms the traditional cokriging predictor with commonly used covariance functions, such as the linear model of co-regionalization and flexible bivariate Mat\'ern covariance. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed DNN model, with computations that are, on average, 20 times faster than those of conventional techniques. We apply the bivariate DeepKriging method to the wind data over the Middle East region at 506,771 locations. The prediction performance of the proposed method is superior over the cokriging predictors and dramatically reduces computation time.</description>
