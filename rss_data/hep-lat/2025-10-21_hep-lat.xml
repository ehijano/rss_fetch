      <title>Electromagnetic form factors and structure of the $T_{bb}$ tetraquark from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD determination of the electromagnetic form factors of the exotic tetraquark $T_{bb} \ (bb \bar u \bar d)$ with quantum numbers $I( J^P ) = 0( 1^+ )$. The extracted form factors encode information about its internal structure, including the charge distribution and the magnetic dipole moments, determined separately for the light and heavy quarks. Our results provide evidence in favor of it being a bound state consisting of a compact heavy diquark $[bb]$ in a color-antitriplet with spin one, and a light antidiquark $[\bar u \bar d]$ in a color-triplet with spin zero. The charge radius of $T_{bb}$ is found to be significantly smaller than the combined charge radii of $B$ and $B^*$ mesons. These two comprise the lowest-lying threshold $BB^*$ in the channel we are considering, and their electric charge form factors are also determined. The computations were performed on a single CLS ensemble with $N_f = 2+1$ dynamical quarks and a lattice spacing of approximately $a \approx0.064 \ \mathrm{fm}$ at the pion mass $m_\pi \approx 290 \ \mathrm{MeV}$.</description>

      <title>First Self-Renormalized Gluon PDF of Nucleon from Large-Momentum Effective Theory in the Continuum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first lattice-QCD determination of the nucleon gluon parton distribution function (PDF) within the large-momentum effective theory (LaMET) framework, employing the hybrid scheme with self renormalization, in the continuum limit. High statistics calculations with boost momentum $P_z \approx 2.0$-$2.2$~GeV are performed at lattice spacings of $a \approx \{ 0.15, 0.12, 0.09 \}$~fm, a pion mass of $M_\pi \approx 310$~MeV, with $N_f=2+1+1$ quark flavors. We apply gradient flow smearing with $\mathcal{T}_\text{W} = 3a^2$, finding that self-renormalization remains stable. The renormalized gluon matrix elements and PDFs show consistent behavior across lattice spacings, with the $a \approx 0.09$~fm results statistically compatible with the continuum limit. Our final LaMET gluon PDF compares reasonably with select global-fit determinations, specifically preferring analyses which have near-zero gluonic density in the $x \gtrsim 0.6$ region.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics in a U(1) Lattice Gauge Theory via Local Information Flows: Scattering and String Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce local information flows as a diagnostic tool for characterizing out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics in lattice gauge theories. We employ the information lattice framework, a local decomposition of total information into spatial- and scale-resolved contributions, to characterize the propagation and buildup of quantum correlations in real-time processes. Focusing on the Schwinger model, a canonical $(1+1)$-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory, we apply this framework to two scenarios. First, in the near-threshold scattering of two vector mesons, we demonstrate that the emergence of correlations at a longer length scale in the information lattice marks the production of heavier scalar mesons. Second, in the dynamics of electric field strings, we clearly distinguish between the confining regime, which evolves towards a steady state with a static correlation profile, and the string-breaking sector. The latter is characterized by dynamic correlation patterns that reflect the sequential formation and annihilation of strings. This information-centric approach provides a direct, quantitative, and interpretable visualization of complex many-body phenomena, offering a promising tool for analyzing dynamics in higher-dimensional gauge theories and experiments on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic properties of the $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom partners in a molecular configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic properties of the axial-vector molecular states $D^* K$, $DK^*$, $B^* K$, and $BK^*$, which are used to model the charmed states $D_{s1}^{+}(2460)$, $D_{s1}^{+}(2536)$, and their bottom partners with quantum numbers $J^P = 1^+$. To our knowledge, this presents the first comprehensive calculation of the magnetic and quadrupole moments for these specific molecular configurations. Employing the QCD light-cone sum rule method with molecular-type interpolating currents, we compute these moments and perform a detailed flavor decomposition to reveal the internal distribution of the electromagnetic charge and spin. Our results demonstrate that the light up and down quarks dominate the electromagnetic response, with negligible contributions from the heavy quarks. The $D^* K$ and $B^* K$ states exhibit negative quadrupole moments and slightly oblate charge distributions, whereas the $DK^*$ and $BK^*$ states possess positive quadrupole moments and prolate distributions, with significant contributions from the strange quark. The predicted moments provide benchmarks for lattice QCD calculations and are testable through their influence on radiative transitions and photo- and electro-production observables at high-luminosity facilities, offering crucial insights into the internal structure and nature of these axial-vector states.</description>

      <title>A conjecture on the lower bound of the length-scale critical exponent $\nu$ at continuous phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in the renormalization-group (RG) theory of critical phenomena concerns the allowed values of critical exponents that are consistent with the continuous nature of a phase transition. Here we conjecture a lower bound for the length-scale exponent $\nu$ that should hold at continuous transitions associated with $d$-dimensional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson (LGW) $\Phi^4$ theories with a multicomponent scalar field $\varphi_i$ (including some extensions with fermionic and gauge fields). If $\Delta_\varphi=(d-2+\eta)/2$ is the dimension of the order parameter -- $\varphi_i$ in LGW models -- and $\Delta_\varepsilon=d-1/\nu$ is the RG dimension of the energy operator $\varepsilon$, which can be identified with $[\sum_i \varphi_i^2]$ (the squared field with a proper subtraction of the mixing with the identity), we conjecture the inequality $\Delta_\varepsilon - 2 \Delta_\varphi\ge 0$, which implies $1/\nu \le 2-\eta$ and $\gamma = (2-\eta)\nu\ge 1$. These inequalities are supported by general arguments for lattice models, exact relations for two-dimensional minimal conformal field theories, and are consistent with all known (numerical, perturbative, and exact) results for LGW $\Phi^4$ theories. In particular, since unitarity requires $\eta\ge 0$, the above inequality implies $\nu\ge 1/2$ for unitary theories. This lower bound is more restrictive than the bound $\nu &gt; 1/d$, which is derived by noting that $\nu=1/d$ is the expected behavior at first-order transitions.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_N$ stability and continuity in twisted Eguchi-Kawai model with two-flavor adjoint fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the twisted Eguchi-Kawai (TEK) reduced model of four-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theory in the presence of two-flavor adjoint fermions (adjoint TEK model). Using Monte Carlo simulations with $N=121$, twist parameter $k=1$, hopping parameter $\kappa=0.01$-$0.03$ ($\ll\kappa_c $) and inverse 't Hooft coupling $b=0.30$-$0.45$, we show that heavy adjoint fermions stabilize the $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ center-symmetric vacuum even for the minimal twist satisfying $k/\sqrt{N} &lt; 1/9$, where the $(\mathbb{Z}_N)^4$ symmetry is spontaneously broken in the absence of adjoint fermions. This result also suggests that the adjoint TEK model with the minimal twist is equivalent to $SU(N)$ gauge theory over a broader $(\kappa,b)$ parameter region than the adjoint EK model without twist. We further extend our analysis to a partially reduced model to realize a geometry akin to $\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1$ and study the theory under $S^1$ compactification with periodic adjoint fermions. Numerical simulations with $N=16$-$49$, $b=0.30$-$0.46$ and $\kappa=0.03$-$0.16$ supports the adiabatic continuity conjecture: with periodic adjoint fermions, the theory remains in a center-symmetric (confined) phase as the $S^1$ circle size is reduced, in contrast to the deconfining transition observed in the pure TEK model or in the TEK model with antiperiodic adjoint fermions. We present the Polyakov loop measurements and consistency checks supporting these findings.</description>

      <title>Regularization Prescription for the Mixing Between Nonlocal Gluon and Quark Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that in the study of mixing between nonlocal gluon and quark bilinear operators there exists an ambiguity when relating coordinate space and momentum space results, which can be conveniently resolved through Mellin moments matching in both spaces. In this work, we show that this ambiguity is due to the lack of a proper regularization prescription of the singularity that arises when the separation between the gluon/quark fields approaches zero. We then demonstrate that dimensional regularization resolves this issue and yields consistent results in both coordinate and momentum space. This prescription is also compatible with lattice extractions of parton distributions from nonlocal operators.</description>

      <title>Probing $ \phi $N interaction through bound states of $ \phi\textrm{N-}\alpha $ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The possible bound state of the $ \phi N \alpha $ system is explored within the framework of the three-body cluster model.
  The calculations are done by employing the state-of-the-art $ \phi $N interactions obtained from the analysis of the pure elastic scattering and the coupled-channel in the $\phi p$ correlation functions.
  The $ \phi\alpha $ potentials are constructed by two methods: the single-folding potential (SFP) method for the given spin-averaged $ \phi $N potentials in coordinate space, and the optical model potential (OMP) approximation within the multiple-scattering framework for the given scattering length of the $ \phi $N interaction.
  It is found that, when only the single-channel $ \phi N$ interactions are employed, the $ \phi N \alpha $ system could be bound with a binding energy in the interval [3-26] MeV.
  However, the coupled-channel $\phi p$ interaction, which is most consistent with experimental measurements, does not yield any bound state, even when the spin-averaged $\phi N$ potential is employed, and this potential is found to be more attractive than the corresponding coupled-channel counterpart.
  It is essential to consider the contributions from the dynamics of the vector-baryon coupled channels $\phi p$ interaction.
  This effect is capable of playing a decisive role in the existence of mesic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Muon Anomaly from $e^+ e^-\to$ Hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18239v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this talk, I revisit and present a more comprehensive estimate of the lowest order Hadronic Vacuum Polarization (HVP) contribution $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{lo}$ to the muon anomalous magnetic moment (muon anomaly) from $e^+e^-\to$ Hadrons obtained recently in Ref.[1]. New CMD-3 data on $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ [2] and precise BABAR [3] and recent BELLE2 [4] $e^+e^-\to 3\pi$ data are usedto update the estimate of the $I=0$ isoscalar channel below the $\phi$-meson mass. Adding the data compiled by PDG22 [5] above 1 GeV and the QCD improved continuum used in Ref. [1], one deduces: $a_\mu\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(7043\pm 37)\times 10^{-11} $.A comparison with previous data driven ($e^+e^-$ and $\tau$-decays) estimates is done.Including the Higher Order $a_\mu\vert_{hvp}^{ho}$ corrections, the phenomenological estimate of the Hadronic Light by Light scattering up to NLO and the QED and Electroweak (EW) contributions, one obtains: $\Delta a_\mu^{pheno}\equiv a_\mu^{exp}-a_{\mu}^{pheno}= (81\pm 41)\times 10^{-11}$ where the recent experimental value $a_\mu^{exp}$ [6] has been used. This result consolidates the previous one in Ref.[1], after adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions, and can be compared with the one from the most precise Lattice result $\Delta a_\mu^{lattice}= (90\pm 56)\times 10^{-11}$. Then, we deduce the (tentative) SM prediction average : $\Delta a_\mu^{SM} = (87\pm 33)\times 10^{-11}$. We complete the paper by revising our predictions on the LO HVP contributions in adding the $\pi^0\gamma,\eta\gamma$ contributions to the ones in Ref.[1]. Then, we obtain: $a_\tau\vert^{hvp}_{lo}=(3516\pm 25)\times 10^{-11} $ and $\Delta \alpha^{(5)}_{had}(M_Z^2)=(2770.7\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-5}$ for 5 flavours.</description>

      <title>Stable Evaluation of Lefschetz Thimble Intersection Numbers: Towards Real-Time Path Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a robust numerical method for determining intersection numbers of Lefschetz thimbles in multivariable settings. Our approach employs the multiple shooting method to solve the upward flow equations from the saddle points to the original integration cycle, which also enables us to determine the signs of the intersection numbers. The method demonstrates stable and reliable performance, and has been tested for systems with up to $20$ variables, which can be further extended by adopting quadruple-precision arithmetic. We determine intersection numbers for several complex saddle points in a discretized path integral, providing new insights into the structure of real-time path integrals. The proposed method is broadly applicable to a wide range of problems involving oscillatory integrals in physics and mathematics.</description>
