      <title>Bounds and New Constructions for Girth-Constrained Regular Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the design and analysis of regular bipartite graphs motivated by their application in low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes specifically with constrained girth and in the high-rate regime. We focus on the relation between the girth of the graph, and the size of the sets of variable and check nodes. We derive bounds on the size of the vertices in regular bipartite graphs, showing how the required number of check nodes grows with respect to the number of variable nodes as girth grows large. Furthermore, we present two constructions for bipartite graphs with girth $\mathcal{G} = 8$; one based on a greedy construction of $(w_c, w_r)$-regular graphs, and another based on semi-regular graphs which have uniform column weight distribution with a sublinear number of check nodes. The second construction leverages sequences of integers without any length-$3$ arithmetic progression and is asymptotically optimal while maintaining a girth of $8$. Also, both constructions can offer sparse parity-check matrices for high-rate codes with medium-to-large block lengths. Our results solely focus on the graph-theoretic problem but can potentially contribute to the ongoing effort to design LDPC codes with high girth and minimum distance, specifically in high code rates.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Uplink Adaptive Compression for Cell-Free MIMO with Limited Fronthaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of uplink compression for cell-free multi-input multi-output networks with limited fronthaul capacity. In compress-forward mode, remote radio heads (RRHs) compress the received signal and forward it to a central unit for joint processing. While previous work has focused on a transform-based approach, which optimizes the transform matrix that reduces signals of high dimension to a static pre-determined lower dimension, we propose a rate-based approach that simultaneously finds both dimension and compression adaptively. Our approach accommodates for changes to network traffic and fronthaul limits. Using mutual information as the objective, we obtain the theoretical network capacity for adaptive compression and decouple the expression to enable decentralization. Furthermore, using channel statistics and user traffic density, we show different approaches to compute an efficient representation of side information that summarizes global channel state information and is shared with RRHs to assist compression. While keeping the information exchange overhead low, our decentralized implementation of adaptive compression shows competitive overall network performance compared to a centralized approach.</description>

      <title>On the High-Rate FDPC Codes: Construction, Encoding, and a Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently introduced Fair-Density Parity-Check (FDPC) codes, targeting high-rate applications, offer superior error-correction performance (ECP) compared to 5G Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, given the same number of message-passing decoding iterations. In this paper, we present a novel construction method for FDPC codes, introduce a generalization of these codes, and propose a low-complexity encoding algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the fast convergence of the message-passing decoder for FDPC codes.</description>

      <title>The complete weight distribution of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important family of codes for data storage systems, cryptography, consumer electronics, and network coding for error control in digital communications are the so-called cyclic codes. This kind of linear codes are also important due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. Because of this, cyclic codes have been studied for many years, however their complete weight distributions are known only for a few cases. The complete weight distribution has a wide range of applications in many research fields as the information it contains is of vital use in practical applications. Unfortunately, obtaining these distributions is in general a very hard problem that normally involves the evaluation of sophisticated exponential sums, which leaves this problem open for most of the cyclic codes. In this paper we determine, for any finite field $\bbbf_q$, the explicit factorization of any polynomial of the form $x^{q+1}-c$, where $c \in \bbbf_{q}^*$. Then we use this result to obtain, without the need to evaluate any kind of exponential sum, the complete weight distributions of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two over any finite field. As an application of our findings, we employ the complete weight distributions of some irreducible cyclic codes presented here to construct systematic authentication codes, showing that they are optimal or almost optimal.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Edge AI Model Selection with Conformal Latency and Accuracy Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge artificial intelligence (AI) will be a central part of 6G, with powerful edge servers supporting devices in performing machine learning (ML) inference. However, it is challenging to deliver the latency and accuracy guarantees required by 6G applications, such as automated driving and robotics. This stems from the black-box nature of ML models, the complexities of the tasks, and the interplay between transmitted data quality, chosen inference model, and the random wireless channel. This paper proposes a novel black-box model selection framework for reliable real-time wireless edge AI designed to meet predefined requirements on both deadline violation probability and expected loss. Leveraging conformal risk control and non-parametric statistics, our framework intelligently selects the optimal model combination from a collection of black-box feature-extraction and inference models of varying complexities and computation times. We present both a fixed (relying on channel statistics) and a dynamic (channel-adaptive) model selection scheme. Numerical results validate the framework on a deadline-constrained image classification task while satisfying a maximum misclassification probability requirement. These results indicate that the proposed framework has the potential to provide reliable real-time edge AI services in 6G.</description>

      <title>On Differential and Boomerang Properties of a Class of Binomials over Finite Fields of Odd Characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the differential and boomerang properties of a class of binomial $F_{r,u}(x) = x^r(1 + u\chi(x))$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$, where $r = \frac{p^n+1}{4}$, $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{4}$, and $\chi(x) = x^{\frac{p^n -1}{2}}$ is the quadratic character in $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$. We show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-PN with boomerang uniformity $0$ when $p^n \equiv 3 \pmod{8}$. To the best of our knowledge, the second known non-PN function class with boomerang uniformity $0$, and the first such example over odd characteristic fields with $p &gt; 3$. Moreover, we show that $F_{r,\pm1}$ is locally-APN with boomerang uniformity at most $2$ when $p^n \equiv 7 \pmod{8}$. We also provide complete classifications of the differential and boomerang spectra of $F_{r,\pm1}$. Furthermore, we thoroughly investigate the differential uniformity of $F_{r,u}$ for $u\in \mathbb{F}_{p^n}^* \setminus \{\pm1\}$.</description>

      <title>Last-Pair Swapping Polar Codes: A Structure to Improve Polarization on Channels with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new structure of polar codes is proposed for channels with memory to improve polarization and approach the polarization efficiency of conventional polar codes on memoryless channels. We classify trellis channels, a particular type of finite state channels into two categories, called sub-injective trellis channels and non-sub-injective trellis channels, where an explicit polarization loss is observed on the former. For sub-injective trellis channels, we substitute the last kernel of each layer in polar coding structure by a swapping matrix, thus leading to our proposed coding structure named last-pair swapping structure. Simulation shows on sub-injective trellis channels polarization efficiency of the proposed polar code exceeds that of conventional one. Furthermore, we point out a special type of sub-injective trellis channels, called bijective trellis channels, and indicate on them the proposed structure achieves identical polarization efficiency with that of conventional one on memoryless channels, which is later theoretically proved. Moreover, limit of the proposed structure is also analyzed. Simulation results of error rate are given on continuous phase modulation (CPM) with additional white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, showing a considerable signal-to-noise power ratio (snr) gain of the proposed polar code over conventional one, and identical performances between the proposed polar code on bijective trellis channels and conventional one on memoryless channels.</description>

      <title>Sensor Model Identification via Simultaneous Model Selection and State Variable Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for the unattended gray-box identification of sensor models commonly used by localization algorithms in the field of robotics. The objective is to determine the most likely sensor model for a time series of unknown measurement data, given an extendable catalog of predefined sensor models. Sensor model definitions may require states for rigid-body calibrations and dedicated reference frames to replicate a measurement based on the robot's localization state. A health metric is introduced, which verifies the outcome of the selection process in order to detect false positives and facilitate reliable decision-making. In a second stage, an initial guess for identified calibration states is generated, and the necessity of sensor world reference frames is evaluated. The identified sensor model with its parameter information is then used to parameterize and initialize a state estimation application, thus ensuring a more accurate and robust integration of new sensor elements. This method is helpful for inexperienced users who want to identify the source and type of a measurement, sensor calibrations, or sensor reference frames. It will also be important in the field of modular multi-agent scenarios and modularized robotic platforms that are augmented by sensor modalities during runtime. Overall, this work aims to provide a simplified integration of sensor modalities to downstream applications and circumvent common pitfalls in the usage and development of localization approaches.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning-based mmWave MIMO Channel Estimation using sub-6 GHz Channel Information: CNN and UNet Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems will integrate both sub-6 GHz and millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to meet the growing demands for high data rates. MIMO link establishment typically requires accurate channel estimation, which is particularly challenging at mmWave frequencies due to the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this paper, we propose two novel deep learning-based methods for estimating mmWave MIMO channels by leveraging out-of-band information from the sub-6 GHz band. The first method employs a convolutional neural network (CNN), while the second method utilizes a UNet architecture. We compare these proposed methods against deep-learning methods that rely solely on in-band information and with other state-of-the-art out-of-band aided methods. Simulation results show that our proposed out-of-band aided deep-learning methods outperform existing alternatives in terms of achievable spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>SBMA: A Multiple Access Scheme Combining SCMA and BIA for MU-MISO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11959v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse Code Multiple Access (SCMA) and Blind Interference Alignment (BIA) are key enablers for multi-user communication, yet each suffers from distinct limitations: SCMA faces high complexity and limited multiplexing gain, while BIA requires a long temporal channel pattern and incurs significant decoding delay. This paper proposes SBMA (Sparsecode-and-BIA-based Multiple Access), a novel framework that synergizes SCMA's diversity and BIA's multiplexing while addressing their drawbacks. We design two decoders: a low-complexity two-stage decoder (Zero-forcing + Message Passing Algorithm (MPA)) and a Joint MPA (JMPA) decoder leveraging a virtual factor graph for improved BER. Theoretical analysis derives closed-form BER expressions for a 6-user 2x1 MISO system, validated by simulations. Compared to existing schemes, SBMA with JMPA achieves a diversity gain equivalent to STBC-SCMA and a multiplexing gain comparable to BIA, while simultaneously offering enhanced privacy (relative to STBC-SCMA) and reduced reliance on channel coherence time (compared to BIA). These advancements position SBMA as a compelling solution for next-generation wireless communication systems, particularly in IoT applications demanding high throughput, robust data privacy, and adaptability to dynamic channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Resilient Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning Without Privacy Compromises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) shows great promise in large scale machine learning, but brings new risks in terms of privacy and security. We propose ByITFL, a novel scheme for FL that provides resilience against Byzantine users while keeping the users' data private from the federator and private from other users. The scheme builds on the preexisting non-private FLTrust scheme, which tolerates malicious users through trust scores (TS) that attenuate or amplify the users' gradients. The trust scores are based on the ReLU function, which we approximate by a polynomial. The distributed and privacy-preserving computation in ByITFL is designed using a combination of Lagrange coded computing, verifiable secret sharing and re-randomization steps. ByITFL is the first Byzantine resilient scheme for FL with full information-theoretic privacy.</description>

Abstract: Privacy of the clients' data and security against Byzantine clients are key challenges in Federated Learning (FL). Existing solutions to joint privacy and security incur sacrifices on the privacy guarantee. We introduce LoByITFL, the first communication-efficient information-theoretically private and secure FL scheme that makes no sacrifices on the privacy guarantees while ensuring security against Byzantine adversaries. The key components are a small and representative dataset available to the federator, a careful modification of the FLTrust algorithm, and the one-time use of a trusted third party during an initialization period. We provide theoretical guarantees on the privacy and Byzantine resilience, as well as experimental results showing the convergence of LoByITFL.</description>

      <title>Dual Approach to Inverse Covariance Intersection Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear fusion of estimates under the condition of no knowledge of correlation of estimation errors has reached maturity. On the other hand, various cases of partial knowledge are still active research areas. A frequent motivation is to deal with "common information" or "common noise", whatever it means. A fusion rule for a strict meaning of the former expression has already been elaborated. Despite the dual relationship, a strict meaning of the latter one has not been considered so far. The paper focuses on this area. The assumption of unknown "common noise" is formulated first, analysis of theoretical properties and illustrations follow. Although the results are disappointing from the perspective of a single upper bound of mean square error matrices, the partial knowledge demonstrates improvement over no knowledge in suboptimal cases and from the perspective of families of upper bounds.</description>
