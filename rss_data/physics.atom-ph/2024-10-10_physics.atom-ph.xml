      <title>Preliminary characterization of a surface electrode Paul trap for frequency metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are developing a single-ion optical clock based on a surface-electrode (SE) trap that we will operate with $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions on the electric quadrupole transition at 435.5 nm. We present heating rate measurements performed with a prototype SE trap. We also introduce a new, micro-fabricated SE trapping chip using silicon on insulator technology. Electric tests were performed under ultra-high vacuum using a testing chip, including breakdown voltages measurements and flashover detection. We present suitable trapping parameters for this chip, as well as a road-map for improving its design.</description>

      <title>pCI: a parallel configuration interaction software package for high-precision atomic structure calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the pCI software package for high-precision atomic structure calculations. The standard method of calculation is based on the configuration interaction (CI) method to describe valence correlations, but can be extended to attain better accuracy by including core correlations via many-body perturbation theory (CI+MBPT) or the all-order (CI+all-order) method, as well as QED corrections via QEDMOD. The software package enables calculations of atomic properties, including energy levels, g-factors, hyperfine structure constants, multipole transition matrix elements, polarizabilities, and isotope shifts. It also features modern high-performance computing paradigms, including dynamic memory allocations and large-scale parallelization via the message-passing interface, to optimize and accelerate computations.</description>

      <title>Towards simultaneous imaging of ultrafast nuclear and electronic dynamics in small molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07088v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a chemical bond is broken, the molecular structure undergoes a transformation. An ideal experiment should probe the change in the electronic and nuclear structure simultaneously. Here, we present a method for the simultaneous time-resolved imaging of nuclear and electron dynamics by combining Coulomb explosion imaging with strong-field photoelectron momentum imaging. The simplest chemical reaction, H$_2^+$ $\rightarrow$ H$^+ +$ H, is probed experimentally for the delay-dependent kinetic energy release, and numerically for the transient change in the photoelectron spectra during the dissociation process. The three-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation is solved in the fixed-nuclei approximation numerically and the results are compared to those from a simple imaging model. The numerical results reflect the evolution in the electron density in the molecular ion as its bond is first stretched and then brakes apart. Our work shows how simple gas-phase chemical dynamics can be captured in complete molecular movies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-medium effective carriers with position-dependent mass in a multishell heterostructure are analytically studied. We obtain the exact spectrum of three-dimensional bound eigenstates and the scattering wave-functions for several von Roos ordering classes. Ascribing a continuously varying mass to the carriers in a multilayer type spherical system we use our solutions to compute optical properties such as the absorption coefficients and refraction indices of a nanometric heterostructure. We analyze in detail the case of a GaAs/Al-GaAs alloy and show how these results depend on the ordering class of the kinetic Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Highly Excited Electron Cyclotron for QCD Axion and Dark-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>

      <title>Collisional and Radiative Data for Tellurium ions in Kilonovae modelling and Laboratory Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tellurium is a primary candidate for the identification of the 2.1 $\mu$m emission line in kilonovae (KNe) spectra AT2017gfo and GRB230307A. Despite this, there is currently an insufficient amount of atomic data available for this species. We calculate the required atomic structure and collisional data, particularly the data required for accurate Non-Local-Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (NLTE) modelling of the low temperatures and densities in KNe. We use a Multi-Configurational-Dirac-Hartree-Fock method to produce optimised one-electron orbitals for Te {\sc i}-{\sc iii}.
  As a result energy levels and Einstein A-coefficients for Te {\sc i}-{\sc iii} have been calculated. These orbitals are then employed within Dirac $R$-matrix collision calculations to provide electron-impact-excitation collision strengths that were subsequently averaged according to a thermal Maxwellian distribution. Subsequent \textsc{tardis} simulations using this new atomic data reveal no significant changes to the synthetic spectra due to the very minor contribution of Te at early epochs. NLTE simulations with the ColRadPy package reveal optically thin spectra consistent with the increasing prominence of the Te {\sc iii} 2.1 $\mu$m line as the KNe ejecta cools. This is reinforced by the estimation of luminosities at nebular KNe conditions. New line ratios for both observation and laboratory benchmarks of the atomic data are proposed.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent localization of spin-orbit and Rabi-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in a random potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the spin-orbit (SO) and Rabi couplings on the localization of the spin-1/2 condensate trapped in a one-dimensional random potential. Our studies reveal that the spin-dependent couplings create distinct localization regimes, resulting in various relations between localization and spin-related properties. First, we examine the localization in the linear condensate and find that the SO coupling can lead to a transition of the localized state from the "basin-like" to the "void" region of the potential. For a weak random potential upon an increase in the SO coupling, we find a re-entrant transition from a broad to narrow localized state and back at a higher SO coupling. Further, we analyze the competing role of inter-species and intra-species interactions on the localization of the condensate. We find the appearance of spin-dependent localization as the interactions increase beyond threshold values for a sufficiently strong disorder. Our findings on controlling spin-dependent localization may be useful for future ultracold atomic experiments and corresponding spin-related quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Vector Signal Analyzer: Wideband Electric Field Sensing via Motional Raman Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrasensitive detection of the frequency, phase, and amplitude of radio frequency (RF) electric fields is central to a variety of important applications, including radio communication, cosmology, dark matter searches, and high-fidelity qubit control. Quantum harmonic oscillator (QHO) systems, especially trapped ions, have been used with several quantum sensing techniques to achieve electric field sensing with state-of-the-art sensitivity and nanometer spatial resolution. However, these systems are limited to a narrow frequency range centered around either the motional frequency of the trapped ion oscillator or the frequency of an optical transition in the ion; often these techniques are not sensitive to the RF phase. Here, we propose and demonstrate a procedure that unlocks the extreme sensitivity of a QHO to allow high precision wideband detection of the frequency, phase, and amplitude of an unknown electric field. Specifically, we use motional Raman transitions in a single trapped ion, cooled near its motional ground state to realize state of the art sensitivities to frequency, phase, and amplitude, and show the technique works over a frequency range that is &gt;800x larger than previous techniques. Further, this technique is shown to be compatible with both quantum amplification via squeezing and measurement in the Fock basis, allowing performance 3.4(20) dB below the standard quantum limit and the potential for several orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity with moderate upgrades. In addition to providing an attractive platform for quantum sensing of small fields, this technique allows in situ calibration of qubit control lines in QHO systems, as well as transduction of external, non-resonant drives into oscillator excitation. Additionally, this approach can be extended to other QHO systems, such as a superconducting qubit-resonator system.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Minimising Interference in Low-Pressure Supersonic Beam Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12628v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-jet atomic, cluster and molecular sources are typically used to produce beams of low-energy, neutral particles and find application in a wide array of technologies, from neutral atom microscopes to instruments for surface processing. However, understanding and maximising the intensity derived from such sources has proven challenging, partly because of gas interference effects attenuating the beam intensity. Here, we describe a semi-analytic method to estimate the resulting attenuation in low-pressure free-jet sources. We explicitly calculate two contributions to the interference, that arise from the interaction of the beam with (i) background gas and (ii) atoms backscattered from the skimmer. We demonstrate that the design of the skimmer has an insignificant impact for room temperature beams. Finally, we develop a number of design recommendations for the skimmer and vacuum chamber that optimise beam properties for spectroscopy and microscopy when using cryogenic-temperature atom or molecular beams.</description>

Abstract: Matter-wave jets are ejected from a Bose-Einstein condensate subjected to a modulation of the interaction strength. For sufficiently strong modulation additional higher harmonic matter-wave jets emerge. Here we report the first experimental observation of incommensurable "golden" $\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ matter-wave jets in a Bose-Einstein condensate exposed to a single frequency interaction modulation. We study the formation of higher-order jets and the corresponding incommensurable density waves in quasi-one-dimensional geometry with numerical one dimensional (1D) Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We explore the process of jet formation experimentally and theoretically for a wide range of modulation amplitudes and frequencies and establish a phase diagram delineating different regimes of jet formation.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonic structures for photon-mediated entanglement of trapped ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are natural candidates for quantum information processing and have the potential to realize or improve quantum computing, sensing, and networking. These applications often require the collection of individual photons emitted from ions into guided optical modes, in some cases for the production of entanglement between separated ions. Proof-of-principle demonstrations of such photon collection from trapped ions have been performed using high-numerical-aperture lenses or cavities and single-mode fibers, but integrated photonic elements in ion-trap structures offer advantages in scalability and manufacturabilty over traditional optics. In this paper we analyze structures monolithically fabricated with an ion trap for collecting ion-emitted photons, coupling them into waveguides, and manipulating them via interference. We calculate geometric limitations on collection efficiency for this scheme, simulate a single-layer grating that shows performance comparable to demonstrated free-space optics, and discuss practical fabrication and fidelity considerations. Based on this analysis, we conclude that integrated photonics can support scalable systems of trapped-ions that can distribute quantum information via photon-mediated entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable states of quantum many-body systems with confinement offer a means to simulate false vacuum phenomenology, including non-equilibrium dynamical processes like decay by nucleation, in truncated limits. Recent work has examined the decay process in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spins and superfluids. In this paper, we study nucleation dynamics in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with Rydberg interactions, using both numerical simulations and analytic modeling. We apply a staggered local detuning field to generate the metastable and ground states. Our efforts focus on two dynamical regimes: decay and annealing. In the first, we corroborate the phenomenological decay rate scaling and determine the associated parameter range for the decay process; in the second, we uncover and elucidate a procedure to anneal the metastable state from the initial to the final system, with intermediate nucleation events. We further propose experimental protocols to prepare the required states and perform quenches on near-term neutral atom quantum simulators, examining the experimental feasibility of our proposed setup and parameter regime.</description>

Abstract: Metastable states arise in a range of quantum systems and can be observed in various dynamical scenarios, including decay, bubble nucleation, and long-lived oscillations. The phenomenology of metastable states has been examined in quantum many-body systems, notably in 1D ferromagnetic Ising spin systems and superfluids. In this paper, we study long-lived oscillations of metastable and ground states in 1D antiferromagnetic neutral atom chains with long-range Rydberg interactions. We use a staggered local detuning field to achieve confinement. Using theoretical and numerical models, we identify novel spectral signatures of quasiparticle oscillations distinct to antiferromagnetic neutral atom systems and interpret them using a classical energy model of short-range meson repulsion. Finally, we evaluate the experimental accessibility of our proposed setup on current neutral-atom platforms and discuss experimental feasibility and constraints.</description>

      <title>The impact of microwave phase noise on diamond quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06465</link>

Abstract: Precision optical measurements of the electron-spin precession of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond form the basis of numerous applications. The most sensitivity-demanding applications, such as femtotesla magnetometry, require the ability to measure changes in GHz spin transition frequencies at the sub-millihertz level, corresponding to a fractional resolution of better than 10^{-12}. Here we study the impact of microwave (MW) phase noise on the response of an NV sensor. Fluctuations of the phase of the MW waveform cause undesired rotations of the NV spin state. These fluctuations are imprinted in the optical readout signal and, left unmitigated, are indistinguishable from magnetic field noise. We show that the phase noise of several common commercial MW generators results in an effective pT s^{1/2}-range noise floor that varies with the MW carrier frequency and the detection frequency of the pulse sequence. The data are described by a frequency domain model incorporating the MW phase noise spectrum and the filter-function response of the sensing protocol. For controlled injection of white and random-walk phase noise, the observed NV magnetic noise floor is described by simple analytic expressions that accurately capture the scaling with pulse sequence length and the number of pi pulses. We outline several strategies to suppress the impact of MW phase noise and implement a version, based on gradiometry, that realizes a &gt;10-fold suppression. Our study highlights an important challenge in the pursuit of sensitive diamond quantum sensors and is applicable to other qubit systems with a large transition frequency.</description>
