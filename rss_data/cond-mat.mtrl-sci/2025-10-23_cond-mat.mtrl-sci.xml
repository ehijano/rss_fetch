      <title>A unified picture of phonon anomalies in crystals and glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon spectra in solids often display anomalies that defy the simple Debye law, most prominently the van Hove singularity in crystals and the boson peak in glasses. Although traditionally regarded as distinct, both features are increasingly recognized as sharing a common physical origin. In a recent work, G. Ding et al. (Nat. Phys. 2025) propose a resonant-damping model that unifies these anomalies within a single framework. By coupling phonon damping to vibrational softening, their theory explains why some materials exhibit van Hove peaks, others boson peaks, and many show both. This advance extends earlier ideas and theories of Baggioli and Zaccone on the competition between phonon propagation and damping, while also connecting to microscopic mechanisms such as nonaffine motions in glasses. The resonant-damping paradigm thus offers a promising step toward a unified understanding of vibrational anomalies across ordered and disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Good Enough is Better: Feasibility vs. Pareto-Optimality in Alloy Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In alloy design, the search for candidate materials is often framed as an optimization problem, with the goal of identifying Pareto-optimal solutions across multiple objectives. However, Pareto-optimal solutions do not necessarily satisfy all minimum performance thresholds required for practical deployment. An alternative approach is to treat alloy design as a constraint satisfaction problem, in which the goal is to identify any solution that meets all bare minimum requirements across multiple quantities of interest. These approaches have yet to be benchmarked against each other in the context of realistic alloy design problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, in realistic alloy design campaigns involving multiple objectives and constraints, the constraint satisfaction framework yields a higher likelihood of finding viable alloys than optimization-based approaches. Furthermore, constraint-satisfaction approaches find the first viable alloy solutions earlier than optimization. Our results suggest that focusing on feasibility rather than optimality can lead to more actionable outcomes in materials discovery, particularly in highly constrained applications.</description>

      <title>Domain wall induced topological Hall effect in the chiral-lattice ferromagnet Fe$_x$TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topology and its associated emergent phenomena are central to realizing intriguing quantum states and spintronics functionalities. Designing spin textures to achieve strong and distinct electrical responses remains a significant challenge. Layered transition metal dichalcogenides offer a versatile platform for tailoring structural and magnetic properties, enabling access to a wide spectrum of topological magnetic states. Here, we report a domain-wall-driven, large, and tunable topological Hall effect (THE) in a non-centrosymmetric intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides series Fe$_x$TaS$_2$. By systematically varying the Fe intercalation level, we exert precise control over the magnetic ground states, allowing manipulation of the topological Hall effect. Real-space magnetic force microscopy (MFM) provides direct evidence of periodic magnetic stripe domain formation, confirming the microscopic origin of the observed topological transport phenomena. Our findings establish a promising way for tuning the topology of domains to generate substantial electromagnetic responses in layered magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic spin splitting: Features and Functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, spin splitting of non-relativistic origin in compensated antiferromagnets has drawn growing attention in condensed matter research. Although many materials, now known to exhibit such spin splitting, have been studied for decades, their manifestation along non-high-symmetry momentum directions initially hindered their recognition. In recent years, significant progress has been made in uncovering the symmetry principles that allow non-relativistic spin splitting in the absence of net magnetization, revealing the unconventional physics arising from their coexistence. In this review, we provide a concise overview of non-relativistic spin splitting in compensated antiferromagnets with various spin configurations, including collinear, coplanar, and non-coplanar spin arrangements. We summarize practical identification guidelines, highlight characteristic features in electronic band structures, and discuss the emerging functionalities, with an emphasis on promising directions for future exploration.</description>

      <title>Highly Rectifying Cubic Copper Iron Sulfides p-n Junction Diode Fabricated by Anodic Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rectification properties of semiconductor p-n junction diodes are the basic and important characteristics for electronic device evaluation, especially for novel semiconductor materials. Today's semiconductor devices' fabrication and integration processes require multibillion-dollar investments and are desired to be reduced or simplified. Therefore, low-cost and non-toxic base metal materials with simple fabrication methods are desired for the future semiconductor industry. Recently, copper-based sulfides have been studied for semiconductor devices such as thermoelectric, photovoltaic, or water-splitting applications. Here, a highly rectifying p-n diode of a cubic (disordered) phase Cu4Fe5S8 polycrystal with a zincblende-like structure fabricated by a simple/low-cost wet process is shown. It is found that the Cu4Fe5S8 diode shows the highest rectification ratio in the order of 106 with a large forward current density of 15 Acm-2 (@1.5 V forward bias) at room temperature among the other compounds of copper iron sulfide devices. This remarkable and stable diode characteristic obtained by the p-type layer anodically grown on the sintered n-type cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 can bring the industry closer to low-cost semiconductor manufacturing. These results open a platform of novel semiconductor materials such as cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 with further superior crystal growth and conductive characteristics.</description>

      <title>Unlock Anionic Behavior of Calcium Through Pressure Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An isolated calcium (Ca) atom has empty d-orbitals under ambient conditions. However, s-d band hybridization has been observed in both elemental Ca and compounds by manipulating thermodynamic conditions. Here, we reveal that the Ca 3d-band can even capture electrons from halogen atoms under pressure, exhibiting anionic behaviors in iodides. We predict a CsCl-type monovalent CaI at above 50 GPa by employing first-principles structural searching and successfully identified the phase at 84 GPa using in situ X-ray diffraction. We further reveal that, due to the effect of orbital broadening, unusual charge transfer from the 5p orbitals of I to the 3d orbitals of Ca in CaI, gradually reverses the ionicity of Ca and becomes the anionic ICa at 485 GPa. Multivalent Ca stabilizes a set of metallic iodides with eight- to ten-fold iodine hyper-coordination. Our findings demonstrate that the valence states of Ca can vary from negative to +2, suggesting much greater complexity of Ca chemistry under ultrahigh pressures.</description>

      <title>PBr3 Adsorption and Dissociation on the Si(100) Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adsorption of PBr3 on the Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface was studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). The PBr3 molecule completely dissociates on the Si(100) surface at room temperature into P and Br atoms. In most cases, the dissociated molecule was observed in STM on three neighboring Si dimers. DFT calculations confirm that the PBr3 molecule can completely dissociate at room temperature. After annealing the sample to 400$^{\circ}$C, phosphorus is incorporated into silicon, as evidenced by the Si atoms ejected to the surface. These findings are useful for the insertion of individual phosphorus atoms into silicon by PBr3 adsorption through a halogen mask.</description>

      <title>Vacancy diffusion on a brominated Si(100) surface: Critical effect of the dangling bond charge state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on an adsorbate-covered Si(100) surface can be created in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with high precision required for a number of applications. However, vacancies containing DBs can diffuse, disrupting precisely created structures. In this work, we study the diffusion of Br vacancies on a Si(100)-2$\times$1-Br surface in an STM under typical imaging conditions. In agreement with previous work, Br vacancies diffuse at a positive sample bias voltage. Here, we demonstrated that only vacancies containing a positively charged DB hop across the two atoms of a single Si dimer, while vacancies containing neutral and negatively charged DBs do not. Calculations based on the density functional theory confirmed that positively charged Br (and Cl) vacancies have a minimum activation barrier. We propose that diffusion operates by both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms depending on the applied voltage. Our results show that the DB charge has a critical effect on the vacancy diffusion. This effect should be taken into account when imaging surface structures with charged DBs, as well as when studying the diffusion of other atoms and molecules on the Si(100) surface with vacancies in an adsorbate layer.</description>

      <title>Ultralow-Cost magnetocaloric compound for Cryogenic Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.</description>

      <title>Predicting the 3D microstructure of SOFC anodes from 2D SEM images using stochastic microstructure modeling and CNNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell anodes significantly influences their electrochemical performance, but conventional methods for acquiring high-resolution microstructural 3D data such as focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) are costly in both time and resources. In contrast, obtaining 2D images, such as from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), is more accessible, though typically providing insufficient information to accurately characterize the 3D microstructure. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that predicts the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images. The presented method utilizes a low-parametric 3D model from stochastic geometry to generate a large number of virtual 3D microstructures and employs a physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain the corresponding 2D SEM images. By systematically varying the underlying model parameters, a large dataset can be generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By doing so, we can statistically reconstruct the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images by drawing realizations from the stochastic 3D model using the predicted model parameters. In addition, we conducted an error analysis on key geometrical descriptors to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool.</description>

      <title>The effects of high-temperature ion-irradiation on early-stage grain boundaries serrations formation in Ni-based alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickel based superalloys display outstanding properties such as excellent creep strength, remarkable fracture toughness parameters, and corrosion resistance. For this reason, Ni based materials are considered as materials dedicated to the IV generation of nuclear reactors. Although these materials seem promising candidates, their radiation resistance and impact of radiation damage on the deformation mechanism are still not fully understood. In this work, two commercially available nickel based alloys, Hastelloy X and Haynes 230, were investigated. Structural and mechanical properties have been described by means of SEM and EBSD, TEM, and nanoindentation tests. Radiation damage has been performed by Ar ion with energy 320keV with two doses up to 12dpa. Obtained results have revealed a hardening effect for both levels of damage. However, more intensive effects were observed for Hastelloy X. Moreover, a significant change in precipitates morphology in Hastelloy X has been observed. It has been proposed that structural differences between both alloys determine the type of occurring radiation induced processes. Excess energy deposited into materials structure during ion irradiation can lower the temperature of nucleation of high temperature phases, which initiates the formation of grain boundary serrations.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Mapping of Transition Metal Ordering in Individual LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Particles Using 4D-STEM ACOM Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrochemical performance of the spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, a high-voltage positive electrode material for Li-ion batteries, is influenced by the transition metal arrangement in the octahedral network, leading to disordered (Fd m S.G.) and ordered3 (P4332 S.G.) structures. However, widely used techniques lack the spatial resolution necessary to elucidate the ordering phenomenon at the particle scale. Using the 4D-STEM technique, we present the first direct observation of ordering distribution in individual LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles with nanometric spatial resolution. We propose a quantification method for the local degree of ordering based on the ratio of ordered to disordered spinel lattices along the particle thickness extracted from electron diffraction spot intensities. In an ordered spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, the transition metal ordering is consistently observed throughout the primary particle. However, the extent of ordering in the spinel phase depends on its distribution at the particle scale, a factor influenced by the annealing conditions. The 4D-STEM analysis elucidates the boundary between highly-ordered and low-ordered LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles.</description>

      <title>Angular dependence and powder average of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resonant Inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is a synchrotron-based spectroscopy that has seen growing interest across a range of scientific disciplines beyond fundamental physics. The interpretation of experimental RIXS data requires theoretical calculations based on the Kramers-Heisenberg formula. However, due to the dependence of RIXS on both the incident and scattered photon properties, a tractable treatment of the angular dependence in this formula has been lacking. In this work, within the electric dipole approximation, we determine the number of fundamental spectra contributing to the RIXS cross-section for all crystallographic point groups. We then derive a general expression for the RIXS cross-section of isotropic samples such as un-textured powders, homogeneous glasses or liquids, explicitly accounting for the polarization and propagation directions of both the incident and scattered photons. Simplified forms of the RIXS expressions are subsequently obtained for most common point groups. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our formalism through a case study of uranium 3d4f RIXS.</description>

      <title>Berry Curvature Dipole-induced Non-linear Hall Effect in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of non-linear Hall effects in time-reversal invariant systems has established the intriguing role of band topology beyond Berry curvature in determining transport phenomena. Many of these non-linear responses owe their origin to the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), which, like the Berry curvature (monopole), is also an electronic band structure effect, but is routinely strongly constrained by crystalline symmetries. Here, we propose non-centrosymmetric transition metal oxide heterostructures as promising platforms for realizing and tuning BCD-induced non-linear Hall effects. Specifically, we investigate superlattices of the form $(\mathrm{Ba(Os,Ir)}\mathrm{O}_3)_n/(\mathrm{BaTiO}_3)_4$ ($n{=}1, 2$), comprising metallic perovskite layers ($\mathrm{BaOsO_3}$ or $\mathrm{BaIrO_3}$) sandwiched between insulating ferroelectric $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ (BTO). The ferroelectric distortion in BTO breaks inversion symmetry of the superlattice, giving rise to a finite BCD with two symmetry-allowed components of equal magnitude and opposite sign. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the magnitude of the BCD -- and consequently the nonlinear Hall response -- can be effectively tuned by varying the number of metallic layers or the choice of the B-site cation in these $\mathrm{ABO_3}$ perovskites. Since Rashba splitting and ferroelectric distortion in these systems are readily controllable via an external electric field or strain, the non-linear Hall response in these materials can be directly engineered. Our findings establish non-centrosymmetric oxide perovskite heterostructures as a versatile platform for exploring and manipulating BCD-driven non-linear transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>High Strain Rate Behavior of Liquid Crystal Elastomers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid crystal elastomers are rubbery solids that couple liquid crystalline order and deformation. This coupling leads to properties that are attractive for a number of applications in soft robotics and energy absorption. This paper is motivated by the latter application, and provides a systematic experimental study of a particular class of liquid crystal elastomers -- the isotropic genesis polydomain liquid crystal elastomers -- over a wide range of strain rates. An important aspect of this study is a novel tensile drop-tower that enables tensile strain rates of 100 s$^{-1}$ that are important to application but previously inaccessible. The paper also extends a recently proposed constitutive model to the high strain rate regime, and shows that it can be fit to describe the observed behavior across the spectrum of examined behavior.</description>

      <title>Coupled imbibition and evaporation of droplets deposited on a nanoporous layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquids in hydrophilic pores of nanoscale dimensions have capillary pressures so large that they can theoretically climb several kilometers against gravity. But droplets deposited on thin nanoporous layers form imbibition fronts that stop advancing at typically a fraction of a millimeter, because of evaporation. Recently, there has been growing interest in such droplet infiltration dynamics, either as a way to study the behavior of confined fluids, or in connection with applications e.g. in water harvesting, printing, chemical delivery, actuating, sensing, etc. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the spontaneous imbibition and evaporation of sessile liquid droplets into a thin porous layer with pores of nanometric dimensions (mesopores) and its dependency on the imposed relative humidity (RH). Theoretically, we provide a unified analytical approach to describe the dynamics of the imbibition annulus (halo), which corrects for a neglected coupling between imbibition and evaporation fluxes, describes halos of arbitrary dimensions with respect to droplet size, and incorporates confinement-induced thermodynamic shifts (Kelvin effect). Experimentally, we show that the timescales of halo formation diverge at a critical RH, due to the Kelvin effect. Our analysis also shows an apparent divergence of the imbibition coefficient, which cannot be explained by standard capillary models. This observation suggests an important role of vapor transport and condensation along the porous surface. Globally, our results indicate that droplet infiltration in porous layers involve complex couplings, and that one should be cautious when interpreting halo dynamics data. Our study also suggests RH as a powerful control parameter for tuning droplet imbibition behavior and infiltration patterns.</description>

      <title>Correlation between magnetism and lattice dynamics for cubic FeGe under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This first-principles study investigates the structural, electronic, lattice dynamical properties, and electron-phonon coupling in ferromagnetic cubic B20 FeGe under applied pressure. The implemented spin-scaling exchange-correlation (ssxc) approach allowed to modify the magnetic moment and ferromagnetic phase energetics using a single scaling parameter, thereby yielding an adjustment of the critical pressure ($p_c$) to its experimental value. The ssxc scheme resulted in a subtle energy shift of the electronic bands in the spin-up channel, and reduced the magnetic moment, bringing it closer to the experimentally reported value. Application of the ssxc approach to phonon dispersion and electron-phonon interaction resulted in a slight mitigation of the pronounced softening and large linewidths of the lowest-frequency acoustic branch close to the $R$-point, typically observed with standard DFT calculations. With increasing pressure, phonon anomaly and linewidths diminish significantly and practically disappear at $p_c$ and beyond. This trend parallels the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment. A comparative analysis of the electronic joint density of states with the phonon linewidths revealed that the momentum dependence of linewidths around the $R$-point closely follow the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon matrix elements. This indicates that the correlation between magnetic moment and linewidths under applied pressure originates from the electron-phonon matrix elements, presenting a distinct scenario compared to other B20 family members, where nesting plays a more dominating role.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Structural Analysis of Trilayers for Tantalum Josephson Junctions with Ta$_2$O$_5$ Barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which is believed to host fewer two-level system (TLS) defects key $-$ contributors to decoherence in superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) remains the predominant choice for Josephson junction barriers in most qubit architectures. In this study, we systematically investigate various techniques for forming high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) thin films, aiming to develop effective Josephson junction barriers. We explore thermal oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, as well as plasma oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, and propose a mechanistic picture of the underlying oxidation mechanisms. All methods yield Ta$_2$O$_5$, the same compound as tantalum's native oxide. Among these, plasma oxidation produces the smoothest and highest-quality oxide layers, making it particularly well-suited for Josephson junction fabrication. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-Ta atop oxidized $\alpha$-Ta films, paving the way for the realization of trilayer Ta/Ta-O/Ta Josephson junctions with clean, low-loss interfaces.</description>

      <title>Circuit-based cavity magnonics in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model. We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy, providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.</description>

Abstract: A superlattice of multilayer graphene and hBN has proven to be a promising pathway for engineering electronic band structures and topologies. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the role of hBN alignment in inducing topological band reconstruction in bilayer graphene (BLG) superlattices. Our study establishes that while the primary band retains its massive chiral naure, the secondary bands host massless, chiral fermions. Magnetotransport measurements, including Quantum Hall, temperature-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, and Berry phase analysis, confirm the distinct topological nature of these bands. A significantly reduced Fermi velocity in the moir\'{e} secondary band indicates band flattening induced by the moir\'{e} potential. Our study provides a pathway for controlling topological quantum transport in BLG/hBN superlattices.</description>

      <title>Microfluidic Study of Evaporation-Driven Crystallization of Saline and Ammonia Brines under Hydrogen Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underground storage of hydrogen and ammonia in geological formations is essential for renewable energy integration, but salt precipitation during gas injection may threaten storage performance. While extensively studied for CO2 systems, precipitation mechanisms in hydrogen-brine and ammonia-brine systems remain poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive microfluidic investigation of salt crystallization during hydrogen injection into saline and ammonia-containing brines using high-pressure microfluidics. We conducted 81 high-pressure experiments systematically varying brine composition (1-5 mol/kg NaCl), chemical additives (surfactants, alcohols, ammonia), and hydrogen flow rates (200-1300 mL/min). Quantitative image analysis reveals that hydrogen-induced precipitation differs fundamentally from CO2 systems. Hydrogen drives physical precipitation via evaporation and capillary trapping, producing discrete, localized deposits. In contrast, CO2-ammonia systems generate extensive reactive precipitation of ammonium bicarbonate with interconnected crystal networks. Interfacial tension (IFT) controls both residual brine distribution and final crystal coverage: high-IFT fluids form large, interconnected brine pools promoting extensive crystallization, while low-IFT fluids create isolated pools reducing crystal coverage by 50\%. Alcohol and surfactant additives suppress precipitation by enhancing brine mobility, whereas ammonia paradoxically increases crystal fractions despite lower IFT. Higher flow rates accelerate crystallization across all compositions, enabling operational mitigation strategies. and demonstrate that gas-specific, rather than CO2-analog, risk assessments are essential for underground hydrogen storage design. The effectiveness of chemical additives offers promising pathways for near-wellbore protection in underground hydrogen storage operations.</description>

      <title>Sub-10 nm Quantification of Spin and Orbital Magnetic Moment Across the Metamagnetic Phase Transition in FeRh Using EMCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables element-specific measurement of spin and orbital magnetic moments, analogous to X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). While the EMCD technique offers unmatched spatial resolution, its quantitative accuracy remains under scrutiny, particularly in beam-splitter geometries with convergent probes. Here, we systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative EMCD analysis using the first-order magnetostructural transition in the functional phase-change material FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference. Unlike previous EMCD studies primarily focused on elemental ferromagnets such as Fe, we demonstrate its applicability to a correlated material exhibiting coupled structural and magnetic order. We demonstrate that the extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remains consistent with XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, we observe an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$, which we attribute to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity within the probed volume. Our results confirm that EMCD provides quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments in functional magnetic materials, and allowing the study of interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible to photon-based methods.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature electron dephasing rates indicate magnetic disorder in superconducting TiN films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate electron transport and phase-breaking processes in thin titanium nitride (TiN) films of epitaxial quality. Previous studies show that a minute surface magnetic disorder significantly reduces the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) and broadens the superconducting transition as the film thickness and device size decrease. We measure electron dephasing rates via magnetoresistance from $T_\mathrm{c}$ to $\sim 4T_\mathrm{c}$ in various-thickness TiN films. Electron dephasing occurs on the picosecond timescale and is nearly independent of temperature, differing from the expected inelastic scattering due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions near $T_\mathrm{c}$, which occur over a nanosecond timescale. We propose spin-flip scattering as a possible additional phase-breaking mechanism. The significant increase in the dephasing rate for the thinnest film indicates that magnetic disorder resides near the surface of naturally oxidized films. Our research suggests that magnetic disorder may be a significant contributor to RF dissipation in superconducting devices based on TiN.</description>

      <title>A unified quantum framework for electrons and ions: The self-consistent harmonic approximation on a neural network curved manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The numerical solution of the many-body problem of interacting electrons and ions is a key challenge in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science. Traditional methods to solve the multi-component quantum Hamiltonian are usually specialized for one kind of particles -- electrons or ions -- and can suffer from a methodological gap when applied to the other ones.
  This work extends the self-consistent harmonic approximation, a proven successful technique for simulating quantum ions at finite temperatures in anharmonic crystals, to electrons. The approach minimizes the total free energy by optimizing an ansatz density matrix, solving a fermionic self-consistent harmonic Hamiltonian on a curved manifold parametrized through a neural network. This approach preserves an analytical expression for entropy, enabling the direct computation of free energies and phase diagrams of materials. By benchmarking this technique across several prototypical cases -- a double-well potential, the hydrogen atom, and the H$_2$ dissociation -- we demonstrate it can address both the ground- and excited-state properties of electronic systems, capture quantum tunneling and static electronic correlations, thereby providing a unified quantum framework of electrons and atomic nuclei.</description>

Abstract: Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency {\xi}JDL of Si largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overturns the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced twist and untwist of moir\'e superlattices in TMDC heterobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moir\'e materials are formed by artificially stacking atomically thin monolayers. A wealth of correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered via precise choice of stacking geometry. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry. An important open question is how atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moir\'e geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist-untwist motion of the moir\'e superlattice in $2^\circ$ and $57^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. Upon above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moir\'e superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of $0.6^\circ$, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moir\'e phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moir\'e periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moir\'e potential that shapes excitons, polarons, and correlation-driven behaviors</description>

Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered termination with a varying density of surface tin vacancies. This work establishes heuristics for identifying variable surface disorder using photoemission, an important prerequisite to experimentally establishing the behavior of momentum-space topological surface features subject to variable surface disorder on a single cleave.</description>

Abstract: Local positional disorder in soft, anharmonic materials has emerged as a central factor in shaping their electronic, vibrational, optical, and transport properties. Viewed mainly as a source of performance degradation, recent theoretical insights reveal that local disorder profoundly influences the electronic structure and phonon dynamics, without inducing deep electronic traps or non-radiative recombination pathways. In this work, we highlight advances in modeling local disorder using polymorphous and anharmonic frameworks, showing how these methods explain experimental observations and predict new trends. We emphasize the role of disorder in the breakdown of the phonon quasiparticle picture and in modulating electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions, particularly in soft, anharmonic phases of matter, with significant effects on electrical and thermal transport. We outline opportunities for integrating these insights into predictive modeling for energy materials and propose combining advanced first-principles methods with machine learning.</description>

      <title>A follow-up on the sulphur atom popping model for MoS$_2$ memristor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mechanism of resistive switching in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor-based memristors is intriguing, and our conventional knowledge of bulk-oxide based memristors does not apply to these devices. Experimental data indicate that the genesis of resistive switching may be intrinsic to the 2D semiconducting active layer, as well as resulting from the movement of electrode atoms. Employing reactive-force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we introduced the "sulphur atom popping model" [npj 2D Mater. Appl. 5, 33 (2021)] to elucidate the intrinsic nature of non-volatile resistive switching in 2D molybdenum disulfide-based memristors. In this paper we provide additional perspective to this model using density functional theory. We also discuss the limitations of universal machine learning interatomic potentials in reproducing ReaxFF simulation results.</description>

      <title>Retardance of lab grown diamond substrates as a function of thickness: momentum-drift random walk model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.</description>

      <title>Raman Digital Twin of Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Na2LiAlP2 Crystal for High-Performance Field-Effect Transistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-performance, low-power transistors are core components of advanced integrated circuits, and the ultimate limitation of Moore's law has made the search for new alternative pathways an urgent priority. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become the most promising exploration target due to their exceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve the required on-state current of 900 {\mu}A/{\mu}m under low operating voltages of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the channel length is 7 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope of 2D high-performance transistors.</description>

      <title>Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate transformer-based language models, including RoBERTa, T5, Llama-3, and MatSciBERT, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual descriptions. The inputs encode key material features, such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, and other structural and electronic properties. Unlike shallow machine learning models, which require extensive feature engineering, or Graph Neural Networks, which rely on graph representations derived from atomic coordinates, pretrained language models can process textual inputs directly, eliminating the need for manual feature preprocessing or structure-based encoding. Material descriptions were constructed in two formats: structured strings with a consistent template and natural language narratives generated via the ChatGPT API. Each model was augmented with a custom regression head and finetuned for band gap prediction task. Language models of different architectures and parameter sizes were all able to predict band gaps from human-readable text with strong accuracy, achieving MAEs in the range of 0.25-0.33 eV, highlighting the success of this approach for scientific regression tasks. Finetuned Llama-3, with 1.2 billion parameters, achieved the highest accuracy (MAE 0.248 eV, R2 0.891). MatSciBERT, pretrained on materials science literature, reached comparable performance (MAE 0.288 eV, R2 0.871) with significantly fewer parameters (110 million), emphasizing the importance of domain-specific pretraining. Attention analysis shows that both models selectively focus on compositional and spin-related features while de-emphasizing geometric features, reflecting the difficulty of capturing spatial information from text. These results establish that pretrained language models can effectively extract complex feature-property relationships from textual material descriptions.</description>

      <title>The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a Chern-Simons topological term. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the radiative corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the theory is unitary at the tree level.</description>

      <title>Self-Enhancing Halite Growth Creates Secondary Porous Networks During CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Salt precipitation during CO2 injection into saline aquifers obstructs flow-controlling pore throats and reduces permeability, yet reactive transport models assume salt forms dispersed, non-porous crystals with minimal flow impact. We demonstrate that halite instead creates three-dimensional porous networks with 40% internal porosity through self-enhancing growth mechanisms absent from current models. Time-lapse X-ray micro-computed tomography and spectral imaging reveal preferential nucleation at gas-liquid interfaces, where porous hydrophilic aggregates generate capillary suction that draws brine films toward precipitation sites, accelerating growth and expanding reactive surface area in a positive feedback loop. Spectral tomography shows systematic density gradients reflecting two-stage precipitation: dense macrocrystalline cores formed under moderate supersaturation and evaporation, surrounded by microcrystalline overgrowths from rapid late-stage dynamics. These overgrowths create umbrella-like crusts that encapsulate residual brine beneath surface layers. This porous architecture explains why modest porosity reduction causes severe permeability decline, as aggregates preferentially obstruct flow percolation pathways rather than uniformly cementing grains or filling pore space. Five interconnected mechanisms drive self-enhancing growth across nano- to centimeter scales: interface nucleation, secondary porous structure formation, steep concentration gradients, hydrophilic substrate film maintenance, and capillary-driven solute delivery. Our quantitative characterization of internal salt architecture, reactive surface areas, and pore connectivity provides essential parameters for improving predictive models of evaporation-precipitation dynamics in carbon storage, soil salinization, and cultural heritage preservation.</description>

      <title>Orbital altermagnetism on the kagome lattice and possible application to $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Continuous Uniqueness and Novelty Metrics for Generative Modeling of Inorganic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change, increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.</description>

      <title>iDART: Interferometric Dual-AC Resonance Tracking nano-electromechanical mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a &gt;10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.</description>
