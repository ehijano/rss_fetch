      <title>Circularity and repetitiveness in non-injective DF0L systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study circularity in DF0L systems, a generalization of D0L systems. We focus on two different types of circularity, called weak and strong circularity. When the morphism is injective on the language of the system, the two notions are equivalent, but they may differ otherwise. Our main result shows that failure of weak circularity implies unbounded repetitiveness, and that unbounded repetitiveness implies failure of strong circularity. This extends previous work by the second and third authors for injective systems. To help motivate this work, we also give examples of non-injective but strongly circular systems.</description>

      <title>Structural Properties of Non-Linear Cellular Automata: Permutivity, Surjectivity and Reversibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the algebraic conditions under which a cellular automaton with a non-linear local rule exhibits surjectivity and reversibility. We also analyze the role of permutivity as a key factor influencing these properties and provide conditions that determine whether a non-linear CA is (bi)permutive. Through theoretical results and illustrative examples, we characterize the relationships between these fundamental properties, offering new insights into the dynamical behavior of non-linear CA.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Sampling on Sparse Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider sampling in the so-called low-temperature regime, which is typically characterised by non-local behaviour and strong global correlations. Canonical examples include sampling independent sets on bipartite graphs and sampling from the ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model. Low-temperature sampling is computationally intractable for general graphs, but recent advances based on the polymer method have made significant progress for graph families that exhibit certain expansion properties that reinforce the correlations, including for example expanders, lattices and dense graphs.
  One of the most natural graph classes that has so far escaped this algorithmic framework is the class of sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs whose expansion only manifests for sufficiently large subsets of vertices; small sets of vertices on the other hand have vanishing expansion which makes them behave independently from the bulk of the graph and therefore weakens the correlations. At a more technical level, the expansion of small sets is crucial for establishing the Kotecky-Priess condition which underpins the applicability of the framework.
  Our main contribution is to develop the polymer method in the low-temperature regime for sparse random graphs. As our running example, we use the Potts and random-cluster models on $G(n,d/n)$ for $d=\Theta(1)$, where we show a polynomial-time sampling algorithm for all sufficiently large $q$ and $d$, at all temperatures. Our approach applies more generally for models that are monotone. Key to our result is a simple polymer definition that blends easily with the connectivity properties of the graph and allows us to show that polymers have size at most $O(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>A framework for distributed discrete evacuation strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the following discrete evacuation model. The evacuation terrain is modeled by a simple graph $G=(V,E)$ whose certain vertices $X\subseteq V$ are called \emph{exits}. Initially, each vertex is either \emph{empty} or \emph{occupied} by an agent. We assume that each vertex has a unique \emph{id} (and therefore the agents do have unique ids), each agent has finite but arbitrarily large memory, and the graph is initially stored in the memory of each agent. In other words, the agents do know the topology of the network along with the locations of the exits, but they do not know the initial positions nor the quantity of other agents. The time is divided into \emph{steps}; in each step any pair of agents present at vertices at a distance of at most two can exchange an arbitrary number of messages, and then each agent can either make a move or stay put. The agents should make moves in a collision-free manner, i.e., no two agents can be located at the same vertex in the same step. At the end of each step, any agent located at an exit \emph{evacuates}, i.e., it is removed from the graph. The goal is to provide an algorithm to the agents (referred to as an evacuation strategy) that ensures the evacuation of all agents and minimizes the number of steps.
  This work provides an algorithmic framework that allows constructing valid evacuation strategies for arbitrary input graphs. Specifically, we focus on the properties of the input graphs that lead to evacuation strategies with constant competitive ratios. In particular, we describe an application of the above framework that gives an asymptotically optimal evacuation for grids (and by extension hexagonal or triangular grids as well).</description>

      <title>Comparing Width Parameters on Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how the relationship between non-equivalent width parameters changes once we restrict to some special graph class. As width parameters, we consider treewidth, clique-width, twin-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number, whereas as graph classes we consider $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, line graphs and their common superclass, for $t \geq 3$, of $K_{t,t}$-free graphs.
  We first provide a complete comparison when restricted to $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs, showing in particular that treewidth, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number are all equivalent. This extends a result of Gurski and Wanke (2000) stating that treewidth and clique-width are equivalent for the class of $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free graphs.
  Next, we provide a complete comparison when restricted to line graphs, showing in particular that, on any class of line graphs, clique-width, mim-width, sim-width and tree-independence number are all equivalent, and bounded if and only if the class of root graphs has bounded treewidth. This extends a result of Gurski and Wanke (2007) stating that a class of graphs ${\cal G}$ has bounded treewidth if and only if the class of line graphs of graphs in ${\cal G}$ has bounded clique-width.
  We then provide an almost-complete comparison for $K_{t,t}$-free graphs, leaving one missing case. Our main result is that $K_{t,t}$-free graphs of bounded mim-width have bounded tree-independence number. This result has structural and algorithmic consequences. In particular, it proves a special case of a conjecture of Dallard, Milani\v{c} and \v{S}torgel.
  Finally, we consider the question of whether boundedness of a certain width parameter is preserved under graph powers. We show that the question has a positive answer for sim-width precisely in the case of odd powers.</description>

      <title>Six Candidates Suffice to Win a Voter Majority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03390v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cornerstone of social choice theory is Condorcet's paradox which says that in an election where $n$ voters rank $m$ candidates it is possible that, no matter which candidate is declared the winner, a majority of voters would have preferred an alternative candidate. Instead, can we always choose a small committee of winning candidates that is preferred to any alternative candidate by a majority of voters?
  Elkind, Lang, and Saffidine raised this question and called such a committee a Condorcet winning set. They showed that winning sets of size $2$ may not exist, but sets of size logarithmic in the number of candidates always do. In this work, we show that Condorcet winning sets of size $6$ always exist, regardless of the number of candidates or the number of voters. More generally, we show that if $\frac{\alpha}{1 - \ln \alpha} \geq \frac{2}{k + 1}$, then there always exists a committee of size $k$ such that less than an $\alpha$ fraction of the voters prefer an alternate candidate. These are the first nontrivial positive results that apply for all $k \geq 2$.
  Our proof uses the probabilistic method and the minimax theorem, inspired by recent work on approximately stable committee selection. We construct a distribution over committees that performs sufficiently well (when compared against any candidate on any small subset of the voters) so that this distribution must contain a committee with the desired property in its support.</description>

      <title>On total transitivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph where $V$ and $E$ are the vertex and edge sets, respectively. For two disjoint subsets $A$ and $B$ of $V$, we say that $A$ \emph{dominates} $B$ if every vertex of $B$ is adjacent to at least one vertex of $A$. A vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ is called a \emph{transitive partition} of size $k$ if $V_i$ dominates $V_j$ for all $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq k$. In this article, we study a variation of the transitive partition, namely the \emph{total transitive partition}. The total transitivity $Tr_t(G)$ is defined as the maximum order of a vertex partition $\pi = \{V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_k\}$ of $G$ obtained by repeatedly removing a total dominating set from $G$ until no vertices remain. Thus, $V_1$ is a total dominating set of $G$, $V_2$ is a total dominating set of the graph $G_1 = G - V_1$, and, for $2 \leq i \leq k - 1$, $V_{i+1}$ is a total dominating set in the graph $G_i = G - \bigcup_{j=1}^i V_j$. A vertex partition of order $Tr_t(G)$ is called a $Tr_t$-partition. The \textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} is to find a total transitive partition of a given graph with the maximum number of parts. First, we characterize split graphs with total transitivity equal to $1$ and $\omega(G) - 1$. Moreover, for a split graph $G$ and $1 \leq p \leq \omega(G) - 1$, we provide necessary conditions for $Tr_t(G) = p$. Furthermore, we show that the decision version of this problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs. On the positive side, we prove that this problem can be solved in linear time for bipartite chain graphs. Finally, we design a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the \textsc{Maximum Total Transitivity Problem} in trees.</description>

      <title>Effective Computation of Generalized Abelian Complexity for Pisot Type Substitutive Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized abelian equivalence compares words by their factors up to a certain bounded length. The associated complexity function counts the equivalence classes for factors of a given size of an infinite sequence. How practical is this notion? When can these equivalence relations and complexity functions be computed efficiently? We study the fixed points of substitution of Pisot type. Each of their $k$-abelian complexities is bounded and the Parikh vectors of their length-$n$ prefixes form synchronized sequences in the associated Dumont--Thomas numeration system. Therefore, the $k$-abelian complexity of Pisot substitution fixed points is automatic in the same numeration system. Two effective generic construction approaches are investigated using the \texttt{Walnut} theorem prover and are applied to several examples. We obtain new properties of the Tribonacci sequence, such as a uniform bound for its factor balancedness together with a two-dimensional linear representation of its generalized abelian complexity functions.</description>
