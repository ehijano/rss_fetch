      <title>Proactive SFC Provisioning with Forecast-Driven DRL in Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service Function Chaining (SFC) requires efficient placement of Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) to satisfy diverse service requirements while maintaining high resource utilization in Data Centers (DCs). Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively. This strategy ensures more balanced resource allocation, and reduces contention.</description>

      <title>Dependable Connectivity for Industrial Wireless Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dependability - a system's ability to consistently provide reliable services by ensuring safety and maintainability in the face of internal or external disruptions - is a fundamental requirement for industrial wireless communication networks (IWCNs). While 5G ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) addresses some aspects of this challenge, its evolution toward holistic dependability in 6G must encompass reliability, availability, safety, and security. This paper provides a comprehensive framework for dependable IWCNs, bridging theory and practice. We first establish the theoretical foundations of dependability, including outlining its key attributes and presenting analytical tools to study it. Next, we explore practical enablers, such as adaptive multiple access schemes leveraging real-time monitoring and time-sensitive networking to ensure end-to-end determinism. A case study demonstrates how intelligent wake-up protocols improve event detection probability by orders of magnitude compared to conventional duty cycling. Finally, we outline open challenges and future directions for a 6G-driven dependable IWCN.</description>

      <title>Immersive Volumetric Video Playback: Near-RT Resource Allocation and O-RAN-based Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Immersive volumetric video streaming in extended reality (XR) demands ultra-low motion-to-photon (MTP) latency, which conventional edge-centric architectures struggle to meet due to per-frame computationally intensive rendering tightly coupled with user motion. To address this challenge, we propose an Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN)-integrated playback framework that jointly orchestrates radio, compute, and content resources in near real time (Near-RT) control loop. The system formulates the rendered-pixel ratio as a continuous control variable and jointly optimizes it over the Open Cloud (O-Cloud) compute, gNB transmit power, and bandwidth under a Weber-Fechner quality of experience (QoE) model, explicitly balancing resolution, computation, and latency. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent with structured action decomposition and QoE-aware reward shaping resolves the resulting high-dimensional control problem. Experiments on a 5G O-RAN testbed and system simulations show that SAC reduces median MTP latency by above $11\%$ and improves both mean QoE and fairness, demonstrating the feasibility of RIC-driven joint radio-compute-content control for scalable, latency-aware immersive streaming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper critically examines the device identification process using machine learning, addressing common pitfalls in existing literature. We analyze the trade-offs between identification methods (unique vs. class based), data heterogeneity, feature extraction challenges, and evaluation metrics. By highlighting specific errors, such as improper data augmentation and misleading session identifiers, we provide a robust guideline for researchers to enhance the reproducibility and generalizability of IoT security models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Multi-Agent DRL Based Dynamic Cluster Reconfiguration for UAV Mobility Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-connectivity involves dynamic cluster formation among distributed access points (APs) and coordinated resource allocation from these APs, highlighting the need for efficient mobility management strategies for users with multi-connectivity. In this paper, we propose a novel mobility management scheme for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that uses dynamic cluster reconfiguration with energy-efficient power allocation in a wireless interference network. Our objective encompasses meeting stringent reliability demands, minimizing joint power consumption, and reducing the frequency of cluster reconfiguration. To achieve these objectives, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (H-MADRL) framework, specifically tailored for dynamic clustering and power allocation. The edge cloud connected with a set of APs through low latency optical back-haul links hosts the high-level agent responsible for the optimal clustering policy, while low-level agents reside in the APs and are responsible for the power allocation policy. To further improve the learning efficiency, we propose a novel action-observation transition-driven learning algorithm that allows the low-level agents to use the action space from the high-level agent as part of the local observation space. This allows the lower-level agents to share partial information about the clustering policy and allocate the power more efficiently. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed distributed algorithm achieves comparable performance to the centralized algorithm. Additionally, it offers better scalability, as the decision time for clustering and power allocation increases by only 10% when doubling the number of APs, compared to a 90% increase observed with the centralized approach.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Experts for Decentralized Generative AI and Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency, particularly in large-scale machine learning architectures such as large language models (LLMs). Recent advances in MoE have facilitated its adoption in wireless networks to address the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of modern communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the MoE framework in wireless networks, highlighting its potential in optimizing resource efficiency, improving scalability, and enhancing adaptability across diverse network tasks. We first introduce the fundamental concepts of MoE, including various gating mechanisms and the integration with generative AI (GenAI) and reinforcement learning (RL). Subsequently, we discuss the extensive applications of MoE across critical wireless communication scenarios, such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite communications, heterogeneous networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and mobile edge networks. Furthermore, key applications in channel prediction, physical layer signal processing, radio resource management, network optimization, and security are thoroughly examined. Additionally, we present a detailed overview of open-source datasets that are widely used in MoE-based models to support diverse machine learning tasks. Finally, this survey identifies crucial future research directions for MoE, emphasizing the importance of advanced training techniques, resource-aware gating strategies, and deeper integration with emerging 6G technologies.</description>
