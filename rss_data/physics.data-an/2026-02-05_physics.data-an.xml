      <title>Geometric Organization and Inference of Shortest Path Nodes in Soft Random Geometric Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shortest path problem is related to many dynamic processes on networks, ranging from routing in communication networks to signaling in molecular interaction networks. When the network is fully known, the shortest path problem can be solved precisely and in polynomial time. If, however, the network of interest is only partially observable, the shortest path problem is no longer straightforward. Inspired by the shortest path problem in partially observable networks, we investigate the geometric properties of shortest paths in {\it Euclidean} Soft Random Geometric Graphs (SRGGs). We find that shortest paths are aligned along geodesic curves connecting shortest path endpoints. The strength of the shortest path alignment, as quantified by the average distance to geodesic from shortest path nodes and the average path stretch, is higher for larger SRGGs with short-range connections. In addition, we find that the strength of the shortest path alignment is non-monotonic with respect to the average degree of the SRGG. Based on these observations, we establish the conditions under which the alignment of shortest paths may be sufficiently strong to allow the identification of shortest path nodes based on their proximity to geodesic curves. We show that in partially observable networks with uncertain node positions, our geometric approach can outperform network-based shortest-path algorithms. In practical settings, our findings may have applications to navigation, wireless routing, and flow characterization in infrastructure networks.</description>

      <title>Automated Extraction of Multicomponent Alloy Data Using Large Language Models for Sustainable Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of sustainable materials requires access to materials performance and sustainability data from literature corpus in an organized, structured and automated manner. Natural language processing approaches, particularly large language models (LLMs), have been explored for materials data extraction from the literature, yet often suffer from limited accuracy or narrow scope. In this work, an LLM-based pipeline is developed to accurately extract alloy-related information from both textual descriptions and tabular data across the literature on high-entropy (or multicomponent) alloys (HEA). Specifically two databases with 37,711 and 148,069 entries respectively are retrieved; one from the literature text, consisting of alloy composition, processing conditions, characterization methods, and reported properties, and other from the literature tables, consisting of property names, values, and units. The pipeline enhances materials-domain sensitivity through prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation and achieves F1-scores of 0.83 for textual extraction and 0.88 for tabular extraction, surpassing or matching existing approaches. Application of the pipeline to over 10,000 articles yields the largest publicly available multicomponent alloy database and reveals compositional and processing-property trends. The database is further employed for sustainability-aware materials selection in three application domains, i.e., lightweighting, soft magnetic, and corrosion-resistant, identifying multicomponent alloy candidates with more sustainable production while maintaining or exceeding benchmark performance. The pipeline developed can be easily generalized to other class of materials, and assist in development of comprehensive, accurate and usable databases for sustainable materials design.</description>

      <title>MoreFit: A More Optimised, Rapid and Efficient Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameter estimation via unbinned maximum likelihood fits is a central technique in particle physics. This article introduces MoreFit, which aims to provide a more optimised, rapid and efficient fitting solution for unbinned maximum likelihood fits. MoreFit is developed with a focus on parallelism and relies on computation graphs that are compiled just-in-time. Several novel automatic optimisation techniques are employed on the computation graphs that significantly increase performance compared to conventional approaches. MoreFit can make efficient use of a wide range of heterogeneous platforms through its compute backends that rely on open standards. It provides an OpenCL backend for execution on GPUs of all major vendors, and a backend based on LLVM and Clang for single- or multithreaded execution on CPUs, which in addition allows for SIMD vectorisation. MoreFit is benchmarked against several other fitting frameworks and shows very promising performance, illustrating the power of the approach.</description>

      <title>Community Detection with the Map Equation and Infomap: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world networks have a complex topology comprising many elements often structured into communities. Revealing these communities helps researchers uncover the organizational and functional structure of the system that the network represents. However, detecting community structures in complex networks requires selecting a community detection method among a multitude of alternatives with different network representations, community interpretations, and underlying mechanisms. This tutorial focuses on a popular community detection method called the map equation and its search algorithm Infomap. The map equation framework for community detection describes communities by analyzing dynamic processes on the network. Thanks to its flexibility, the map equation provides extensions that can incorporate various assumptions about network structure and dynamics. To help decide if the map equation is a suitable community detection method for a given complex system and problem at hand - and which variant to choose - we review the map equation's theoretical framework and guide users in applying the map equation to various research problems.</description>

      <title>Deterministic scale-invariant dynamics in a logistic Game-of-Life model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link>

Abstract: Scale invariance is a hallmark of criticality in complex dynamical systems. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required to produce critical behavior, it remains unclear whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions. Here, we address this question by studying the asymptotic dynamics of the logistic Game of Life (GOL), a deterministic-parameter extension of Conway's GOL. In this system, we identify three distinct asymptotic phases separated by two fundamentally different critical points. The first critical point, associated with an unusual form of self-organized criticality, separates a sparse-static phase from a sparse-dynamic phase. The second critical point corresponds to a deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic phase and a third, dense-dynamic phase. In addition, we observe power-law cluster size distributions with unconventional critical exponents not found in standard equilibrium systems. Overall, our work paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Transfer Operators in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator, as a linear representation of a nonlinear dynamical system, has been attracting attention in many fields of science. Recently, Koopman operator theory has been combined with another concept that is popular in data science: reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We follow this thread into Gaussian process methods, and illustrate how these methods can alleviate two pervasive problems with kernel-based Koopman algorithms. The first being sparsity: most kernel methods do not scale well and require an approximation to become practical. We show that not only can the computational demands be reduced, but also demonstrate improved resilience against sensor noise. The second problem involves hyperparameter optimization and dictionary learning to adapt the model to the dynamical system. In summary, the main contribution of this work is the unification of Gaussian process regression and dynamic mode decomposition.</description>
