      <title>More extreme Indian monsoon daily rainfall in El Ni\~no summers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme rainfall in the Indian summer monsoon can be destructive and deadly. Although El Ni\~no/ events in the equatorial Pacific make dry days and whole summers more likely throughout India, their influence on daily extremes is not well established. Despite this summer-mean drying effect, we show using observational data spanning 1901-2020 that El Ni\~no increases extreme rainfall likelihoods within monsoonal India, especially in the the summer's core rainy areas of central-eastern India and the narrow southwestern coastal band. Conversely, extremes are broadly suppressed in the drier southeast and far northwest, and more moderate accumulations are inhibited throughout the domain. These rainfall signals appear driven by corresponding ones in convective buoyancy, provided both the undilute instability of near-surface air and its dilution by mixing with drier air above are accounted for. When the summer ENSO state is predicted from a seasonal forecast ensemble initialized in May, the extreme rainfall patterns broadly persist, suggesting the potential for skillful seasonal forecasts. The framework of analyzing the full distributions of rainfall and convective buoyancy could be usefully applied to hourly extremes, other tropical regions under ENSO, other variability modes, and to trends in extreme rainfall under climate change.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Two-Moment and Three-Moment Bulk Microphysics Schemes in Thunderstorm Simulations over Indian Subcontinent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed three-dimensional thunderstorm real simulations using the two-moment and three-moment bulk microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. We have analyzed three cases to understand the potential differences between the double-moment (Morrison-2M) and National Taiwan University triple-moment (NTU-3M) microphysics parameterizations in capturing the characteristics of lightning events over the Indian subcontinent. Despite general resemblances in these schemes, the simulations reveal distinct differences in storm structure, cloud hydrometeors formation, and precipitation. The lightning flash counts from the in situ lightning detection network (LDN) are also used to compare the simulation of storms. The Lightning Potential Index (LPI) is computed for Morrison-2M and NTU-3M microphysics schemes and compared it with the Lightning Detection Network (LDN) observation. In most cases, the Morrison-2M shows more LPI than the NTU-3M scheme. Both the schemes also differ in simulating rainfall and other thermodynamical, dynamical, and microphysical parameters in the model. Here, we have attempted to identify the basic differences between these two schemes, which may be responsible for the discrepancies in the simulations. In particular, the Morrison-2M produced much higher surface precipitation rates. The effects on the size distributions cloud hydrometeors between two microphysical schemes are important to simulate the biases in the precipitation and lightning flash counts. The inclusions of ice crystal shapes are responsible for many of the key differences between the two microphysics simulations. Different approaches in treating cloud ice, snow, and graupel may have an impact on the simulation of lightning and precipitation. Results show that the simulation of lightning events is sensitive to microphysical parameterization schemes in NWP models.</description>

      <title>Optimized Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Reconstruction and Forecasting of Atmospheric Chemistry Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the optimized dynamic mode decomposition algorithm for constructing an adaptive and computationally efficient reduced order model and forecasting tool for global atmospheric chemistry dynamics. By exploiting a low-dimensional set of global spatio-temporal modes, interpretable characterizations of the underlying spatial and temporal scales can be computed. Forecasting is also achieved with a linear model that uses a linear superposition of the dominant spatio-temporal features. The DMD method is demonstrated on three months of global chemistry dynamics data, showing its significant performance in computational speed and interpretability. We show that the presented decomposition method successfully extracts known major features of atmospheric chemistry, such as summertime surface pollution and biomass burning activities. Moreover, the DMD algorithm allows for rapid reconstruction of the underlying linear model, which can then easily accommodate non-stationary data and changes in the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Edge-wave phase-shifts versus normal-mode phase-tilts in an Eady problem with a sloping boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One mechanistic interpretation of baroclinic instability is that of mutual constructive interference of Rossby edge-waves. While the two edge-waves and their relative phase-shifts are invoked as part of the mechanistic interpretation, the phase-tilts of the related normal modes are often presented instead. Here we highlight the differences between edge-wave phase-shifts and normal-mode phase-tilts, in the context of an Eady problem modified by the presence of a sloping boundary. We argue and present evidence that the normal-mode phase-tilt is potentially a misleading quantity to use, and edge-wave phase-shifts should be the ones that are mechanistically relevant. We also provide a clarification for the mechanistic rationalization for baroclinic instability in the presence of slopes (such as suppression of growth rates) that is valid over all parameter space, in contrast to previous attempts. We further present evidence that there is a strong correlation between quantities diagnosed from the GEOMETRIC framework with the edge-wave phase-shifts, but not the normal-mode phase-tilts. The result is noteworthy in that the geometric framework makes no explicit reference to the edge-wave structures in its construction, but the correlation suggests that in problems where edge-wave structures are not so well-defined or readily available, the GEOMETRIC framework should still capture mechanistic and dynamical information. Some implications for parameterization of baroclinic instability and relevant eddy-mean feedbacks are discussed. For completeness, we also provide an explicit demonstration that the linear instability problem of the present modified Eady problem is parity-time symmetric, and speculate on some suggestive links between parity-time symmetry, shear instability, and the edge-wave interaction mechanism.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimisation for Active Monitoring of Air Pollution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air pollution is one of the leading causes of mortality globally, resulting in millions of deaths each year. Efficient monitoring is important to measure exposure and enforce legal limits. New low-cost sensors can be deployed in greater numbers and in more varied locations, motivating the problem of efficient automated placement. Previous work suggests Bayesian optimisation is an appropriate method, but only considered a satellite data set, with data aggregated over all altitudes. It is ground-level pollution, that humans breathe, which matters most. We improve on those results using hierarchical models and evaluate our models on urban pollution data in London to show that Bayesian optimisation can be successfully applied to the problem.</description>

      <title>Improving Global Weather and Ocean Wave Forecast with Large Artificial Intelligence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, particularly in recent years, has led to the emergence of several large parameter artificial intelligence weather forecast models. These models represent a significant breakthrough, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical weather prediction models and indicating the emergence of profound potential tools for atmosphere-ocean forecasts. This study explores the evolution of these advanced artificial intelligence forecast models, and based on the identified commonalities, proposes the "Three Large Rules" to measure their development. We discuss the potential of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing numerical weather prediction, and briefly outlining the underlying reasons for its great potential. While acknowledging the high accuracy, computational efficiency, and ease of deployment of large artificial intelligence forecast models, we also emphasize the irreplaceable values of traditional numerical forecasts and explore the challenges in the future development of large-scale artificial intelligence atmosphere-ocean forecast models. We believe that the optimal future of atmosphere-ocean weather forecast lies in achieving a seamless integration of artificial intelligence and traditional numerical models. Such a synthesis is anticipated to offer a more advanced and reliable approach for improved atmosphere-ocean forecasts. Additionally, we illustrate how forecasters can adapt and leverage the advanced artificial intelligence model through an example by building a large artificial intelligence model for global ocean wave forecast.</description>
