      <title>Contrasting chaotic and stochastic forcing: tipping windows and attractor crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems subjected to a combination of noise and time-varying forcing can exhibit sudden changes, critical transitions or tipping points where large or rapid dynamic effects arise from changes in a parameter that are small or slow. Noise-induced tipping can occur where extremes of the forcing causes the system to leave one attractor and transition to another. If this noise corresponds to unresolved chaotic forcing, there is a limit such that this can be approximated by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and the statistics of large deviations determine the transitions. Away from this limit it makes sense to consider tipping in the presence of chaotic rather than stochastic forcing. In general we argue that close to a parameter value where there is a bifurcation of the unforced system, there will be a chaotic tipping window outside of which tipping cannot happen, in the limit of asymptotically slow change of that parameter. This window is trivial for a stochastically forced system. Entry into the chaotic tipping window can be seen as a boundary crisis/non-autonomous saddle-node bifurcation and corresponds to an exceptional case of the forcing, typically by an unstable periodic orbit. We discuss an illustrative example of a chaotically forced bistable map that highlight the richness of the geometry and bifurcation structure of the dynamics in this case. If a parameter is changing slowly we note there is a dynamic tipping window that can also be determined in terms of unstable periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Spread and Spectral Complexity in Quantum Spin Chains: from Integrability to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore spread and spectral complexity in quantum systems that exhibit a transition from integrability to chaos, namely the mixed-field Ising model and the next-to-nearest-neighbor deformation of the Heisenberg XXZ spin chain. We corroborate the observation that the presence of a peak in spread complexity before its saturation, is a characteristic feature in chaotic systems. We find that, in general, the saturation value of spread complexity post-peak depends not only on the spectral statistics of the Hamiltonian, but also on the specific state. However, there appears to be a maximal universal bound determined by the symmetries and dimension of the Hamiltonian, which is realized by the thermofield double state (TFD) at infinite temperature. We also find that the time scales at which the spread complexity and spectral form factor change their behaviour agree with each other and are independent of the chaotic properties of the systems. In the case of spectral complexity, we identify that the key factor determining its saturation value and timescale in chaotic systems is given by minimum energy difference in the theory's spectrum. This explains observations made in the literature regarding its earlier saturation in chaotic systems compared to their integrable counterparts. We conclude by discussing the properties of the TFD which, we conjecture, make it suitable for probing signatures of chaos in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical regimes of CCN activation in adiabatic air parcels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ubiquitous, yet elusive to a complete understanding: Tiny, warm clouds with faint visual signatures play a critical role in Earth's energy balance. These "twilight clouds", as they are sometimes called, form under weak updraft conditions. Their constituent particles exist in a precarious state, teetering between hazy wisps and activated droplets. This delicate thermodynamic balance creates a limited reservoir of supersaturation, which activated droplets readily consume. Our research presents a novel approach, solving coupled equations for particle growth (K\"ohler's equation) and supersaturation change. This reveals previously unconsidered activation states for these clouds. Additionally, the analysis predicts conditions where particles can exhibit self-sustained oscillations between haze and activated droplet states.</description>
