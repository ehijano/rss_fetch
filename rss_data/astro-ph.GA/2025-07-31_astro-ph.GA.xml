      <title>Auriga Superstars: Improving the resolution and fidelity of stellar dynamics in cosmological galaxy simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have become an indispensable tool to understand galaxies. However, computational constraints still severely limit their numerical resolution. This not only restricts the sampling of the stellar component and its direct comparison to detailed observations, but also the precision with which it is evolved. To overcome these problems we introduce the \emph{Superstars} method. This method increases the stellar mass resolution in cosmological galaxy simulations in a computationally inexpensive way for a fixed dark matter and gas resolution without altering any global properties of the simulated galaxies. We demonstrate the \emph{Superstars} method for a Milky Way-like galaxy of the Auriga project, improving the stellar mass resolution by factors of $8$ and $64$. We show and quantify that this improves the sampling of the stellar population in the disc and halo without changing the properties of the central galaxy or its satellites, unlike simulations that change the resolution of all components (gas, dark matter, stars). Moreover, the better stellar mass resolution reduces numerical heating of the stellar disc in its outskirts and keeps substructures in the stellar disc and inner halo more coherent. It also makes lower mass and lower surface brightness structures in the stellar halo more visible. The \emph{Superstars} method is straightforward to incorporate in any cosmological galaxy simulation that does not resolve individual stars.</description>

      <title>Probing Turbulence, Gravity, Supernovae, and Magnetic Field Effects with the 6D Kinematics of Young Stars in Milky Way Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of star forming gas can be affected by many physical processes, such as turbulence, gravity, supernova explosions, and magnetic fields. In this paper, we investigate several nearby star forming regions (Orion, Upper Sco, Taurus, and Perseus) for kinematic imprints of these influences on the newly formed stars. Using Gaia DR3 astrometry and APOGEE DR17 radial velocities, we compute first-order velocity structure functions (VSFs) of young stars in galactic Cartesian coordinates in both 6D (3D positions and 3D velocities) and 4D (3D positions and each 1D velocity) to identify signatures of turbulence and anisotropic motion. We also construct 3D and 1D radial velocity profiles to identify coherent expansion trends, and compare stellar proper motions to plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations in Taurus and Perseus. We find that the VSFs are mildly anisotropic, with slightly different amplitudes, slopes, or features in different directions in several groups, but in general, they are all consistent with Larson's Relation at intermediate length scales, especially in less compact groups. In several cases, the VSFs exhibit features suggestive of local energy injection from supernovae. Radial velocity profiles reveal clear anisotropic expansion in multiple groups, with the most extreme cases corresponding to those with the most anisotropic VSFs. In Perseus, we find that the motions of young stars are preferentially perpendicular to the local magnetic field. We find multiple, overlapping causes in each group for the observed kinematics. Our findings support that young stars remember more than just the turbulent state of their natal clouds.</description>

      <title>Cusp-to-Core Transition of Dark Matter Halos across Galaxy Mass Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the diversity of dark matter (DM) density profiles in a large sample of late-type galaxies from the SPARC database, with the goal of testing whether a cusp-to-core transition occurs across galaxy mass scales. We perform Bayesian fits to high-quality rotation curves using flexible halo models that allow for variations in the inner slopes of DM density profiles. We quantify the central dark matter structure using the surface density within the inner region of the halo, defined as $\Sigma_{\rm DM}(&lt;0.01r_{V_{\rm max}})$, and compare the SPARC galaxies with Milky Way dwarf satellites as well as galaxy groups and clusters. Our results reveal significant diversity in the inner density slopes of SPARC galaxies, ranging from steep cusps to shallow cores, and show that many of them lie below the cuspy profiles predicted by the cold dark matter model, consistent with core-like structures. In contrast, both lower-mass dwarf galaxies and higher-mass galaxy clusters tend to follow the cuspy DM halos. These findings suggest that baryonic feedback may induce a cusp-to-core transition in Milky Way-mass galaxies, as predicted by hydrodynamical simulations. However, observational limitations and modeling uncertainties still prevent a definitive conclusion. This study provides new empirical insights into the halo mass-dependent nature of DM inner structures and the role of baryonic processes in shaping them.</description>

      <title>The X-ray Link Between High Eddington Ratio Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) and Hot DOGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) with extremely red optical-to-infrared colors are often associated with intense starburst and AGN activity. Studying DOGs can provide insights into the processes that drive the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. However, the general DOG population is heterogeneous, spanning a wide range of evolutionary stages, and has X-ray obscuring column densities ($N_\mathrm{H}$) covering low-to-high levels. In this work, we focus on seven high Eddington ratio DOGs ($\log \lambda_\mathrm{Edd} \gtrsim -0.5$) to examine their X-ray obscuration properties using new and archival X-ray observations. We confirm that these systems are generally heavily obscured, with 6/7 having $N_\mathrm{H}\gtrsim10^{23}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$ and 3/7 having $N_\mathrm{H}\gtrsim10^{24}~\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. Based on the observed similarity with the rare Hot DOG population, we argue that both high-$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ DOGs and Hot DOGs likely trace the post-merger phase during which AGNs are enshrouded by large columns of dust-rich material.</description>

      <title>CECILIA: Ultra-Deep Rest-Optical Spectra of Faint Galaxies at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsically faint galaxies at $z\sim2-3$ offer critical insights into early galaxy formation, tracing low-metallicity, low-mass systems during Cosmic Noon and serving as analogs to reionization-era galaxies. We present ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of nine low-luminosity galaxies ($-17 \lesssim M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -20$, $M_\star \lesssim 10^9\,M_\odot$) at $z\sim2.5$ from the CECILIA program, with $\sim$29.5 hr in G235M/F170LP and 1 hr in G395M/F290LP. Our sample includes four LAEs, three rest-UV color-selected galaxies, and two serendipitous detections -- providing the most sensitive rest-optical spectra of individual faint galaxies at this epoch to date. Balmer-line measurements reveal low SFRs ($0.63 &lt; \mathrm{SFR}/(M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}) &lt; 5.43$) and a broad range of dust reddening ($0 &lt; E(B-V) &lt; 1$), with SFRs systematically below those of continuum-selected galaxies. Electron densities are low ($n_e \lesssim 200$cm$^{-3}$), and emission-line diagnostics indicate low [NII]/H$\alpha$, high [OIII]/H$\beta$, suggesting metallicities $12+\log({\rm O/H})\lesssim8.0$. We also present the first O1-BPT constraints in such faint high-redshift galaxies. Notably, two galaxies show low [OIII]/H$\beta$ despite high Ly$\alpha$ EWs and very low [NII]/H$\alpha$, consistent with the predicted turnover in this ratio at very low metallicities -- highlighting the need for complementary diagnostics (e.g., N2, O32) to identify metal-poor systems. Direct $T_e$-based abundances and expanded samples are needed to further trace metallicity and ionization trends in low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph$-$Distant Quasar Survey: the Chandra View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Chandra observations of 63 sources from the Gemini Near Infrared Spectrograph$-$Distant Quasar Survey (GNIRS-DQS) of which 54 were targeted by snapshot observations in Cycle 24. A total of 55 sources are clearly detected in at least one X-ray band, and we set stringent upper limits on the X-ray fluxes of the remaining eight sources. In combination with rest-frame ultraviolet-optical spectroscopic data for these sources, we assess whether X-rays can provide a robust accretion-rate indicator for quasars, particularly at the highest accessible redshifts. We utilize a recently modified H$\beta$-based Eddington luminosity ratio estimator, as well as the C IV $\lambda$1549 emission-line parameter space to investigate trends and correlations with the optical-X-ray spectral slope ($\alpha_{\mathrm{ox}}$) and the effective hard-X-ray power-law photon index ($\Gamma$). We find that $\alpha_{\mathrm{ox}}$ does not improve current accretion-rate estimates based on H$\beta$ or C IV. Instead, within the limitations of our sample, we confirm previous findings that the C IV parameter space may be a better indicator of the accretion rate up to $z\sim3.5$. We also find that the average $\Gamma$ values for a small subset of our sources, as well as the average $\Gamma$ value in different groupings of our sources, are consistent with their respective relatively high Eddington luminosity ratios. Deeper X-ray observations of our X-ray-detected sources are needed for measuring $\Gamma$ accurately and testing whether this parameter can serve as a robust, un-biased accretion-rate diagnostic.</description>

      <title>MUSEQuBES: The Column Density, Covering Fraction, Mass, and Environmental Dependence of Cool HI Gas Around Low-Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate cool HI gas traced by Lyman series absorption in the vicinity of 256 galaxies (median stellar mass, log10(M*/Msun) = 8.7 and median redshift, z = 0.48) using 15 background quasars (median impact parameter, D ~ 140 physical kpc (pkpc)), as part of the MUSE Quasar-fields Blind Emitters Survey (MUSEQuBES). We find that the HI column density (N(HI)) profile around isolated, star-forming galaxies, which span ~ 3 dex in stellar mass, is well described by a power law with a slope of ~ -2.3 when expressed as a function of the normalized impact parameter, D/Rvir. The HI covering fraction (k) within the virial radius, for a threshold of log10(N(HI)/cm^{-2}) = 14, is significantly lower for high-mass passive galaxies compared to their isolated, star-forming counterparts. The k-profile of isolated, star-forming galaxies suggests a characteristic size of the HI-rich CGM of ~ 1.5 Rvir, consistently across the stellar mass range. The mean HI mass in the outer CGM (0.3-1 Rvir ) increases with stellar mass, ranging from ~ 10^{5} to 10^{6.6} Msun. The b-parameters of the strongest HI components correlate and anti-correlate with specific star-formation rate (sSFR) and mass, respectively, with &gt; 2 sigma significance. Broad Lya absorbers (BLAs) with b &gt; 60 km s^{-1} are predominantly associated with high-mass galaxies, likely tracing the warm-hot phase of the CGM. The velocity centroids of HI components indicate that the absorbers at D &lt; Rvir are predominantly consistent with being gravitationally bound to their associated galaxy, regardless of stellar mass. Finally, leveraging ~3000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from the wide-field Magellan follow-up of six MUSEQuBES fields, we find that non-isolated galaxies exhibit an HI-rich environment that extends approximately three times further than for their isolated counterparts.</description>

      <title>Streams and Shells Decoded: A Density-Driven Approach to Stellar Clustering in Galactic Halos with AstroLink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method to differentiate stream-like and shell-like tidal remnants of stellar systems in galactic halos using the density-based approach of the clustering algorithm AstroLink. While previous studies lean on observation, phase-space, and action-space based criteria for stream and shell determination, we introduce AstroLink's ordered-density plot and cluster identification as a viable tool for classification. For a given data set, the AstroLink ordered-density plot reveals the density-based hierarchical clustering structure from which the resultant clusters are identified as being statistically significant overdensities. Using simulations of sub-halo disruptions in an external potential to generate samples of tidal structures, we find that the curvature of the ordered-density plot is positive for stream-like structures and negative for shell-like structures. Comparisons with more standard classification techniques reveal strong agreement on which structures typically fit into stream-like and shell-like categories. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of clustered stream and shell samples in radial phase space and energy-angle space. Given the sensitivity of stellar tidal structures to their host dark matter halos, the identification and subsequent classification of these structures provide exciting avenues of investigation in galactic evolution dynamics and dark matter structure formation.</description>

      <title>AGN contribution on the morphological parameters of their host galaxies up to intermediate redshifts of z~2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of Active Galaxy Nuclei (AGN) can affect the morphological classification of galaxies. This work aims to determine how the contribution of AGN affects the most used morphological parameters down to the redshift of z~2 in COSMOS-like conditions. We use a sample of &gt; 2000 local non-active galaxies, with a well-known visual morphological classification, and add an AGN as an unresolved component that contributes to the total galaxy flux with 5%-75%. We moved all the galaxies to lower magnitudes (higher redshifts) to map the conditions in the COSMOS field, and we measured six morphological parameters. The greatest impact on morphology occurs when considering the combined effect of magnitude, redshift and AGN, with spiral galaxies being the most affected. In general, all the concentration parameters change significantly if the AGN contribution is &gt; 25% and the magnitude &gt; 23. We find that the GINI coefficient is the most stable in terms of AGN and magnitude/redshift, followed by the M20, Conselice-Bershady (CCON), and finally the Abraham (CABR) concentration indexes. We find that, when using morphological parameters, the combination of CABR, CCON and asymmetry is the most effective in classifying active galaxies at high-redshift, followed by the combination of CABR and GINI.</description>

      <title>Key Physical Parameters Influencing Fragmentation and Multiplicity in Dense Cores of Orion A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When dense cores in molecular clouds or filamentary structures collapse and form protostars, they may undergo fragmentation and form binary or multiple systems. In this paper, we investigated the key mechanisms influencing fragmentation by comparing the physical conditions of fragmented and unfragmented dense cores (~0.1 pc) in Orion A. Utilizing archival submillimeter continuum data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array survey of Class 0 and I protostars at a 0.''1 resolution, we identified 38 dense cores hosting single protostars and 15 cores hosting binary or multiple systems. We measured the dense cores properties with the Herschel dust temperature, Nobeyama 45m N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, and JCMT polarization data. Our results reveal that the dense cores hosting binary/multiple systems exhibit significantly higher density and Mach number compared to those hosting single protostars, while there are no correlations between the occurrence of fragmentation and the energy ratios of turbulence and magnetic field to gravity. Our results suggest that the higher density and supersonic turbulence of the dense cores can lead to local collapse and fragmentation to form binary/multiple systems, while the magnetic field has limited influence on fragmentation in the dense cores in Orion A.</description>

      <title>Chemical segregation analysed with unsupervised clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular emission is a powerful tool for studying the physical and chemical structures of dense cores. The distribution and abundance of different molecules provide information on the chemical composition and physical properties in these cores. We study the chemical segregation of three molecules (c-C$_3$H$_2$, CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CCH) in the starless cores B68 and L1521E, and the prestellar core L1544. We applied the density-based clustering algorithms DBSCAN and HDBSCAN to identify chemical and physical structures within these cores. To enable cross-core comparisons, the input samples were characterised based on their physical environment, discarding the 2D spatial information. The clustering analysis showed significant chemical differentiation across the cores, successfully reproducing the known molecular segregation of c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$OH in all three cores. Furthermore, it identifies a segregation between c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CH$_3$CCH, which is not apparent from the emission maps. Key features driving the clustering are integrated intensity, velocity offset, H$_2$ column density, and H$_2$ column density gradient. Different environmental conditions are reflected in the variations in the feature relevance across the cores. This study shows that density-based clustering provides valuable insights into chemical and physical structures of starless cores. It demonstrates that already small datasets of two or three molecules can yield meaningful results. This new approach revealed similarities in the clustering patterns of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CCH relative to c-C$_3$H$_2$, suggesting that c-C$_3$H$_2$ traces regions of lower density than to the other two molecules. This allowed for insight into the CH$_3$CCH peak in L1544, which appears to trace a landing point of chemically fresh gas that is accreted to the core, highlighting the impact of accretion processes on molecular distributions.</description>

      <title>A MaNGA about the Legacy I: Connecting the Assembly of Stellar Halo with the Average Star Formation History in Low-Redshift Massive Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the connection between stellar mass distribution, assembly history, and star formation timescales in low-redshift massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) by combining deep LegacySurvey imaging with MaNGA's spatially resolved spectroscopy. Focusing on stellar population properties, especially the [Mg/Fe] abundance ratio, we analyze stacked spectra using both absorption line indices and full-spectrum fitting. We find that, among massive ETGs with identical average stellar mass distributions beyond 5 kpc, those with higher central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{cen}$) are older and more $\alpha$-enhanced, suggesting a connection between the in-situ star formation in the past and the central gravitational potential today for massive ETGs with a similar stellar accretion history. Conversely, at fixed $\sigma_{cen}$ and total stellar mass, galaxies with more extended stellar halos show lower [Fe/H], higher [Mg/Fe], and older ages, indicating an intriguing link between early starburst and quenching and later ex-situ assembly. These results demonstrate that the evolution of massive galaxies cannot be fully described by simple scaling relations alone, as the interplay between in-situ star formation and ex-situ accretion leaves distinct imprints in both their inner and outer stellar populations. Our findings highlight the importance of extending stellar population studies to large radii and underscore the scientific potential of next-generation IFU surveys and deep, high-resolution spectroscopy for probing the galaxy-halo connection.</description>

      <title>A visual approach to global accretion disk instabilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over 30 years, the Magneto-Rotational Instability has been accepted as the mechanism driving accretion disk turbulence. Its physical basis is well understood, where an interplay between centrifugal forces and magnetic tension transfers angular momentum between oppositely displaced fluid elements. In this work, we revisit this picture in global disk models and various magnetic field topologies and generalise it to non-axisymmetric instabilities like the Super-Alfv\'enic Rotational Instability (SARI). We use the open-source \texttt{Legolas} software to quantify all complex-valued linear eigenfunctions for the (near-)eigenmodes and visualise the resulting spatio-temporal variations in real space in a manner that can be compared to direct numerical simulations of disks. The field perturbations are fundamentally different between the (axisymmetric) MRI and the novel, ultra-localised SARI modes, which bear some resemblance to spiral modes in galaxies but differ in important ways. We use a combined numerical-analytical approach to study the polarization of the magnetic and velocity field perturbations. Finally, we compare disks of differing magnetic topology where many linear modes are merely superposed to recreate a visual impression of `turbulent' fields and quantify the resulting stresses. We find that even superposed, still linearly growing SARI modes can already provide the needed effective viscosity-related alpha-values invoked for angular momentum transport. 3D views on the magnetic field perturbations show that SARI modes of opposite azimuthal mode number may naturally introduce plasmoid and toroidal flux-tube like field deformations.</description>

      <title>Spiral Structure Properties, Dynamics, and Evolution in MW-mass Galaxy Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of spiral galaxies is essential to understanding the dynamics and evolution of disc galaxies; however, the precise nature of spiral arms remains uncertain. Two challenges in understanding the mechanisms driving spirals are how galactic environment impacts spiral morphology and how they evolve over time. We present a catalog characterizing the properties, dynamics, and evolution of m=2 spiral structure in 10 Milky Way-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. Consistent with previous literature, we find that FIRE-2 spirals are transient, recurring features simultaneously present in the disc at varying pattern speeds ($\Omega_p$) that broadly decrease with radius. These spirals persist on Gyr timescales (mean duration 1.90 Gyr), but fluctuate in amplitude on timescales of hundreds of Myr. Tidal interactions and bar episodes impact the resulting m=2 spiral structure; strong satellite interactions generally produce shorter-lived, stronger spirals with larger radial extent, and bars can increase $\Omega_p$. Galactic environment influences spiral structure; kinematically colder discs can support longer-lived, stronger spirals. The properties of identified spirals in FIRE-2 vary widely in radial extent (0.3-10.8 kpc), duration (1.00-6.00 Gyr), and amplitudes ($a_{2,\text{max}}$=0.018-0.192). We find the presence of spirals in all age populations, suggesting these are density wave-driven features. This work represents the first time that spiral structure has been cataloged in this manner in cosmological simulations; the catalog can be leveraged with current and forthcoming observational surveys, enabling systematic comparisons to further our understanding of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Extended multi-phase gas reservoirs in the z=4.3 protocluster SPT2349-56: non-stellar ionisation sources?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to characterize the multi-phase gas in the SPT2349-56 protocluster at z=4.3, known to host one of the most starbursting and AGN-rich high redshift environments.For this purpose we conducted APEX single dish observations of the [CII]158 micron (hereafter [CII]) line towards the Core and North components, previously imaged with the ALMA 12-m array. We also present the first [OIII]88 micron (hereafter [OIII]) line observations in such high redshift protocluster system. We obtain a [CII] line luminosity $\sim$1.7$\times$ more than the one recovered by ALMA towards the Core, while remarkably we recover 4$\times$ more [CII] line emission than the one found in deep ALMA images towards the North component, suggesting that the most massive gas reservoirs lie in the less extreme regions of this protocluster system. A minimum ionised gas mass of $\mathrm M_{\rm min}(H^+)$$ \sim$$3.7\times 10^{10}$\,\Msun\, is deduced from the [OIII] line, amounting to 30\% of the molecular gas mass in the same area. Finally we obtain star formation rate (SFR) estimates using the [OIII] line luminosity, and the corresponding ionised gas mass. These yield values that can surpass the far-IR continuum-derived SFR (under the assumption of a standard stellar IMF), which can be reconciled only if non-stellar ionising sources contribute to the [OIII] line luminosity, or a top-heavy stellar IMF produces a larger fraction of O stars per total stellar mass, a distinct possibility in High-Energy-Particle (HEP) rather than (UV-photon)-dominated environments in clusters. Future work using far-IR fine-structure and molecular/neutral-atomic lines is necessary for determining the thermal/ionisation states of the multi-phase medium and these line ratios must be measured over a wide range of spatial scales, which ultimately requires combining wide-field single-dish and high resolution interferometric observations.</description>

      <title>JADES-GS-z14-1: A Compact, Faint Galaxy at $z\approx14$ with Weak Metal Lines from Extremely Deep JWST MIRI, NIRCam, and NIRSpec Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has shed light on galaxy formation and metal enrichment within 300 Myr of the Big Bang. While luminous galaxies at $z &gt; 10$ often show significant [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 emission lines, it remains unclear whether such features are prevalent among fainter, more typical galaxies due to observational limits. We present deep imaging and spectroscopy of JADES-GS-z14-1 at $z_\mathrm{spec}=13.86^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$, currently the faintest spectroscopically confirmed galaxy at $z\approx 14$. It serendipitously received 70.7 hours of MIRI/F770W imaging in the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES), the deepest MIRI exposure for any high-redshift galaxy to date. Nonetheless, we detect only tentative F770W emission of $7.9\pm2.8$ nJy at $2.8\sigma$ significance, constraining the total equivalent width of [O III]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 + H$\beta$ to $520^{+400}_{-380}$ A, weaker than most $z &gt; 10$ galaxies with MIRI detections. This source is unresolved across 16 NIRCam bands, implying a physical radius $\lesssim50$ pc. NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy totaling 56 hours reveals no rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines above $3 \sigma$. Stellar population synthesis suggests a stellar mass $\sim4\times 10^{7}$ $\mathrm{M_\odot}$ and a star formation rate $\sim 2$ $\mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. The absence of strong metal emission lines despite intense star formation suggests a gas-phase metallicity below 10% solar and potentially a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. These deep observations provide rare constraints on faint, early galaxies, tracing the onset of chemical enrichment and ionization in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Formation of over-massive black holes in high-redshift disk galaxies via globular cluster accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have suggested the existence of over-massive black holes (OMBHs) in high-redshift galaxies. In this paper, we propose a new mechanism for the formation of OMBHs, based on the accretion of globular clusters (GCs) in compact disk galaxies. We derive the conditions under which OMBHs can form, focusing on key parameters such as halo mass, redshift, and halo spin parameter. Our results show that at redshift $z = 10$, a halo with mass $10^{11}~M_{\odot}$ and a spin parameter of $0.02$ can form a black hole of $1.4 \times 10^{8}~M_{\odot}$ through GC migration and accretion via tidal disruption events (TDEs). The resulting black hole-to-stellar mass ratio can reach $\sim 0.1$, corresponding to the fraction of GC mass accreted onto the black hole. This mechanism thus provides a plausible explanation for the OMBHs observed by JWST. Furthermore, by combining our model with halo mass functions and the distribution of spin parameters, we construct black hole mass functions that successfully reproduce the number densities of massive BH candidates at $z \sim 5$ inferred from JWST observations, and UHZ1 and GHZ9 at $z \sim 10$.</description>

      <title>Sulfur oxides tracing streamers and shocks at low mass protostellar disk-envelope interfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion shocks are thought to play a crucial role in the early stages of star and planet formation, but their direct observational evidence remains elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common, with warm ($T_{\rm ex} &gt; 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\rm ex} \gtrsim 100$ K) spots or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1) the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like inner envelope warrants further special attention.</description>

      <title>On the origins of oxygen: ALMA and JWST characterise the multi-phase, metal-enriched, star-bursting medium within a 'normal' $z &gt; 11$ galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unexpectedly high abundance of galaxies at $z &gt; 11$ revealed by JWST has sparked a debate on the nature of early galaxies and the physical mechanisms regulating their formation. The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has begun to provide vital insights on their gas and dust content, but so far only for extreme 'blue monsters'. Here we present new, deep ALMA observations of JADES-GS-z11-0, a more typical (sub-$L^*$) $z &gt; 11$ galaxy that bridges the discovery space of JWST and the Hubble Space Telescope. These data confirm the presence of the [O III] 88 $\mu$m line at $4.5\sigma$ significance, precisely at the redshift of several faint emission lines previously seen with JWST/NIRSpec, while the underlying dust continuum remains undetected ($F_\nu &lt; 9.0 \, \mathrm{\mu Jy}$), implying an obscured star formation rate (SFR) of $\text{SFR}_\text{IR} \lesssim 6 \, \mathrm{M_\odot \, yr^{-1}}$ and dust mass of $M_\text{dust} \lesssim 1.0 \times 10^{6} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ (all $3\sigma$). The accurate ALMA redshift of $z_\text{[O III]} = 11.1221 \pm 0.0006$ ($\gtrsim \! 5\times$ refined over NIRSpec) helps confirm that redshifts measured purely from the Lyman-$\alpha$ break, even spectroscopically, should properly take into account the effects of potential damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption (DLA) systems to avoid systematic overestimates of up to $\Delta z \approx 0.5$. The [O III] 88 $\mu$m luminosity of $L_\text{[O III]} = (1.0 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{8} \, \mathrm{L_\odot}$, meanwhile, agrees well with the scaling relation for local metal-poor dwarfs given the SFR measured by NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI. The spatially resolved MIRI and ALMA emission also underscores that JADES-GS-z11-0 is likely to consist of two low-mass components that are undergoing strong bursts of star formation yet are already pre-enriched in oxygen (~30% solar), only 400 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Measuring the splashback feature: Dependence on halo properties and history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we define the novel splashback depth $\mathcal{D}$ and width $\mathcal{W}$ to examine how the splashback features of dark matter haloes are affected by the physical properties of haloes themselves. We use the largest simulation run in the hydrodynamic MillenniumTNG project. By stacking haloes in bins of halo mass, redshift, mass-dependent properties such as peak height and concentration, and halo formation history, we measure the shape of the logarithmic slope of the density profile of dark matter haloes. Our results show that the splashback depth has a strong dependence on the halo mass which follows a power law $\mathcal{D}\propto\left(\log_{10}M\right)^{2.8}$. Properties with strong correlation with halo mass demonstrate similar dependence. The splashback width has the strongest dependence on halo peak height and follows a power law $\mathcal{W}\propto\nu^{-0.87}$. We provide the fitting functions of the splashback depth and width in terms of halo mass, redshift, peak height, concentrations and halo formation time. The depth and width are therefore considered to be a long term memory tracker of haloes since they depend more on accumulative physical properties, e.g., halo mass, peak height and halo formation time. They are shaped primarily by the halo's assembly history, which exerts a stronger influence on the inner density profile than short-term dynamical processes. In contrast, the splashback features have little dependence on the short term factors such as halo mass accretion rate and most recent major merger time. The splashback depth and width can therefore be used to complement information gained from quantities like the point of steepest slope or truncation radius to characterise the halo's history and inner structure.</description>

      <title>The Binary Fraction of B-type Runaway Stars from LAMOST DR8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Runaway stars are defined as stars that depart from their birth clusters at high peculiar velocities. There are two main mechanisms for the formation of runaway stars, i.e., the binary-supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the binary fraction of runaway stars is an important step in further exploring the relative significance of the two mechanisms. We analyzed the binary fraction of 203 Galactic B-type runaway stars identified in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 8 database. Our analysis of radial velocity variations in the runaway star sample reveals an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of $5.4\%\pm 1.6\%$, representing the proportion of objects that exhibit statistically significant variations in radial velocity with amplitudes larger than $\rm 16~km~s^{-1}$. We employed a Monte Carlo method to correct for observational biases and determined an intrinsic binary fraction of $27\%\pm 8\%$. The period and mass ratio distributions that best reproduce the observation are $f(P)\propto P^{-5.7}$ for $1\leq P\leq 1000$ days, and $f(q)\propto q^{-3.6}$ for $0.1\leq q\leq 1.0$, indicating a preference for binaries with shorter periods and less massive companions compared to a uniform distribution. The intrinsic binary fraction, in combination with previous studies on the binary fractions of runaway stars formed by the BSS and the DES, implies that both scenarios contribute comparably to the formation of Galactic B-type runaway stars, where the ratio of the BSS to the DES is 0.86.</description>

      <title>SOAP: A Python Package for Calculating the Properties of Galaxies and Halos Formed in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern large scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations require robust tools capable of analysing their data outputs in a parallel and efficient manner. We introduce SOAP (Spherical Overdensity and Aperture Processor), a Python package designed to compute halo and galaxy properties from SWIFT simulations after being post-processed with a subhalo finder. SOAP takes a subhalo catalogue as input and calculates a wide array of properties for each object. SOAP offers parallel processing capabilities via mpi4py for efficient handling of large datasets, and allows for consistent property calculation across multiple halo finders. SOAP supports various halo definitions, including spherical overdensities and fixed physical apertures, providing flexibility for diverse observational comparisons. The package is compatible with both dark matter-only and full hydrodynamic simulations, producing HDF5 catalogues that are integrated with the swiftsimio package for seamless unit handling.</description>

Abstract: Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.</description>

      <title>Tracking on-the-fly massive black hole binary evolution and coalescence in galaxy simulations: RAMCOAL</title>

Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from massive black hole binary (MBHB) coalescence motivates the development of a sub-grid model. We present RAMCOAL, integrated into the RAMSES code, which simulates the orbital evolution of MBHBs, accounting for stellar and gaseous dynamical friction (DF), stellar scattering, circumbinary disk interactions, and GW emission at scales below the simulation resolution. Unlike post-processing approaches, RAMCOAL tracks the real-time evolution of MBHBs within hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies using local quantities to model dynamics and accretion. This enables more accurate predictions of both GW signals and the properties of merging black holes. We validate RAMCOAL across isolated and merging galaxy setups at resolutions of 10, 50, and 100 pc, with and without black hole accretion and feedback. In addition, we test the model in seven galaxy merger scenarios at 100 pc resolution. These tests demonstrate that RAMCOAL is largely resolution-independent and successfully captures the effects of DF from stars, dark matter, and gas, loss-cone scattering, viscous drag from circumbinary disks, and GW emission -- all within a realistic galactic environment, even at low resolutions. With RAMCOAL, we can better estimate MBHB coalescence rates and the GW background, while providing insights into the electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources. This approach bridges the gap between electromagnetic observations and GW detection, offering a more comprehensive understanding of MBHB evolution in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Planetesimals Formed in H$_2$O-Rich Disks at Cosmic Dawn</title>

Abstract: Primordial, or Pop III, supernovae (SNe) were the first, great nucleosynthetic engines in the Universe, forging the heavy elements required for the later formation of planets, and life. Past studies suggest that the rise of planet formation was gradual, and did not peak until about half of the present age of the Universe after cosmic mean metallicities exceeded a critical value. Here we show that planetesimals, the precursors of terrestrial planets, can form around low-mass, long-lived stars in the debris of the first cosmic explosions 200 Myr after the Big Bang, before the first galaxies and far earlier than previously thought. Pop III pair-instability SNe, which can eject over 100 solar masses of metals, produced dense cloud cores that were enriched to metallicities $\gtrsim$ 0.1 Z$_{\odot}$. One such core in our cosmological simulation with a Jeans mass of just 1 - 2 M$_{\odot}$ collapsed to a protoplanetary disk in which several Earth masses of planetesimals formed 0.46 - 1.1 AU from their parent 0.7 M$_{\odot}$ star. The protoplanetary disk has H$_2$O mass fractions that are only a factor of a few less than in the Solar System today, and planetesimal formation occurs within the water snowline of the star. This raises the possibility of subsequent enrichment of the first planets in the Universe with water, in direct analogy to Earth in the Solar system.</description>

      <title>The Intermediate-Mass Black Hole Reverberation Mapping Project: First Detection of Mid-Infrared Lags in Prototypical IMBHs in NGC 4395 and POX 52</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for robust evidence of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) is crucial for understanding black hole seeding process and the formation of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. NGC 4395 and POX 52 are two prototypical IMBH hosts, both exhibiting multi-line evidence of low-mass black hole activity. Here, we report the first detection of mid-infrared (MIR) lags in response to optical variability, with measurements of $3.0^{+2.4}_{-1.9}$ days for NGC 4395 and $35.2^{+14.2}_{-11.7}$ days for POX~52 at $3.4$ $\mu$m, respectively, using archival optical data and observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). This detection provides the first reverberation evidence of low-mass black hole activity in POX 52. The time lags of these two low-mass, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) generally follow the extent of the $R_{\rm dust}-L_{\rm 5100}$ relation found in higher-mass AGNs. Based on an empirical relation between the broad-line region and dusty torus size, we constrain the black hole mass of POX 52 to log($M_{\rm BH}$/$M_\odot$) = 5.5 $\pm$ 0.37 (systemic and statistical errors), confirming its IMBH nature. Furthermore, long-term optical continuum monitoring of POX 52 reveals a mild inter-band lag of $\lesssim$ 1 day. However, no significant intranight variability was detected during its one-night, high-cadence monitoring, which we attribute to the longer duty cycle of fast variability in POX 52 compared to that in NGC 4395.</description>

Abstract: A method is presented for obtaining unified radial distributions of dark matter properties for different galaxies independent of their mass, type, or size. The publicly available measurements of 2693 stellar objects of 153 different galaxies of the SPARC-group [3] are used to demonstrate the effectivity of the method. The obtained unified radial distributions of dark matter properties like velocity, acceleration, mass and mass density give a detailed understanding of the general dark matter behavior within in the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Delayed Feedback in High-$z$ Starbursts Revealed by Lyman-$\alpha$ Profiles and Metal Line Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lyman-$\alpha$ emission, which owing to its resonant nature strongly couples the emergent line profile to gas kinematics, is a key observable for probing outflows from star-forming galaxies in the early universe. Inferences of outflow properties from Lyman-$\alpha$, however, often lack contextual comparisons with more direct outflow diagnostics from down-the-barrel metal absorption lines and driving-source properties from metal emission lines. Here, we make such checks by taking advantage of the lensing magnification provided by galaxy clusters for 338 Lyman-$\alpha$ sources observed with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). Using metal emission lines to measure systemic redshifts, we confirm that the Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles are consistent with outflowing gas: single peaks redshifted relative to, or double peaks straddling, the systemic redshift. In cases where metal absorption lines are detected, blueshifted velocities indicate outflows, while line ratios point to absorption by a clumpy medium. We find systematic differences in both metal absorption and emission lines associated with single- versus double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles, such that the latter are preferentially associated with weaker and narrower metal absorption profiles, but stronger emission lines indicating younger stellar ages ($\lesssim4\,$Myr for double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ vs $\gtrsim10\,$Myr for single-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$). Double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles may therefore reflect weaker feedback in extremely young starbursts due to the delayed onset of core-collapse supernovae. Fitting model Lyman-$\alpha$ profiles based on simple expanding shell geometry to those observed, we find that such models successfully reproduce the data, yet systematically overestimate systemic redshifts and yield unphysical parameters -- calling for caution when inferring outflow properties from such models.</description>

      <title>BASS LII: The prevalence of double-peaked broad lines at low accretion rates among hard X-ray selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have double-peaked H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and Mg II broad lines attributed to emission from rotating gas in the accretion disk. Using optical spectroscopy of a flux-limited sample of AGN selected via ultrahard X-rays from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS), we systematically identify 71 double-peaked emitters amongst 343 broad-line AGN with redshifts $0.004&lt;z&lt;0.297$ and 2-10 KeV X-ray luminosities of log 40-45.7 (erg/s), and provide their best-fit accretion disk geometry parameters. We find that ~21% of X-ray selected broad-line AGN are double-peaked emitters (DPEs), consistent with rates previously reported for $z&lt;0.2$ broad-line AGN selected for strong optical variability in ZTF. 11 of 71 DPEs (15%) exhibited a single-peaked Gaussian component to the broad line profile in addition to the double-peaked disk profile. In this sample, DPEs have intrinsically higher masses by ~0.4 dex and lower Eddington ratios by ~0.3 dex than other broad-line AGN, and have a preference for elliptical host galaxies, higher X-ray luminosities, and higher [OI] $\lambda$6302 to narrow H$\alpha$ flux ratios than other broad-line AGN. We find that DPEs are not segregated from other broad-line AGN in the $L_{\rm bol}$ vs $M_{\rm BH}$ relation or their X-ray to radio luminosity ratios, and do not show a preference for intermediate Seyfert types over Seyfert 1s. We do not find differences in a wide range of multi-wavelength properties when comparing DPEs to other broad-line AGN, including optical and mid-IR variability levels, and the rate of changing-look events. We discuss the two populations in the context of multi-component disk-wind models of the AGN broad line region and consider how unrecognized contributions of disk emission to the broad lines introduce biases in virial SMBH mass estimates.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved H$\alpha$ emission in B14-65666: compact starbursts, ionizing efficiency and gas kinematics in an advanced merger at the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MIRI/JWST medium resolution spectroscopy (MRS) and imaging (MIRIM) of B14-65666, a Lyman-break and interacting galaxy at redshift $z$=7.15. We detect the H$\alpha$ line emission in this system, revealing a spatially-resolved structure of the H$\alpha$ emitting gas, which consists of two distinct galaxies, E and W, at a projected distance of 0.4". Galaxy E is very compact in the rest-frame UV, while W galaxy is more extended, showing a clumpy structure reminiscent of a tidal tail. The total H$\alpha$ luminosity implies that the system is forming stars at a Star Formation Rate (SFR) of 76$\pm$8 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and 30$\pm$4 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for E and W, respectively. The ionizing photon production efficiency is within the range measured in galaxies at similar redshifts. The high values derived for the H$\alpha$ equivalent widths (EW) and the distinct locations of the E and W galaxies in the $\log(\zeta_\mathrm{ion}$) $-$ EW (H$\alpha$) plane, indicate that the system is dominated by a young (less than 10 Myr) stellar population. The overall spectral energy distribution suggests that in addition to a young stellar population, the two galaxies may have mature stellar population and very different dust attenuation. The derived SFR and stellar masses identify the two galaxies as going through a starburst phase. The kinematics of the ionized gas traced by the H$\alpha$ line show a velocity difference of 175 $\pm$ 28 km s$^{-1}$ between the two components of B14-65666. The in-depth study of systems like B14-65666 reveal how galaxy mergers in the early Universe drive intense star formation, shape the interstellar medium, and influence the buildup of stellar mass, just 700 $-$ 800 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Ly$\alpha$ Emission from [OIII] Emitters Near Reionization: The role of environment in galaxy Ly$\alpha$ detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission to probe reionization relies on establishing baseline expectations for its detectability in the absence of attenuation by neutral gas in the IGM. Towards this end, the growing numbers of $z \sim 5$--6 star-forming galaxies spectroscopically selected by JWST provide an ideal sample for determining how Ly$\alpha$ emission depends on galaxy properties and environment after reionization has largely completed. In this study, we use Keck LRIS to measure the Ly$\alpha$ emission of 46 JWST-selected [OIII]-emitting galaxies over $5.3 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.2$ in the foreground of the ultra-luminous quasar J0100+2802. Overall, we find that the fraction of galaxies detected in Ly$\alpha$ emission is consistent with previous works; however, the fraction also varies with environment. Most notably, we find an apparent deficit of Ly$\alpha$ in the largest group in our sample, at $z \simeq 6.19$, which falls within the redshift range of the quasar's highly ionized proximity zone. We speculate that the Ly$\alpha$ emission from this group may be partly scattered by a foreground neutral island. In contrast, we detect a high rate of Ly$\alpha$ emission in two groups at $z \simeq 5.73$ and $z \simeq 5.78$. These groups may be part of a structure that is extended along the line of sight, enhancing the transmission of Ly$\alpha$ emission. While our sample size is limited, our results suggest that environment may play a significant role in the detectability of galaxy Ly$\alpha$ emission even as late as $z \sim 6$.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Most Extreme Gamma-Ray Blazars Using Broadband Spectral Energy Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme high-synchrotron peaked blazars (EHSPs) are rare high-energy sources characterised by synchrotron peaks beyond 10$^{17}$ Hz in their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Their extreme properties challenge conventional blazar emission models and provide a unique opportunity to test the limits of particle acceleration and emission mechanisms in relativistic jets. However, the number of identified EHSPs is still small, limiting comprehensive studies of their population and characteristics. This study aims to identify new EHSP candidates and characterise their emission properties. A sample of 124 $\gamma$-ray blazars was analysed, selected for their high synchrotron peak frequencies and $\gamma$-ray emission properties, with a focus on sources showing low variability and good broadband data coverage. Their SEDs were constructed using archival multi-wavelength data from the SSDC SED Builder service, supplemented with recent Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, and Fermi-LAT observations. The SEDs were modelled with a one-zone synchrotron/synchrotron-self-Compton framework, classifying sources by synchrotron peak frequency. We identify 66 new EHSP candidates, significantly expanding the known population. A clear correlation between synchrotron peak frequency and the magnetic-to-kinetic energy density ratio is found, with the most extreme EHSPs nearing equipartition. Host galaxy emission is detected in many sources, but no significant differences are observed between elliptical and lenticular hosts. Our analysis suggests that nine high-synchrotron peaked/EHSPs could be observed by CTAO at $&gt;5\sigma$ (20 at $&gt;3\sigma$) in 20-hour exposures, indicating that while the overall detection rate remains modest, a subset of these sources is within reach of next-generation very-high-energy gamma-ray instruments.</description>

      <title>Planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn: Vortices as planetary nurseries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-mass, metal-enriched stars were likely present as early as cosmic dawn. In this work, we investigate whether these stars could have hosted planets in their protoplanetary disks. If so, these would have been the first planets to form in the Universe, emerging in systems with metallicities much lower than solar. In the core accretion model, planetesimals serve as the building blocks of planets, meaning that planetesimal formation is a prerequisite for planet formation. In a non-structured disk, planetesimal formation typically requires near-solar metallicities according to our current understanding. However, mechanisms that concentrate solid material can significantly lower this metallicity threshold. Here, we explore whether vortices can facilitate the formation of the first planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn. Vortices are prime sites for planetesimal formation due to their ability to efficiently trap and concentrate dust. We conduct simulations spanning a range of metallicities, and identify a metallicity threshold at Z &gt;=~ 0.04 Zsun for planetesimal formation. If these planetesimals remain inside the vortex long enough to accrete the remaining trapped solids, Mercury-mass planets can form. The formation of Mars-mass planets or larger requires a metallicity of Z &gt;=~ 0.08 Zsun. These results assume a low level of disk turbulence, with higher turbulence levels leading to higher metallicity thresholds.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the evolution of spectral energy distribution (SED) and underlying electron energy distribution (EED) by modeling the nearly simultaneous broadband spectra of selected bright 4FGL blazars, in the context of a combined cooling and stochastic acceleration scenario. We find that one-zone leptonic model with log-parabolic (LP) EED can successfully fit the GeV-TeV emission of blazars. The synchrotron frequency $\nu_s$ of blazars mainly evolves due to variation of electron peak energy $\gamma_{3p}$. The BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) show a negative trend in the $\nu_s- \nu_s L_s$ SED plane, known as blazar sequence, that does not seem to be an artifact of Doppler boosting, but driven by the equipartition constraints. A positive correlation is found between the derived magnetic field $B$ and electron density $n_e$, whereas $n_e$ and $\gamma_{3p}$ negatively relate, as expected in an equipartition scenario. The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) deviate significantly from such a scenario, indicating their jet parameters should be varying independently. The synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_s$ and its spectral curvature $b_s$ negatively correlate for all blazars, confirming the stochastic particle acceleration in blazar jets. However, blazars do not show the signature of hard-sphere acceleration, indicating that magnetic turbulence in the jets might be soft and physical conditions might be near to steady state, consistent with equipartition. Furthermore, for BL Lacs, the SED curvature $b_s$ and the EED curvature $r$ and nearly meet the theoretical relationship $r=5b_s$, whereas the FSRQs show large deviation due to poor constrain on $b_s$ due to presence of thermal component.</description>
