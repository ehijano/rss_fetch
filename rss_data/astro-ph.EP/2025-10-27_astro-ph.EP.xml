      <title>Irradiated Atmospheres IV: Effect of Mixing Heat Flux on Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical mixing disrupts the thermochemical equilibrium and introduces additional heat flux that alters exoplanetary atmospheric temperatures. We investigate how this mixing-induced heat flux affects atmospheric chemistry. Temperature increase in the lower atmosphere by the mixing-induced heat flux alters species abundances there and modifies those in the upper atmosphere through vertical transport. In the lower atmosphere, most species follow thermodynamic equilibrium with temperature changes. In the upper layers, species mixing ratios depend on the positions of quenching levels relative to the regions exhibiting significant mixing-induced temperature variations. When the quenching level resides within such region (e.g. CO, $\rm CH_4$, and $\rm H_2O$ with strong mixing), the mixing ratios in the upper atmosphere are modified due to changes in the quenched ratios affected by the temperature variation in the lower atmosphere. This alters the mixing ratio of other species (e.g. NO and $\rm CO_2$) through the chemical reaction network, whose quenching occurs in the region without much temperature change. The mixing ratios of $\rm CH_4$, $\rm H_2O$, and $\rm NH_3$ decrease in the lower atmosphere with increasing mixing heat flux, similarly reducing these ratios in the upper atmosphere. Conversely, the mixing ratios of CO, $\rm CO_2$, and NO rise in the lower atmosphere, with CO and $\rm CO_2$ also increasing in the upper levels, although NO decreases. Weaker host star irradiation lowers the overall temperature of the planet, allowing a smaller mixing to have a similar effect. We conclude that understanding the vertical mixing heat flux is essential for accurate atmospheric chemistry modeling and retrieval.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of Superrotation in Slowly-Rotating and Tidally-Locked Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superrotation is a common feature of quickly rotating gas giants, slowly rotating planetary bodies, and tidally-locked planets. In this paper we compare and contrast the mechanisms of superrotation in slow rotators and tidally-locked planets. We cover a wide range of planetary properties, varying in particular the thermal Rossby number Ro_T (controlled by planetary size, rotation rate, and instellation) and a radiative relaxation timescale T_rad (which parameterizes atmospheric optical thickness). We use a two-level model that contains the principal mechanisms for superrotation in both regimes yet remains analytically tractable. Linearizations of the model elucidate the behavior of superrotation-inducing eddies. In tidally-locked planets a Matsuno-Gill-like structure organizes the eddy effects but of itself is insufficient to produce superrotation; baroclinicity and low-level drag are additional essential ingredients. Nonlinear integrations further explore the superrotating regimes and exhibit significant time variability even in statistical equilibrium. Not all tidally-locked regimes superrotate: subrotation arises at high T_rad (optically thick atmospheres) and weak low-level drag. On axisymmetrically-forced slow rotators, superrotation is always linked to a previously identified Rossby-Kelvin instability. Perhaps surprisingly, the instability itself is also linked to the spinup of superrotation in some tidally-locked regimes. Finally, we explore the continuous transition in the mechanisms of superrotation from axisymmetrically-forced to tidally-locked planets by applying a progressively stronger asymmetric equatorial forcing. The Matsuno-Gill pattern quickly dominates over traveling planetary Rossby-Kelvin waves in forcing superrotation, although both mechanisms can coexist. These results provide a unified view of superrotation mechanisms across a wide range of planetary bodies.</description>

      <title>Comparing the data reduction pipelines of FRIPON, DFN, WMPL, and AMOS: Geminids Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods. We processed a dataset of 584 Geminid fireballs observed by FRIPON between 2016 and 2023. The single-station astrometric data is converted into the Global Fireball Exchange (GFE) standard format for uniform processing. We assess variations in trajectory, velocity, radiant, and orbital element calculations across the pipelines and compare them to previously published Geminid measurements.
  Results. The radiant and velocity solutions provided by the four data reduction pipelines are all within the range of previously published values. However, there are some nuances. Particularly, the radiants estimated by WMPL, DFN, and AMOS are nearly identical. Whereas FRIPON reports a systematic shift in right ascension (-0.3 degrees), caused by improper handling of the precession. Additionally, the FRIPON data reduction pipeline also tends to overestimate the initial velocity (+0.3 km s-1) due to the deceleration model used as the velocity solver. The FRIPON velocity method relies on having a well-constrained deceleration profile; however, for the Geminids, many are low-deceleration events, leading to an overestimation of the initial velocity. On the other end of the spectrum, the DFN tends to predict lower velocities, particularly for poorly observed events. However, this velocity shift vanishes for the DFN when we only consider Geminids with at least three observations or more. The primary difference identified in the analysis concerns the velocity uncertainties. Despite all four pipelines achieving similar residuals between their trajectories and observations, their velocity uncertainties vary systematically, with WMPL outputting the smallest values, followed by AMOS, FRIPON, and DFN.</description>

      <title>An H{\alpha} Transit of HD 189733b to Assess Stellar Activity Across the Transit Chord Close to JWST Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy allows us to detect molecules in planetary atmospheres, but is subject to contamination from inhomogeneities on the stellar surface. Quantifying the extent of this contamination is essential for accurate measurements of atmospheric composition, as stellar activity can manifest as false atmospheric signals in planetary transmission spectra. We present a study of hot Jupiter HD 189733b, which has over 50 hours of JWST observations scheduled or taken, to measure the activity level of the host star at the current epoch. We utilize high-resolution spectra of the H${\alpha}$ line from the MEGARA spectrograph on the 10-m GTC to examine the activity level of HD 189733 during a transit. We measure H${\alpha}$ becoming shallower mid-transit by an H${\alpha}$ index of ${\delta}$ = 0.00156 ${\pm}$ 0.00026, which suggests that HD 189733b crosses an active region as it transits. We posit this deviation is likely caused by a spot along the transit chord with an approximate radius of $R_{spot}$ = 3.47 ${\pm}$ 0.30R${\oplus}$ becoming occulted during transit. Including an approximation for unocculted spots, we estimate that this spot could result in transit depth variations of ${\sim}$17 ppm at the 4.3 micron CO2 feature. Since this is comparable to JWST NIRCam Grism mode's noise floor of ${\sim}$20 ppm, it could bias atmospheric studies by altering the inferred depths of the planet's features. Thus, we suggest ground-based high-resolution monitoring of activity indicator species concurrently taken with JWST data when feasible to disentangle stellar activity signals from planetary atmospheric signals during transit.</description>

      <title>pyROX: Rapid Opacity X-sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant advances have been made in exoplanet and brown dwarf observations. By using state-of-the-art models, astronomers can determine properties of their atmospheres, such as temperatures, the presence of clouds, or the chemical abundances of molecules and atoms. Accurate and up-to-date opacities are crucial to avoid inconclusive or biased results, but it can be challenging to compute opacity cross-sections from the line lists provided by various online databases.
  We introduce pyROX, an easy-to-use Python package to calculate molecular and atomic cross-sections. Since pyROX works on CPUs, it can compute a small line list on a regular workstation, but it is also easily parallelised on a cluster for larger line lists. In addition to line opacities, pyROX also supports calculations of collision-induced absorption. Tutorials are provided in the online documentation which explain the configuration parameters and different functionalities of pyROX.</description>

      <title>Parametrisation of the wave-zonal flow interactions taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration. The necessity of going beyond the traditional approximation in the sub-inertial regime and in weakly stratified regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the Earth's atmosphere and oceans to stellar radiation zones, inertia-gravity waves, which are called gravito-inertial waves (hereafter GIWs) in Astrophysics, are transporting momentum and mixing matter when they are damped through heat and viscous diffusions and when they break. Their short-time scale dynamics is governed by the buoyancy force and the Coriolis acceleration. Because of the transport they trigger, they modify the long-term evolution of the large-scale planetary atmospheric (oceanic) circulation and of the structure and rotation of stars. In many state-of-the-art models, the so-called Traditional Approximation of Rotation (hereafter denoted TAR), where the local projection of the rotation vector along the horizontal direction is neglected, is assumed. We aim to identify the applicability regime of this approximation and to propose a non-traditional parametrisation of wave - zonal flow interactions, in which the full Coriolis acceleration is taken into account. We build a prototype local non-traditional Cartesian model in which we take into account the full Coriolis acceleration, buoyancy, and heat and viscous diffusions. On the one hand, the TAR is strongly underestimating GIWs damping in the sub-inertial regime. In this regime a non-traditional modelling must be adopted to predict the correct altitude where momentum is deposited, which is closer to the excitation region of waves than the one predicted using the TAR. On the other hand, non-traditional modellings of GIWs convective and shear-induced breakings are proposed. Taking into account the full Coriolis acceleration leads to a stronger inhibition of the efficiency of the convective and shear-induced overturnings and to a weaker transport than those predicted when assuming the TAR. Finally, a fully non-traditional parametrisation of GIWs - mean zonal flows interaction is derived.</description>

      <title>Space waste: An update of the anthropogenic matter injection into Earth atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large satellite constellations are one of the main reasons for an increasing amount of mass being brought into low Earth orbit in recent years. After end of life, the satellites, as well as rocket stages, reenter Earth's atmosphere. This space waste burns up and thus injects a substantial amount of its matter into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. A first comprehensive analysis of the anthropogenic injection and a comparison to the natural injection by meteoroids was presented by Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021). They found significant and even the dominant injection of several metal elements regularly used in spacecraft compared to the natural injection. The first observations of space waste remnants in stratospheric aerosol particles (Murphy et al., 2023) confirmed several of these estimates, but also revealed differences and new insights. The current study presents an update to the space waste injection estimates of Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021), assessing the years from 2015 to 2025 but also considering future mass influx scenarios. 43 elements are considered and thus a much more detailed comparison to the meteoric injection is possible. Comparison of estimated elemental fluxes to stratospheric aerosol data shows excellent agreement. From 2020 onward, a strong rise in space waste mass influx to the atmosphere can be seen. Future scenarios discussed by Schulz &amp; Glassmeier (2021) may already be reached by the end of 2025. In 2024, 24 elements were dominating the meteoric injection compared to 18 in 2015. Several of them are transition metals, which are known for their catalytic activity. This indicates a substantial risk of long-term adverse effects on the atmosphere such as ozone depletion, radiative effects and changes in cloud formation, if no action is taken. Research is urgently needed into the atmospheric accumulation, chemistry, and general atmospheric effects of specific elements.</description>

      <title>AGN STORM 2. XI. Spectroscopic reverberation mapping of the hot dust in Mrk 817</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping 2 (STORM 2) campaign targeted Mrk 817 with intensive multi-wavelength monitoring and found its soft X-ray emission to be strongly absorbed. We present results from 157 near-IR spectra with an average cadence of a few days. Whereas the hot dust reverberation signal as tracked by the continuum flux does not have a clear response, we recover a dust reverberation radius of $\sim 90$ light-days from the blackbody dust temperature light-curve. This radius is consistent with previous photometric reverberation mapping results when Mrk 817 was in an unobscured state. The heating/cooling process we observe indicates that the inner limit of the dusty torus is set by a process other than sublimation, rendering it a luminosity-invariant `dusty wall' of a carbonaceous composition. Assuming thermal equilibrium for dust optically thick to the incident radiation, we derive a luminosity of $\sim 6 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ for the source heating it. This luminosity is similar to that of the obscured spectral energy distribution, assuming a disk with an Eddington accretion rate of $\dot{m} \sim 0.2$. Alternatively, the dust is illuminated by an unobscured lower luminosity disk with $\dot{m} \sim 0.1$, which permits the UV/optical continuum lags in the high-obscuration state to be dominated by diffuse emission from the broad-line region. Finally, we find hot dust extended on scales $&gt; 140-350$ pc, associated with the rotating disk of ionised gas we observe in spatially-resolved [SIII] $\lambda 9531$ images. Its likely origin is in the compact bulge of the barred spiral host galaxy, where it is heated by a nuclear starburst.</description>

      <title>Near the Runaway: The Climate and Habitability of Teegarden's Star b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teegarden's Star b, a nearby terrestrial world receiving an Earth-like instellation, is a prime candidate for next-generation observatories targeting temperate exoplanets in their habitable zones. We employ a suite of three-dimensional global climate model (GCM) simulations to (1) map the inner boundary of the habitable zone of Teegarden's Star b and (2) characterize its surface climate under the assumption of an Earth-analog atmosphere. Our simulations show that, with its most recently estimated instellation of 1481 Wm^-2, Teegarden's Star b remains below the runaway greenhouse threshold for both low (as=0.07, ocean-dominated) and moderate (as=0.30, land-dominated) surface albedos. However, a different estimate of 1565 Wm^-2 places it beyond the runaway threshold. The result that Teegarden's Star b is habitable under the most recent instellation measurement reinforces its status as one of the most compelling targets for future habitability and biosignature searches. Given the planet's proximity to the runaway threshold, it would benefit from a comparative study done with other models using different parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Galactic Exoplanet Survey. IV. Lens Mass and Distance Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of the Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS), the Nancy Grace Roman Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will use microlensing to discover cold outer planets and free-floating planets unbound to stars. NASA has established several science requirements for the GBTDS to ensure RGES success. A key advantage of RGES is Roman's high angular resolution, which will allow detection of flux from many host stars. One requirement specifies that Roman must measure the masses and distances of 40% of detected planet hosts with 20% precision or better. To test this, we simulated microlensing events toward the GBTDS fields and used Fisher matrix analysis to estimate light curve parameter uncertainties. Combining these with Roman imaging observables (lens flux, relative lens-source proper motion), we estimated the achievable precision of lens mass and distance measurements. Using pyLIMASS, a publicly available code for estimating lens properties, we applied this analysis to 3,000 simulated events. Assuming the Cassan et al. (2012) exoplanet mass function, we find that &gt;40% of host stars meet the required 20% precision threshold, confirming that the GBTDS can satisfy the mission requirement. We validated our approach by comparing our inferred lens masses and distances to empirical measurements from detailed image-constrained light curve modeling of historical microlensing events with Hubble and Keck follow-up imaging. Our results agree within roughly 1 sigma, demonstrating that both approaches yield consistent and reliable mass and distance estimates, and confirming the robustness of our simulations for Roman-era microlensing science.</description>
