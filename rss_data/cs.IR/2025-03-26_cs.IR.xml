      <title>BeLightRec: A lightweight recommender system enhanced with BERT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trend of data mining using deep learning models on graph neural networks has proven effective in identifying object features through signal encoders and decoders, particularly in recommendation systems utilizing collaborative filtering methods. Collaborative filtering exploits similarities between users and items from historical data. However, it overlooks distinctive information, such as item names and descriptions. The semantic data of items should be further mined using models in the natural language processing field. Thus, items can be compared using text classification, similarity assessments, or identifying analogous sentence pairs. This research proposes combining two sources of item similarity signals: one from collaborative filtering and one from the semantic similarity measure between item names and descriptions. These signals are integrated into a graph convolutional neural network to optimize model weights, thereby providing accurate recommendations. Experiments are also designed to evaluate the contribution of each signal group to the recommendation results.</description>

      <title>Learnable Sequence Augmenter for Triplet Contrastive Learning in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing contrastive learning-based sequential recommendation (SR) methods rely on random operations (e.g., crop, reorder, and substitute) to generate augmented sequences. These methods often struggle to create positive sample pairs that closely resemble the representations of the raw sequences, potentially disrupting item correlations by deleting key items or introducing noisy iterac, which misguides the contrastive learning process.
  To address this limitation, we propose Learnable sequence Augmentor for triplet Contrastive Learning in sequential Recommendation (LACLRec). Specifically, the self-supervised learning-based augmenter can automatically delete noisy items from sequences and insert new items that better capture item transition patterns, generating a higher-quality augmented sequence. Subsequently, we randomly generate another augmented sequence and design a ranking-based triplet contrastive loss to differentiate the similarities between the raw sequence, the augmented sequence from augmenter, and the randomly augmented sequence, providing more fine-grained contrastive signals. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that both the sequence augmenter and the triplet contrast contribute to improving recommendation accuracy. LACLRec significantly outperforms the baseline model CL4SRec, and demonstrates superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art sequential recommendation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dewey Long Context Embedding Model: A Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This technical report presents the training methodology and evaluation results of the open-source dewey_en_beta embedding model. The increasing demand for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems and the expanding context window capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have created critical challenges for conventional embedding models. Current approaches often struggle to maintain semantic coherence when processing documents exceeding typical sequence length limitations, significantly impacting retrieval performance in knowledge-intensive applications. This paper presents dewey_en_beta, a novel text embedding model that achieves excellent performance on MTEB (Eng, v2) and LongEmbed benchmark while supporting 128K token sequences. Our technical contribution centers on chunk alignment training, an innovative methodology that enables the simultaneous generation of localized chunk embeddings and global document-level representations through distillation. Information regarding the model release can be found at https://huggingface.co/infgrad/dewey_en_beta.</description>

      <title>RALLRec+: Retrieval Augmented Large Language Model Recommendation with Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been integrated into recommender systems to enhance user behavior comprehension. The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance. However, existing RAG methods have two shortcomings. \textit{(i)} In the \textit{retrieval} stage, they rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, thus constraining system effectiveness. \textit{(ii)} In the \textit{generation} stage, they lack explicit chain-of-thought reasoning, further limiting their potential.
  In this paper, we propose Representation learning and \textbf{R}easoning empowered retrieval-\textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{L}arge \textbf{L}anguage model \textbf{Rec}ommendation (RALLRec+). Specifically, for the retrieval stage, we prompt LLMs to generate detailed item descriptions and perform joint representation learning, combining textual and collaborative signals extracted from the LLM and recommendation models, respectively. To account for the time-varying nature of user interests, we propose a simple yet effective reranking method to capture preference dynamics. For the generation phase, we first evaluate reasoning LLMs on recommendation tasks, uncovering valuable insights. Then we introduce knowledge-injected prompting and consistency-based merging approach to integrate reasoning LLMs with general-purpose LLMs, enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments on three real world datasets validate our method's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>ProtoBERT-LoRA: Parameter-Efficient Prototypical Finetuning for Immunotherapy Study Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) studies in genomic repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) is vital for cancer research yet remains challenging due to semantic ambiguity, extreme class imbalance, and limited labeled data in low-resource settings. We present ProtoBERT-LoRA, a hybrid framework that combines PubMedBERT with prototypical networks and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient fine-tuning. The model enforces class-separable embeddings via episodic prototype training while preserving biomedical domain knowledge. Our dataset was divided as: Training (20 positive, 20 negative), Prototype Set (10 positive, 10 negative), Validation (20 positive, 200 negative), and Test (71 positive, 765 negative). Evaluated on test dataset, ProtoBERT-LoRA achieved F1-score of 0.624 (precision: 0.481, recall: 0.887), outperforming the rule-based system, machine learning baselines and finetuned PubMedBERT. Application to 44,287 unlabeled studies reduced manual review efforts by 82%. Ablation studies confirmed that combining prototypes with LoRA improved performance by 29% over stand-alone LoRA.</description>

      <title>Open Deep Search: Democratizing Search with Open-source Reasoning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Open Deep Search (ODS) to close the increasing gap between the proprietary search AI solutions, such as Perplexity's Sonar Reasoning Pro and OpenAI's GPT-4o Search Preview, and their open-source counterparts. The main innovation introduced in ODS is to augment the reasoning capabilities of the latest open-source LLMs with reasoning agents that can judiciously use web search tools to answer queries. Concretely, ODS consists of two components that work with a base LLM chosen by the user: Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent. Open Reasoning Agent interprets the given task and completes it by orchestrating a sequence of actions that includes calling tools, one of which is the Open Search Tool. Open Search Tool is a novel web search tool that outperforms proprietary counterparts. Together with powerful open-source reasoning LLMs, such as DeepSeek-R1, ODS nearly matches and sometimes surpasses the existing state-of-the-art baselines on two benchmarks: SimpleQA and FRAMES. For example, on the FRAMES evaluation benchmark, ODS improves the best existing baseline of the recently released GPT-4o Search Preview by 9.7% in accuracy. ODS is a general framework for seamlessly augmenting any LLMs -- for example, DeepSeek-R1 that achieves 82.4% on SimpleQA and 30.1% on FRAMES -- with search and reasoning capabilities to achieve state-of-the-art performance: 88.3% on SimpleQA and 75.3% on FRAMES.</description>

      <title>MMMORRF: Multimodal Multilingual Modularized Reciprocal Rank Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Videos inherently contain multiple modalities, including visual events, text overlays, sounds, and speech, all of which are important for retrieval. However, state-of-the-art multimodal language models like VAST and LanguageBind are built on vision-language models (VLMs), and thus overly prioritize visual signals. Retrieval benchmarks further reinforce this bias by focusing on visual queries and neglecting other modalities. We create a search system MMMORRF that extracts text and features from both visual and audio modalities and integrates them with a novel modality-aware weighted reciprocal rank fusion. MMMORRF is both effective and efficient, demonstrating practicality in searching videos based on users' information needs instead of visual descriptive queries. We evaluate MMMORRF on MultiVENT 2.0 and TVR, two multimodal benchmarks designed for more targeted information needs, and find that it improves nDCG@20 by 81% over leading multimodal encoders and 37% over single-modality retrieval, demonstrating the value of integrating diverse modalities.</description>

      <title>Don't Use LLMs to Make Relevance Judgments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making the relevance judgments for a TREC-style test collection can be complex and expensive. A typical TREC track usually involves a team of six contractors working for 2-4 weeks. Those contractors need to be trained and monitored. Software has to be written to support recording relevance judgments correctly and efficiently. The recent advent of large language models that produce astoundingly human-like flowing text output in response to a natural language prompt has inspired IR researchers to wonder how those models might be used in the relevance judgment collection process. At the ACM SIGIR 2024 conference, a workshop ``LLM4Eval'' provided a venue for this work, and featured a data challenge activity where participants reproduced TREC deep learning track judgments, as was done by Thomas et al (arXiv:2408.08896, arXiv:2309.10621). I was asked to give a keynote at the workshop, and this paper presents that keynote in article form. The bottom-line-up-front message is, don't use LLMs to create relevance judgments for TREC-style evaluations.</description>

      <title>Retro-li: Small-Scale Retrieval Augmented Generation Supporting Noisy Similarity Searches and Domain Shift Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The retrieval augmented generation (RAG) system such as Retro has been shown to improve language modeling capabilities and reduce toxicity and hallucinations by retrieving from a database of non-parametric memory containing trillions of entries. We introduce Retro-li that shows retrieval can also help using a small-scale database, but it demands more accurate and better neighbors when searching in a smaller hence sparser non-parametric memory. This can be met by using a proper semantic similarity search. We further propose adding a regularization to the non-parametric memory for the first time: it significantly reduces perplexity when the neighbor search operations are noisy during inference, and it improves generalization when a domain shift occurs. We also show that Retro-li's non-parametric memory can potentially be implemented on analog in-memory computing hardware, exhibiting O(1) search time while causing noise in retrieving neighbors, with minimal (&lt;1%) performance loss. Our code is available at: https://github.com/IBM/Retrieval-Enhanced-Transformer-Little.</description>

      <title>Long-Sequence Recommendation Models Need Decoupled Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lifelong user behavior sequences are crucial for capturing user interests and predicting user responses in modern recommendation systems. A two-stage paradigm is typically adopted to handle these long sequences: a subset of relevant behaviors is first searched from the original long sequences via an attention mechanism in the first stage and then aggregated with the target item to construct a discriminative representation for prediction in the second stage. In this work, we identify and characterize, for the first time, a neglected deficiency in existing long-sequence recommendation models: a single set of embeddings struggles with learning both attention and representation, leading to interference between these two processes. Initial attempts to address this issue with some common methods (e.g., linear projections -- a technique borrowed from language processing) proved ineffective, shedding light on the unique challenges of recommendation models. To overcome this, we propose the Decoupled Attention and Representation Embeddings (DARE) model, where two distinct embedding tables are initialized and learned separately to fully decouple attention and representation. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that DARE provides more accurate searches of correlated behaviors and outperforms baselines with AUC gains up to 0.9% on public datasets and notable improvements on Tencent's advertising platform. Furthermore, decoupling embedding spaces allows us to reduce the attention embedding dimension and accelerate the search procedure by 50% without significant performance impact, enabling more efficient, high-performance online serving. Code in PyTorch for experiments, including model analysis, is available at https://github.com/thuml/DARE.</description>

      <title>PRECTR: A Synergistic Framework for Integrating Personalized Search Relevance Matching and CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two primary tasks in the search recommendation system are search relevance matching and click-through rate (CTR) prediction -- the former focuses on seeking relevant items for user queries whereas the latter forecasts which item may better match user interest. Prior research typically develops two models to predict the CTR and search relevance separately, then ranking candidate items based on the fusion of the two outputs. However, such a divide-and-conquer paradigm creates the inconsistency between different models. Meanwhile, the search relevance model mainly concentrates on the degree of objective text matching while neglecting personalized differences among different users, leading to restricted model performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a unified Personalized Search RElevance Matching and CTR Prediction Fusion Model(PRECTR). Specifically, based on the conditional probability fusion mechanism, PRECTR integrates the CTR prediction and search relevance matching into one framework to enhance the interaction and consistency of the two modules. However, directly optimizing CTR binary classification loss may bring challenges to the fusion model's convergence and indefinitely promote the exposure of items with high CTR, regardless of their search relevance. Hence, we further introduce two-stage training and semantic consistency regularization to accelerate the model's convergence and restrain the recommendation of irrelevant items. Finally, acknowledging that different users may have varied relevance preferences, we assessed current users' relevance preferences by analyzing past users' preferences for similar queries and tailored incentives for different candidate items accordingly. Extensive experimental results on our production dataset and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed PRECTR method.</description>

      <title>BRIGHT: A Realistic and Challenging Benchmark for Reasoning-Intensive Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12883v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing retrieval benchmarks primarily consist of information-seeking queries (e.g., aggregated questions from search engines) where keyword or semantic-based retrieval is usually sufficient. However, many complex real-world queries require in-depth reasoning to identify relevant documents that go beyond surface form matching. For example, finding documentation for a coding question requires understanding the logic and syntax of the functions involved. To better benchmark retrieval on such challenging queries, we introduce BRIGHT, the first text retrieval benchmark that requires intensive reasoning to retrieve relevant documents. Our dataset consists of 1,384 real-world queries spanning diverse domains, such as economics, psychology, mathematics, and coding. These queries are drawn from naturally occurring and carefully curated human data. Extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art retrieval models perform poorly on BRIGHT. The leading model on the MTEB leaderboard (Muennighoff et al., 2023) SFR-Embedding-Mistral (Meng et al., 2024), which achieves a score of 59.0 nDCG@10,1 produces a score of nDCG@10 of 18.3 on BRIGHT. We show that incorporating explicit reasoning about the query improves retrieval performance by up to 12.2 points. Moreover, incorporating retrieved documents from the top-performing retriever boosts question-answering performance. We believe that BRIGHT paves the way for future research on retrieval systems in more realistic and challenging settings.</description>
