      <title>Eigenvector Geometry as a Universal Amplifier of Heavy-Tailed Fluctuations in Random Multiplicative Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy-tailed fluctuations and power-law distributions pervade physics, biology, and the social sciences, with numerous mechanisms proposed for their emergence. Kesten processes, which are multiplicative stochastic recursions with additive noise or reinjection, provide a canonical explanation, where power-law tails arise from transient supercritical excursions as eigenvalues intermittently cross the stability boundary. Here we uncover a distinct and more general mechanism in multidimensional systems: non-normal eigenvector amplification. In random non-normal matrices, the non-orthogonality of eigenvectors, quantified by the condition number $\kappa$, induces transient growth that increases the effective Lyapunov exponent $\gamma \simeq \gamma_0 + \langle \ln \kappa \rangle$ and lowers the tail exponent $\alpha \simeq -2\gamma / \sigma_{\kappa}^2$, where $\sigma_{\kappa}^2$ is the variance of $\ln \kappa$. As the system dimension $N$ grows, $\kappa$ typically increases proportionally, making non-normal amplification the dominant source of scale-free behavior. We illustrate this mechanism in two representative systems: (i) polymer stretching in turbulent flows, where intermittent extensions arise from eigenvector amplification of velocity gradients and (ii) financial return distributions, where extending one-dimensional GARCH/Kesten processes to a multidimensional setting yields a collective origin for heavy-tailed market fluctuations and explains their near-universal exponents across assets.</description>

      <title>Bridging Prediction and Attribution: Identifying Forward and Backward Causal Influence Ranges Using Assimilative Causal Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal inference identifies cause-and-effect relationships between variables. While traditional approaches rely on data to reveal causal links, a recently developed method, assimilative causal inference (ACI), integrates observations with dynamical models. It utilizes Bayesian data assimilation to trace causes back from observed effects by quantifying the reduction in uncertainty. ACI advances the detection of instantaneous causal relationships and the intermittent reversal of causal roles over time. Beyond identifying causal connections, an equally important challenge is determining the associated causal influence range (CIR), indicating when causal influences emerged and for how long they persist. In this paper, ACI is employed to develop mathematically rigorous formulations of both forward and backward CIRs at each time. The forward CIR quantifies the temporal impact of a cause, while the backward CIR traces the onset of triggers for an observed effect, thus characterizing causal predictability and attribution of outcomes at each transient phase, respectively. Objective and robust metrics for both CIRs are introduced, eliminating the need for empirical thresholds. Computationally efficient approximation algorithms to compute CIRs are developed, which facilitate the use of closed-form expressions for a broad class of nonlinear dynamical systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate how this forward and backward CIR framework provides new possibilities for probing complex dynamical systems. It advances the study of bifurcation-driven and noise-induced tipping points in Earth systems, investigates the impact from resolving the interfering variables when determining the influence ranges, and elucidates atmospheric blocking mechanisms in the equatorial region. These results have direct implications for science, policy, and decision-making.</description>

      <title>Analytic Marginalization over Binary Variables in Physics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many data analyses, each measurement may come with a simple yes/no correction; for example, belonging to one of two populations or being contaminated or not. Ignoring such binary effects may bias the results, while accounting for them explicitly quickly becomes infeasible as each of the $N$ data points introduces an additional parameter, resulting in an exponentially growing number of possible configurations ($2^N$). We show that, under generic conditions, an exact treatment of these binary corrections leads to a mathematical form identical to the well-known Ising model from statistical physics. This connection opens up a powerful set of tools developed for the Ising model, enabling fast and accurate likelihood calculations. We present efficient approximation schemes with minimal computational cost and demonstrate their effectiveness in applications, including Type Ia supernova calibration, where we show that the uncertainty in host-galaxy mass classification has negligible impact on the inferred value of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Aeroelastic Reduced-Order Model Differential Equations in Transonic Buffeting Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of the transonic shock buffet phenomenon remains a formidable challenge due to its inherent nonlinear and unsteady characteristics. These difficulties are further compounded in three-dimensional configurations and when aeroelastic coupling is considered. Consequently, computational studies of aeroelastic shock buffet interactions have largely been confined to two-dimensional systems. This limitation underscores the need for reduced-order models (ROMs) capable of efficiently and accurately capturing the aeroelastic response of structures subjected to shock buffet oscillations. This paper presents a novel nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic ROM that integrates nonlinear oscillator dynamics with Volterra theory to model aeroelastic shock buffet phenomena. The coefficients and terms of the resulting Integro-Differential Equation ROM (IDE-ROM) are identified using the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. Application of the IDE-ROM to an OAT15A airfoil demonstrates that the compact and computationally efficient formulation can reproduce key nonlinear behaviors, including aeroelastic lock-in, with a high degree of accuracy. The limitations and potential extensions of the proposed approach are also critically examined.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Growth and Vari-linear Preferential Attachment in Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random networks are convenient foundational platforms widely employed in network experiments. Generating networks that more accurately reflect real-world patterns is a significant topic within complex network research. This work propose a new network formation model: the vari-linear network, which includes two core mechanisms: exponential probabilistic growth and vari-linear preferential attachment. It overcomes the limitation of traditional growth mechanism in characterising low-degree distributions. And confirms that controlling the extent of non-linear in preferential attachment is key to achieving a better fit to the real network's degree distribution pattern. The results show that the vari-linear network model maintains high fitting accuracy across multiple real-world networks of varying types and scales. And exhibits several-fold performance advantages over traditional methods. Meanwhile, it provides a unified theoretical explanation for classic topological characteristics such as small-world networks and scale-free networks. It not only provides a more quality foundational network framework for network research, but also serve as the brand new paradigm for bridging the conceptual divide between various classical network models.</description>

      <title>Larger cities, more commuters, more crime? The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their roles within wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this interconnectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. In this work, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population-crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher levels of burglary, drug possession, robbery, shoplifting, and theft. For example, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population size constant. We demonstrate that models incorporating both population size and commuter inflows explain variation in these offenses better than population-only models. Our findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population-crime relationship.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the potential of PyStoch: detecting continuous gravitational waves from interesting supernova remnant targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting continuous gravitational waves (CWs) is challenging due to their weak amplitude and high computational demands, especially with poorly constrained source parameters. Stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) searches using cross-correlation techniques can identify unresolved astrophysical sources, including CWs, at lower computational cost, albeit with reduced sensitivity. This motivates a hybrid approach where SGWB algorithms act as a first-pass filter to identify CW candidates for follow-up with dedicated CW pipelines.
  We evaluated the discovery potential of the SGWB analysis tool PyStoch for detecting CWs, using simulated signals from spinning down NSs. We then applied the method to data from the third LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run (O3), covering the (20-1726) Hz frequency band, and targeting four supernova remnants: Vela Jr., G347.3-0.5, Cassiopeia A, and the NS associated with the 1987A supernova remnant. If necessary, significant candidates are followed up using the 5-vector Resampling and Band-Sampled Data Frequency-Hough techniques. However, since no interesting candidates were identified in the real O3 analysis, we set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the CW strain amplitude $h_0$. The most stringent limit was obtained for Cassiopeia A, and is $h_0 = 1.13 \times 10^{-25}$ at $201.57$ Hz with a frequency resolution of $1/32$ Hz. As for the other targets, the best upper limits have been set with the same frequency resolution, and correspond to $h_0 = 1.20 \times 10^{-25} $ at $202.16$ Hz for G347.3-0.5, $1.20 \times 10^{-25}$ at $217.81$ Hz for Vela Jr., and $1.47 \times 10^{-25}$ at $186.41$ Hz for the NS in the 1987A supernova remnant.</description>
