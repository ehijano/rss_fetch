      <title>UFO, universe, reptilians and creatures communities on Brazilian Telegram: when the sky is not the limit and conspiracy theories seek answers beyond humanity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interest in extraterrestrial phenomena and conspiracy theories involving UFOs and reptilians has been growing on Brazilian Telegram, especially in times of global uncertainty, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, this study aims to address the research question: how are Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on UFO, universe, reptilians and creatures topics characterized and articulated on Telegram? It is worth noting that this study is part of a series of seven studies whose main objective is to understand and characterize Brazilian conspiracy theory communities on Telegram. This series of seven studies is openly and originally available on arXiv at Cornell University, applying a mirrored method across the seven studies, changing only the thematic object of analysis and providing investigation replicability, including with proprietary and authored codes, adding to the culture of free and open-source software. Regarding the main findings of this study, the following were observed: UFO communities act as gateways for theories about reptilians, connecting narratives of global control with extraterrestrial beings; Discussions about UFOs and the universe grew significantly during the Pandemic, reflecting a renewed interest in extraterrestrial phenomena; Reptilians remain a significant subculture within conspiracy theories, with a notable growth during the Pandemic; The thematic overlap between UFOs, reptilians and esotericism reveals a cohesive ecosystem of disinformation, making factual correction a challenge; UFO communities function as amplifiers of other conspiracy theories, connecting different themes and strengthening the disinformation network.</description>

      <title>A+AI: Threats to Society, Remedies, and Governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document focuses on the threats, especially near-term threats, that Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings to society. Most of the threats discussed here can result from any algorithmic process, not just AI; in addition, defining AI is notoriously difficult. For both reasons, it is important to think of "A+AI": Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence.
  In addition to the threats, this paper discusses countermeasures to them, and it includes a table showing which countermeasures are likely to mitigate which threats. Thoughtful governance could manage the risks without seriously impeding progress; in fact, chances are it would accelerate progress by reducing the social chaos that would otherwise be likely. The paper lists specific actions government should take as soon as possible, namely:
  * Require all social media platforms accessible in the U.S. to offer users verification that their accounts are owned by citizens, and to display every account's verification status
  * Establish regulations to require that all products created or significantly modified with A+AI be clearly labeled as such; to restrict use of generative AI to create likenesses of persons; and to require creators of generative AI software to disclose materials used to train their software and to compensate the creators of any copyrighted material used
  * Fund a crash project of research on mitigating the threats
  * Fund educational campaigns to raise awareness of the threats</description>

      <title>ChatGPT vs Social Surveys: Probing the Objective and Subjective Human Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extent to which Large Language Models (LLMs) can simulate the data-generating process for social surveys remains unclear. Current research has not thoroughly assessed potential biases in the sociodemographic population represented within the language model's framework. Additionally, the subjective worlds of LLMs often show inconsistencies in how closely their responses match those of groups of human respondents. In this paper, we used ChatGPT-3.5 to simulate the sampling process and generated six socioeconomic characteristics from the 2020 US population. We also analyzed responses to questions about income inequality and gender roles to explore GPT's subjective attitudes. By using repeated random sampling, we created a sampling distribution to identify the parameters of the GPT-generated population and compared these with Census data. Our findings show some alignment in gender and age means with the actual 2020 US population, but we also found mismatches in the distributions of racial and educational groups. Furthermore, there were significant differences between the distribution of GPT's responses and human self-reported attitudes. While the overall point estimates of GPT's income attitudinal responses seem to align with the mean of the population occasionally, their response distributions follow a normal distribution that diverges from human responses. In terms of gender relations, GPT's answers tend to cluster in the most frequently answered category, demonstrating a deterministic pattern. We conclude by emphasizing the distinct design philosophies of LLMs and social surveys: LLMs aim to predict the most suitable answers, while social surveys seek to reveal the heterogeneity among social groups.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Effects of Digital Privacy Regulations on User Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In today's digital society, issues related to digital privacy have become increasingly important. Issues such as data breaches result in misuse of data, financial loss, and cyberbullying, which leads to less user trust in digital services. This research investigates the impact of digital privacy laws on user trust by comparing the regulations in the Netherlands, Ghana, and Malaysia. The study employs a comparative case study method, involving interviews with digital privacy law experts, IT educators, and consumers from each country. The main findings reveal that while the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the Netherlands is strict, its practical impact is limited by enforcement challenges. In Ghana, the Data Protection Act is underutilized due to low public awareness and insufficient enforcement, leading to reliance on personal protective measures. In Malaysia, trust in digital services is largely dependent on the security practices of individual platforms rather than the Personal Data Protection Act. The study highlights the importance of public awareness, effective enforcement, and cultural considerations in shaping the effectiveness of digital privacy laws. Based on these insights, a recommendation framework is proposed to enhance digital privacy practices, also aiming to provide valuable guidance for policymakers, businesses, and citizens in navigating the challenges of digitalization.</description>

      <title>Governing dual-use technologies: Case studies of international security agreements and lessons for AI governance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: International AI governance agreements and institutions may play an important role in reducing global security risks from advanced AI. To inform the design of such agreements and institutions, we conducted case studies of historical and contemporary international security agreements. We focused specifically on those arrangements around dual-use technologies, examining agreements in nuclear security, chemical weapons, biosecurity, and export controls. For each agreement, we examined four key areas: (a) purpose, (b) core powers, (c) governance structure, and (d) instances of non-compliance. From these case studies, we extracted lessons for the design of international AI agreements and governance institutions. We discuss the importance of robust verification methods, strategies for balancing power between nations, mechanisms for adapting to rapid technological change, approaches to managing trade-offs between transparency and security, incentives for participation, and effective enforcement mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Global Public Sentiment on Decentralized Finance: A Spatiotemporal Analysis of Geo-tagged Tweets from 150 Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies, and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have transformed financial and decentralized systems. However, existing research often neglects the spatiotemporal variations in public sentiment toward these technologies, limiting macro-level insights into their global impact. This study leverages Twitter data to explore public attention and sentiment across 150 countries, analyzing over 150 million geotagged tweets from 2012 to 2022. Sentiment scores were derived using a BERT-based multilingual sentiment model trained on 7.4 billion tweets. The analysis integrates global cryptocurrency regulations and economic indicators from the World Development Indicators database. Results reveal significant global sentiment variations influenced by economic factors, with more developed nations engaging more in discussions, while less developed countries show higher sentiment levels. Geographically weighted regression indicates that GDP-tweet engagement correlation intensifies following Bitcoin price surges. Topic modeling shows that countries within similar economic clusters share discussion trends, while different clusters focus on distinct topics. This study highlights global disparities in sentiment toward decentralized finance, shaped by economic and regional factors, with implications for poverty alleviation, cryptocurrency crime, and sustainable development. The dataset and code are publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Demographic parity in regression and classification within the unawareness framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the theoretical foundations of fair regression under the constraint of demographic parity within the unawareness framework, where disparate treatment is prohibited, extending existing results where such treatment is permitted. Specifically, we aim to characterize the optimal fair regression function when minimizing the quadratic loss. Our results reveal that this function is given by the solution to a barycenter problem with optimal transport costs. Additionally, we study the connection between optimal fair cost-sensitive classification, and optimal fair regression. We demonstrate that nestedness of the decision sets of the classifiers is both necessary and sufficient to establish a form of equivalence between classification and regression. Under this nestedness assumption, the optimal classifiers can be derived by applying thresholds to the optimal fair regression function; conversely, the optimal fair regression function is characterized by the family of cost-sensitive classifiers.</description>

      <title>More is More: Addition Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the presence of additive bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), drawing a parallel to the cognitive bias observed in humans where individuals tend to favor additive over subtractive changes. Using a series of controlled experiments, we tested various LLMs, including GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral, Math$\Sigma$tral, and Llama 3.1, on tasks designed to measure their propensity for additive versus subtractive modifications. Our findings demonstrate a significant preference for additive changes across all tested models. For example, in a palindrome creation task, Llama 3.1 favored adding letters 97.85% of the time over removing them. Similarly, in a Lego tower balancing task, GPT-3.5 Turbo chose to add a brick 76.38% of the time rather than remove one. In a text summarization task, Mistral 7B produced longer summaries in 59.40% to 75.10% of cases when asked to improve its own or others' writing. These results indicate that, similar to humans, LLMs exhibit a marked additive bias, which might have implications when LLMs are used on a large scale. Addittive bias might increase resource use and environmental impact, leading to higher economic costs due to overconsumption and waste. This bias should be considered in the development and application of LLMs to ensure balanced and efficient problem-solving approaches.</description>

      <title>J\"ager: Automated Telephone Call Traceback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsolicited telephone calls that facilitate fraud or unlawful telemarketing continue to overwhelm network users and the regulators who prosecute them. The first step in prosecuting phone abuse is traceback -- identifying the call originator. This fundamental investigative task currently requires hours of manual effort per call. In this paper, we introduce J\"ager, a distributed secure call traceback system. J\"ager can trace a call in a few seconds, even with partial deployment, while cryptographically preserving the privacy of call parties, carrier trade secrets like peers and call volume, and limiting the threat of bulk analysis. We establish definitions and requirements of secure traceback, then develop a suite of protocols that meet these requirements using witness encryption, oblivious pseudorandom functions, and group signatures. We prove these protocols secure in the universal composibility framework. We then demonstrate that J\"ager has low compute and bandwidth costs per call, and these costs scale linearly with call volume. J\"ager provides an efficient, secure, privacy-preserving system to revolutionize telephone abuse investigation with minimal costs to operators.</description>

      <title>Towards Measuring and Modeling "Culture" in LLMs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15412v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a survey of more than 90 recent papers that aim to study cultural representation and inclusion in large language models (LLMs). We observe that none of the studies explicitly define "culture, which is a complex, multifaceted concept; instead, they probe the models on some specially designed datasets which represent certain aspects of "culture". We call these aspects the proxies of culture, and organize them across two dimensions of demographic and semantic proxies. We also categorize the probing methods employed. Our analysis indicates that only certain aspects of ``culture,'' such as values and objectives, have been studied, leaving several other interesting and important facets, especially the multitude of semantic domains (Thompson et al., 2020) and aboutness (Hershcovich et al., 2022), unexplored. Two other crucial gaps are the lack of robustness of probing techniques and situated studies on the impact of cultural mis- and under-representation in LLM-based applications.</description>

      <title>Public vs Private Bodies: Who Should Run Advanced AI Evaluations and Audits? A Three-Step Logic Based on Case Studies of High-Risk Industries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Safety Institutes and governments worldwide are deciding whether they evaluate and audit advanced AI themselves, support a private auditor ecosystem or do both. Auditing regimes have been established in a wide range of industry contexts to monitor and evaluate firms' compliance with regulation. Auditing is a necessary governance tool to understand and manage the risks of a technology. This paper draws from nine such regimes to inform (i) who should audit which parts of advanced AI; and (ii) how much capacity public bodies may need to audit advanced AI effectively. First, the effective responsibility distribution between public and private auditors depends heavily on specific industry and audit conditions. On the basis of advanced AI's risk profile, the sensitivity of information involved in the auditing process, and the high costs of verifying safety and benefit claims of AI Labs, we recommend that public bodies become directly involved in safety critical, especially gray- and white-box, AI model evaluations. Governance and security audits, which are well-established in other industry contexts, as well as black-box model evaluations, may be more efficiently provided by a private market of evaluators and auditors under public oversight. Secondly, to effectively fulfill their role in advanced AI audits, public bodies need extensive access to models and facilities. Public bodies' capacity should scale with the industry's risk level, size and market concentration, potentially requiring 100s of employees for auditing in large jurisdictions like the EU or US, like in nuclear safety and life sciences.</description>

      <title>Taking the Next Step with Generative Artificial Intelligence: The Transformative Role of Multimodal Large Language Models in Science Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems, in education has shown promise in enhancing teaching and learning experiences. However, the advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) like GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V), capable of processing multimodal data including text, sound, and visual inputs, opens a new era of enriched, personalized, and interactive learning landscapes in education. Grounded in theory of multimedia learning, this paper explores the transformative role of MLLMs in central aspects of science education by presenting exemplary innovative learning scenarios. Possible applications for MLLMs could range from content creation to tailored support for learning, fostering competencies in scientific practices, and providing assessment and feedback. These scenarios are not limited to text-based and uni-modal formats but can be multimodal, increasing thus personalization, accessibility, and potential learning effectiveness. Besides many opportunities, challenges such as data protection and ethical considerations become more salient, calling for robust frameworks to ensure responsible integration. This paper underscores the necessity for a balanced approach in implementing MLLMs, where the technology complements rather than supplants the educator's role, ensuring thus an effective and ethical use of AI in science education. It calls for further research to explore the nuanced implications of MLLMs on the evolving role of educators and to extend the discourse beyond science education to other disciplines. Through the exploration of potentials, challenges, and future implications, we aim to contribute to a preliminary understanding of the transformative trajectory of MLLMs in science education and beyond.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02461v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) is a theoretical framework designed to address challenges in AI development, particularly focusing on data fragmentation and siloing issues. It facilitates effective AI training within sovereign data networks by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse data sources, leveraging: 1) personal data stores to ensure data sovereignty, where data remains securely within Participants' control; 2) a scalable federated learning protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training, where only model parameter updates are shared, keeping data within the personal data stores; and 3) a scalable, trustless cryptographic rewards mechanism on a public blockchain to incentivize participation and ensure fair reward distribution through a decentralized auditing protocol. This approach guarantees that no entity can prevent or control access to training data or influence financial benefits, as coordination and reward distribution are managed on the public blockchain with an immutable record. The framework supports effective AI training by allowing Participants to maintain control over their data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized, scalable ecosystem that leverages collective AI to develop beneficial algorithms.</description>

      <title>Seeing Like an AI: How LLMs Apply (and Misapply) Wikipedia Neutrality Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on broad corpora and then used in communities with specialized norms. Is providing LLMs with community rules enough for models to follow these norms? We evaluate LLMs' capacity to detect (Task 1) and correct (Task 2) biased Wikipedia edits according to Wikipedia's Neutral Point of View (NPOV) policy. LLMs struggled with bias detection, achieving only 64% accuracy on a balanced dataset. Models exhibited contrasting biases (some under- and others over-predicted bias), suggesting distinct priors about neutrality. LLMs performed better at generation, removing 79% of words removed by Wikipedia editors. However, LLMs made additional changes beyond Wikipedia editors' simpler neutralizations, resulting in high-recall but low-precision editing. Interestingly, crowdworkers rated AI rewrites as more neutral (70%) and fluent (61%) than Wikipedia-editor rewrites. Qualitative analysis found LLMs sometimes applied NPOV more comprehensively than Wikipedia editors but often made extraneous non-NPOV-related changes (such as grammar). LLMs may apply rules in ways that resonate with the public but diverge from community experts. While potentially effective for generation, LLMs may reduce editor agency and increase moderation workload (e.g., verifying additions). Even when rules are easy to articulate, having LLMs apply them like community members may still be difficult.</description>

      <title>The Need for Guardrails with Large Language Models in Medical Safety-Critical Settings: An Artificial Intelligence Application in the Pharmacovigilance Ecosystem</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are useful tools with the capacity for performing specific types of knowledge work at an effective scale. However, LLM deployments in high-risk and safety-critical domains pose unique challenges, notably the issue of ``hallucination,'' where LLMs can generate fabricated information. This is particularly concerning in settings such as drug safety, where inaccuracies could lead to patient harm. To mitigate these risks, we have developed and demonstrated a proof of concept suite of guardrails specifically designed to mitigate certain types of hallucinations and errors for drug safety, and potentially applicable to other medical safety-critical contexts. These guardrails include mechanisms to detect anomalous documents to prevent the ingestion of inappropriate data, identify incorrect drug names or adverse event terms, and convey uncertainty in generated content. We integrated these guardrails with an LLM fine-tuned for a text-to-text task, which involves converting both structured and unstructured data within adverse event reports into natural language. This method was applied to translate individual case safety reports, demonstrating effective application in a pharmacovigilance processing task. Our guardrail framework offers a set of tools with broad applicability across various domains, ensuring LLMs can be safely used in high-risk situations by eliminating the occurrence of key errors, including the generation of incorrect pharmacovigilance-related terms, thus adhering to stringent regulatory and quality standards in medical safety-critical environments.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06240v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Health Intelligence Network (DHIN) extends the Decentralized Intelligence Network (DIN) framework to address challenges in healthcare data sovereignty and AI utilization. Building upon DIN's core principles, DHIN introduces healthcare-specific components to tackle data fragmentation across providers and institutions, establishing a sovereign architecture for healthcare provision. It facilitates effective AI utilization by overcoming barriers to accessing diverse health data sources. This comprehensive framework leverages: 1) self-sovereign identity architecture coupled with a personal health record (PHR), extending DIN's personal data stores concept to ensure health data sovereignty; 2) a scalable federated learning (FL) protocol implemented on a public blockchain for decentralized AI training in healthcare, tailored for medical data; and 3) a scalable, trustless rewards mechanism adapted from DIN to incentivize participation in healthcare AI development. DHIN operates on a public blockchain with an immutable record, ensuring that no entity can control access to health data or determine financial benefits. It supports effective AI training while allowing patients to maintain control over their health data, benefit financially, and contribute to a decentralized ecosystem. Unique to DHIN, patients receive rewards in digital wallets as an incentive to opt into the FL protocol, with a long-term roadmap to fund decentralized insurance solutions. This approach introduces a novel, self-financed healthcare model that adapts to individual needs, complements existing systems, and redefines universal coverage, showcasing how DIN principles can transform healthcare data management and AI utilization while empowering patients.</description>

      <title>LLM Defenses Are Not Robust to Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks Yet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent large language model (LLM) defenses have greatly improved models' ability to refuse harmful queries, even when adversarially attacked. However, LLM defenses are primarily evaluated against automated adversarial attacks in a single turn of conversation, an insufficient threat model for real-world malicious use. We demonstrate that multi-turn human jailbreaks uncover significant vulnerabilities, exceeding 70% attack success rate (ASR) on HarmBench against defenses that report single-digit ASRs with automated single-turn attacks. Human jailbreaks also reveal vulnerabilities in machine unlearning defenses, successfully recovering dual-use biosecurity knowledge from unlearned models. We compile these results into Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks (MHJ), a dataset of 2,912 prompts across 537 multi-turn jailbreaks. We publicly release MHJ alongside a compendium of jailbreak tactics developed across dozens of commercial red teaming engagements, supporting research towards stronger LLM defenses.</description>
