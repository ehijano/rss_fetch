      <title>Pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent network solving the integrable nonlinear lattice equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional discrete learning methods involve discretizing continuous equations using difference schemes, necessitating considerations of stability and convergence. Integrable nonlinear lattice equations possess a profound mathematical structure that enables them to revert to continuous integrable equations in the continuous limit, particularly retaining integrable properties such as conservation laws, Hamiltonian structure, and multiple soliton solutions. The pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent network (PG-PhyCRNet) is proposed to investigate the localized wave solutions of integrable lattice equations, which significantly enhances the model's extrapolation capability to lattice points beyond the temporal domain. We conduct a comparative analysis of PG-PhyCRNet with and without pseudo grid by investigating the multi-soliton solutions and rational solitons of the Toda lattice and self-dual network equation. The results indicate that the PG-PhyCRNet excels in capturing long-term evolution and enhances the model's extrapolation capability for solitons, particularly those with steep waveforms and high wave speeds. Finally, the robustness of the PG-PhyCRNet method and its effect on the prediction of solutions in different scenarios are confirmed through repeated experiments involving pseudo grid partitioning.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Method for Quasinormal Modes of Non-Relativistic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently reported compactified hyperboloidal method has found wide use in the numerical computation of quasinormal modes, with implications for fields as diverse as gravitational physics and optics. We extend this intrinsically relativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to calculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\"odinger equation and solve related bound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method, offering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes for the programme of black hole spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural Networks with Symplectic Preservation Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a deep neural network architecture designed such that its output forms an invertible symplectomorphism of the input. This design draws an analogy to the real-valued non-volume-preserving (real NVP) method used in normalizing flow techniques. Utilizing this neural network type allows for learning tasks on unknown Hamiltonian systems without breaking the inherent symplectic structure of the phase space.</description>

      <title>Evanescent Optothermoelectric Trapping: Deeper Potentials at a Largescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface plasmons (SP) and their mediated effects have been widely used to manipulate micro- and nanoscale objects of dielectric and metallic nature. In this work, we show how SP excitation can be used to induce thermofluidic and thermoelectric effects to manipulate colloidal dynamics on a large scale. In an evanescent plasmonic trap, temperature gradients induce fluid flow that can facilitate particle accumulation. However, large out-of-plane flows expel particles from the trap, resulting in a shallow trap potential. Here, we numerically demonstrate how adding thermoelectric fields can overpower the optical and hydrodynamic forces to achieve a stable nanoparticle assembly at low excitation powers. We calculate the corresponding optical, fluidic, and thermoelectric trapping forces and potentials. These potentials can be enabled without resonant SP excitation, which requires careful optical alignment. Thus, we explain the mechanism of how, despite weak optical intensities and forces, sufficient trapping force can be supplied via the evanescent optothermoelectric trap to obtain large-scale reversible nanoparticle assemblies, irrespective of their shape, size, or material.</description>

      <title>Understanding Large-Scale Plasma Simulation Challenges for Fusion Energy on Supercomputers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding plasma instabilities is essential for achieving sustainable fusion energy, with large-scale plasma simulations playing a crucial role in both the design and development of next-generation fusion energy devices and the modelling of industrial plasmas. To achieve sustainable fusion energy, it is essential to accurately model and predict plasma behavior under extreme conditions, requiring sophisticated simulation codes capable of capturing the complex interaction between plasma dynamics, magnetic fields, and material surfaces. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive HPC analysis of two prominent plasma simulation codes, BIT1 and JOREK, to advance understanding of plasma behavior in fusion energy applications. Our focus is on evaluating JOREK's computational efficiency and scalability for simulating non-linear MHD phenomena in tokamak fusion devices. The motivation behind this work stems from the urgent need to advance our understanding of plasma instabilities in magnetically confined fusion devices. Enhancing JOREK's performance on supercomputers improves fusion plasma code predictability, enabling more accurate modelling and faster optimization of fusion designs, thereby contributing to sustainable fusion energy. In prior studies, we analysed BIT1, a massively parallel Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code for studying plasma-material interactions in fusion devices. Our investigations into BIT1's computational requirements and scalability on advanced supercomputing architectures yielded valuable insights. Through detailed profiling and performance analysis, we have identified the primary bottlenecks and implemented optimization strategies, significantly enhancing parallel performance. This previous work serves as a foundation for our present endeavours.</description>

      <title>ParaPIF: A Parareal Approach for Parallel-in-Time Integration of Particle-in-Fourier schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose ParaPIF, a parareal based time parallelization scheme for the particle-in-Fourier (PIF) discretization of the Vlasov-Poisson system used in kinetic plasma simulations. Our coarse propagators are based on the coarsening of the numerical discretization scheme combined with, if possible, temporal coarsening rather than coarsening of particles and/or Fourier modes, which are not possible or effective for PIF schemes. Specifically, we use PIF with a coarse tolerance for nonuniform FFTs or even the standard particle-in-cell schemes as coarse propagators for the ParaPIF algorithm. We state and prove the convergence of the algorithm and verify the results numerically with Landau damping, two-stream instability, and Penning trap test cases in 3D-3V. We also implement the space-time parallelization of the PIF schemes in the open-source, performance-portable library IPPL and conduct scaling studies up to 1536 A100 GPUs on the JUWELS booster supercomputer. The space-time parallelization utilizing the ParaPIF algorithm for the time parallelization provides up to $4-6$ times speedup compared to spatial parallelization alone and achieves a push rate of around 1 billion particles per second for the benchmark plasma mini-apps considered.</description>

      <title>Solving combinatorial optimization problems through stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method to approximately solve general instances of combinatorial optimization problems using the physical dynamics of 3d rotors obeying Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics. Conventional techniques to solve discrete optimization problems that use simple continuous relaxation of the objective function followed by gradient descent minimization are inherently unable to avoid local optima, thus producing poor-quality solutions. Our method considers the physical dynamics of macrospins capable of escaping from local minima, thus facilitating the discovery of high-quality, nearly optimal solutions, as supported by extensive numerical simulations on a prototypical quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Our method produces solutions that compare favorably with those obtained using state-of-the-art minimization algorithms (such as simulated annealing) while offering the advantage of being physically realizable by means of arrays of stochastic magnetic tunnel junction devices.</description>

      <title>When is the Four-phonon Effect in Half-Heusler Materials more Pronounced?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppressed three-phonon scattering processes have been considered to be the direct cause of materials exhibiting significant higher-order four-phonon interactions. However, after calculating the phonon-phonon interactions of 128 Half-Heusler materials by high-throughput, we find that the acoustic phonon bandwidth dominates the three-phonon and four-phonon scattering channels and keeps them roughly in a co-increasing or decreasing behavior. The $aao$ and $aaa$ three-phonon scattering channels in Half-Heusler materials are weakly affected by the acoustic-optical gap and acoustic bunched features respectively only when acoustic phonon bandwidths are close. Finally, we found that Half-Heusler materials with smaller acoustic bandwidths tend to have a more pronounced four-phonon effect, although three-phonon scattering may not be significantly suppressed at this time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has deeply changed the paradigms of many research fields. At the heart of chemical and physical sciences is the accurate ab initio calculation of many-body wavefunction, which has become one of the most notable examples to demonstrate the power of deep learning in science. In particular, the introduction of deep learning into quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has significantly advanced the frontier of ab initio calculation, offering a universal tool to solve the electronic structure of materials and molecules. Deep learning QMC architectures were initial designed and tested on small molecules, focusing on comparisons with other state-of-the-art ab initio methods. Methodological developments, including extensions to real solids and periodic models, have been rapidly progressing and reported applications are fast expanding. This review covers the theoretical foundation of deep learning QMC for solids, the neural network wavefunction ansatz, and various of other methodological developments. Applications on computing energy, electron density, electric polarization, force and stress of real solids are also reviewed. The methods have also been extended to other periodic systems and finite temperature calculations. The review highlights the potentials and existing challenges of deep learning QMC in materials chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Direct free energy calculation from ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations of warm dense matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out highly accurate \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to directly estimate the free energy of various warm dense matter systems including the uniform electron gas and hydrogen without any nodal restrictions or other approximations. Since our approach is based on an effective ensemble in a bosonic configuration space, it does not increase the computational complexity beyond the usual fermion sign problem. Its application to inhomogeneous cases such as an electronic system in a fixed external ion potential is straightforward and opens up the enticing possibility to benchmark density functional theory and other existing methods. Finally, it is not limited to warm dense matter, and can be applied to a gamut of other systems such ultracold atoms and electrons in quantum dots.</description>

Abstract: The description of thermodynamic phase transitions in terms of percolation transitions of suitably defined clusters has a long tradition and boasts a number of important successes, the most prominent ones being in ferromagnetic lattice models. Spin glasses and other frustrated systems are not among them as the clusters of aligned spins usually considered in this context start to percolate in the disordered phase and hence fail to indicate the onset of ordering. In this mini-review we provide an overview of the state of the art in this field, including recent advances, and outline the main open questions in the area.</description>

      <title>Adaptive variational quantum computing approaches for Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and benchmark quantum computing approaches for calculating real-time single-particle Green's functions and nonlinear susceptibilities of Hamiltonian systems. The approaches leverage adaptive variational quantum algorithms for state preparation and propagation. Using automatically generated compact circuits, the dynamical evolution is performed over sufficiently long times to achieve adequate frequency resolution of the response functions. We showcase accurate Green's function calculations using a statevector simulator for Fermi-Hubbard chains of 4 and 6 sites, with maximal circuit depth of 65 and 424 layers, respectively. Additionally, we consider an antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1 model that incorporates the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to illustrate calculations of the third-order nonlinear susceptibilities, which can be measured in two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy experiments. These results demonstrate that real-time approaches using adaptive parameterized circuits to evaluate linear and nonlinear response functions can be feasible with near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <title>The role of electronic excited states in the spin-lattice relaxation of spin-1/2 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance is a prime method for the study of chemical and biological structures and their dynamical processes. The interpretation of these experiments relies on considering the spin of electrons as the sole relevant degree of freedom. By applying ab inito open quantum systems theory to the full electronic wavefunction, here we show that contrary to this widespread framework the thermalization of the unpaired electron spin of two Cr(V) coordination compounds is driven by virtual transitions to excited states with energy higher than 20,000 1/cm instead of solely involving low-energy spin interactions such as Zeeman and hyperfine ones. Moreover, we found that a window of low-energy THz phonons contributes to thermalization, rather than a small number of high-energy vibrations. This work provides a drastic reinterpretation of relaxation in spin-1/2 systems and its chemical control strategies, and ultimately exemplifies the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to relaxometry.</description>

Abstract: This work shows that feed-forward neural networks can predict the final ro-vibrational state distributions of inelastic and reactive processes of the reaction of Ca $+$ H2 $\rightarrow$ CaH $+$ H in the hyperthermal regime, relevant for buffer gas chemistry. Furthermore, these models can be extended to the isotopologues of the reaction involving deuterium and tritium. In addition, we develop a neural network model that can learn across the chemical space based on the isotopologues of hydrogen. The model can predict the outcome of a reaction whose reactants have never been seen. This is done by training on the Ca $+$ H2 and Ca $+$ T2 reactions and subsequently predicting the Ca $+$ D2 reaction.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets): A Data-Driven Approach for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used to describe relevant phenomena in dynamical systems. In real-world applications, we commonly need to combine formal PDE models with (potentially noisy) observations. This is especially relevant in settings where we lack information about boundary or initial conditions, or where we need to identify unknown model parameters. In recent years, Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have become a popular tool for this kind of problems. In high-dimensional settings, however, PINNs often suffer from computational problems because they usually require dense collocation points over the entire computational domain. To address this problem, we present Physics-Informed Boundary Integral Networks (PIBI-Nets) as a data-driven approach for solving PDEs in one dimension less than the original problem space. PIBI-Nets only require points at the computational domain boundary, while still achieving highly accurate results. Moreover, PIBI-Nets clearly outperform PINNs in several practical settings. Exploiting elementary properties of fundamental solutions of linear differential operators, we present a principled and simple way to handle point sources in inverse problems. We demonstrate the excellent performance of PIBI- Nets for the Laplace and Poisson equations, both on artificial datasets and within a real-world application concerning the reconstruction of groundwater flows.</description>

      <title>First-principles characterization of thermal conductivity in LaPO4-based alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alloys based on lanthanum phosphate (LaPO$_{4}$) are often employed as thermal barrier coatings, due to their low thermal conductivity and structural stability over a wide temperature range. To enhance the thermal-insulation performance of these alloys, it is essential to comprehensively understand the fundamental physics governing their heat conduction. Here, we employ the Wigner formulation of thermal transport in conjunction with first-principles calculations to elucidate how the interplay between anharmonicity and compositional disorder determines the thermal properties of La$_{1{-}x}$Gd$_{x}$PO$_{4}$ alloys, and discuss the fundamental physics underlying the emergence and coexistence of particle-like and wave-like heat-transport mechanisms. We also show how the Wigner transport equation describes correctly the thermodynamic limit of a compositionally disordered crystal, while the Boltzmann transport equation does not. Our predictions for microscopic vibrational properties (temperature-dependent Raman spectrum) and for macroscopic thermal conductivity are validated against experiments. Finally, we leverage these findings to devise strategies to optimize the performance of thermal barrier coatings.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Fine-Tuning and Error Indication for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07548</link>

Abstract: Data-driven surrogate modeling has surged in capability in recent years with the emergence of graph neural networks (GNNs), which can operate directly on mesh-based representations of data. The goal of this work is to introduce an interpretable fine-tuning strategy for GNNs, with application to unstructured mesh-based fluid dynamics modeling. The end result is an enhanced fine-tuned model that isolates regions in physical space, corresponding to sub-graphs, that are intrinsically linked to the forecasting task while retaining the predictive capability of the baseline. These structures, identified by the fine-tuned GNNs, are adaptively produced in the forward pass and serve as explainable links between the baseline model architecture, the optimization goal, and known problem-specific physics. Additionally, through a regularization procedure, the fine-tuned GNNs can also be used to identify, during inference, graph nodes that correspond to a majority of the anticipated forecasting error, adding a novel interpretable error-tagging capability to baseline models. Demonstrations are performed using unstructured flow field data sourced from flow over a backward-facing step at high Reynolds numbers, with geometry extrapolations demonstrated for ramp and wall-mounted cube configurations.</description>

      <title>MieAI: A neural network for calculating optical properties of internally mixed aerosol in atmospheric models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06497</link>

Abstract: Aerosols influence weather and climate by interacting with radiation through absorption and scattering. These effects heavily rely on the optical properties of aerosols, which are mainly governed by attributes such as morphology, size distribution, and chemical composition. These attributes undergo continuous changes due to chemical reactions and aerosol micro-physics, resulting in significant spatio-temporal variations. Most atmospheric models struggle to incorporate this variability because they use pre-calculated tables to handle aerosol optics. This offline approach often leads to substantial errors in estimating the radiative impacts of aerosols alongwith posing significant computational burdens. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel and computationally efficient machine learning ap proach called MieAI. It allows for online calculation of the optical properties of internally mixed aerosols with a log-normal size distribution. Importantly, MieAI fully incorporates the variability in aerosol chemistry and microphysics. Our evaluation of MieAI against traditional Mie calculations, using number concentrations from ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosol and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) simulations, demonstrates that MieAI exhibits excellent predictive accuracy for aerosol optical properties. MieAI achieves this with errors well within 10%, and it operates more than 1000 times faster than the benchmark approach of Mie calculations. Due to its generalized nature, the MieAI approach can be implemented in any chemistry transport model which represents aerosol size distribution in the form of log-normally distributed internally mixed modes. This advancement has the potential to replace frequently employed lookup tables and play a substantial role in the ongoing attempts to reduce uncertainties in estimating aerosol radiative forcing.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian limited valence model for liquid polyamorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08882v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Liquid-liquid phase transitions have been found experimentally or by computer simulations in many compounds such as water, hydrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, carbon, silica, and silicon. Limited valence model implemented via event-driven molecular dynamics algorithm provides a simple generic mechanism for the liquid-liquid phase transitions in all these diverse cases. Here, we introduce a variant of the limited valence model with a well defined Hamiltonian, i.e., a unique algorithm by which the potential energy of the system of particles can be computed solely from the coordinates of the particles and is thus equivalent to a complex multi-body potential. We present several examples of the model which can be used to reproduce liquid-liquid phase transition in systems with maximum valence $z=1$ (hydrogen), $z=2$ (sulfur) and $z=4$ (water), where $z$ is the maximum number of bonds an atom is allowed to have. For $z=1$, we find a set of parameters for which the system has a liquid-liquid and an isostructural solid--solid critical points. For $z=4$, we find a set of parameters for which the phase diagram resembles that of water with a wide region of negative thermal expansion coefficient (density anomaly) extending into the metastable region of negative pressures. The limited valence model can be modified to forbid not only too large valences but also too low valences. In the case of sulfur, we forbid the formation of monomers, thus restricting the valence $v$ of an atom to be within an interval $1=v_{\rm min}\leqslant v\leqslant v_{\rm max}\equiv z=2$.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Limits of Charge Carrier Mobilities in Layered Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12960</link>

Abstract: Layered halide perovskites have emerged as potential alternatives to three-dimensional halide perovskites due to their improved stability and larger material phase space, allowing fine-tuning of structural, electronic, and optical properties. However, their charge carrier mobilities are significantly smaller than that of three-dimensional halide perovskites, which has a considerable impact on their application in optoelectronic devices. Here, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio approaches to unveil the electron-phonon mechanisms responsible for the diminished transport properties of layered halide perovskites. Starting from a prototypical ABX$_{3}$ halide perovskite, we model the case of $n=1$ and $n=2$ layered structures and compare their electronic and transport properties to the three-dimensional reference. The electronic and phononic properties are investigated within density functional theory (DFT) and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), while transport properties are obtained via the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The vibrational modes contributing to charge carrier scattering are investigated and associated with polar-phonon scattering mechanisms arising from the long-range Fr\"ohlich coupling and deformation potential scattering processes. Our investigation reveals that the lower mobilities in layered systems primarily originates from the increased electronic density of states at the vicinity of the band edges, while the electron-phonon coupling strength remains similar. Such increase is caused by the dimensionality reduction and the break in octahedra connectivity along the stacking direction. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the electron-phonon coupling mechanisms in layered perovskites and highlight the intrinsic limitations of the charge carrier transport in these materials.</description>

      <title>The coupling mechanism between crossed-beams energy transfer and stimulated Brillouin scattering in homogeneous plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coupling mechanism between crossed beams energy transfer and stimulated Brillouin scattering in homogeneous plasmas are studied by theoretical analysis, fluid simulations and particle in cell(PIC) simulations. The numerical models of laser plasma instabilities are constructed by solving coupling equations with Schodinger equations form, and the fluid simulation results are confirmed by fluid theory and PIC simulations.In the parameter regime when the pump depletion does not occur in CBET and the reflectivity of SBS is lower than 1%, SBS will be affected by CBET, the CBET energy gain will still agree with theoretical predications. However, In the parameter regime when the pump depletion does occur in CBET and the reflectivity of SBS is higher than 1%, the CBET spatial gain will be reduced by the interaction of CBET and SBS, and the huge difference of SBS reflectivity for two crossed laser beams is observed.In the PIC simulations, we found that lower ZTe=Ti will significantly reduce the interaction between CBET and SBS (Z is the ion charge, Teis the electron temperature, Ti is the ion temperature).</description>
