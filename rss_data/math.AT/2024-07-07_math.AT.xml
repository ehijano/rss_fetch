      <title>Homology of graph burnings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study graph burnings using methods of algebraic topology. We prove that the time function of a burning is a graph map to a path graph. Afterwards, we define a category whose objects are graph burnings and morphisms are graph maps which commute with the time functions of the burnings. In this category we study relations between burnings of different graphs and, in particular, between burnings of a graph and its subgraphs. For every graph, we define a simplicial complex, arising from the set of all the burnings, which we call a configuration space of the burnings. Further, simplicial structure of the configuration space gives burning homology of the graph. We describe properties of the configuration space and the burning homology theory. In particular, we prove that the one-dimensional skeleton of the configuration space of a graph $G$ coincides with the complement graph of $G$. The results are illustrated with numerous examples.</description>

      <title>Cohomology and K-theory of generalized Dold manifolds fibred by complex flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\nu=(n_1,\ldots, n_s), s\ge 2,$ be a sequence of positive integers and let $n=\sum_{1\le j\le s}n_j$. Let $\mathbb CG(\nu)=U(n)/(U(n_1)\times \cdots\times U(n_s))$ be the complex flag manifold. Denote by $P(m,\nu)=P(\mathbb S^m,\mathbb CG(\nu))$ the generalized Dold manifold $\mathbb S^m\times \mathbb CG(\nu)/\langle \theta\rangle $ where $\theta=\alpha\times \sigma$ with $\alpha:\mathbb S^m\to \mathbb S^m$ being the antipodal map and $\sigma:\mathbb CG(\nu)\to \mathbb CG(\nu)$, the complex conjugation. The manifold $P(m,\nu)$ has the structure of a smooth $\mathbb CG(\nu)$-bundle over the real projective space $\mathbb RP^m.$ We determine the additive structure of $H^*(P(m,\nu);R)$ when $R=\mathbb Z$ and its ring structure when $R$ is a commutative ring in which $2$ is invertible. As an application, we determine the additive structure of $K(P(m,\nu))$ almost completely and also obtain partial results on its ring structure. The results for the singular homology are obtained for generalized Dold spaces $P(S,X)=S\times X/\langle \theta\rangle$, where $\theta=\alpha\times \sigma$, $\alpha:S\to S$ is a fixed point free involution and $\sigma:X\to X$ is an involution with $\mathrm{Fix}(\sigma)\ne \emptyset,$ for a much wider class of spaces $S$ and $X$.</description>

      <title>An isomorphism between models of graphic arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a bridge between the theories of wonderful models associated with toric arrangements and wonderful models associated with hyperplane arrangements. In a previous work, the same authors noticed that the model of the toric arrangement of type $A_{n-1}$ is isomorphic to the one of the hyperplane arrangement of type $A_{n}$; it is natural to ask if there exist similar isomorphisms between other families of arrangements. The aim of this paper is to study one such family, namely the family of arrangements defined by graphs. The main result states that there is indeed an isomorphism between the model of a toric arrangement defined by a graph $\Gamma$ and the model of a hyperplane arrangement defined by the cone of $\Gamma$, provided that a suitable building set is chosen.</description>

      <title>Efficient Betti Matching Enables Topology-Aware 3D Segmentation via Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for the calculation of the Betti matching, which can be used as a loss function to train topology aware segmentation networks. Betti matching loss builds on techniques from topological data analysis, specifically persistent homology. A major challenge is the computational cost of computing persistence barcodes. In response to this challenge, we propose a new, highly optimized implementation of Betti matching, implemented in C++ together with a python interface, which achieves significant speedups compared to the state-of-the-art implementation Cubical Ripser. We use Betti matching 3D to train segmentation networks with the Betti matching loss and demonstrate improved topological correctness of predicted segmentations across several datasets. The source code is available at https://github.com/nstucki/Betti-Matching-3D.</description>

      <title>Duality for Cohen--Macaulay Complexes through Combinatorial Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a duality theorem for Cohen--Macaulay simplicial complexes. This is a generalisation of Poincar\'e Duality, framed in the language of combinatorial sheaves. Our treatment is self-contained and accessible for readers with a working knowledge of simplicial complexes and (co)homology. The main motivation is a link with Bieri-Eckmann duality for discrete groups, which is explored in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>On the extension problems for three 33-stem homotopy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08621v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper tackles the extension problems for three far-unsatble homotopy groups $\pi_{39}(S^{6})$, $\pi_{40}(S^{7})$, and $\pi_{41}(S^{8})$ localized at 2, the puzzles having remained unsolved for forty-five years. By a Toda bracket indexed by 1 included in $\pi_{39}(S^{6}_{(2)})$, which makes better use of the deuspension property of homotopy classes, we address the problems. As a corollary, through Thomeier's 8-step backward theorem of the metastable homotopy theory, together with the results of Oda, Mukai and Miyauchi, we show a table of the 33-stem homotopy groups $\pi_{33+n}(S^{n}_{(2)})$, ($2\leq n\leq 9$, $n\geq27$).</description>

      <title>Formal groups over non-commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an extension of the usual theory of formal group laws where the base ring is not required to be commutative and where the formal variables need neither be central nor have to commute with each other.
  We show that this is the natural kind of formal group law for the needs of algebraic topology in the sense that a (possibly non-commutative) complex oriented ring spectrum is canonically equipped with just such a formal group law. The universal formal group law is carried by the Baker-Richter spectrum M{\xi} which plays a role analogous to MU in this non-commutative context.
  As suggested by previous work of Morava the Hopf algebra B of "formal diffeomorphisms of the non-commutative line" of Brouder, Frabetti and Krattenthaler is central to the theory developed here. In particular, we verify Morava's conjecture that there is a representation of the Drinfeld quantum-double D(B) through cohomology operations in M{\xi}.</description>

      <title>Morse homology with DG coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Morse homology and cohomology with coefficients in a derived local system, for manifolds and also more generally for colimits of spaces that have the homotopy type of manifolds, with a view towards Floer theory. The model that we adopt for derived, or differential graded (DG) local systems is that of DG modules over chains on the based loop space of a manifold. These encompass both classical (non DG) local systems and chains on fibers of Hurewicz fibrations. We prove that the Morse homology and cohomology groups that we construct are isomorphic to DG Tor and Ext functors. The key ingredient in the definition is a notion of twisting cocycle obtained by evaluating into based loops a coherent system of representatives for the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Morse trajectories of arbitrary dimensions. From this perspective, our construction sits midway between classical Morse homology with twisted coefficients and more refined invariants of Floer homotopical flavor. The construction of the twisting cocycle is originally due to Barraud and Cornea with Z/2-coefficients. We show that the twisting cocycle with integer coefficients is equivalent to Brown's universal twisting cocycle. We prove that Morse homology with coefficients in chains on the fiber of a Hurewicz fibration recovers the homology of the total space of the fibration. We study several structural properties of the theory: invariance, functoriality, and Poincar\'e duality, also in the nonorientable case.</description>

      <title>Flux Quantization on 11-dimensional Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flux quantization of the C-field in 11d supergravity is arguably necessary for the (UV-)completion of the theory, in that it determines the torsion charges carried by small numbers of M-branes. However, hypotheses about C-field flux-quantization ("models of the C-field") have previously been discussed only in the bosonic sector of 11d supergravity and ignoring the supergravity equations of motion. Here we highlight a duality-symmetric formulation of on-shell 11d supergravity on superspace, observe that this naturally lends itself to completion of the theory by flux quantization, and indeed that 11d super-spacetimes are put on-shell by carrying quantizable duality-symmetric super-C-field flux; the proof of which we present in detail.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology with DG Coefficients. Applications to cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define Hamiltonian Floer homology with differential graded (DG) local coefficients for symplectically aspherical manifolds. The differential of the underlying complex involves chain representatives of the fundamental classes of the moduli spaces of Floer trajectories of arbitrary dimension. This setup allows in particular to define and compute Floer homology with coefficients in chains on fibers of fibrations over the free loop space of the underlying symplectic manifold. We develop the DG Floer toolset, including continuation maps and homotopies, and we also define and study symplectic homology groups with DG local coefficients. We define spectral invariants and establish general criteria for almost existence of contractible periodic orbits on regular energy levels of Hamiltonian systems inside Liouville domains.
  In the case of cotangent bundles, we prove a Viterbo isomorphism theorem with DG local coefficients. This serves as a stepping stone for applications to the almost existence of contractible closed characteristics on closed smooth hypersurfaces. In this context, our methods allow to access for the first time the dichotomy between closed manifolds that are aspherical and those that are not.</description>

      <title>Universality in Random Persistent Homology and Scale-Invariant Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a universality result for the limiting distribution of persistence diagrams arising from geometric filtrations over random point processes. Specifically, we consider the distribution of the ratio of persistence values (death/birth), and show that for fixed dimension, homological degree and filtration type (Cech or Vietoris-Rips), the limiting distribution is independent of the underlying point process distribution, i.e., universal. In proving this result, we present a novel general framework for universality in scale-invariant functionals on point processes. Finally, we also provide a number of new results related to Morse theory in random geometric complexes, which may be of an independent interest.</description>
