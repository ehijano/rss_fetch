      <title>Operational measurement of relativistic equilibrium from stochastic fields alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic equilibrium is described by the inverse-temperature four-vector $\beta^\mu = u^\mu/(k_B T_0)$ rather than by a frame-dependent scalar temperature. We show that $\beta^\mu$ can be reconstructed directly from electromagnetic fluctuations emitted by a drifting medium, without external probes, spectral lines, or absolute intensity calibration. A Lorentz boost converts isotropic rest-frame noise into correlated electric and magnetic fields, producing a gain-independent fluctuation observable that yields the drift velocity purely from stochastic data. Combined with angle-resolved noise spectra governed by the covariant fluctuation--dissipation theorem, this enables full reconstruction of $\beta^\mu$ using electromagnetic measurements alone. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios, and feasibility estimates indicate sub-microsecond integration times for laboratory plasmas. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first method that reconstructs the covariant thermal state $\beta^\mu$ of a relativistic medium from passive stochastic fields alone, without absolute calibration, spectral lines, or external probes. These results establish vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations as a direct operational probe of relativistic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Hot Electron Preheat Observed in Magnetized Laser Direct-Drive Implosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard x-ray emission, associated with hot electron preheat, in direct-drive implosions was observed to be enhanced by a factor of $1.5\pm0.1$ by application of a $10$ T magnetic field. The applied magnetic field reaches a quasi steady-state aligned with the ablation flow prior to the onset of laser-plasma instabilities in the corona. Hot electrons that would otherwise escape the corona and lead to capsule charging in unmagnetized implosions are confined in a mirror-mode of the magnetic field in magnetized implosions. These hot electrons are shown to subsequently pitch-angle scatter from the mirror onto the capsule, thereby leading to the observed hard x-ray generation in magnetized implosions. Consequently, the energy of charged-fusion products, associated with the capsule charging, are observed to decrease when the implosion is magnetized. These results intensify the need to mitigate laser-plasma instabilities -- particularly for magnetized implosions -- to maximize fusion gain and implosion efficiency.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of electron acceleration by microwave-driven plasma wakefields in rectangular waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-based acceleration schemes have attracted sustained interest as a pathway toward compact particle accelerators, owing to the large electric fields supported by plasmas. Although recent studies have demonstrated the excitation of plasma wakefields using high-power microwave pulses in plasma-filled waveguides, the conditions required for efficient electron acceleration in such configurations remain insufficiently characterized. In this work, we investigate the acceleration of externally injected electrons by microwave-driven plasma wakefields in rectangular waveguides filled with low-density plasma. Three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are employed to analyze the dynamics of electron injection and energy gain under both reduced and fully self-consistent numerical models. The results show that electron acceleration is strongly dependent on the injection phase and initial velocity. Optimal acceleration is achieved when electrons are pre-accelerated to velocities close to the group velocity of the driving microwave pulse. For the parameters considered, energy gains of the order of $10^2 \mathrm{keV}$ are obtained over interaction lengths of the order of meters, while maintaining a quasi-monoenergetic energy distribution under suitable injection conditions. The influence of transverse dynamics and space-charge effects is also examined, revealing additional constraints on acceleration efficiency associated with the transverse electromagnetic field of the driving microwave pulse. These results provide a quantitative assessment of the acceleration stage in microwave-driven plasma wakefield schemes and support their evaluation as a viable platform for compact plasma-based accelerators.</description>

      <title>Capturing Secondary Kinetic Instabilities in Three-Dimensional Dayside Reconnection Using an Improved Gradient-Based Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a highly dynamic process that excites a wide variety of kinetic waves and instabilities. Transverse current sheet instabilities such as the lower-hybrid drift and secondary drift-kink instabilities in particular have been shown by kinetic simulations to modify the reconnection and introduce significant turbulence and mixing to the reconnection layer. Past studies using the ten-moment fluid model to capture important kinetic physics such as the electron inertia and full representation of the pressure tensor proved advantageous to a two-fluid representation of reconnection, but the model struggled when using a local relaxation closure for the heat flux to replicate the current sheet instabilities and subsequent mixing seen in kinetic simulations. This work uses the \texttt{Gkeyll} software framework to perform simulations of asymmetric reconnection based on the 16 October 2015 MMS crossing of a diffusion region, the Burch event. An improved gradient-based heat flux closure is implemented, showing significant improvement in secondary kinetic instabilities that grow in the current sheet. These instabilities generate turbulence which leads to growth of secondary magnetic islands and flux ropes.</description>

      <title>Resistive instabilities of current sheets in stratified plasmas with a gravitational field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection can develop spontaneously via the tearing instability, often invoked to explain disruptive instabilities in fusion devices, solar flares, the generation of periodic density disturbances at the tip of helmet streamers, and flux transfer events at the Earth's dayside magnetopause. However, in many such environments the presence of gravity, magnetic field curvature or other forms of acceleration often result in situations of a heavy-over-light plasma in an effective gravitational field with an embedded current sheet. This paper studies the linear stability of a slab current sheet with respect to reconnecting modes in the presence of a density gradient under the effect of a constant gravitational acceleration. We show that the presence of stratification and gravity modify the properties of the tearing mode instability both in the case of favorable and unfavorable stratification. Favorable stratification suppresses reconnection while unfavorable stratification strongly destabilizes the tearing mode. Furthermore, we show that the classical constant-{\psi} regime effectively does not exist, even for weak unfavorable stratification, for S&gt;&gt;1. Instead, the gravity-modified tearing progressively transitions into the G-mode, which is a gravity-driven reconnecting mode with a growth rate scaling as S^-1/3. As a consequence, unfavorable stratification only permits rapidly reconnecting modes.</description>

      <title>Plasma Mixing in Collisionless Kelvin-Helmholtz Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations and observations of the low-latitude magnetosphere-magnetosheath boundary layer indicate that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) drives vortex structures that enhance plasma mixing and magnetic reconnection, influencing transport and particle acceleration. We investigate the efficiency and physical mechanisms of plasma mixing driven by the nonlinear evolution of the KHI. We perform high-resolution two-dimensional Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations using a finite-Larmor-radius shear-flow initial configuration. Plasma mixing is quantified using particle tracking, passive tracers, and diagnostics of magnetic reconnection. Mixing across the shear layer is present but localized, occurring mainly in narrow interface regions and plasma structures. Ions mix more effectively than electrons, which remain largely frozen to field lines. Enhanced mixing correlates with localized reconnection within and between KH vortices. Cross-boundary transport driven by the kinetic KHI is highly localized and mediated by vortex advection and reconnection. Electron mixing is strongly constrained, providing an upper bound on kinetic-scale transport across collisionless shear layers.</description>

      <title>Self-Consistent Dynamics of Electron Radiation Reaction via Structure-Preserving Geometric Algorithms for Coupled Schr\"odinger-Maxwell Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically, a charged particle in a magnetic field emits radiation, losing momentum and experiencing the Abraham-Lorentz (AL) / Landau-Lifshitz (LL) radiation reaction (RR) force. However, at atomic scales and outside the range of their applicability, the AL/LL equations fail and RR destroys the coherent state of an electron-undermining the very concept of a RR force. This process can be described by the coupled Schr\"odinger-Maxwell (SM) system under appropriate limits, but the system's nonlinear complexity has long limited purely analytical studies. We present geometric structure-preserving algorithms for the SM system that preserve gauge invariance, symplecticity, and unitarity on the discrete space-time lattice, which are implemented in our Structure-Preserving scHrodINger maXwell (SPHINX) code. By constructing coherent states from the Landau levels, SPHINX simulates the fully-coupled nonlinear dynamics of an electron coherent state, the energy partition evolution, and decoherence/relaxation of the electron wave packet in time due to RR. These simulations indicate that, in an external magnetic field, an electron prepared in an atomic-scale coherent state can radiate strongly, rapidly losing coherence and dispersing into a decoherent wave packet. Additionally, we also present the fully-coupled nonlinear evolution of the non-degenerate ground- and first-excited Landau levels themselves to understand how the coupled SM system modifies the well-known ideal (i.e., Schr\"odinger-only) dynamics of the Landau Levels. With appropriate boundary conditions, simulations show that the Landau levels are renormalized into stationary dressed eigenstates with constant electromagnetic and kinetic energies. This opens a new computational window into RR physics and advances modeling of extreme-field phenomena in fusion plasmas, astrophysics, and next-generation laser experiments</description>

      <title>Tolerances to driver-witness misalignment in a quasilinear plasma wakefield accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma-based accelerators offer high accelerating gradients and scalability through staging or long plasma sources, which makes them good candidates for future accelerator and collider concepts. Proton-driven accelerators in particular have the potential to bring particles to high energy in a single stage. In the quasilinear regime - where the plasma wake is only partially evacuated - a witness bunch of electrons drives a cavitated wake, which acts to preserve the emittance of the portion of the witness inside this self-blowout. In the case of a misalignment between the driver and witness, this behaviour can persist, but its effectiveness is reduced. In this paper, we study transverse witness dynamics in this regime, and develop analytical models to describe the witness motion, and develop a metric to estimate emittance preservation based on a single parameter which estimates the density of the witness after phase mixing. Particle in cell simulations using the AWAKE Run 2c baseline parameters show excellent agreement with the predictive models developed. This work allows alignment constraints to be set both for the AWAKE experiment and other wakefield acceleration schemes operating in the quasilinear regime.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Route to Helicity-Constrained Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through 2D3V PIC simulations of freely decaying sub-ion turbulence, intermittent localized regions with $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B} \neq 0$ are found to be statistically associated with reductions in the magnitude of magnetic helicity while evolving in the early electron-scale interaction phase. Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \sim \text{const}$. For initially net-helical configurations, we observe rapid development of mixed-signed magnetic helicity patches and a decrease of the global fractional helicity, such that the decay over the kinetic interval is again most consistent with the cancellation-dominated scaling constraint.</description>

      <title>Characterization of compressible fluctuations in solar wind streams dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence: Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter and Wind observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing compressible fluctuations in the solar wind is essential for understanding their role in solar wind acceleration and heating, yet their origin and evolution across different turbulence regimes remain poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a statistical analysis of the properties of compressible fluctuations in solar wind dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence. Using in-situ measurements from Wind, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe, we investigate the scale dependence of density and magnetic field fluctuations and their correlations with plasma beta and radial distance. Our results indicate that solar wind compressibility is likely affected by both expansion effects and compressible dynamics governed by local plasma conditions. The non-Alfvenic wind is dominated by anti-correlated fluctuations, whereas the Alfvenic wind contains a mixture of correlated and anti-correlated fluctuations, though the latter remain prevalent. While the anti-correlated component is consistent with MHD slow magnetosonic modes, the correlated (fast mode-like) component is not reproduced by predictions from either linear MHD theory or nonlinear models of forced compressible fluctuations. Nevertheless, the dominant slow mode component explains the observed dependence on beta and the enhanced density fluctuations measured by Parker Solar Probe. This further suggests that slow mode waves contribute significantly to the compressible energy budget near the Sun and may play an important role in solar wind heating and acceleration close to the Sun.</description>

      <title>Theory of striped dynamic spectra of the Crab pulsar high-frequency interpulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of the spectral "zebra" pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Relativistic Plasmas with a Conservative Discontinuous Galerkin Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for solving the relativistic Vlasov--Maxwell system of equations, applicable to a wide range of extreme high-energy-density astrophysical and laboratory environments. The method directly discretizes the kinetic equation on a high-dimensional phase-space grid using a discontinuous Galerkin finite element approach, yielding a high-order, conservative numerical scheme that is free from the Poisson noise inherent to traditional Monte-Carlo methods. A novel and flexible velocity-space mapping technique enables the efficient treatment of the wide range of energy scales characteristic of relativistic plasmas, including QED pair-production discharges, instabilities in strongly magnetized plasmas surrounding neutron stars, and relativistic magnetic reconnection. Our noise-free approach is capable of providing unique insight into plasma dynamics, enabling detailed analysis of electromagnetic emission and fine-scale phase-space structure.</description>

      <title>Extended phase-space symplectic integration for electron dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16542v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of extended phase-space symplectic integration for simulating two different classes of electron dynamics. The first one, with one and a half degrees of freedom, comes from plasma physics and describes the classical dynamics of a charged particle in a strong, constant, and uniform magnetic field perturbed by a turbulent electrostatic potential. The second one, with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, comes from physical chemistry and corresponds to Kohn-Sham time-dependent density-functional theory. For both we lay out the extension procedure and stability condition for numerical integration of the dynamics using high-order symplectic split-operator schemes. We also identify a computationally inexpensive metric that can be used for on-the-fly estimation of the accuracy of simulations. Our work paves the way for broad application of symplectic split-operator integration of classical and quantum Hamiltonian systems with finite and infinite number of degrees of freedom by comparing different modes of implementation of extended phase space integration.</description>
