      <title>Precision measurement of Cs($nF_J$) quantum defects and calculations of scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ ,$nD_J$ , and $nF_J$ series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend our recent work on cesium S and D states [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 233005 (2024)] to the F states. We present absolute frequency measurements of the $|6S_{1/2}, F = 3\rangle \rightarrow nF_{5/2,7/2}(n = 28-68)$ Rydberg series to measure the spectrum of $^{133}$Cs. Atomic spectra are obtained using a three-photon excitation scheme referenced to an optical frequency comb in a sample of ultracold $^{133}$Cs. By globally fitting the absolute-frequency measurements to the modified Ritz formula, we determine the quantum defects of the $nF_{5/2}$ and $nF_{7/2}$ series. The ionization potential extracted for both series from the modified Ritz formula agrees with our measurements based on the S and D series. Fine-structure intervals are calculated and parameterized. The wave functions computed for the energies from the quantum defects are used to calculate transition dipole moments. We compare the reduced electric-dipole matrix elements with available benchmarks and find agreement within the precision of those works. The scalar and tensor polarizabilities of the $nS_{1/2}$, $nP_J$ , $nD_J$ and $nF_J$ series are calculated based on the now more accurate set of wave functions. Moreover, we report the polarizability as a series in powers of the effective principal quantum number and find the main coefficients of the expansion. The results will be useful for calculating properties of $^{133}$Cs such as collision and decay rates, polarizabilities, and magic wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Multipassage Landau-Zener tunneling oscillations in transverse/longitudinal dual dressing of atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of a non-resonant dressed-atom
  qubit in an XZ original configuration. It is composed of two
  electromagnetic fields, one oscillating parallel and the other
  orthogonal to the quantisation magnetic static field. The
  experiments are performed in rubidium and caesium atomic
  magnetometers, confined in a magneto-optical trap and in a vapour
  cell, respectively. Static fields in the $\mu$T range and kHz
  oscillating fields with large Rabi frequencies are applied. This
  dual-dressing configuration is an extension of the Landau-Zener
  multipassage interferometry in the presence of an additional
  dressing field controlling the tunneling process by its amplitude
  and phase. Our measurement of the qubit coherence introduces
  additional features to the transition probability readout of
  standard interferometry. The coherence time evolution is
  characterized by oscillations at several frequencies, each of them
  produced by a different quantum contribution. Such frequency
  description introduces a new picture of the qubit multipassage
  evolution. Because the present low-frequency dressing operation
  does not fall within the standard Floquet engineering paradigm based
  on the high-frequency expansion, we develop an ad-hoc dressing
  perturbation treatment. Numerical simulations support the adiabatic
  and non-adiabatic qubit evolution.</description>

      <title>Permutationally-Invariant N-body gates via Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widely used in atomic and superconducting qubit systems, the Jaynes-Cummings (JC) Hamiltonian is a simple, yet powerful model for a two-level system interacting with a quantum harmonic oscillator. In this paper, we focus on a system of n qubits, identically coupled to a single oscillator via JC interaction, also known as the Tavis-Cummings (TC) Hamiltonian. We show that all permutationally-invariant unitaries on an arbitrary number of qubits can be realized using this permutationally-invariant Hamiltonian, which couples the qubits to an oscillator initialized in its vacuum state, together with global uniform x and z fields on all qubits. This includes useful gates, such as controlled-Z gate with an arbitrary number of control qubits. As a corollary, we find that all permutationally invariant states -- including useful entangled states such as GHZ and Dicke states -- can be prepared using this interaction and global fields. We also characterize unitaries that can be realized on the joint Hilbert space of the qubits and oscillator with the TC interaction and global z field, and develop new methods for preparing the state of the oscillator in an arbitrary initial state. We present various examples of explicit circuits for the case of n=2 qubits. In particular, we develop new methods for implementing controlled-Z, SWAP, iSWAP, and $\sqrt{i\text{SWAP}}$ gates using only the TC interaction and a global z field. Our work also reveals an accidental symmetry in the TC Hamiltonian and shows that it can be explained using Schwinger's oscillator model of angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Superatomic hydrogen: achieving effective aggregation of hydrogen atoms at pressures lower than that of metallic hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal hydrogen exhibiting electron delocalization properties has been recognized as an important prospect for achieving controlled nuclear fusion, but the extreme pressure conditions required exceeding hundreds of GPa remain a daunting challenge. Here, we propose a model of superatomic hydrogen, aiming to reduce the pressure conditions required for the effective aggregation of elemental hydrogen atoms. High-precision ab initio calculations indicate that the pressure required to compress the H13 system with one central atom and 12 surrounding atoms into a superatomic state is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of metallic hydrogen. Atomic-level analyses reveal that in the superatomic state of compressed H13, the central H atom donates its electron, and all electrons are delocalized on the superatomic molecular orbitals, which conforms to properties of metallic hydrogen. Our discovery in principle opens up the prospect of superatomic hydrogen in areas such as nuclear fusion.</description>

      <title>Atomic and Molecular Waveform Processing with Attosecond Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancing the temporal resolution in computations, signal generation and modulation, and measurements is of paramount importance for pushing the boundaries of science and technology. Optical resonators have recently demonstrated the ability to perform computational operations at frequencies beyond the gigahertz range, surpassing the speed of conventional electronic devices. However, increasing the resonator length extends the operation time but decreases the temporal resolution, with current state-of-the-art systems achieving only picosecond resolution. Here we show that atoms and molecules belong to the class of widely-used passive resonators that operate without gain, such as subwavelength particles, electric circuits, and slabs, but with long operation times and, importantly, attosecond resolution. Our analysis reveals that when resonantly exciting atoms and molecules, the resulting scattered field is the integral of the incoming field envelope, with improvement factors in temporal resolution of a million and trillion compared with optical resonators and electronic devices, respectively. We demonstrate our results theoretically for atoms and compare it with the standard slab resonator. Remarkably, our approach applies to all transition types including electronic, vibrational, rotational, and spin, with the same temporal resolution preserved across all frequencies. Our research paves the way for a new generation of devices operating on attosecond timescales and opens new avenues in fields such as computation, ultrafast phenomena, high-rate data transmission, encryption, and quantum technology.</description>

      <title>The QTF-Backbone: Proposal for a Nationwide Optical Fibre Backbone in Germany for Quantum Technology and Time and Frequency Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in the distribution of quantum information and high-precision time and frequency (T&amp;F) signals over long-haul optical fibre networks have transformative potential for physically secure communications, resilience of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and fundamental physics. However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&amp;F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions.
  We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&amp;F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&amp;D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment. As a national and European hub, it will position Germany and Europe at the forefront of quantum networking, as well as time and frequency transfer.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Sensing via Rydberg Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Using Zeeman and Stark Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg-assisted atomic electrometry with thermal vapors offers a promising approach for detecting external electric fields. However, this technique presents significant challenges for measuring low frequencies due to the effects of metal-alkali atoms adsorbed on the interior surface of the vacuum chamber. In this work, we apply high-contrast Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) spectroscopy to systematically investigate these effects, including the influence of laser power and electric field strength. We demonstrate the ability to measure electric field frequencies ranging from 10 Hz to 1 MHz. Additionally, this study identifies a fundamental limit for data capacity in such measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method for precise Stark shift measurements by locking the coupling laser to Zeeman-split Rydberg EIT peaks. Using the Zeeman shift in a reference cell as a stable frequency reference, we track Stark-induced shifts in a science cell and confirm excellent agreement with theoretical predictions. These results provide valuable insights for future precision measurement techniques and field sensing applications based on Rydberg atom systems.</description>

      <title>Prospects for measuring the electron's electric dipole moment with polyatomic molecules in an optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the conceptual design of an experiment to measure the electron's electric dipole moment (eEDM) using $^{138}$BaOH molecules in an optical lattice. The BaOH molecule is laser-coolable and highly sensitive to the eEDM, making it an attractive candidate for such a precision measurement, and capturing it in an optical lattice offers potentially very long coherence times. We study possibilities and limitations of this approach, identify the most crucial limiting factors and ways to overcome them. The proposed apparatus can reach a statistical error of $10^{-30}\,e\,$cm by measuring spin precession on a total number of $5 \times 10^9$ molecules over a span of 120 days.</description>

      <title>Theory of internal conversion of the thorium-229 nuclear isomer in solid-state hosts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser excitation of thorium-229 nuclei in doped wide bandgap crystals has been demonstrated recently, opening the possibility of developing ultrastable solid-state clocks and sensitive searches for new physics. We develop a quantitative theory of the internal conversion of isomeric thorium-229 in solid-state hosts. The internal conversion of the isomer proceeds by resonantly exciting a valence band electron to a defect state, accompanied by multi-phonon emission. We demonstrate that, if the process is energetically allowed, it generally quenches the isomer on timescales much faster than the isomer's radiative lifetime, despite thorium being in the +4 charge state in the valence band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the use of global drives with multiple frequency components to improve the efficiency of trapped ion quantum simulations and computations. We show that such `multi-mode' global drives, when combined with a linear number of single-qubit rotations, generate universal Ising-type interactions with shorter overall runtimes than corresponding two-qubit gate implementations. Further, we show how this framework may be extended to efficiently generate $n-$body interactions between any subset $n$ of the ion qubits. Finally, we apply these techniques to encode the Quantum Fourier Transform using quadratically-fewer entangling operations, with quadratically smaller runtime, compared with traditional approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for quantum logic spectroscopy of an electron or positron in a Penning trap. An electron or positron in a spectroscopy trap is coupled to a remote logic electron or positron via a wire to achieve motional entanglement. By separating the two traps, one can significantly improve magnetic field homogeneity, microwave characteristics, and detection sensitivity. The proposed scheme will improve the measurement precision of the electron's and positron's magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios, enabling precise tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>
