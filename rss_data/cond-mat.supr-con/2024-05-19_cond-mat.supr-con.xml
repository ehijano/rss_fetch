      <title>Bulk nanoscale structural correlations in a model cuprate superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the extent and role of inhomogeneity is a pivotal challenge in the physics of cuprate superconductors. While it is known that structural and electronic inhomogeneity is prevalent in the cuprates, it has proven difficult to disentangle compound-specific features from universally relevant effects. We combine advanced neutron and x-ray diffuse scattering with numerical modeling, which enables us to obtain insight into bulk structural correlations in HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$. This cuprate exhibits a high optimal transition temperature of nearly 100 K, pristine charge-transport behavior, and a simple average crystal structure without long-range structural instabilities, and is therefore uniquely suited for investigations of intrinsic inhomogeneity. We uncover diffuse reciprocal-space patterns that correspond to nanoscale correlations of atomic displacements predominant perpendicular to the CuO$_2$ planes. The real-space nature of the correlations is revealed through three-dimensional pair distribution function analysis and complementary numerical refinement. We find that relative displacements of ionic and CuO$_2$ layers play a crucial role, and that the structural inhomogeneity is not directly caused by the presence of conventional point defects. The observed correlations are therefore intrinsic to HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, and thus likely important for the physics of cuprates more broadly. It is possible that the structural correlations are closely related to the unusual superconducting correlations and Mott-localization in these complex oxides. The experimental and analysis tools developed here for large volumes of diffuse scattering data can be expected to aid future investigations of a wide range of materials, especially as advances in scattering techniques present researchers with more comprehensive data to be analyzed.</description>

      <title>Describing heat dissipation in the resistive state of three-dimensional superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the role of the heat diffusion equation in simulating the resistive state of superconducting films. By analyzing the current-voltage and current-resistance characteristic curves for temperatures close to $T_c$ and various heat removal scenarios, we demonstrate that heat diffusion notably influences the behavior of the resistive state, specially near the transition to the normal state, where heat significantly changes the critical current and the calculated resistance. Furthermore, we show how the efficiency of the substrate has important effects in the dynamics of the system, particularly for lower temperatures. Finally, we investigate the hysteresis loops, the role of the film thickness and of the Ginzburg-Landau parameter, the findings accounting for heat diffusion in accurately modeling the resistive state of superconducting films and provide valuable insights into its complex dynamics. To accomplish these findings, we have used the $3D$ generalized Ginzburg-Landau equation coupled with the heat diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Possible spin-polarized Cooper pairing in high temperature FeSe superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity and long-range ferromagnetism hardly coexist in a uniform manner. The counter-example has been observed, in uranium-based superconductors for instance, with a coexisting temperature limited to about 1 K. Here, we report the coexistence of high temperature superconductivity and itinerant ferromagnetism in lithium intercalated FeSe flakes. In superconducting samples with transition temperature around 40 K, we observe the anomalous Hall effect with a hysteresis loop in transverse resistivity and a butterfly-like pattern of magneto-resistance. Intriguingly, such ferromagnetism persists down to a temperature at which the zero-field resistance fully vanishes. Furthermore, the superconductivity is enhanced under an in-plane magnetic field, suggestive of the participation of spin-polarized Cooper pairs. The surprising finding underscores a uniform coexistence of the two antagonistic phenomena on a record-high energy scale.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study on magnetism suppression, anharmonicity, rattling mode and superconductivity in Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$=Fe, Co, Ni)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic ab initio study on phonon-mediated superconductivity in the transition-metal-based superconductors Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = Fe, Co, Ni). Firstly, our charge analysis reveals significant electron transfer from Sc to $M$ due to the substantial difference in the electronegativity, filling the 3$d$ orbitals of $M$ and suppressing magnetic instability. Secondly, we show that Sc$_6$FeTe$_2$ exhibits strong lattice anharmonicity. Moreover, for $M =$ Fe and Co, we find low-frequency soft phonon bands of $M$ which can be interpreted as "rattling phonons" in the framework formed by Sc. While not observed in the case of $M=$ Ni, the rattling phonons give rise to a prominent peak or plateau in the Eliashberg spectral function and enhance the pairing instability. By reproducing the experimental trend of superconducting transition temperatures, our study underscores the potential of designing phonon-mediated superconductors by strategically combining non-superconducting and magnetic transition-metal elements.</description>

      <title>Large Fermi surface in pristine kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and enhanced quasiparticle effective masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is an ideal platform to study the interplay between topology and electron correlation. To understand the fermiology of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, intensive quantum oscillation (QO) studies at ambient pressure have been conducted. However, due to the Fermi surface reconstruction by the complicated charge density wave (CDW) order, the QO spectrum is exceedingly complex, hindering a complete understanding of the fermiology. Here, we directly map the Fermi surface of the pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ by measuring Shubnikov-de Haas QOs up to 29 T under pressure, where the CDW order is completely suppressed. The QO spectrum of the pristine CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ is significantly simpler than the one in the CDW phase, and the detected oscillation frequencies agree well with our density functional theory calculations. In particular, a frequency as large as 8,200 T is detected. Pressure-dependent QO studies further reveal a weak but noticeable enhancement of the quasiparticle effective masses on approaching the critical pressure where the CDW order disappears, hinting at the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our high-pressure QO results reveal the large, unreconstructed Fermi surface of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, paving the way to understanding the parent state of this intriguing metal in which the electrons can be organized into different ordered states.</description>

      <title>$\varphi$ Josephson junction induced by altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in a superconductor/altermagnet/superconductor (S/AM/S) junction. We find anomalous phenomena including $0$-$\pi$ transition as well as multi-nodal current-phase relations. Similar to $d$-wave superconductor, $d$-wave altermagnet can support $\varphi$ junction where free energy minima locate neither $\varphi=0$ nor $\pm \pi$ with double degeneracy. These properties can be tunable by parameters e.g., the exchange energy, the orientation of crystal axis, the length, and the applied gate voltage of altermagnet. These rich features lead to accessible functionality of S/AM/S junction.</description>

      <title>Superconducting spin valve effect in the Co/Pb/Co heterostructure with insulating interlayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the superconducting properties of the Co/Pb/Co heterostructures with thin insulating interlayers. The main specific feature of these structures is the intentional oxidation of both superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces. We study variation of the critical temperature of our systems due to switching between parallel and antiparallel configurations of the magnetizations of the two magnetic layers. Common wisdom suggests that this spin valve effect, which is due to the S/F proximity effect, is most pronounced in the case of perfect metallic contact at the interfaces. Nevertheless, in our structures with intentionally deteriorated interfaces, we observed a significant full spin valve effect. A shift of the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ by switching the mutual orientation of the magnetizations of the two ferromagnetic Co layers from antiparallel to parallel amounted to $\Delta T_c =0.2$ K at the optimal thickness of the superconducting Pb layer. Our finding verifies the so far unconfirmed earlier results by Deutscher and Meunier on an F1/S/F2 heterostructure with oxidized interlayers [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.22.395, G. Deutscher and F. Meunier, Phys. Rev. Lett. 22, 395 (1969)] and suggests an alternative route to optimize the performance of the superconducting spin valves.</description>

      <title>Extended Coupled Cluster approach to Twisted Graphene Layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A study of correlation effects in twisted bilayer graphene is presented using the extended coupled cluster method at consistent mean-field and beyond mean-field truncations. In order to describe the phase transitions in this strongly correlated system, equations and a suitable implementation is developed for the method. Combining modern tensor contraction techniques with singular value decomposition, the correlation effects are successfully described in a qualitative manner, with the majority of both short-range and long-range Coulomb interactions included. The superconducting gap is found to peak at an angle $\theta_c = 1.00^\circ$ with a BCS value for the critical temperature of $T_\text{c}^\text{BCS} = 0.8$K matching closely with experiment. Additionally, a homogeneous (s-wave) gap is found. While the simulations are somewhat limited by the truncations used, nevertheless, a strong candidate for the mechanism behind superconductive phases in twisted bilayer graphene is presented.</description>

      <title>Superfluid weight in the isolated band limit within the generalized random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superfluid weight of a generic lattice model with attractive Hubbard interaction is computed analytically in the isolated band limit within the generalized random phase approximation. Time-reversal symmetry, spin rotational symmetry, and the uniform pairing condition are assumed. It is found that the relation obtained in [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.014518] between the superfluid weight in the flat band limit and the so-called minimal quantum metric is valid even at the level of the generalized random phase approximation. For an isolated, but not necessarily flat, band it is found that the correction to the superfluid weight obtained from the generalized random phase approximation $D_{\rm s}^{(1)} = D_{\rm s,c}^{(1)}+D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}$ is also the sum of a conventional contribution $D_{\rm s,c}^{(1)}$ and a geometric contribution $D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}$, as in the case of the known mean-field result $D_{\rm s}^{(0)}=D_{\rm s,c}^{(0)}+D_{\rm s,g}^{(0)}$, in which the geometric term $D_{\rm s,g}^{(0)}$ is a weighted average of the quantum metric. The conventional contribution is geometry independent, that is independent of the orbital positions, while it is possible to find a preferred, or natural, set of orbital positions such that $D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}=0$. Useful analytic expressions are derived for both the natural orbital positions and the minimal quantum metric, including its extension to bands that are not necessarily flat. Finally, using some simple examples, it is argued that the natural orbital positions may lead to a more refined classification of the topological properties of the band structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many emergent phases of matter stem from the intertwined dynamics of quasiparticles. Here we show that a topological superconducting phase emerges as the result of interactions between electrons and magnons in a quantum wire and a helical magnet. The magnon-mediated interaction favors triplet superconductivity over a large magnetic phase space region, and stabilizes topological superconductivity over an extended region of chemical potentials. The superconducting gap depends exponentially on the spin-electron coupling, allowing it to be enhanced through material engineering techniques.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling approach to temperature dependence of competing orders of superconductivity: Possible time-reversal symmetry breaking and nontrivial topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use strong-coupling Eliashberg theory to study the competition of separate superconducting orders at low temperatures. Specifically, we study magnon-mediated superconductivity in a trilayer heterostructure with a thin normal metal between two antiferromagnetic insulators. Spin-triplet $p$-wave, spin-triplet $f$-wave, and spin-singlet $d$-wave superconducting gaps have been predicted to occur close to the critical temperature for the superconducting instability. The gap symmetry with the largest critical temperature depends on parameters in the model. We confirm that the same gap symmetries appear at any temperature below the critical temperature. Furthermore, we show that the temperature can affect the competition between the different superconducting orders. In addition, we consider time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, complex linear combinations of candidate pairings, such as chiral $p$-, $f$-, and $d$-wave gaps, as well as $p_x+if_y$-wave gaps. We find indications that some of these time-reversal-symmetry-breaking, nodeless gaps offer a greater condensation energy than the time-reversal symmetric gaps. This indicates that superconducting states with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry and nontrivial topology may be preferred in this system.</description>

      <title>Luther-Emery liquid and dominant singlet superconductivity in the hole-doped Haldane spin-1 chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the pairing tendencies in the hole-doped Haldane spin-1 chain. To allow for doping, we extend the original spin chain Hamiltonian into a fermionic model involving a two-orbital Hubbard chain at intermediate or strong repulsive interaction strengths $U$, and for degenerate orbitals. At half-filling and large $U$, the ferromagnetic Hund's coupling, $J_\mathrm{H}$, generates effective spin-$1$ moments, with antiferromagnetic correlations between sites. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations, we study accurately the system's behavior under light hole-doping. For $U=1.6$ in units of the non-interacting bandwidth and for $J_\mathrm{H}/U\gtrsim 0.275$ we find that singlet pairing dominates the long-distance physics, establishing this system as a promising platform for repulsively mediated superconductivity. We provide concrete examples of materials that could realize the physics described here. We also provide evidence that the system approaches a Luther-Emery liquid state at large system sizes, reminiscent of the behavior of doped one-orbital two-leg ladders at weak coupling, which also have superconducting tendencies. The numerically calculated central charge approaches one in the thermodynamic limit, indicating a single gapless mode as is expected for the Luther-Emery state. Exponents characterizing the power-law decays of singlet pair-pair and charge density-density correlations are determined, and found to approximately satisfy the Luther-Emery identity.</description>

      <title>Consistent combination of truncated-unity functional renormalization group and mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for combining efficiently the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TUFRG) and the mean-field theory. It follows a method of Wang, Eberlein and Metzner that uses only the two-particle irreducible part of the vertex as an input for the mean-field treatment. In the TUFRG, the neglect of fluctuation effects from other channels in the symmetry-broken regime is represented by applying the random phase approximation (RPA) in each individual channel, below the divergence scale. Then the Bethe-Salpeter equation for the four-point vertex is translated into the RPA matrix equations for the bosonic propagators that relates the singular and irreducible singular modes of the propagators. The universal symmetries for the irreducible singular modes are obtained from the antisymmetry of Grassmann variables. The mean-field equation based on these modes is derived by the saddle-point approximation in the framework of the path-integral formalism. By using our scheme, the power of the TUFRG, as an unbiased tool for identifying the many-body instabilities, could be elevated to a quantitative level, and its application would be extended to a quantitative analysis of the coexisting orders. As an illustration we employ this scheme to study the coexistence phase of the chiral superconductivity and the chiral spin-density wave, predicted near van Hove filling of the honeycomb lattice.</description>
