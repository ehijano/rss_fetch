      <title>High-Rate Quantized Matrix Multiplication: Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the problem of quantized matrix multiplication (MatMul), which has become crucial for the efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs). We consider two settings: 1) Generic MatMul, where both matrices must be quantized (weight+activation quantization); and 2) weight-only quantization, where the second matrix is only known through covariance matrix $\Sigma_X$ of its columns. For each setting, we first review the fundamental information-theoretic tradeoff between quantization rate and distortion (high-rate theory), and then analyze the performance of several popular quantization schemes, comparing them to these fundamental limits. Specifically, we discuss rate loss (compared to information theoretic optima) of absmax INT and floating-point (FP) quantization, for which we also derive remarkably accurate heuristic approximations. Weight-only quantization is related to the problem of weighted mean squared error (WMSE) source coding, whose classical (reverse) waterfilling solution dictates how one should distribute rate between coordinates of the vector. We show how waterfilling can be used to improve practical LLM quantization algorithms (GPTQ), which at present allocate rate equally. This new scheme (termed ``WaterSIC'') only uses scalar INT quantizers, but its high-rate performance is basis free (it depends only on the determinant of $\Sigma_X$ and, thus, unlike existing schemes, is immune to applying random rotations) and is within a multiplicative factor of $\frac{2\pi e}{12}$ (or 0.25 bit/entry) of the information-theoretic distortion limit (!). GPTQ's performance is affected by the choice of basis, but for a random rotation and actual $\Sigma_X$ from Llama-3-8B we find GPTQ to be within 0.1 bit (depending on the layer type) of WaterSIC, suggesting that GPTQ with random rotation is also near optimal (for high-rate quantization).</description>

      <title>Joint Uplink-Downlink Fronthaul Bit Allocation in Fronthaul-Limited Massive MU-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper optimizes the fronthaul bit allocation in massive multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems operating with limited-capacity fronthaul links. We consider an advanced antenna system (AAS) controlled by a centralized baseband unit (BBU). In the AAS, multiple antenna elements together with their radio units are integrated into a single unit. In this setup, a key challenge is allocating fronthaul bits between uplink channel state information (CSI) quantization and downlink precoding matrix quantization. We formulate the problem of maximizing the sum spectral efficiency (SE) for a given fronthaul capacity. We develop an SE expression for this scenario based on the hardening bound. We compute the expression in closed form for maximum ratio transmission, which reveals the relative impact of the two types of quantization distortion. We then formulate a bit split optimization problem and propose an algorithm that exactly solves it.
  Numerical results demonstrate how the relative importance of assigning bits to CSI and precoding varies depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Double-Cover-Based Analysis of the Bethe Permanent of Block-Structured Positive Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the permanent of a square matrix with non-negative entries. A tractable approximation is given by the so-called Bethe permanent that can be efficiently computed by running the sum-product algorithm on a suitable factor graph. While the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent is, in the worst case, upper and lower bounded by expressions that are exponentially far apart in the matrix size, in practice it is observed for many ensembles of matrices of interest that this ratio is strongly concentrated around some value that depends only on the matrix size. In this paper, for an ensemble of block-structured matrices where entries in a block take the same value, we numerically study the ratio of the permanent of a matrix to its Bethe permanent. It is observed that also for this ensemble the ratio is strongly concentrated around some value depending only on a few key parameters of the ensemble. We use graph-cover-based approaches to explain the reasons for this behavior and to quantify the observed value.</description>

      <title>Study of Robust Power Allocation for User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks, robust resource allocation is critical to ensure reliable system performance in the presence of channel uncertainties resulting from imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this work, we propose a robust power allocation method that formulates the power optimization problem into a least-squares framework, enhanced by Tikhonov regularization to mitigate the adverse effects of channel estimation errors. We integrate our approach with zero-forcing precoding, enabling a design that is both computationally efficient and resilient to CSI imperfections. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing non-robust techniques while benefiting from low computational overhead, making it well-suited for large-scale deployments under CSI uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A Model-Driven Lossless Compression Algorithm Resistant to Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the fundamental connection between next-symbol prediction and compression, modern predictive models, such as large language models (LLMs), can be combined with entropy coding to achieve compression rates that surpass those of standard compression algorithms. However, this approach relies on the assumption that the predictive model produces identical output distributions at both the encoder and decoder, since even small mismatches can cause the decoding to fail. This assumption often fails with complex predictive models, particularly those based on neural networks, a phenomenon referred to as non-determinism.
  In this work, we propose a new compression algorithm based on next-token prediction that is robust to arbitrarily large, but structured, prediction mismatches. We prove the correctness of the proposed scheme under a formal mismatch certification, characterize its theoretical performance, and validate it experimentally on real datasets. Our results demonstrate reliable operation within the certified mismatch regime while achieving compression ratios that exceed those of commonly used compression methods.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Fusion Platform for Joint Environment Sensing and Channel Sounding in Highly Dynamic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G system is evolving toward full-spectrum coverage,ultra-wide bandwidth, and high mobility, resulting in increasingly complex propagation environments. The deep integration of communication and sensing is widely recognized as a core 6G vision, underscoring the importance of comprehensive environment awareness. Accurate channel modeling forms the foundation of 6G system design and optimization, and channel sounders provide the essential empirical basis. However, existing channel sounders, although supporting wide bandwidth and large antenna arrays in selected bands, generally lack cross-band capability, struggle in dynamic scenarios, and provide limited environmental awareness. The absence of detailed environmental information restricts the development of environment-aware channel models. To address this gap, we propose a multi-modal sensing and channel sounding fusion platform that enables temporally and spatially synchronized acquisition of images, point clouds, geolocation information, and multi-band multi-antenna channel data. The modular architecture facilitates rapid deployment in diverse dynamic environments. The platform supports Sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands with up to 1 GHz bandwidth and 1 ns delay resolution, enabling multi-antenna measurements with a channel switching rate of 8 ms. Moreover, it achieves centimeter-level and 360{\deg} environmental sensing accuracy and meter-level positioning accuracy. Key performance metrics of the platform, including dynamic range, phase stability, delay resolution, and multimodal data synchronization, are validated through vehicle-to-infrastructure measurement campaign. The established platform supports environment-channel joint modeling, enabling analysis and optimization of channel models in dynamic 6G scenarios.</description>

      <title>On the Extension of Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication Schemes to the Grid Partition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider polynomial codes for private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM/SDMM). Existing codes for PDMM are either specialized for the outer product partitioning (OPP), or inner product partitioning (IPP), or are valid for the more general grid partitioning (GP). We design extension operations that can be applied to a large class of OPP code designs to extend them to the GP case. Applying them to existing codes improves upon the state-of-the-art for certain parameters. Additionally, we show that the GP schemes resulting from extension fulfill additional combinatorial constraints, potentially limiting their performance. We illustrate this point by presenting a new GP scheme that does not adhere to these constraints and outperforms the state-of-the-art for a range of parameters.</description>

      <title>Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading for Scalable Rydberg Atomic-MIMO Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems using Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers face significant scalability challenges in signal detection due to their nonlinear signal models. This letter proposes phase-rotated symbol spreading (PRSS), which transmits each symbol across two consecutive time slots with an optimal {\pi}/2 phase offset. PRSS enables reconstruction of an effective linear signal model while maintaining spectral efficiency and facilitating the use of conventional RF-MIMO detection algorithms. Simulation results demonstrate that PRSS achieves greater than 2.5 dB and 10 dB bit error rate improvements compared to current single-transmission methods when employing optimal exhaustive search and low-complexity sub-optimal detection methods, respectively.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Secure Aggregation in Decentralized Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the increasing demand for data security in decentralized federated learning (FL) and stochastic optimization, we formulate and investigate the problem of information-theoretic \emph{decentralized secure aggregation} (DSA). Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ interconnected users, each holding a private input, representing, for example, local model updates in FL, who aim to simultaneously compute the sum of all inputs while satisfying the security requirement that no user, even when colluding with up to $T$ others, learns anything beyond the intended sum. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one bit of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one bit to all other users, (ii) hold at least one bit of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key bits. Our result establishes the fundamental performance limits of DSA and offers insights into the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols for distributed learning systems.</description>

      <title>Secure Beamforming and Reflection Design for RIS-ISAC Systems under Collusion of Passive and Active Eavesdroppers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the physical-layer security for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is studied. There is an active eavesdropper (AE) as well as a passive eavesdropper (PE), and they cooperate each other. By joint base station beamforming and RIS reflection design, we aim to achieve the best secure data communications with guaranteed sensing performance. Mathematically, taking the constraints on sensing performance and transmission power in consideration, the system secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated with respect to transmitting beamforming, RIS reflection, and receiving beamforming. The formulated problem is non-convex and is decomposed to three subproblem by applying the alternating optimization scheme. For the decomposed subproblem, we utilize the quadratic penalty method and successive convex approximation (SCA) for the solution derivation. Thereafter, an iterative numerical algorithm, referred to as the joint beamforming and reflection design (JBRD) algorithm, is proposed. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Tail-Latency-Aware Federated Learning with Pinching Antenna: Latency, Participation, and Placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Straggler synchronization is a dominant wall-clock bottleneck in synchronous wireless federated learning (FL). Under non-IID data, however, aggressively sampling only fast clients may significantly slow convergence due to statistical heterogeneity. This paper studies PASS-enabled FL, where a radiating pinching antenna (PA) can be activated at an arbitrary position along a dielectric waveguide to reshape uplink latencies. We consider a joint optimization of PA placement and client participation to minimize the expected time-to-accuracy, coupling the exact expected maximum round latency via order statistics with a heterogeneity-aware convergence factor. We derive first-order optimality conditions that reveal an explicit tail-latency premium in the KKT recursion, quantifying how latency gaps are amplified by maximum-order-statistic synchronization. Under a latency-class structure, we obtain a within-class square-root sampling law and establish a two-class phase transition where slow-class participation collapses under an explicit heterogeneity-threshold condition as the per-round sample size grows. For PA placement, we prove a piecewise envelope-derivative characterization and provide an exact breakpoint-and-root candidate-enumeration procedure. Simulation results verify the theoretical findings and show that PASS enables more eligible participation, yielding higher wall-clock accuracy.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Message Passing Graph Neural Networks for Next-Generation Wireless Communications: Architectures, Use Cases, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are eminently suitable for wireless resource management, thanks to their scalability, but they still face computational challenges in large-scale, dense networks in classical computers. The integration of quantum computing with GNNs offers a promising pathway for enhancing computational efficiency because they reduce the model complexity. This is achieved by leveraging the quantum advantages of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs), while retaining the expressive power of GNNs. However, existing pure quantum message passing models remain constrained by the limited number of qubits, hence limiting the scalability of their application to the wireless systems. As a remedy, we conceive a Scalable Quantum Message Passing Graph Neural Network (SQM-GNN) relying on a quantum message passing architecture. To address the aforementioned scalability issue, we decompose the graph into subgraphs and apply a shared PQC to each local subgraph. Importantly, the model incorporates both node and edge features, facilitating the full representation of the underlying wireless graph structure. We demonstrate the efficiency of SQM GNN on a device-to-device (D2D) power control task, where it outperforms both classical GNNs and heuristic baselines. These results highlight SQM-GNN as a promising direction for future wireless network optimization.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued-Matrix Permanents: SPA-based Approximations and Double-Cover Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating the permanent of a complex-valued matrix is a fundamental problem with applications in Boson sampling and probabilistic inference. In this paper, we extend factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of non-negative-real-valued matrices that are based on running the sum-product algorithm (SPA) on standard normal factor graphs, to factor-graph-based methods for approximating the permanent of complex-valued matrices that are based on running the SPA on double-edge normal factor graphs.
  On the algorithmic side, we investigate the behavior of the SPA, in particular how the SPA fixed points change when transitioning from real-valued to complex-valued matrix ensembles. On the analytical side, we use graph covers to analyze the Bethe approximation of the permanent, i.e., the approximation of the permanent that is obtained with the help of the SPA.
  This combined algorithmic and analytical perspective provides new insight into the structure of Bethe approximations in complex-valued problems and clarifies when such approximations remain meaningful beyond the non-negative-real-valued settings.</description>

      <title>A Heterogeneous Massive MIMO Technique for Uniform Service in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional cellular networks struggle with poor quality of service (QoS) for cell-edge users, while cell-free (CF) systems offer uniform QoS but incur high roll-out costs due to acquiring numerous access point (AP) sites and deploying a large-scale optical fiber network to connect them. This paper proposes a cost-effective heterogeneous massive MIMO architecture that integrates centralized co-located antennas at a cell-center base station with distributed edge APs. By strategically splitting massive antennas between centralized and distributed nodes, the system maintains high user fairness comparable to CF systems but reduces infrastructure costs substantially, by minimizing the required number of AP sites and fronthaul connections. Numerical results demonstrate its superiority in balancing performance and costs compared to cellular and CF systems.</description>

To tackle spectrum scarcity, spectrum sharing is studied for a hybrid satellite-terrestrial network where satellite links share the same group of time-slotted sub-carriers with terrestrial links opportunistically. In particular, with coarse network-wide time synchronization, a time-scale-adaptable spectrum sharing framework is proposed based on a satellite-terrestrial cooperation time scale that can be flexibly adjusted according to practical requirements. For generality, it is assumed that both full and partial frequency reuse could be adopted among the base stations (BSs) and satellite selection is supported when multiple satellites are available. Relying on only statistical channel state information (CSI), joint link scheduling and power control are explored to maximize the average sum rate of the network while ensuring quality of service (QoS) for users. To solve the complicated mixed integer programming (MIP) problem, a low-complexity spectrum sharing scheme is presented based on link-feature-sketching-aided hierarchical link clustering and Monte-Carlo-and-successive-approximation-aided transmit power optimization. Simulation results demonstrate that by link feature sketching, diversity of the links brought by the spatial distribution of the users could be well utilized. The proposed scheme promises a significant performance gain even under strict inter-link interference constraints.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Message Size in PIR Under Arbitrary Collusion Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A private information retrieval protocol (PIR) scheme under an arbitrary collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$ enables a client to retrieve one message from a library of $K$ equal-sized messages duplicated in $N$ servers, while keeping the index of the desired message private from any colluding set in $\mathcal{P}$. Although achieving high rates typically requires sufficiently large message sizes, smaller message sizes also desirable due to reduced implementation complexity and fewer constraints. By characterizing the capacity-achieving schemes, Tian, Sun, and Chen (2019) showed that the optimal message size for uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under no-collusion setting is $N-1$. However, comparable results are not yet available for more general collusion settings.
  In this work, we present a complete characterization of the properties of capacity-achieving decomposable PIR schemes under arbitrary collusion patterns. Building on this characterization, we derive a general lower bound on the optimal message size for capacity-achieving uniformly decomposable PIR schemes under an arbitrary collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$, expressed in terms of the hitting number of a newly defined family of subsets of servers determined by the collusion pattern $\mathcal{P}$. Finally, we specialize the lower bound to several important classes of collusion patterns, including $T$-collusion, disjoint collections of colluding sets, cyclically $T$-contiguous collusion, and disjoint collections of cyclically contiguous colluding sets. For the last two collusion patterns, we present matching achievable schemes that attain the corresponding bounds, thereby providing a complete characterization of the optimal message size.</description>

      <title>Coding Schemes for Document Exchange under Multiple Substring Edits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the document exchange problem under multiple substring edits. A substring edit in a string $\mathbf{x}$ occurs when a substring $\mathbf{u}$ of $\mathbf{x}$ is replaced by an arbitrary string $\mathbf{v}$. The lengths of $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are bounded from above by a fixed constant. Let $\mathbf{x}$ and $\mathbf{y}$ be two binary strings that differ by multiple substring edits. The aim of document exchange schemes is to construct an encoding of $\mathbf{x}$ with small length such that $\mathbf{x}$ can be recovered using $\mathbf{y}$ and the encoding. We construct a low-complexity document exchange scheme with encoding length of $4t\log n+o(\log n)$ bits, where $n$ is the length of the string $\mathbf{x}$. The best known scheme achieves an encoding length of $4t \log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits, but at a much higher computational complexity. Then, we investigate the average length of valid encodings for document exchange schemes with uniform strings $\mathbf{x}$ and develop a scheme with an expected encoding length of $(4t-1) \log n+o(\log n)$ bits. In this setting, prior works have only constructed schemes for a single substring edit.</description>

      <title>Finite-Aperture Fluid Antenna Array Design: Analysis and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-aperture constraints render array design nontrivial and can undermine the effectiveness of classical sparse geometries. This letter provides universal guidance for fluid antenna array (FAA) design under a fixed aperture. We derive a closed-form Cram\'er--Rao bound (CRB) that unifies conventional and reconfigurable arrays by explicitly linking the Fisher information to the geometric variance of port locations. We further obtain a closed-form probability density function of the minimum spacing under random FAA placement, which yields a principled lower bound for the minimum-spacing constraint. Building upon these analytical insights, we then propose a gradient-based algorithm to optimize continuous port locations. Utilizing a simple gradient update design, the optimized FAA can achieve about a $30\%$ CRB reduction and a $42.5\%$ reduction in mean-squared error.</description>

      <title>Ribbons from Independence Structure: Hypercontractivity, $\Phi$-Mutual Information, and Matrix $\Phi$-Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hypercontractivity ribbon and the $\Phi$-ribbon for joint distributions that obey a given independence structure, obtaining tight bounds in some basic regimes. For general independence structures, modeled as a hypergraph whose hyperedges specify mutually independent subcollections of random variables, we provide an explicit inner bound on the $\Phi$-ribbon described by a simple convex hull of incidence vectors. We also provide a new multipartite generalization version and a $\Phi$-mutual information analogue of the Zhang--Yeung inequality, which implies nontrivial points in the hypercontractivity ribbon and the $\Phi$-ribbon respectively. Finally, we propose the matrix $\Phi$-ribbon based on matrix $\Phi$-entropy and establish the tensorization and data processing properties, together with the calculation of an exact matrix SDPI constant for the doubly symmetric binary source.</description>

      <title>Improvement of the Gilbert-Varshamov Bound for Linear Codes and Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gilbert--Varshamov (GV) bound is a central benchmark in coding theory, establishing existential guarantees for error-correcting codes and serving as a baseline for both Hamming and quantum fault-tolerant information processing. Despite decades of effort, improving the GV bound is notoriously difficult, and known improvements often rely on technically heavy arguments and do not extend naturally to the quantum setting due to additional self-orthogonality constraints.
  In this work we develop a concise probabilistic method that yields an improvement over the classical GV bound for $q$-ary linear codes. For relative distance $\delta=d/n&lt;1-1/q$, we show that an $[n,k,d]_q$ linear code exists whenever $\frac{q^{k}-1}{q-1}\;&lt;\;\frac{c_\delta \sqrt{n}\, q^{n}}{\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)}$, for positive constant $c_\delta$ depending only on $\delta$, where $\mathrm{Vol}_q(n,d-1)$ denotes the volume of a $q$-ary Hamming ball.
  We further adapt this approach to the quantum setting by analyzing symplectic self-orthogonal structures. For $\delta&lt;1-1/q^2$, we obtain an improved quantum GV bound: there exists a $q$-ary quantum code $[[n,\,n-k,\,d]]$ provided that $\frac{q^{2n-k}-1}{q-1}&lt;\frac{c_\delta \sqrt{n}\cdot q^{2n}}{\sum_{i=0}^{d-1}\binom{n}{i}(q^2-1)^i}$. In particular, our result improves the standard quantum GV bound by an $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ multiplicative factor.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rotation Diversity in Displaced Squeezed Binary Phase-Shift Keying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum rotation diversity (QRD) scheme for optical quantum communication using binary phase-shift-keying displaced squeezed states and homodyne detection over Gamma-Gamma turbulence channels. Consecutive temporal modes are coupled by a passive orthogonal rotation that redistributes the displacement amplitude between slots, yielding a diversity order of two under independent fading and joint maximum-likelihood detection. Analytical expressions for the symbol-error rate performance, along with asymptotic results for the diversity and coding gains, are derived. The optimal rotation angle and energy allocation between displacement and squeezing are obtained in closed form. Furthermore, we show that when both the displacement amplitude and the squeezing strength scale with the total photon number, an effective diversity order of four is achieved. Numerical results validate the analysis and demonstrate the super-diversity behaviour of the proposed QRD scheme.</description>

      <title>Balancing Privacy and Robustness in Coded Computing Under Profiled Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed computing with untrusted workers, the assignment of evaluation indices plays a critical role in determining both privacy and robustness. In this work, we study how the placement of unreliable workers within the Numerically Stable Lagrange Coded Computing (NS-LCC) framework influences privacy and the ability to localize Byzantine errors. We derive analytical bounds that quantify how different evaluation-index assignments affect privacy against colluding curious workers and robustness against Byzantine corruption under finite-precision arithmetic. Using these bounds, we formulate optimization problems that identify privacy-optimal and robustness-optimal index placements and show that the resulting assignments are fundamentally different. This exposes that index choices that maximizes privacy degrade error-localization, and vice versa. To jointly navigate this trade-off, we propose a low-complexity greedy assignment strategy that closely approximates the optimal balance between privacy and robustness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel indoor visible light positioning (VLP) system utilising one vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser installed at the ceiling centre of a space. The system offers three-dimensional localisation by sweeping through space at one-degree resolution in two dimensions (azimuth and elevation), significantly simplifying hardware. Through incorporating the angle of arrival and received signal strength, this system demonstrates excellent precision in indoor positioning. Simulation results verify that the system attains sub-centimetre precision for most test points, outperforming conventional multi-transmitter VLP schemes in cost-efficiency and simplicity.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Structured Estimators for Information Freshness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the contemporary literature on information freshness solely focuses on the analysis of freshness for martingale estimators, which simply use the most recently received update as the current estimate. While martingale estimators are easier to analyze, they are far from optimal, especially in pull-based update systems, where maximum aposteriori probability (MAP) estimators are known to be optimal, but are analytically challenging. In this work, we introduce a new class of estimators called $p$-MAP estimators, which enable us to model the MAP estimator as a piecewise constant function with finitely many stages, bringing us closer to a full characterization of the MAP estimators when modeling information freshness.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Task Clustering for Federated Cooperative Multi-Task Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication (SemCom) prioritizes task execution over accurate symbol reconstruction and is well-suited to emerging intelligent applications. Cooperative multi-task SemCom (CMT-SemCom) further improves task execution performance. However, [1] demonstrates that cooperative multi-tasking can be either constructive or destructive. Moreover, the existing CMT-SemCom framework is not directly applicable to distributed multi-user scenarios, such as non-terrestrial satellite networks, where each satellite employs an individual semantic encoder. In this paper, we extend our earlier CMT-SemCom framework to distributed settings by proposing a federated learning (FL) based CMT-SemCom that enables cooperative multi-tasking across distributed users. Moreover, to address performance degradation caused by negative information transfer among heterogeneous tasks, we propose a semantic-aware task clustering method integrated in the FL process to ensure constructive cooperation based on an information-theoretic approach. Unlike common clustering methods that rely on high-dimensional data or feature space similarity, our proposed approach operates in the low-dimensional semantic domain to identify meaningful task relationships. Simulation results based on a LEO satellite network setup demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and performance gain over unclustered FL and individual single-task SemCom.</description>

      <title>Winning Criteria for Open Games: A Game-Theoretic Approach to Prefix Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-player games with alternating moves played on infinite trees. Our main focus is on the case where the trees are full (regular) and the winning set is open (with respect to the product topology on the tree). Gale and Stewart showed that in this setting one of the players always has a winning strategy, though it is not known in advance which player. We present simple necessary conditions for the first player to have a winning strategy, and establish an equivalence between winning sets that guarantee a win for the first player and maximal prefix codes. Using this equivalence, we derive a necessary algebraic condition for winning, and exhibit a family of games for which this algebraic condition is in fact equivalent to winning. We introduce the concept of coverings, and show that by covering the graph with an infinite labeled tree corresponding to the free group, we can derive a simple trait of maximal prefix codes.</description>

      <title>Space-Air-Ground-Integrated Networks: The BER vs. Residual Delay and Doppler Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perfect Doppler compensation and synchronization is nontrivial due to multi-path Doppler effects and Einstein's theory of relativity in the space-air-ground-integrated networks (SAGINs). Hence, by considering the residual Doppler and the synchronization delay, this paper investigates the bit-error-rate (BER) performance attained under time-varying correlated Shadowed-Rician SAGIN channels. First, a practical SAGIN model is harnessed, encompassing correlated Shadowed-Rician channels, the Snell's law-based path loss, atmospheric absorption, the line-of-sight Doppler compensation, elliptical satellite orbits, and Einstein's theory of relativity. Then, a specific correlation coefficient between the pilot and data symbols is derived in the context of correlated Shadowed-Rician Channels. By exploiting this correlation coefficient, the channel distribution is mimicked by a bi-variate Gamma distribution. Then, a closed-form BER formula is derived under employing least-square channel estimation and equalization for 16-QAM. Our analytical results indicate for a 300-km-altitude LEO that 1) the period of realistic elliptical orbits is around 0.8 seconds longer than that of the idealized circular orbits; and 2) the relativistic delay is lower than 1 $\mu s$ over a full LEO pass (from rise to set). Our numerical results for the L bands quantify the effects of: 1) the residual Doppler; 2) atmospheric shadowing; 3) synchronization errors; and 4) pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>The hyperlink representation of entanglement and the inclusion-exclusion principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy (EE) of any bipartition of a pure state can be approximately expressed as a sum of entanglement links (ELs). In this work, we introduce their exact extension, i.e. the entanglement hyperlinks (EHLs), a type of generalized mutual informations defined through the inclusion-exclusion principle, each of which captures contributions to the multipartite entanglement that are not reducible to lower-order terms. We show that any EHL crossing a factorized partition must vanish, and that the EHLs between any set of blocks can be expressed as a sum of all the EHLs that join all of them. This last result allows us to provide an exact representation of the EE of any block of a pure state, from the sum of the EHLs which cross its boundary. In order to illustrate their rich structure, we discuss some explicit numerical examples using ground states of local Hamiltonians. The EHLs thus provide a remarkable tool to characterize multipartite entanglement in quantum information theory and quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Barren Plateaus in Variational Quantum Circuits using a Two-Step Least Squares Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms are a vital part of quantum computing. It is a blend of quantum and classical methods for tackling tough problems in machine learning, chemistry, and combinatorial optimization. Yet as these algorithms scale up, they cannot escape the barren-plateau phenomenon. As systems grow, gradients can vanish so quickly that training deep or randomly initialized circuits becomes nearly impossible. To overcome the barren plateau problem, we introduce a two-stage optimization framework. First comes the convex initialization stage. Here, we shape the quantum energy landscape, the Hilmaton landscape, into a smooth, low-energy basin. This step makes gradients easier to spot and keeps noise from derailing the process. Once we have gotten a stable gradient flow, we move to the second stage: nonconvex refinement. In this phase, we allow the algorithm to explore different energy minima, thereby making the model more expressive. Finally, we used our two-stage solution to perform quantum cryptanalysis of the quantum key distribution protocol (i.e., BB84) to determine the optimal cloning strategies. The simulation results showed that our proposed two-stage solution outperforms its random initialization counterpart.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Single-Antenna Atomic Beamforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging the quantum advantages of highly excited atoms, Rydberg atomic receivers (RAREs) represent a paradigm shift in radio wave detection, offering high sensitivity and broadband reception. However, existing studies largely model RAREs as isotropic point receivers and overlook the spatial variations of atomic quantum states within vapor cells, thus inaccurately characterizing their reception patterns. To address this issue, we present a theoretical analysis of the aforementioned spatial responses of a standard local-oscillator (LO)- dressed RARE. Our results reveal that increasing the vapor-cell length produces a receive beam aligned with the LO field, with a beamwidth inversely proportional to the cell length. This finding enables atomic beamforming to enhance received signal-to-noise ratio using only a single-antenna RARE. Furthermore, we derive the achievable beamforming gain by characterizing and balancing the fundamental tradeoff between the effects of increasing the vapor cell length and the exponential power decay of laser propagating through the cell. To overcome the limitation imposed by exponential decay, we propose a novel RARE architecture termed segmental vapor cell. This architecture consists of vapor-cell segments separated by clear-air gaps, allowing the total cell length (and hence propagation loss) to remain fixed while the effective cell length increases. As a result, this segmented design expands the effective atom-field interaction area without increasing the total vapor cell length, yielding a narrower beamwidth and thus higher beamforming gain as compared with a traditional continuous vapor cell.</description>

      <title>The First and Second-Order Asymptotics of Covert Communication over AWGN Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17924v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotics of the maximal throughput of communication over AWGN channels by $n$ channel uses under a covert constraint in terms of an upper bound $\delta$ of Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL divergence). It is shown that the first and second order asymptotics of the maximal throughput are $\sqrt{n\delta \log e}$ and $(2)^{1/2}(n\delta)^{1/4}(\log e)^{3/4}\cdot Q^{-1}(\epsilon)$, respectively. The technique we use in the achievability is quasi-$\varepsilon$-neighborhood notion from information geometry. For finite blocklength $n$, the generating distributions are chosen to be a family of truncated Gaussian distributions with decreasing variances. The law of decreasing is carefully designed so that it maximizes the throughput at the main channel in the asymptotic sense under the condition that the output distributions satisfy the covert constraint. For the converse, the optimality of Gaussian distribution for minimizing KL divergence under the second order moment constraint is extended from dimension $1$ to dimension $n$. Based on that, we establish an upper bound on the average power of the code to satisfy the covert constraint, which further leads to the direct converse bound in terms of covert metric.</description>

      <title>Communicate Less, Synthesize the Rest: Latency-aware Intent-based Generative Semantic Multicasting with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality, enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal into multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. To better utilize the wireless resources, the transmitter sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, namely non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate, to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users' reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantity called discrete layered entropy, which approximates the Shannon entropy within a logarithmic gap. Compared to the Shannon entropy, the discrete layered entropy is piecewise linear, approximates the expected length of the optimal one-to-one non-prefix code, and satisfies an elegant conditioning property. These properties make it useful for approximating the Shannon entropy in linear programming and maximum entropy problems, studying the optimal length of conditional encoding, and bounding the entropy of monotonic mixture distributions. In particular, it can give a bound $I(X;Y)+\log(I(X;Y)+3.4)+1$ for the strong functional representation lemma which is optimal within $2.8$ bits, and significantly improves upon the best known bound.</description>

      <title>Zak-Transform-Induced Optimal Sequences and Their Applications in OTFS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel finite Zak transform (FZT)-aided framework for constructing multiple zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) sequence sets with optimal correlation properties. Specifically, each sequence is perfect with zero auto-correlation sidelobes, each ZCZ sequence set meets the Tang-Fan-Matsufuji bound with equality, and the maximum inter-set cross-correlation of multiple sequence sets meets the Sarwate bound with equality. Our study shows that these sequences can be sparsely expressed in the Zak domain through properly selected index and phase matrices. Particularly, it is found that the maximum inter-set cross-correlation beats the Sarwate bound if every index matrix is a circular Florentine array. Several construction methods of multiple ZCZ sequence sets are proposed, demonstrating both the optimality and high flexibility. {Additionally, it is shown that excellent synchronization performance can be achieved by the proposed sequences in orthogonal-time-frequency-space (OTFS) systems.</description>

      <title>Secret Sharing Schemes from Correlated Random Variables and Rate-Limited Public Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dealer aims to share a secret with participants so that only predefined subsets can reconstruct it, while others learn nothing. The dealer and participants access correlated randomness and communicate over a one-way, public, rate-limited channel. For this problem, we propose the first explicit coding scheme able to handle arbitrary access structures and achieve the best known achievable rates, previously obtained non-constructively. Our construction relies on lossy source coding coupled with distribution approximation to handle the reliability constraints, followed by universal hashing to handle the security constraints. We stress that our coding scheme does not require symmetry or degradation assumptions on the correlated random variables, and does not need a pre-shared secret among the participants and dealer. As a by-product, our construction also yields explicit coding schemes for secret-key generation under one-way, rate-limited public communication that, unlike prior work, achieves the capacity for arbitrary source correlations and do not require a pre-shared secret to ensure strong secrecy.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces: From Model-Based Approaches to Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) offer a new solution for wireless communications by introducing morphological degrees of freedom, dynamically morphing their three-dimensional shape to ensure multipath signals interfere constructively. However, realizing the desired performance gains in FIM systems is critically dependent on acquiring accurate channel state information across a continuous and high-dimensional deformation space. Therefore, this paper investigates this fundamental channel estimation problem for FIM assisted millimeter-wave communication systems. First, we develop model-based frameworks that structure the problem as either function approximation using interpolation and kernel methods or as a sparse signal recovery problem that leverages the inherent angular sparsity of millimeter-wave channels. To further advance the estimation capability beyond explicit assumptions in model-based channel estimation frameworks, we propose a deep learning-based framework using a Fourier neural operator (FNO). By parameterizing a global convolution operator in the Fourier domain, we design an efficient FNO architecture to learn the continuous operator that maps FIM shapes to channel responses with mesh-independent properties. Furthermore, we exploit a hierarchical FNO (H-FNO) architecture to efficiently capture the multi-scale features across a hierarchy of spatial resolutions. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed H-FNO significantly outperforms the model-based benchmarks in estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency. In particular, the interpretability analysis show that the proposed H-FNO learns an anisotropic spatial filter adapted to the physical geometry of FIM and is capable of accurately reconstructing the non-linear channel response across the continuous deformation space.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-Aware Learning-to-Optimize in Wireless Communication Resource Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G wireless communication enables massive edge device access and supports real-time intelligent services such as the Internet of things (IoT) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X). However, the surge in edge devices connectivity renders wireless resource allocation (RA) tasks as large-scale constrained optimization problems, whereas the stringent real-time requirement poses significant computational challenge for traditional algorithms. To address the challenge, feasibility-aware learning-to-optimize (L2O) techniques have recently gained attention. These learning-based methods offer efficient alternatives to conventional solvers by directly learning mappings from system parameters to feasible and near-optimal solutions. This article provide a comprehensive review of L2O model designs and feasibility enforcement techniques and investigates the application of constrained L2O in wireless RA systems and. The paper also presents a case study to benchmark different L2O approaches in weighted sum rate problem, and concludes by identifying key challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation Driven Semantic NOMA for Image Transmission with Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a promising 6G enabler beyond conventional bit-level transmission, semantic communication can considerably reduce required bandwidth resources, while its combination with multiple access requires further exploration. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation-driven and diffusion-enhanced (KDD) semantic non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), named KDD-SemNOMA, for multi-user uplink wireless image transmission. Specifically, to ensure robust feature transmission across diverse transmission conditions, we firstly develop a ConvNeXt-based deep joint source and channel coding architecture with enhanced adaptive feature module. This module incorporates signal-to-noise ratio and channel state information to dynamically adapt to additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, to improve image restoration quality without inference overhead, we introduce a two-stage knowledge distillation strategy, i.e., a teacher model, trained on interference-free orthogonal transmission, guides a student model via feature affinity distillation and cross-head prediction distillation. Moreover, a diffusion model-based refinement stage leverages generative priors to transform initial SemNOMA outputs into high-fidelity images with enhanced perceptual quality. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ-256 datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, delivering satisfactory reconstruction performance even at extremely poor channel conditions. These results highlight the advantages in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual metrics, effectively mitigating interference and enabling high-quality image recovery.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Aided Bandwidth-Efficient Semantic Communication with Adaptive Requests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication focuses on conveying the task-relevant meaning rather than exact bitwise recovery. For image transmission with a generative receiver, relying only on text descriptions can be insufficient to preserve instance-specific visual evidence, whereas sending dense latent representations can incur substantial overhead. This paper presents a receiver-driven closed-loop scheme that transmits a short caption together with an initial sparse subset of latent blocks, and then uses feedback to request additional blocks only when needed. At each round, the receiver reconstructs the image via latent diffusion inpainting and applies a semantic consistency check between a caption generated from the reconstruction and the received caption, using a lightweight language similarity score such as ROUGE-L. The receiver stops early once a target consistency level is met, and otherwise requests a small number of additional latent blocks to refine the reconstruction. Experiments on Flickr30k over AWGN channels demonstrate a controllable rate-quality tradeoff. Adaptive feedback achieves the strongest semantic alignment and the lowest failure rate, outperforming budget-matched one-shot transmission while typically using fewer latent blocks than always-on retransmission.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm to Sample Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient algorithm to sample random sparse matrices to be used as check matrices for quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\mathbf H\in\mathbb F_2^{r\times n}$ such that $\mathbf H\mathbf H^\top = \mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.
  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.
  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Airy Beamforming for Radiative Near-Field MU-XL-MIMO: Overcoming Half-Space Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The move to next-generation wireless communications with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) brings the communications into the radiative near-field (RNF) region, where distance-aware focusing is feasible. However, high-frequency RNF links are highly vulnerable to blockage in indoor environments dominated by half-space obstacles (walls, corners) that create knife-edge shadows. Conventional near-field focused beams offer high gain in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios but suffer from severe energy truncation and effective-rank collapse in shadowed regions, often necessitating the deployment of auxiliary hardware such as Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) to restore connectivity. We propose a beamforming strategy that exploits the auto-bending property of Airy beams to mitigate half-space blockage without additional hardware. The Airy beam is designed to ``ride'' the diffraction edge, accelerating its main lobe into the shadow to restore connectivity. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a Green's function-based RNF multi-user channel model that analytically reveals singular-value collapse behind knife-edge obstacles; (ii) an Airy analog beamforming scheme that optimizes the bending trajectory to recover the effective channel rank; and (iii) an Airy null-steering method that aligns oscillatory nulls with bright-region users to suppress interference in mixed shadow/bright scenarios. Simulations show that the proposed edge-riding Airy strategy achieves a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) improvement of over 20 dB and restores full-rank connectivity in shadowed links compared to conventional RNF focusing, virtually eliminating outage in geometric shadows and increasing multi-user spectral efficiency by approximately 35\% under typical indoor ELAA configurations. These results demonstrate robust RNF multi-user access in half-space blockage scenarios without relying on RIS.</description>

The existence of Radon Nikodym derivates appear in many text books in measure theory but in text books on probability or information theory it is often omitted because the proof is often considered to be too difficult.</description>

      <title>A New Construction Structure on Multi-access Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Cyclic Multi-Access Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the $(K,L,M,N)$ multi-access coded caching system introduced by Hachem et al., which consists of a central server with $N$ files and $K$ cache nodes, each of memory size $M$, where each user can access $L$ cache nodes in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that our scheme achieves lower transmission loads than some existing schemes with linear subpacketization. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieves lower transmission load compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization in some case.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-Code Channel Transforms Beyond Repetition Codes for Improved Hashing Bounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum hashing bound guarantees that rates up to $1-H(p_I, p_X, p_Y, p_Z)$ are achievable for memoryless Pauli channels, but it is not generally tight. A known way to improve achievable rates for certain asymmetric Pauli channels is to apply a small inner stabilizer code to a few channel uses, decode, and treat the resulting logical noise as an induced Pauli channel; reapplying the hashing argument to this induced channel can beat the baseline hashing bound. We generalize this induced-channel viewpoint to arbitrary stabilizer codes used purely as channel transforms. Given any $ [\![ n, k ]\!] $ stabilizer generator set, we construct a full symplectic tableau, compute the induced joint distribution of logical Pauli errors and syndromes under the physical Pauli channel, and obtain an achievable rate via a hashing bound with decoder side information. We perform a structured search over small transforms and report instances that improve the baseline hashing bound for a family of Pauli channels with skewed and independent errors studied in prior work.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Beam Alignment using Noisy Twenty Questions Estimation with Trained Questioner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 6G communication systems use mmWave and MIMO technologies to achieve wide bandwidth and high throughout, leading to indispensable need for beam alignment to overcome severe signal attenuation. Traditional sector-search-based beam alignment algorithms rely on sequential sampling to identify the best sector, resulting in a significant latency burden on 6G communication systems. Recently proposed adaptive beam alignment algorithms based on the active learning framework address the problem, aiming to identify the optimal sector with the fewest possible samples under an identical sector partition. Nevertheless, these algorithms either lack feasibility (Chiu, Ronquillo and Javidi, JSAC 2019) due to ideal assumptions or lack interpretability (Sohrabi, Chen and Yu, JSAC 2021) due to the use of end-to-end black-box neural networks. To avoid ideal assumptions and maintain interpretability, we address all above problems by proposing an adaptive beam alignment algorithm using the framework of noisy twenty questions estimation with a trained questioner. Specifically, we use two methods for training the questioner to eliminate reliance on ideal assumptions. The first method maps queries of twenty questions estimation to beamforming vectors via weighted summation of steering vectors, as an initial attempt to address the feasibility problem encountered in prior pioneering study by Chiu, Ronquillo and Javidi (JSAC 2019). The second method uses multi-layer fully connected neural networks to achieve improved performance while only employing them to train the questioner, which can effectively mitigate the interpretability issues in prior study by Sohrabi, Chen and Yu (JSAC 2021). Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed adaptive beam alignment algorithms and demonstrate that our algorithms outperform all benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>The computational inevitability of life: self-replication under resource-bounded nested algorithmic probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.09646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent computational experiments have demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of self-replicating programs across universal automata, artificial chemistries, and self-modifying code systems. Remarkably, these results arise without explicit fitness functions, reward shaping, or predefined objectives, indicating a gap in our formal understanding of the underlying computational process.
  In this work, we argue that self-replication is computationally inevitable under resource-bounded automata. Building on algorithmic information theory, we show that when universal inductive bias is applied under finite constraints of time, memory, and description length, programs that construct descriptions of themselves, i.e., quines, emerge as stable fixed points of nested algorithmic probability. We formalize this argument and demonstrate that self-replicating programs act as attractors in program space, independent of external optimization criteria. Thus, resource bounds transform universal induction into a competitive ecological process over programs, in which self-constructing programs dominate by stabilizing their own measure under resampling.
  We reinterpret recent results from computational life experiments and self-improving artificial agents as empirical realizations of this theoretical principle. More broadly, we propose that life is the simplest persistent structure available to constrained computation. A living system remembers itself because doing so is algorithmically and thermodynamically unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmit and Pinching Beamforming for Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS): Optimization-Based or Learning-Based?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS)-enabled downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) framework is proposed. PASS consists of multiple waveguides spanning over thousands of wavelength, which equip numerous low-cost dielectric particles, named pinching antennas (PAs), to radiate signals into free space. The positions of PAs can be reconfigured to change both the large-scale path losses and phases of signals, thus facilitating the novel pinching beamforming design. A sum rate maximization problem is formulated, which jointly optimizes the transmit and pinching beamforming to adaptively achieve constructive signal enhancement and destructive interference mitigation. To solve this highly coupled and nonconvex problem, both optimization-based and learning-based methods are proposed. 1) For the optimization-based method, a majorization-minimization and penalty dual decomposition (MM-PDD) algorithm is developed, which handles the nonconvex complex exponential component using a Lipschitz surrogate function and then invokes PDD for problem decoupling. 2) For the learning-based method, a novel Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-guided dual learning (KDL) approach is proposed, which enables KKT solutions to be reconstructed in a data-driven manner by learning dual variables. Following this idea, a KDL-Transformer algorithm is developed, which captures both inter-PA/inter-user dependencies and channel-state-information (CSI)-beamforming dependencies by attention mechanisms. Simulation results demonstrate that: i) The proposed PASS framework significantly outperforms conventional massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system even with a few PAs. ii) The proposed KDL-Transformer can improve over 20% system performance than MM-PDD algorithm, while achieving a millisecond-level response on modern GPUs.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret Bounds for Linear Bandits with Heavy-Tailed Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic linear bandits with heavy-tailed rewards, where the rewards have a finite $(1+\epsilon)$-absolute central moment bounded by $\upsilon$ for some $\epsilon \in (0,1]$. We improve both upper and lower bounds on the minimax regret compared to prior work. When $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$, the best prior known regret upper bound is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$. While a lower with the same scaling has been given, it relies on a construction using $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(d)$, and adapting the construction to the bounded-moment regime with $\upsilon = \mathcal{O}(1)$ yields only a $\Omega(d^{\frac{\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$ lower bound. This matches the known rate for multi-armed bandits and is generally loose for linear bandits, in particular being $\sqrt{d}$ below the optimal rate in the finite-variance case ($\epsilon = 1$). We propose a new elimination-based algorithm guided by experimental design, which achieves regret $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\frac{1+3\epsilon}{2(1+\epsilon)}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, thus improving the dependence on $d$ for all $\epsilon \in (0,1)$ and recovering a known optimal result for $\epsilon = 1$. We also establish a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{\frac{2\epsilon}{1+\epsilon}} T^{\frac{1}{1+\epsilon}})$, which strictly improves upon the multi-armed bandit rate and highlights the hardness of heavy-tailed linear bandit problems. For finite action sets, we derive similarly improved upper and lower bounds for regret. Finally, we provide action set dependent regret upper bounds showing that for some geometries, such as $l_p$-norm balls for $p \le 1 + \epsilon$, we can further reduce the dependence on $d$, and we can handle infinite-dimensional settings via the kernel trick, in particular establishing new regret bounds for the Mat\'ern kernel that are the first to be sublinear for all $\epsilon \in (0, 1]$.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Cooperative Multi-Tasking over Rate-Limited Wireless Channels with Implicit Optimal Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we expand the cooperative multi-task semantic communication framework (CMT-SemCom) introduced in [1], which divides the semantic encoder on the transmitter side into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs), to a more applicable design. Our proposed system model addresses real-world constraints by introducing a general design that operates over rate-limited wireless channels. Further, we aim to tackle the rate-limit constraint, represented through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, by employing the density ratio trick alongside the implicit optimal prior method (IoPm). By applying the IoPm to our multi-task processing framework, we propose a hybrid learning approach that combines deep neural networks with kernelized-parametric machine learning methods, enabling a robust solution for the CMT-SemCom. Our framework is grounded in information-theoretic principles and employs variational approximations to bridge theoretical foundations with practical implementations. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed system's effectiveness in rate-constrained multi-task SemCom scenarios, highlighting its potential for enabling intelligence in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Distillation-Enabled Knowledge Alignment for Generative Semantic Communications of AIGC Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated images, its provisioning to edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks. Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent representations, instead of high-dimensional image data. However, GSC relies on the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the image generation knowledge from the cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and condition-aware low-rank adaptation (CALA). For MAKD, an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, while CALA enables efficient adaptation to diverse rate requirements and channel conditions. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the consistency between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44% and enahnces the average transmission quality in terms of PSNR by 6.5 dB over the baselines without knowledge alignment.</description>

      <title>Tackling Federated Unlearning as a Parameter Estimation Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models. This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario, our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.</description>

      <title>Burau representation, Squier's form, and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a frequency-tunable, two-dimensional non-Abelian control of operation order constructed from the reduced Burau representation of the braid group $B_3$, specialised at $t=e^{i\omega}$ and unitarized by Squier's Hermitian form. Coupled to two non-commuting qubit unitaries $A$, $B$, the resulting switch admits a closed expression for the single-shot Helstrom success probability and a fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}$, defining the fixed-order ceiling $p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and the witness gaps $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{switch}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$ and $\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)=p_{\mathrm{test}}(\omega)-p_{\mathrm{fixed}}^*$.
  The non-Abelian mixers can either enhance or suppress the bare switch advantage, which we quantify by the interference contrast $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega):=\Delta_{\rm test}(\omega)-\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)=p_{\rm test}(\omega)-p_{\rm switch}(\omega)$. Across the Squier positivity region, $\Delta_{\rm int}(\omega)$ takes both positive (constructive) and negative (destructive) values, a hallmark of matrix-valued (non-Abelian) order control, while $\Delta_{\rm sw}(\omega)&gt;0$ certifies algebraic causal non-separability.
  Numerical simulations confirm both enhancement and suppression regimes, establishing a minimal $B_3$ braid control that reproduces the characteristic interference pattern expected from a \emph{Gedankenexperiment} in anyonic statistics.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Limits of LLMs at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have benefited enormously from scaling, yet these gains are bounded by five fundamental limitations: (1) hallucination, (2) context compression, (3) reasoning degradation, (4) retrieval fragility, and (5) multimodal misalignment. While existing surveys describe these phenomena empirically, they lack a rigorous theoretical synthesis connecting them to the foundational limits of computation, information, and learning. This work closes that gap by presenting a unified, proof-informed framework that formalizes the innate theoretical ceilings of LLM scaling. First, computability and uncomputability imply an irreducible residue of error: for any computably enumerable model family, diagonalization guarantees inputs on which some model must fail, and undecidable queries (e.g., halting-style tasks) induce infinite failure sets for all computable predictors. Second, information-theoretic and statistical constraints bound attainable accuracy even on decidable tasks, finite description length enforces compression error, and long-tail factual knowledge requires prohibitive sample complexity. Third, geometric and computational effects compress long contexts far below their nominal size due to positional under-training, encoding attenuation, and softmax crowding. We further show how likelihood-based training favors pattern completion over inference, how retrieval under token limits suffers from semantic drift and coupling noise, and how multimodal scaling inherits shallow cross-modal alignment. Across sections, we pair theorems and empirical evidence to outline where scaling helps, where it saturates, and where it cannot progress, providing both theoretical foundations and practical mitigation paths like bounded-oracle retrieval, positional curricula, and sparse or hierarchical attention.</description>

      <title>Surprisal and Metaphor Novelty Judgments: Moderate Correlations and Divergent Scaling Effects Revealed by Corpus-Based and Synthetic Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Novel metaphor comprehension involves complex semantic processes and linguistic creativity, making it an interesting task for studying language models (LMs). This study investigates whether surprisal, a probabilistic measure of predictability in LMs, correlates with annotations of metaphor novelty in different datasets. We analyse the surprisal of metaphoric words in corpus-based and synthetic metaphor datasets using 16 causal LM variants. We propose a cloze-style surprisal method that conditions on full-sentence context. Results show that LM surprisal yields significant moderate correlations with scores/labels of metaphor novelty. We further identify divergent scaling patterns: on corpus-based data, correlation strength decreases with model size (inverse scaling effect), whereas on synthetic data it increases (quality-power hypothesis). We conclude that while surprisal can partially account for annotations of metaphor novelty, it remains limited as a metric of linguistic creativity.
