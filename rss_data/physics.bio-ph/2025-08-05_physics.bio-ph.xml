      <title>Frequency-Domain Denoising-Based in Vivo Fluorescence Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 900-1,880 nm) has been pivotal in advancing in vivo fluorescence imaging due to its superior penetration depth and contrast. Yet, its clinical utility remains limited by insufficient imaging temporal-spatial resolution and the absence of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved NIR-II contrast agents. This work presents a frequency-domain denoising (FDD)-based in vivo fluorescence imaging technique, which can improve signal-to-background ratio (SBR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by more than 2,500-fold and 300-fold, respectively. The great enhancement yields a doubled penetration depth and a 95% reduction in contrast agent dosage or excitation light intensity for mouse vascular imaging. Additionally, we achieved a SBR far exceeded the Rose criterion in the observation of tumor margins and vessels in mice using Indocyanine Green (ICG), demonstrating the feasibility of NIR-II surgical navigation with FDA-approved agents. Furthermore, a 600 Hz real-time video enables visualization of the entire contrast agent diffusion process within the mouse body and differentiation between arteries and veins. This innovative technique, characterized by exceptional sensitivity, efficiency, and robustness, presents a promising solution for clinical applications, particularly in NIR-II surgical navigation.</description>

      <title>Neural subspaces, minimax entropy, and mean-field theory for networks of neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in experimental techniques enable the simultaneous recording of activity from thousands of neurons in the brain, presenting both an opportunity and a challenge: to build meaningful, scalable models of large neural populations. Correlations in the brain are typically weak but widespread, suggesting that a mean-field approach might be effective in describing real neural populations, and we explore a hierarchy of maximum entropy models guided by this idea. We begin with models that match only the mean and variance of the total population activity, and extend to models that match the experimentally observed mean and variance of activity along multiple projections of the neural state. Confronted by data from several different brain regions, these models are driven toward a first-order phase transition, characterized by the presence of two nearly degenerate minima in the energy landscape, and this leads to predictions in qualitative disagreement with other features of the data. To resolve this problem we introduce a novel class of models that constrain the full probability distribution of activity along selected projections. We develop the mean-field theory for this class of models and apply it to recordings from 1000+ neurons in the mouse hippocampus. This 'distributional mean--field' model provides an accurate and consistent description of the data, offering a scalable and principled approach to modeling complex neural population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Measuring the entropy of a neuron cell from its membrane current signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate how the entropy of a neuron cell can be measured using membrane ion current signals, which were recorded from neurons in the mouse medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The sample entropy and the Scalogram entropy were used as entropy measurement methods. It is well known that the entropy increases in the direction of the movement of the system towards the equilibrium. Therefore, in the process of the electrical activity of a living cell, the entropy is expected to reach a maximum at the moment when the membrane potential reaches the 'Nernst equilibrium potential' (or ionic equilibrium) of the ions. However, it was observed that the entropy values obtained by traditional calculations did not reach the peak at the equilibrium state of the ions. Therefore, two modifications to these measurement methods were proposed to adjust the entropy value to the maximum at the equilibrium potential of the ions. As a result of these proposed modifications, the entropy values were observed to peak around the equilibrium potential of the ions. These refined approaches were successfully validated using the Logistic map. Additionally, the entropy results were compared with Lyapunov exponents. The results show that the behaviour of living cells can be analysed using entropy measurements. The results also suggest that the method could be used to detect differences in the behaviour of tumour and normal cells, or the effects of drugs on cells.</description>

      <title>Substrate stiffness governs dynamics and self-organization of nascent biofilms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolutionary success of bacteria lies in their ability to form complex surface-associated communities in diverse biophysical settings. However, it remains poorly understood how compliance of soft surfaces, measured in terms of their elastic deformability, impacts the dynamics and self-organization of bacterial cells proliferating into colonies. Using experiments and biomechanical modelling, here we study the expansion and self-organization of bacterial cells into sessile colonies on soft substrates. The dynamics and spatiotemporal structures were captured by visualising growing bacterial colonies on nutrient-rich, soft agarose pads, with elastic modulus in the range ~0.3 kPA to ~100 kPA by varying the concentration of the agarose in the underlying substrate. Our results show that, at the scale of the colonies, significant differences emerge in the spreading dynamics and colony geometry as the substrate stiffness is altered: softer substrates promote distinct, multilayered colony structures, and as revealed by fractal analysis of the colony boundaries, they exhibit higher boundary roughness. In contrast, colonies growing on harder substrates first grow up to large monolayers, before undergoing the mono-to-multilayer transition (MTMT), showing nearly 300% increase in the overall colony area at MTMT. A simple biomechanical model captures the role of effective drag forces at different scales, acting on the colonies as they spread on substrates with different stiffness: higher drag in soft substrates drive early verticalisation of the colonies, while lower effective drag delays the MTMT, resulting in larger colony areas. Based on the results and biomechanical insights, a comprehensive data-backed numerical model is currently being developed. Our findings highlight the role of surface stiffness in determining the self-organization of bacterial cells into an expanding multi-scale colony.</description>

      <title>Correlated cell movements drive epithelial finger formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelia form protective barriers in multicellular organisms. To maintain homeostasis, they must be able to regenerate and heal damaged areas. This occurs through collective cell migration, during which finger-like protrusions commonly appear. Whether these protrusions are driven by specialised leader cells, biochemical cues, or generic physical interactions remains unclear. Integrating in vitro imaging, agent-based simulations, and continuum modelling, we show that correlated active cell motion alone suffices to produce fingers. Leader cells, signalling, and proliferation modulate, but do not trigger, this pattern. Our results show that the key mechanism underlying a complex biological process can be understood using a general framework of the physics of dense active matter.</description>

      <title>Patterns of imbalance states between sub-brain regimes during development in the resting state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The functional brain network is the result of neurons and different areas working together in a coordinated manner. The findings indicate that the spatial distribution of anticorrelations in the brain network is not inherent. In this study, using Heider balance theory, we examine the network of imbalanced triangles with negative links in the brain, which undergoes dynamic changes across development. By analyzing the age-related transformations in the connectivity of imbalanced triangles at the level of brain subnetworks. We show that anticorrelations evolve from childhood to adulthood, reflecting a developmental trajectory from a locally modular organization in childhood, through a flexible and reconfigurable architecture during adolescence, to a highly segregated and functionally specialized network system in adulthood. This mature configuration supports a balance between internally directed cognition and external task demands, enabling efficient and adaptive cognitive control. Specifically, in childhood, prominent anticorrelations were observed between the default mode network (DMN) and the dorsal attention network (DAN), as well as between the default mode network (DMN) and the ventral attention network (VAN). During adolescence, these anticorrelations persisted but became weaker. By adulthood, dominant anticorrelations were observed between the DMN and both the DAN and the frontoparietal network (FPN).</description>

      <title>RinQ: Predicting central sites in proteins on current quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce RinQ, a hybrid quantum-classical framework for identifying functionally critical residues in proteins, utilizing techniques in quantum optimization. To that end, protein structures are modeled as residue interaction networks (RINs), and the centrality detection task is cast as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. Solved using D-Wave's simulated annealing, this approach is applied to a diverse set of proteins, including small peptides and biologically significant regulatory proteins. RinQ consistently finds residues that align with classical centrality benchmarks, underscoring the accuracy and reliability of the approach. This work highlights the promise of near-term quantum and quantum-inspired methods for advancing protein network analysis and lays the groundwork for future extensions to larger systems using real quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Molecular Structure of Lipid Nanoparticles through in-silico Self-Assembly for Rational Delivery Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a leading platform in the delivery of RNA-based therapeutics, playing a pivotal role in the clinical success of mRNA vaccines and other nucleic acid drugs. Their performance in RNA encapsulation and delivery is critically governed by the molecular structure of ionizable lipids and the overall formulation composition. However, mechanistic insight into how these factors govern LNP architecture and function remains limited, primarily owing to the challenges of capturing nanoscale assembly and organization using experimental techniques. Here, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to systematically investigate how ionizable lipid chemistry influences LNP self-assembly, internal organization, and surface properties. We further explore the effects of formulation ratios and pH-dependent deprotonation on both the internal structure and surface morphology of LNPs. Leveraging these insights, we demonstrate how in silico structural characteristics can inform the rational design of novel ionizable lipids and optimization of formulation ratios, supported with experimental validations. Our findings offer a molecular-level understanding of LNP assembly dynamics and architecture, thereby establishing a computational framework linking lipid chemistry and LNP formulation to the structure and performance of LNP, to advance the rational design of novel LNP delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Sub-surface Skin Deformation in Response to Gentle Brushing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even simple tactile stimuli can lead to remarkably different perceptions among individuals, both in intensity and pleasantness. To understand the physical factors behind this variation, it is important to investigate how mechanical events are transmitted through the skin. In this study, we visualize the internal skin strains in response to soft brushing stimuli using functional Optical Coherence Tomography (fOCT), which provides depth-resolved time-series data of the displacement of the skin. Driven with custom-made software, the system enabled sub-surface imaging at a refresh rate of 10 kHz. Brushing was applied to the back of the hand, and skin displacement was observed at different depths. The results show that each skin layer responds differently to the stimulus, suggesting that internal skin dynamics play a role in tactile perception. This method offers a way to investigate how mechanical events within the skin relate to sensory function.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method for lipid membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian finite element method and numerical implementation for curved and deforming lipid membranes is presented here. The membrane surface is endowed with a mesh whose in-plane motion need not depend on the in-plane flow of lipids. Instead, in-plane mesh dynamics can be specified arbitrarily. A new class of mesh motions is introduced, where the mesh velocity satisfies the dynamical equations of a user-specified two-dimensional material. A Lagrange multiplier constrains the out-of-plane membrane and mesh velocities to be equal, such that the mesh and material always overlap. An associated numerical inf--sup instability ensues, and is removed by adapting established techniques in the finite element analysis of fluids. In our implementation, the aforementioned Lagrange multiplier is projected onto a discontinuous space of piecewise linear functions. The new mesh motion is compared to established Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations by investigating a preeminent numerical benchmark of biological significance: the pulling of a membrane tether from a flat patch, and its subsequent lateral translation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flows of tissues of epithelial cells often involve T1 transitions. These neighbour exchanges are irreversible rearrangements crossing an energy barrier. Here, by an exact geometric construction, I determine this energy barrier for general, isolated T1 transitions dominated by line tensions. I~show how deviations from regular cell packing reduce this energy barrier, but find that line tension fluctuations increase it on average. By another exact construction, I prove that the nonlinear tensions in vertex models of tissues also resist T1 transitions. My results thus form the basis for coarse-grained understanding of cell neighbour exchanges for continuum descriptions of epithelia.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Modeling of Antibody Kinetics Post Infection and Vaccination: A Markov Chain Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10793v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of antibody levels is crucial for characterizing the time-dependent response to immune events: either infections or vaccinations. The sequence and timing of these events significantly influence antibody level changes. Despite extensive interest in the topic in the recent years and many experimental studies, the effect of immune event sequences on antibody levels is not well understood. Moreover, disease or vaccination prevalence in the population are time-dependent. This, alongside the complexities of personal antibody kinetics, makes it difficult to analyze a sample immune measurement from a population. As a solution, we design a rigorous mathematical characterization in terms of a time-inhomogeneous Markov chain model for event-to-event transitions coupled with a probabilistic framework for the post-event antibody kinetics of multiple immune events. We demonstrate that this is an ideal model for immune event sequences, referred to as personal trajectories. This novel modeling framework surpasses the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) characterizations by rigorously tracking the probability distribution of population antibody response across time. To illustrate our ideas, we apply our mathematical framework to longitudinal severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) data from individuals with multiple documented infection and vaccination events. Our work is an important step towards a comprehensive understanding of antibody kinetics that could lead to an effective way to analyze the protective power of natural immunity or vaccination, predict missed immune events at an individual level, and inform booster timing recommendations.</description>
