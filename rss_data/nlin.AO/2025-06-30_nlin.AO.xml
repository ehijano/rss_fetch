      <title>Walking Through Complex Spatial Patterns of Climate and Conflict-Induced Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather events are projected to intensify global migration, increase resource competition, and amplify socio-spatial phenomena, including intergroup conflicts, socioeconomic inequalities, and unplanned displacements, among others. Addressing these challenges requires consolidating heterogeneous data to identify, estimate, and predict the dynamical process behind climate-induced movements. We propose a novel hybrid approach to reconstruct hazard-induced displacements by analysing the statistical properties of stochastic walks that explore the spatial network constructed from real movements. The likely trajectories produced by the walker inform the typical journey experienced by individuals, helping identify likely hazards encountered when fleeing high-risk areas. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to Somalia's detailed displacement tracking matrix, containing 20,220 movements dating from February 8th to June 18th, 2025. We reconstruct the likely routes that displaced persons could have taken when fleeing areas affected by conflict or climate hazards. We find that individuals using the most likely paths based on current flows would experience mainly droughts and conflicts, while the latter become less prominent at every next step. We also find that the probability of conflict and drought across all trajectories is widely dispersed, meaning that there is no typical exposure. This work provides an understanding of the mechanisms underlying displacement patterns and a framework for estimating future movements from areas expected to face increasing hazards. We also provide avenues to develop tools that can support policymakers implementing proactive responses and early interventions.</description>

      <title>Collective oscillations in the finite-size Kuramoto model below the critical coupling: shot-noise approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model, a paradigmatic framework for studying synchronization, exhibits a transition to collective oscillations only above a critical coupling strength in the thermodynamic limit. However, real-world systems are finite, and their dynamics can deviate significantly from mean-field predictions. Here, we investigate finite-size effects in the Kuramoto model below the critical coupling, where the infinite-size theory predicts complete asynchrony. Using a shot-noise approach, we derive analytically the power spectrum of emergent collective oscillations and demonstrate their dependence on the coupling strength. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical results, though deviations arise near the critical coupling due to nonlinear effects. Our findings reveal how finite-size fluctuations sustain synchronization in regimes where classical mean-field theories fail, offering insights for applications in neural networks, power grids, and other coupled oscillator systems.</description>
