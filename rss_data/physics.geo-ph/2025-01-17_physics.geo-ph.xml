      <title>Use of Ground Penetrating Radar to Map the Tree Roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tree roots can support and transmit nutrients for trees healthy growth aboveground, which greatly improve trees productivity and have significant effect on maintaining the normal operation of ecosystem. In order to map the tree roots more efficiently and effectively, the nondestructive ground penetrating radar is introduced into this area. The construction of tree roots model mainly conducted by the profile matrix which stored electromagnetic parameters of tree roots, ground penetrating radar set the normalized first derivative Blackman-Harris window function as the source pulse. Two-way travel time, the electromagnetic pulses arriving at root zone and then reflected back to the receive antenna, which can be calculated by two-dimensional Finite-Difference Time-Domain. Finally synthesized the common-offset reflection data that extracted from the output multi-offset data cube as radargrams which contain the information about buried tree roots. The results turned out that through interaction between electromagnetic pulse and underground anomalies, the distribution information related subsurface buried tree roots can be observed accurately from radargrams, in addition to the intermediate section shielded by tree roots barrier, the dipping boundary between clay layer and bedrock layer is clear enough to be noticed. With the increase of radar frequency, the electromagnetic pulse meet severe attenuation accompanied by the detection depth decrease, thus the texture in radargram gradually blurred. These relatively accurate roots outline, calculated by numerical simulation, showed that the application of ground penetrating radar in tree roots detection can significantly improve resolution of roots which stretched in the vertical direction.</description>

      <title>Observational evidence of anisotropic changes apparent resistivity before strong earthquakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a method based on normalized monthly variation rate, we studied resistivity data of seven observation stations before the events in the epicenter areas of two strong earthquakes. The relationship between variation of anisotropic apparent resistivity and the azimuth of the maximum principal stress is analyzed. The study shows that significant apparent resistivity variation occurs in the direction that is perpendicular to the azimuth of the maximum principal stress while only small fluctuation are recorded in the direction of the maximum principal stress. We surmise that the variation of anisotropic resistivity occurs in the late stage of the development of a strong earthquake, which can be observed in the epicenter area. If the density of the observation stations is increased and the direction of the observed resistivity is right, the epicenter of an earthquake location may be estimated by the observed resistivity anomaly.</description>
