      <title>Bathing in a sea of candidate quantum spin liquids: From the gapless ruby to the gapped maple-leaf lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the two-dimensional ruby and maple-leaf lattices is emerging as a new paradigmatic model of frustrated quantum magnetism, with the potential to realize intricate many-body phases on both mineral and synthetic platforms. We provide evidence that the generalized model interpolating between these two lattices features an extended quantum spin liquid ground state, which is gapless on the ruby lattice and gapped on the maple-leaf lattice, with the transition between the two occurring midway. We present equal-time spin structure factors which further characterize the nature of the presumed quantum spin liquid. Our results are based on one of the most extensive state-of-the-art variational infinite tensor network calculations to date, thereby helping us to resolve the long-standing issue of the delicate competition between magnetically ordered and paramagnetic states in this family of models.</description>

      <title>First-order N\'eel-VBS transition in $S=3/2$ antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the transition between N\'eel and columnar valence-bond solid ordering in two-dimensional $S=3/2$ square lattice quantum antiferromagnets with SO(3) symmetry. According to the deconfined criticality scenario, this transition can be direct and continuous like the well-studied $S=1/2$ case. To study the global phase diagram, we work with four multi-spin couplings with full rotational symmetry, that are free of the sign-problem of quantum Monte Carlo. Exploring the phase diagram with quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the phase transition between N\'eel and valence-bond solid is strongly first-order in the parts of the phase diagram that we have accessed.</description>

      <title>Single Crystal Diffuse Neutron Scattering Study of the Dipole-Octupole Quantum Spin Ice Candidate Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$: No Apparent Octupolar Correlations Above $T = 0.05$ K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The insulating magnetic pyrochlore Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ has attracted much attention as a quantum spin ice candidate with dipole-octupole character that permits spin ice phases based not only on magnetic dipole moments but also allows for even-more-exotic octupole-based spin ice phases. This work reports low-temperature neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ with $Q$-coverage both at low $Q$ where the magnetic form factor for dipoles is near maximal and at high $Q$ covering the region where the magnetic form factor for Ce$^{3+}$ octupoles is near maximal. This study was motivated by recent powder neutron diffraction studies of other Ce-based dipole-octupole pyrochlores, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$, which each showed temperature-dependent diffuse diffraction at high $Q$ that was interpreted as arising from octupolar correlations. Our measurements use an optimized single crystal diffuse scattering instrument that allows us to screen against strong single crystal Bragg scattering in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. The temperature-difference neutron diffraction reveals a low-$Q$ peak consistent with dipolar spin ice correlations. For larger $Q$, the temperature-difference neutron diffraction shows an alternation between positive and negative net intensity. These features are qualitatively consistent with the corresponding numerical-linked-cluster (NLC) calculations using pseudospin interaction parameters reported for Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, or Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Importantly, neither the measured data nor any of the NLC calculations show increased scattering at high $Q$ resulting from octupolar correlations. We conclude that at the lowest attainable temperatures for our measurement ($T = 0.05$ K), octupolar correlations are not present in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ on the level of our observation threshold of $\sim$ 0.1$\%$ of the low-$Q$ dipole scattering.</description>

      <title>Layer Resolved Magnetotransport Properties in Antiferromagnetic/Paramagnetic Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the layer resolved magnetotransport properties of the antiferromagnetic/paramagnetic superlattices based on one band half-filled Hubbard model in three dimensions. In our set up the correlated layers (with on-site repulsion strength $U \ne$ 0) are intercalated between the uncorrelated (U = 0) layers. Our calculations based on the semi-classical Monte-Carlo technique show that the magnetic moments are induced in the uncorrelated layers at low temperatures due to kinetic hopping of the carriers across the interface. The average induced magnetic moment in the uncorrelated layer varies nonmonotonically with the $U$ values of the correlated layer. Interestingly, the induced magnetic moments are antiferromagnetically arranged in uncorrelated layers and mediates the antiferromagnetic ordering between correlated layers. As a result the whole SL system turns out to be antiferromagnetic insulating at low temperatures. For $U \sim$ bandwidth the local moments in the correlated planes increases as a function of the distance from the interface. Expectedly our in-plane resistivity calculations show that the metal insulator transition temperature of the central plane is larger than the edge planes in the correlated layers. On the other hand, although the induced moments in uncorrelated planes decreases considerably as move from edge planes to center planes the metal insulator transition temperature remains more or less same for all planes. The induced moments in uncorrelated layers gradually dissipates with increasing the thickness of uncorrelated layer and as a result the long range antiferromagnetic ordering vanishes in the superlattices similar to the experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric induced quantum Hall conductance inversion and reentrant transition in fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum metric of single-particle wave functions in topological flatbands plays a crucial role in determining the stability of fractional Chern insulating (FCI) states. Here, we unravel that the quantum metric causes the many-body Chern number of the FCI states to deviate sharply from the expected value associated with partial filling of the single-particle topological flatband. Furthermore, the variation of the quantum metric in momentum space induces band dispersion through interactions, affecting the stability of the FCI states. This causes a reentrant transition into the Fermi liquid from the FCI phase as the interaction strength increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report cutting edge performance results for a hybrid CPU-multi GPU implementation of the spin adapted ab initio Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method on current state-of-the-art NVIDIA DGX-H100 architectures. We evaluate the performance of the DMRG electronic structure calculations for the active compounds of the FeMoco and cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)] and 63 electrons in 58 orbitals [CAS(63, 58)], respectively. We achieve 246 teraFLOPS of sustained performance, an improvement of more than 2.5x compared to the performance achieved on the DGX-A100 architectures and an 80x acceleration compared to an OpenMP parallelized implementation on a 128-core CPU architecture. Our work highlights the ability of tensor network algorithms to efficiently utilize high-performance GPU hardware and shows that the combination of tensor networks with modern large-scale GPU accelerators can pave the way towards solving some of the most challenging problems in quantum chemistry and beyond.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing may naturally decompose into a series of weakly-coupled bilayer and trilayer superconducting blocks in order to minimize its total free energy. Our work is motivated by the recent proposal of interlayer pairing induced by the interlayer superexchange interaction of nearly half-filled $d_{z^2}$ orbitals in the bilayer and trilayer nickelate superconductors. We explore general properties of interlayer pairing superconductivity and perform systematic Ginzburg-Landau analyses of an effective multilayer model. For real materials, our results imply strong superconducting order parameter modulation and short coherence length along the $z$ axis (perpendicular to the layers). This reveals a unique feature of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing and provides a basic framework for future experimental and theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Universal nonlinear responses of quantum Hall systems with Galilean invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems with Galilean invariance gapped under magnetic fields. When such quantum Hall systems are coupled with external sources for charge, energy, and momentum currents, they exhibit invariance under the Milne boost as well as under the gauge and general coordinate transformations. We construct the most general effective action consistent with all the symmetries in the derivative expansion, where an electric field is regarded as order of unity so as to allow for nonlinear responses. The resulting action is shown to consist of four terms proportional to the Hall conductivity and viscosity and the energy density and magnetization. We then compute the local currents induced by electromagnetic fields, revealing universal relations among distinct kinds of responses. In particular, we find the Hall conductivity determining the longitudinal conductivity at nonzero frequency and the Hall viscosity contributing to the nonlinear electrothermal conductivity at nonzero wave number.</description>

      <title>Spectral Statistics, Hydrodynamics and Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central problems in many-body physics, both classical and quantum, is the relations between different notions of chaos. Ergodicity, mixing, operator growth, the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, and spectral chaos are defined in terms of completely different objects in different contexts, don't necessarily co-occur, but still seem to be manifestations of closely related phenomena. In this dissertation, we study the relation between two notions of chaos: thermalization and spectral chaos. We define a quantity called the Total Return Probability (TRP) which measures how a system forgets its initial state after time $T$, and show that it is closely connected to the Spectral Form Factor (SFF), a measure of chaos deriving from the energy level spectrum of a quantum system. The main thrust of this work concerns hydrodynamic systems -- systems where locality prevents charge or energy from spreading quickly, this putting a throttle on thermalization. We show that the detailed spacings of energy levels closely capture the dynamics of these locally conserved charges. We also study spin glasses, a phase of matter where the obstacle to thermalization comes not from locality but from the presence of too many neighbors. Changing one region requires changing nearby regions which requires changing nearby-to-nearby regions, until only catastrophic realignments of the whole system can fully explore phase space. In spin glasses we find our clearest analytic link between thermalization and spectral statistics. We analytically calculate the spectral form factor in the limit of large system size and show it is equal to the TRP. Finally, in the conclusion, we discuss some ideas for the future of both the SFF and the TRP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study high harmonic generation in altermagnetic metals with and without spin-orbit coupling. The altermagnetism manifests itself in the magnetic field dependence of the low harmonics associated with intra-band dynamics. Spin-orbit coupling leads to additional higher energy peaks and plateau structures originating from inter-band transitions. While the pure altermagnet or spin-orbit system exhibits no circular dichroism in the high-harmonic response, an altermagnetic system with spin-orbit coupling shows such a dichroism. We also analyze the spin currents and their high harmonic spectrum.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly} \log n $ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly} \log \log n $ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly} \log n$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing unitary ensembles conjectured to form PRUs. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</description>

      <title>Information dynamics in decohered quantum memory with repeated syndrome measurements: a dual approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements can detect errors in a decohered quantum memory allowing active error correction to increase the memory time. Previous understanding of this mechanism has focused on evaluating the performance of error correction algorithms based on measurement results. In this work, we instead intrinsically characterize the information dynamics in a quantum memory under repeated measurements, using coherent information and relative entropy. We consider the dynamics of a $d$-dimensional stabilizer code subject to Pauli errors and noisy stabilizer measurements and develop a $(d+1)$-dimensional statistical mechanics model for the information-theoretic diagnostics. Our model is dual to the model previously obtained for the optimal decoding algorithm, and the potential decoding transition in the quantum memory again manifests as a thermal phase transition in the statistical mechanics model. We explicitly derive the model and study the phase transition in information encoding in three examples: surface codes, repetition codes, and the XZZX code.</description>

Abstract: Ultraclean graphene at charge neutrality hosts a quantum critical Dirac fluid of interacting electrons and holes. Interactions profoundly affect the charge dynamics of graphene, which is encoded in the properties of its electron-photon collective modes: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Here we show that polaritonic interference patterns are particularly well suited to unveil the interactions in Dirac fluids by tracking polaritonic interference in time at temporal scales commensurate with the electronic scattering. Spacetime SPP interference patterns recorded in tera-hertz (THz) frequency range provided unobstructed readouts of the group velocity and lifetime of polariton that can be directly mapped onto the electronic spectral weight and the relaxation rate. Our data uncovered prominent departures of the electron dynamics from the predictions of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. The deviations are particularly strong when the densities of electrons and holes are approximately equal. The proposed spacetime imaging methodology can be broadly applied to probe the electrodynamics of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>From Fractional Quantum Anomalous Hall Smectics to Polar Smectic Metals: Nontrivial Interplay Between Electronic Liquid Crystal Order and Topological Order in Correlated Topological Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking orders can not only compete with each other, but also be interwined, and the interwined topological and symmetry-breaking orders make the situation more intriguing. This work examines the archetypal correlated flat band model on a checkerboard lattice at filling $\nu=2/3$ and we find the unique interplay between smectic charge order and topological order gives rise to two novel quantum states. As the interaction strength increases, the system first transitions from a Fermi liquid into FQAH smectic (FQAHS) state, where FQAH topological order coexists cooperatively with smectic charge order with enlarged ground-state degeneracy and interestingly, the Hall conductivity is $\sigma_{xy}=\nu=2/3$, different from the band-folding or doping scenarios. Further increasing the interaction strength, the system undergoes another quantum phase transition and evolves into a polar smectic metal (PSM) state. This emergent PSM is an anisotropic non-Fermi liquid, whose interstripe tunneling is irrelevant while it is metallic inside each stripe. Different from the FQAHS and conventional smectic orders, this PSM spontaneously breaks the two-fold rotational symmetry, resulting in a nonzero electric dipole moment and ferroelectric order. In addition to the exotic ground states, large-scale numerical simulations are also used to study low-energy excitations and thermodynamic characteristics. We find the onset temperature of the incompressible FQAHS state, which also coincides with the onset of non-polar smectic order, is dictated by the magneto-roton modes. Above this onset temperature, the PSM state exists at intermediate-temperature regime. Although the T = 0 quantum phase transition between PSM and FQAHS is first order, the thermal FQAHS-PSM transition could be continuous. We expect the features of the exotic states and thermal phase transitions could be accessed in future experiments.</description>

Abstract: Spin-ordered states close to metal-insulator transitions are poorly understood theoretically and challenging to probe in experiments. Here, we propose that the quantum twisting microscope, which provides direct access to the energy-momentum resolved spectrum of single-particle and collective excitations, can be used as a novel tool to distinguish between different types of magnetic order. To this end, we calculate the single-particle spectral function and the dynamical spin-structure factor for both a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic generalized Wigner crystal formed in fractionally filled moir\'e superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures. We demonstrate that magnetic order can be clearly identified in these response functions. Furthermore, we explore signatures of quantum phase transitions in the quantum twisting microscope response. We focus on the specific case of triangular moir\'e lattices at half filling, which have been proposed to host a topological phase transition between a chiral spin liquid and a 120 degree ordered state. Our work demonstrates the potential for quantum twisting microscopes to characterize quantum magnetism in moir\'e heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a gapped spin-$S$ chain with antiferromagnetic (AFM) order exhibits in the thermodynamic limit exponentially localized fractional $\pm \frac{S}{2}$ edge modes when the system possesses U(1) symmetry. We show this for integrable and non integrable spin chains both analytically and numerically. Through exact analytical solutions, we show that an AFM spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain with {\it explicitly} broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry and an integrable AFM spin-$1$ chain with {\it spontaneously} broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry have $\pm \frac{1}{4}$ and $\pm \frac{1}{2}$ fractionalized edge modes, respectively. Furthermore, employing the density matrix renormalization group technique, we extend this analysis to {\it generic} $XXZ-S$ chains with $S\leq 3$ and demonstrate that these fractional spins are robust quantum observables, substantiated by the observation of a variance of the associated fractional spin operators that is consistent with a vanishing functional form in the thermodynamic limit. Moreover, we find that the edge modes are robust to disorder that couples to the N\'eel order parameter.</description>

      <title>Surface phonons and possible structural phase transition in a topological semimetal PbTaSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological insulators are a novel class of quantum materials characterized by protected gapless surface or edge states but insulating bulk states which is due to presence of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. Such an intriguing surface and bulk topology manifests itself in coupling with lattice dynamics due to electron-phonon scattering. Here we report an in-depth investigation of a topological nodal line semimetal PbTaSe2 via temperature, polarization dependent Raman spectroscopy and temperature dependent single crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) measurements. Our analysis shows signature of electron-phonon coupling as reflected in the Fano asymmetry in line shape of M1-M4 modes and anomalous temperature variation of line-width of P3-P4 modes. Further polarization dependent phonon symmetry changes at different temperature (6K and 300K), discontinuities in bulk phonon dynamics for P2-P5 modes and disappearance of phonon modes i.e., M1-M5, on decreasing temperatures indicates towards a thermally induced structural phase transition which is also supported by the SC-XRD results. Hence based on our findings we propose that M1-M4 modes are surface phonon modes, the material undergoes a thermally induced structural phase transition from alpha to beta phase at T ~ 150 K or is in close proximity to the beta phase and another transition below T(CDW+beta) ~ 100K which is possibly due to the interplay of remanent completely commensurate charge density wave (CCDW) of 1H-TaSe2 and beta phase.</description>

      <title>Treatment of the strongly correlated topological superconductors through the $su(2|1)$ path-integral technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that topological superconductivity can be produced by strong electron-electron (e-e) interaction in two minimal one (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) models containing only nearest neighbor hopping and suitable superconducting order parameters. The presence of the strong e-e interaction constrains each atomic site to be either empty or singly occupied. One can treat this scenario by fractionalizing the electrons into spin and charge degrees of freedom. We use the coherent state symbols associated with the lowest irreducible representation of the $su(2|1)$ superalgebra spanned by the Hubbard operators to solve the proposed models, as they implicitly take into account both the single particle occupation constraint and the fractionalization of the electrons. Our two example display the emergence of topological superconductivity in an 1D nanowire with extended $s$-wave superconductivity, and in a 2D square lattice with $p$-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Thermal masses and trapped-ion quantum spin models: a self-consistent approach to Yukawa-type interactions in the $\lambda\!\phi^4$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum simulation of magnetism in trapped-ion systems makes use of the crystal vibrations to mediate pairwise interactions between spins, which are encoded in the internal electronic states of the ions, and measured in experiments that probe the real-time dynamics. These interactions can be accounted for by a long-wavelength relativistic theory, where the phonons are described by a coarse-grained Klein-Gordon field $\phi(x)$ locally coupled to the spins that acts as a carrier, leading to an analogue of pion-mediated Yukawa interactions. In the vicinity of a structural transition of the ion crystal, one must go beyond the Klein-Gordon fields, and include additional $\lambda\phi^4$ terms responsible for phonon-phonon scattering. This leads to quantum effects that can be expressed by Feynman loop integrals that modify the range of the Yukawa-type spin interactions; an effect that could be used to probe the underlying fixed point of this quantum field theory (QFT). Unfortunately, the rigidity of the trapped-ion crystal makes it challenging to observe genuine quantum effects, such as the flow of the critical point with the quartic coupling $\lambda$. We hereby show that thermal effects, which can be controlled by laser cooling, can unveil this flow through the appearance of thermal masses in interacting QFTs. We perform self-consistent calculations that resum certain Feynman diagrams and, additionally, go beyond mean-field theory to predict how measurements on the trapped-ion spin system can probe key properties of the $\lambda\phi^4$ QFT.</description>

      <title>Collective tunneling of a Wigner necklace in carbon nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collective tunneling of a Wigner necklace - a crystal-like state of a small number of strongly interacting electrons confined to a suspended nanotube and subject to a double well potential - is theoretically analyzed and compared with experiments in [Shapir \emph{et al.}, Science {\bf 364}, 870 (2019)]. Density Matrix Renormalization Group computations, exact diagonalization, and instanton theory provide a consistent description of this very strongly interacting system, and show good agreement with experiments. Experimentally extracted and theoretically computed tunneling amplitudes exhibit a scaling collapse. Collective quantum fluctuations renormalize the tunneling, and substantially enhance it as the number of electrons increases.</description>

      <title>Quantum phases of hardcore bosons with repulsive dipolar density-density interactions on two-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the ground-state quantum phase diagram of hardcore Bosons interacting with repulsive dipolar potentials. The bosons dynamics is described by the extended-Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian on a two-dimensional lattice. The ground state results from the interplay between the lattice geometry and the long-range interactions, which we account for by means of a classical spin mean-field approach limited by the size of the considered unit cells. This extended classical spin mean-field theory accounts for the long-range density-density interaction without truncation. We consider three different lattice geometries: square, honeycomb, and triangular. In the limit of zero hopping the ground state is always a devil's staircase of solid (gapped) phases. Such crystalline phases with broken translational symmetry are robust with respect to finite hopping amplitudes. At intermediate hopping amplitudes, these gapped phases melt, giving rise to various lattice supersolid phases, which can have exotic features with multiple sublattice densities. At sufficiently large hoppings the ground state is a superfluid. The stability of phases predicted by our approach is gauged by comparison to the known quantum phase diagrams of the Bose-Hubbard model with nearest-neighbour interactions as well as quantum Monte Carlo simulations for the dipolar case on the square and triangular lattice. Our results are of immediate relevance for experimental realisations of self-organised crystalline ordering patterns in analogue quantum simulators, e.g., with ultracold dipolar atoms in an optical lattice.</description>

      <title>Topological flat bands, valley polarization, and interband superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with proximitized spin-orbit couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study theoretically the magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene with proximity-induced Ising and Rashba spin-orbit couplings on the top layer. Topological flat bands (with three distinct phases) are generically realized by the spin-orbit couplings. Using a mean field analysis, we find that (partial) valley polarization prevails for a wide range of doping, suppressing the usual superconductivity with a pairing between time-reversal partners. Remarkably, we uncover that observable unconventional intervalley interband phonon-mediated superconductivity (with the highest $T_c\approx 1.2$K) can coexist with strong valley imbalance due to the approximate Fermi surface nesting between two flat bands not related by time-reversal symmetry, and the dominant pairing is an intersublattice Ising pairing, corresponding to a mixture of $p$- and $d$-waves. In contrast, the intrasublattice Ising phonon-mediated superconductivity with $s$- and $f$-wave mixing emerges in the absence of valley imbalance. Our work reveals an unprecedented route of realizing unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>

Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking digital quantum simulations above hundreds of qubits using quantum critical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real-time simulation of large many-body quantum systems is a formidable task, that may only be achievable with a genuine quantum computational platform. Currently, quantum hardware with a number of qubits sufficient to make classical emulation challenging is available. This condition is necessary for the pursuit of a so-called quantum advantage, but it also makes verifying the results very difficult. In this manuscript, we flip the perspective and utilize known theoretical results about many-body quantum critical dynamics to benchmark quantum hardware and various error mitigation techniques on up to 133 qubits. In particular, we benchmark against known universal scaling laws in the Hamiltonian simulation of a time-dependent transverse field Ising Hamiltonian. Incorporating only basic error mitigation and suppression methods, our study shows reliable control up to a two-qubit gate depth of 28, featuring a maximum of 1396 two-qubit gates, before noise becomes prevalent. These results are transferable to applications such as Hamiltonian simulation, variational algorithms, optimization, or quantum machine learning. We demonstrate this on the example of digitized quantum annealing for optimization and identify an optimal working point in terms of both circuit depth and time step on a 133-site optimization problem.</description>

Abstract: A remarkable feature of topological superconductors is the emergence of Majorana fermions in electron systems. Whereas the emergent Majorana fermions share the self-anti-particle property with Majorana fermions in particle physics, they may have essentially different electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we argue the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We present a general theory of the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors and clarify how the pairing symmetry is encoded in the electromagnetic response. As an application, we predict the sublattice-dependent dipole (Ising)-type magnetic response of corner Majorana fermions in iron-based superconductors.</description>
