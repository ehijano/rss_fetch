      <title>Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding Methods for Nonnegative Sparse Signal Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonnegative sparse signal recovery has been extensively studied due to its broad applications. Recent work has integrated rectified linear unit (ReLU) techniques to enhance existing recovery algorithms. We merge Newton-type thresholding with ReLU-based approaches to propose two algorithms: Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding (NDRT) and its enhanced variant, Newton-Direction-Based ReLU-Thresholding Pursuit (NDRTP). Theoretical analysis iindicates that both algorithms can guarantee exact recovery of nonnegative sparse signals when the measurement matrix satisfies a certain condition.. Numerical experiments demonstrate NDRTP achieves competitive performance compared to several existing methods in both noisy and noiseless scenarios.</description>

      <title>NeuroSleep: Neuromorphic Event-Driven Single-Channel EEG Sleep Staging for Edge-Efficient Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable, continuous neural sensing on wearable edge platforms is fundamental to long-term health monitoring; however, for electroencephalography (EEG)-based sleep monitoring, dense high-frequency processing is often computationally prohibitive under tight energy budgets. To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes NeuroSleep, an integrated event-driven sensing and inference system for energy-efficient sleep staging. NeuroSleep first converts raw EEG into complementary multi-scale bipolar event streams using Residual Adaptive Multi-Scale Delta Modulation (R-AMSDM), enabling an explicit fidelity-sparsity trade-off at the sensing front end. Furthermore, NeuroSleep adopts a hierarchical inference architecture that comprises an Event-based Adaptive Multi-scale Response (EAMR) module for local feature extraction, a Local Temporal-Attention Module (LTAM) for context aggregation, and an Epoch-Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (ELIF) module to capture long-term state persistence. Experimental results using subject-independent 5-fold cross-validation on the Sleep-EDF Expanded dataset demonstrate that NeuroSleep achieves a mean accuracy of 74.2% with only 0.932 M parameters while reducing sparsity-adjusted effective operations by approximately 53.6% relative to dense processing. Compared with the representative dense Transformer baseline, NeuroSleep improves accuracy by 7.5% with a 45.8% reduction in computational load. By bridging neuromorphic encoding with state-aware modeling, NeuroSleep provides a scalable solution for always-on sleep analysis in resource-constrained wearable scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advancing Industry 4.0: Multimodal Sensor Fusion for AI-Based Fault Detection in 3D Printing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing, particularly fused deposition modeling, is transforming modern production by enabling rapid prototyping and complex part fabrication. However, its layer-by-layer process remains vulnerable to faults such as nozzle clogging, filament runout, and layer misalignment, which compromise print quality and reliability. Traditional inspection methods are costly, time-intensive, and often limited to post-process analysis, making them unsuitable for real-time intervention. In this current study, the authors developed a novel, low-cost, and portable faultdetection system that leverages multimodal sensor fusion and artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring in FDM-based 3D printing. The system integrates acoustic, vibration, and thermal sensing into a non-intrusive architecture, capturing complementary data streams that reflect both mechanical and process-related anomalies. Acoustic and thermal sensors operate in a fully contactless manner, while the vibration sensor requires minimal attachment such that it will not interfere with printer hardware, thereby preserving portability and ease of deployment. The multimodal signals are processed into spectrograms and time-frequency features, which are classified using convolutional neural networks for intelligent fault detection. The proposed system advances Industry 4.0 objectives by offering an affordable, scalable, and practical monitoring solution that improves faultdetection accuracy, reduces waste, and supports sustainable, adaptive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Real time fault detection in 3D printers using Convolutional Neural Networks and acoustic signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reliability and quality of 3D printing processes are critically dependent on the timely detection of mechanical faults. Traditional monitoring methods often rely on visual inspection and hardware sensors, which can be both costly and limited in scope. This paper explores a scalable and contactless method for the use of real-time audio signal analysis for detecting mechanical faults in 3D printers. By capturing and classifying acoustic emissions during the printing process, we aim to identify common faults such as nozzle clogging, filament breakage, pully skipping and various other mechanical faults. Utilizing Convolutional neural networks, we implement algorithms capable of real-time audio classification to detect these faults promptly. Our methodology involves conducting a series of controlled experiments to gather audio data, followed by the application of advanced machine learning models for fault detection. Additionally, we review existing literature on audio-based fault detection in manufacturing and 3D printing to contextualize our research within the broader field. Preliminary results demonstrate that audio signals, when analyzed with machine learning techniques, provide a reliable and cost-effective means of enhancing real-time fault detection.</description>

      <title>In-Situ Analysis of Vibration and Acoustic Data in Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vibration from an erroneous disturbance harms the manufactured components and lowers the output quality of an FDM printer. For moving machinery, vibration analysis and control are crucial. Additive manufacturing is the basis of 3D printing, which utilizes mechanical movement of the extruder to fabricate objects, and faults occur due to unwanted vibrations. Therefore, it is vital to examine the vibration patterns of a 3D printer. In this work, we observe these parameters of an FDM printer, exemplified by the MakerBot Method X. To analyze the system, it is necessary to understand the motion it generates and select appropriate sensors to detect those motions. The sensor measurement values can be used to determine the condition of the printer. We used an accelerometer and an acoustic sensor to measure the vibration and sound produced by the printer. The outputs from these sensors were examined individually. The findings show that vibration occurs at relatively low levels during continuous motion because it mainly appears at component transition edges. Due to abrupt acceleration and deceleration during zigzag motion, vibration reaches its peak.</description>

      <title>Pinching Antennas-Aided Integrated Sensing and Multicast Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A pinching antennas (PAs)-aided integrated sensing and multicast communication framework is proposed. In this framework, the communication performance is measured by the multicast rate considering max-min fairness. Moreover, the sensing performance is quantified by the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound (BCRB), where a Gauss-Hermite quadrature-based approach is proposed to compute the Bayesian Fisher information matrix. Based on these metrics, PA placement is optimized under three criteria: communications-centric (C-C), sensing-centric (S-C), and Pareto-optimal designs. These designs are investigated in two scenarios: the single-PA case and the multi-PA case. 1) For the single-PA case, a closed-form solution is derived for the location of the C-C transmit PA, while the S-C design yields optimal transmit and receive PA placements that are symmetric about the target location. Leveraging this geometric insight, the Pareto-optimal design is solved by enforcing this PA placement symmetry, thereby reducing the joint transmit and receive PA placement to the transmit PA optimization. 2) For the general multi-PA case, the PA placements constitute a highly non-convex optimization problem. To solve this, an element-wise alternating optimization-based method is proposed to sequentially optimize all PA placements for the S-C design, and is further incorporated into an augmented Lagrangian (AL) framework and a rate-profile formulation to solve the C-C and Pareto-optimal design problems, respectively. Numerical results show that: i) PASS substantially outperforms fixed-antenna baselines in both multicast rate and sensing accuracy; ii) the multicasting gain becomes more pronounced as the user density increases; and iii) the sensing accuracy improves with the number of deployed PAs.</description>

      <title>SeaSpoofFinder -- Potential GNSS Spoofing Event Detection Using AIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether large-scale GNSS spoofing activity can be inferred from maritime Automatic Identification System (AIS) position reports. A data-processing framework, called SeaSpoofFinder, available here: seaspooffinder.github.io/ais_data, was developed to ingest and post-process global AIS streams and to detect candidate anomalies through a two-stage procedure. In Stage 1, implausible position jumps are identified using kinematic and data-quality filters; in Stage 2, events are retained only when multiple vessels exhibit spatially consistent source and target clustering, thereby reducing false positives from single-vessel artifacts. The resulting final potential spoofing events (FPSEs) reveal recurrent patterns in several regions, including the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, Murmansk, Moscow, and the Haifa area, with affected footprints that can span large maritime areas. The analysis also highlights recurring non-spoofing artifacts (e.g., back-to-port jumps and data gaps) that can still pass heuristic filters in dense traffic regions. These results indicate that AIS-based monitoring can provide useful evidence for identifying and characterizing potential spoofing activity at scale, while emphasizing that AIS-only evidence does not provide definitive attribution.</description>

      <title>Impact of Preprocessing on Neural Network-Based RSS/AoA Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid received signal strength (RSS)-angle of arrival (AoA)-based positioning offers low-cost distance estimation and high-resolution angular measurements. Still, it comes at a cost of inherent nonlinearities, geometry-dependent noise, and suboptimal weighting in conventional linear estimators that might limit accuracy. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach using a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to directly map RSS-AoA measurements to 3D positions, capturing nonlinear relationships that are difficult to model with traditional methods. We evaluate the impact of input representation by comparing networks trained on raw measurements versus preprocessed features derived from a linearization method. Simulation results show that the learning-based approach consistently outperforms existing linear methods under RSS noise across all noise levels, and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance under increasing AoA noise. Furthermore, preprocessing measurements using the linearization method provides a clear advantage over raw data, demonstrating the benefit of geometry-aware feature extraction.</description>

      <title>Joint beamforming and mode optimization for multi-functional STAR-RIS-aided integrated sensing and communication networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems assisted by simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs), which act as multi-functional programmable metasurfaces capable of supporting concurrent communication and sensing within a unified architecture. We propose a two-stage ISAC protocol, in which the preparation phase performs direction estimation for outdoor users located in the reflection space, while maintaining communication with both outdoor and indoor users in the transmission space. The subsequent communication phase exploits the estimated directions to enhance information transfer. The directions of outdoor users are modeled as Gaussian random variables to capture estimation uncertainty, and the corresponding average communication performance is incorporated into the design. Building on this framework, we formulate a performance-balanced optimization problem that maximizes the communication sum-rate while guaranteeing the required sensing accuracy, jointly determining the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, and the metasurface partition between energy-splitting and transmit-only modes. The physical constraints of STAR-RIS elements and the required sensing performance are explicitly enforced. To address the non-convex nature of the problem, we combine fractional programming, Lagrangian dual reformulation, and successive convex approximation. The binary metasurface partition is ultimately recovered via continuous relaxation followed by projection-based binarization. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design achieves an effective trade-off between sensing accuracy and communication throughput, by significantly outperforming conventional STAR-RIS-aided ISAC schemes.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Piecewise-Constant Sparse Signals for Modulo Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulo sampling is a promising technology to preserve amplitude information that exceeds the observable range of analog-to-digital converters during the digitization of analog signals. Since conventional methods typically reconstruct the original signal by estimating the differences of the residual signal and computing their cumulative sum, each estimation error inevitably propagates through subsequent time samples. In this paper, to eliminate this error-propagation problem, we propose an algorithm that reconstructs the residual signal directly. The proposed method takes advantage of the high-frequency characteristics of the modulo samples and the sparsity of both the residual signal and its difference. Simulation results show that the proposed method reconstructs the original signal more accurately than a conventional method based on the differences of the residual signal.</description>

      <title>Proof of Concept: Local TX Real-Time Phase Calibration in MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel measurements in MIMO systems hinge on precise synchronization. While methods for time and frequency synchronization are well established, maintaining real-time phase coherence remains an open requirement for many MIMO systems. Phase coherence in MIMO systems is crucial for beamforming in digital arrays and enables precise parameter estimates such as Angle-of-Arrival/Departure. This work presents and validates a simple local real-time phase calibration method for a digital array. We compare two different approaches, instantaneous and smoothed calibration, to determine the optimal interval between synchronization procedures. To quantitatively assess calibration performance, we use two metrics: the average beamforming power loss and the RMS cycle-to-cycle jitter. Our results indicate that both approaches for phase calibration are effective and yield RMS of jitter in the 2.1 ps to 124 fs range for different SDR models. This level of precision enables coherent transmission on commonly available SDR platforms, allowing investigation on advanced MIMO techniques and transmit beamforming in practical testbeds.</description>

      <title>Failure-Aware Access Point Selection for Resilient Cell-Free Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Failure-Aware Access Point Selection (FAAS) method aimed at improving hardware resilience in cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) networks. FAAS selects APs for each user by jointly considering channel strength and the failure probability of each AP. A tunable parameter \(\alpha \in [0,1]\) scales these failure probabilities to model different levels of network stress. We evaluate resilience using two key metrics: the minimum-user spectral efficiency, which captures worst-case user performance, and the outage probability, defined as the fraction of users left without any active APs. Simulation results show that FAAS maintains significantly better performance under failure conditions compared to failure-agnostic clustering. At high failure levels, FAAS reduces outage by over 85\% and improves worst-case user rates. These results confirm that FAAS is a practical and efficient solution for building more reliable CF-mMIMO networks.</description>

      <title>WindDensity-MBIR: Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction for Wind Tunnel 3D Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimentalists often use wind tunnels to study aerodynamic turbulence, but most wind tunnel imaging techniques are limited in their ability to take non-invasive 3D density measurements of turbulence. Wavefront tomography is a technique that uses multiple wavefront measurements from various viewing angles to non-invasively measure the 3D density field of a turbulent medium. Existing methods make strong assumptions, such as a spline basis representation, to address the ill-conditioned nature of this problem. We formulate this problem as a Bayesian, sparse-view tomographic reconstruction problem and develop a model-based iterative reconstruction algorithm for measuring the volumetric 3D density field inside a wind tunnel. We call this method WindDensity-MBIR and apply it using simulated data to difficult reconstruction scenarios with sparse data, small projection field of view, and limited angular extent. WindDensity-MBIR can recover high-order features in these scenarios within 10% to 25% error even when the tip, tilt, and piston are removed from the wavefront measurements.</description>

      <title>Active RIS-Assisted MIMO System for Vital Signs Extraction: ISAC Modeling, Deep Learning, and Prototype Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the RIS-VSign system, an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) framework for vital signs extraction under an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) model. The system consists of two stages: the phase selector of RIS and the extraction of respiration rate. To mitigate synchronization-induced common phase drifts, the difference of M\"obius transformation (DMT) is integrated into the deep learning framework, named DMTNet, to jointly configure multiple active RIS elements. Notably, the training data are generated in simulation without collecting real-world measurements, and the resulting phase selector is validated experimentally. For sensing, multi-antenna measurements are fused by the DC-offset calibration and the DeepMining-MMV processing with CA-CFAR detection and Newton's refinements. Prototype experiments indicate that active RIS deployment improves respiration detectability while simultaneously enabling higher-order modulation; without RIS, respiration detection is unreliable and only lower-order modulation is supported.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses graph learning in Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs). In this context, data matrices often come with auxiliary metadata (e.g., textual descriptions associated with each node) that is usually ignored in traditional graph estimation processes. To fill this gap, we propose a graph learning approach based on Laplacian-constrained GGMs that jointly leverages the node signals and such metadata. The resulting formulation yields an optimization problem, for which we develop an efficient majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm with closed-form updates at each iteration. Experimental results on a real-world financial dataset demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves graph clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches that use either signals or metadata alone, thus illustrating the interest of fusing both sources of information.</description>

      <title>ASPEN: Spectral-Temporal Fusion for Cross-Subject Brain Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Connectivity in Ambient Backscatter Communications via Fluid Antenna Readers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power connectivity by allowing passive backscatter devices (BDs) to convey information through reflection of ambient signals. However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable rate compared with conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings.</description>

      <title>Continuous Fluid Antenna Sampling for Channel Estimation in Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we develop a continuous fluid antenna (FA) framework for uplink channel estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. By modeling the wireless channel as a spatially correlated Gaussian random field, channel estimation is formulated as a Gaussian process (GP) regression problem with motion-constrained spatial sampling. Closed-form expressions for the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the corresponding estimation error are derived. A fundamental comparison with discrete port-based architectures is established under identical position constraints, showing that continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models. Numerical results validate the analysis and show the performance gains of continuous FA sampling over discrete baselines.</description>

      <title>The Role of Common Randomness Replication in Symmetric PIR on Graph-Based Replicated Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR), a user communicates with multiple servers to retrieve from them a message in a database, while not revealing the message index to any individual server (user privacy), and learning no additional information about the database (database privacy). We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of RSMA to Adversarial BD-RIS-Induced Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the robustness of rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems to interference attacks against channel acquisition induced by beyond-diagonal RISs (BD-RISs). Two primary attack strategies, random and aligned interference, are proposed for fully connected and group-connected reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures. Valid random reflection coefficients are generated exploiting the Takagi factorization, while potent aligned interference attacks are achieved through optimization strategies based on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) reformulation followed by projections onto the unitary manifold. Our numerical findings reveal that, when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available, RSMA behaves similarly to space-division multiple access (SDMA) and thus is highly susceptible to the attack, with BD-RIS inducing severe performance loss and significantly outperforming diagonal RIS. However, under imperfect CSI, RSMA consistently demonstrates significantly greater robustness than SDMA, particularly as the system's transmit power increases.</description>

      <title>ASSENT: Learning-Based Association Optimization for Distributed Cell-Free ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key emerging 6G technology. Despite progress, ISAC still lacks scalable methods for joint AP clustering and user/target scheduling in distributed deployments under fronthaul limits. Moreover, existing ISAC solutions largely rely on centralized processing and full channel state information, limiting scalability. This paper addresses joint access point (AP) clustering, user and target scheduling, and AP mode selection in distributed cell-free ISAC systems operating with constrained fronthaul capacity. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly captures interference coupling, RF-chain limits, and sensing requirements, providing optimal but computationally demanding solutions. To enable real-time and scalable operation, we propose ASSENT (ASSociation and ENTity selection), a graph neural network (GNN) framework trained on MILP solutions to efficiently learn association and mode-selection policies directly from lightweight link statistics. Simulations show that ASSENT achieves near-optimal utility while accurately learning the underlying associations. Additionally, its single forward pass inference reduces decision latency compared to optimization-based methods. An open-source Python/PyTorch implementation with full datasets is provided to facilitate reproducible and extensible research in cell-free ISAC.</description>

      <title>Weather Estimation for Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the key features of sixth-generation (6G) mobile communications will be integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). While the main goal of ISAC in standardization efforts is to detect objects, the byproducts of radar operations can be used to enable new services in 6G, such as weather sensing. Even though weather radars are the most prominent technology for weather detection and monitoring, they are expensive and usually neglect areas in close vicinity. To this end, we propose reusing the dense deployment of 6G base stations for weather sensing purposes by detecting and estimating weather conditions. We implement both a classifier and a regressor as a convolutional neural network trained across measurements with varying precipitation rates and wind speeds. We implement our approach in an ISAC proof-of-concept and conduct a multi-week experiment campaign. Experimental results show that we are able to jointly and accurately classify weather conditions with accuracies of 99.38% and 98.99% for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. For estimation, we obtain errors of 1.2 mm/h and 1.5 km/h, for precipitation rate and wind speed, respectively. These findings indicate that weather sensing services can be reliably deployed in 6G ISAC networks, broadening their service portfolio and boosting their market value.</description>

      <title>Spatial Angular Pseudo-Derivative Search: A Single Snapshot Super-resolution Sparse DOA Scheme with Potential for Practical Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution, and real-time DOA estimation is a cornerstone of environmental perception in automotive radar systems. While sparse signal recovery techniques offer super-resolution and high-precision estimation, their prohibitive computational complexity remains a primary bottleneck for practical deployment. This paper proposes a sparse DOA estimation scheme specifically tailored for the stringent requirements of automotive radar such as limited computational resources, restricted array apertures, and single-snapshot constraints. By introducing the concept of the spatial angular pseudo-derivative and incorporating this property as a constraint into a standard L0-norm minimization problem, we formulate an objective function that more faithfully characterizes the physical properties of the DOA problem. The associated solver, designated as the SAPD search algorithm, naturally transforms the high-dimensional optimization task into an efficient grid-search scheme. The SAPD algorithm circumvents high-order matrix inversions and computationally intensive iterations. We provide an analysis of the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm. Numerical simulations and experimental validation demonstrate that the SAPD method achieves a superior balance of real-time efficiency, high precision, and super-resolution, making it highly suitable for next-generation automotive radar applications.</description>

      <title>Communication Compression for Distributed Learning with Aggregate and Server-Guided Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed learning, particularly Federated Learning (FL), faces a significant bottleneck in the communication cost, particularly the uplink transmission of client-to-server updates, which is often constrained by asymmetric bandwidth limits at the edge. Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative. Experimental results in FL scenarios validate the superiority of our approaches over existing compression schemes.</description>

      <title>Agonist-Antagonist Neural Coordination without Mechanical Coupling after Targeted Muscle Reinnervation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following limb amputation and targeted muscle reinnervation (TMR), nerves that originally innervated agonist and antagonist muscles are rerouted into one or more residual target muscles. This rerouting profoundly alters the natural mechanical coupling and afferent signalling that normally link muscle groups in intact limbs. Despite this disruption, in this study we demonstrate, using high-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays implanted in reinnervated muscles of three TMR participants, that motor units (MUs) associated with agonist and antagonist tasks remain functionally coupled. Specifically, over 40% of motor units active during agonist tasks were also recruited during the corresponding antagonist tasks, even though no visual feedback on antagonist neural activity was provided. These motor units exhibited significantly different firing rates depending on their functional role. These results provide the first motor-unit-level evidence that the central nervous system preserves coordinated agonist-antagonist control after TMR and inform restorative surgical strategies and prosthetic systems capable of regulating both limb kinematics and dynamics based on agonist-antagonist commands interplay.</description>
