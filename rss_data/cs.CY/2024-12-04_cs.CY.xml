      <title>Influence of Skill and Knowledge of Programmers on Program Behavior Visualization by CS Unplugged</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer science unplugged (CS unplugged) is a method of teaching computer science and computational thinking. It does not use a computer but employs physical materials. As CS unplugged, past studies proposed a new method to visualize programming behavior, and evaluated the method based on the understanding test of program. However, the past studied did not consider the factors affecting the test such as participants knowledge. This study analyzed the relationship between the factors and the test results.</description>

      <title>A Shared Standard for Valid Measurement of Generative AI Systems' Capabilities, Risks, and Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The valid measurement of generative AI (GenAI) systems' capabilities, risks, and impacts forms the bedrock of our ability to evaluate these systems. We introduce a shared standard for valid measurement that helps place many of the disparate-seeming evaluation practices in use today on a common footing. Our framework, grounded in measurement theory from the social sciences, extends the work of Adcock &amp; Collier (2001) in which the authors formalized valid measurement of concepts in political science via three processes: systematizing background concepts, operationalizing systematized concepts via annotation procedures, and applying those procedures to instances. We argue that valid measurement of GenAI systems' capabilities, risks, and impacts, further requires systematizing, operationalizing, and applying not only the entailed concepts, but also the contexts of interest and the metrics used. This involves both descriptive reasoning about particular instances and inferential reasoning about underlying populations, which is the purview of statistics. By placing many disparate-seeming GenAI evaluation practices on a common footing, our framework enables individual evaluations to be better understood, interrogated for reliability and validity, and meaningfully compared. This is an important step in advancing GenAI evaluation practices toward more formalized and theoretically grounded processes -- i.e., toward a science of GenAI evaluations.</description>

      <title>Effective Mitigations for Systemic Risks from General-Purpose AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The systemic risks posed by general-purpose AI models are a growing concern, yet the effectiveness of mitigations remains underexplored. Previous research has proposed frameworks for risk mitigation, but has left gaps in our understanding of the perceived effectiveness of measures for mitigating systemic risks. Our study addresses this gap by evaluating how experts perceive different mitigations that aim to reduce the systemic risks of general-purpose AI models. We surveyed 76 experts whose expertise spans AI safety; critical infrastructure; democratic processes; chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks (CBRN); and discrimination and bias. Among 27 mitigations identified through a literature review, we find that a broad range of risk mitigation measures are perceived as effective in reducing various systemic risks and technically feasible by domain experts. In particular, three mitigation measures stand out: safety incident reports and security information sharing, third-party pre-deployment model audits, and pre-deployment risk assessments. These measures show both the highest expert agreement ratings (&gt;60\%) across all four risk areas and are most frequently selected in experts' preferred combinations of measures (&gt;40\%). The surveyed experts highlighted that external scrutiny, proactive evaluation and transparency are key principles for effective mitigation of systemic risks. We provide policy recommendations for implementing the most promising measures, incorporating the qualitative contributions from experts. These insights should inform regulatory frameworks and industry practices for mitigating the systemic risks associated with general-purpose AI.</description>

      <title>Pre-Deployment Information Sharing: A Zoning Taxonomy for Precursory Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-impact and potentially dangerous capabilities can and should be broken down into early warning shots long before reaching red lines. Each of these early warning shots should correspond to a precursory capability. Each precursory capability sits on a spectrum indicating its proximity to a final high-impact capability, corresponding to a red line. To meaningfully detect and track capability progress, we propose a taxonomy of dangerous capability zones (a zoning taxonomy) tied to a staggered information exchange framework that enables relevant bodies to take action accordingly. In the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, signatories commit to sharing more detailed information with trusted actors, including an appointed body, as appropriate (Commitment VII). Building on our zoning taxonomy, this paper makes four recommendations for specifying information sharing as detailed in Commitment VII. (1) Precursory capabilities should be shared as soon as they become known through internal evaluations before deployment. (2) AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) should be the trusted actors appointed to receive and coordinate information on precursory components. (3) AISIs should establish adequate information protection infrastructure and guarantee increased information security as precursory capabilities move through the zones and towards red lines, including, if necessary, by classifying the information on precursory capabilities or marking it as controlled. (4) High-impact capability progress in one geographical region may translate to risk in other regions and necessitates more comprehensive risk assessment internationally. As such, AISIs should exchange information on precursory capabilities with other AISIs, relying on the existing frameworks on international classified exchanges and applying lessons learned from other regulated high-risk sectors.</description>

      <title>An ADHD Diagnostic Interface Based on EEG Spectrograms and Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative approach to Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosis by employing deep learning (DL) techniques on electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This method addresses the limitations of current behavior-based diagnostic methods, which often lead to misdiagnosis and gender bias. By utilizing a publicly available EEG dataset and converting the signals into spectrograms, a Resnet-18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was used to extract features for ADHD classification. The model achieved a high precision, recall, and an overall F1 score of 0.9. Feature extraction highlighted significant brain regions (frontopolar, parietal, and occipital lobes) associated with ADHD. These insights guided the creation of a three-part digital diagnostic system, facilitating cost-effective and accessible ADHD screening, especially in school environments. This system enables earlier and more accurate identification of students at risk for ADHD, providing timely support to enhance their developmental outcomes. This study showcases the potential of integrating EEG analysis with DL to enhance ADHD diagnostics, presenting a viable alternative to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Aggregation Rules in Participatory Budgeting: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Participatory Budgeting (PB) offers a democratic process for communities to allocate public funds across various projects through voting. In practice, PB organizers face challenges in selecting aggregation rules either because they are not familiar with the literature and the exact details of every existing rule or because no existing rule echoes their expectations. This paper presents a novel data-driven approach utilizing machine learning to address this challenge. By training neural networks on PB instances, our approach learns aggregation rules that balance social welfare, representation, and other societal beneficial goals. It is able to generalize from small-scale synthetic PB examples to large, real-world PB instances. It is able to learn existing aggregation rules but also generate new rules that adapt to diverse objectives, providing a more nuanced, compromise-driven solution for PB processes. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments with synthetic and real-world PB data, and can expand the use and deployment of PB solutions.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Policies for Crop Planning Decision Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In India, the majority of farmers are classified as small or marginal, making their livelihoods particularly vulnerable to economic losses due to market saturation and climate risks. Effective crop planning can significantly impact their expected income, yet existing decision support systems (DSS) often provide generic recommendations that fail to account for real-time market dynamics and the interactions among multiple farmers. In this paper, we evaluate the viability of three multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for optimizing total farmer income and promoting fairness in crop planning: Independent Q-Learning (IQL), where each farmer acts independently without coordination, Agent-by-Agent (ABA), which sequentially optimizes each farmer's policy in relation to the others, and the Multi-agent Rollout Policy, which jointly optimizes all farmers' actions for global reward maximization. Our results demonstrate that while IQL offers computational efficiency with linear runtime, it struggles with coordination among agents, leading to lower total rewards and an unequal distribution of income. Conversely, the Multi-agent Rollout policy achieves the highest total rewards and promotes equitable income distribution among farmers but requires significantly more computational resources, making it less practical for large numbers of agents. ABA strikes a balance between runtime efficiency and reward optimization, offering reasonable total rewards with acceptable fairness and scalability. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate MARL approaches in DSS to provide personalized and equitable crop planning recommendations, advancing the development of more adaptive and farmer-centric agricultural decision-making systems.</description>

      <title>Construction and optimization of health behavior prediction model for the elderly in smart elderly care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the intensification of global aging, health management of the elderly has become a focus of social attention. This study designs and implements a smart elderly care service model to address issues such as data diversity, health status complexity, long-term dependence and data loss, sudden changes in behavior, and data privacy in the prediction of health behaviors of the elderly. The model achieves accurate prediction and dynamic management of health behaviors of the elderly through modules such as multimodal data fusion, data loss processing, nonlinear prediction, emergency detection, and privacy protection. In the experimental design, based on multi-source data sets and market research results, the model demonstrates excellent performance in health behavior prediction, emergency detection, and personalized services. The experimental results show that the model can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of health behavior prediction and meet the actual application needs in the field of smart elderly care. In the future, with the integration of more data and further optimization of technology, the model will provide more powerful technical support for smart elderly care services.</description>

      <title>Crash Severity Risk Modeling Strategies under Data Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates crash severity risk modeling strategies for work zones involving large vehicles (i.e., trucks, buses, and vans) when there are crash data imbalance between low-severity (LS) and high-severity (HS) crashes. We utilized crash data, involving large vehicles in South Carolina work zones for the period between 2014 and 2018, which included 4 times more LS crashes compared to HS crashes. The objective of this study is to explore crash severity prediction performance of various models under different feature selection and data balancing techniques. The findings of this study highlight a disparity between LS and HS predictions, with less-accurate prediction of HS crashes compared to LS crashes due to class imbalance and feature overlaps between LS and HS crashes. Combining features from multiple feature selection techniques: statistical correlation, feature importance, recursive elimination, statistical tests, and mutual information, slightly improves HS crash prediction performance. Data balancing techniques such as NearMiss-1 and RandomUnderSampler, maximize HS recall when paired with certain prediction models, such as Bayesian Mixed Logit (BML), NeuralNet, and RandomForest, making them suitable for HS crash prediction. Conversely, RandomOverSampler, HS Class Weighting, and Kernel-based Synthetic Minority Oversampling (K-SMOTE), used with certain prediction models such as BML, CatBoost, and LightGBM, achieve a balanced performance, defined as achieving an equitable trade-off between LS and HS prediction performance metrics. These insights provide safety analysts with guidance to select models, feature selection techniques, and data balancing techniques that align with their specific safety objectives, offering a robust foundation for enhancing work-zone crash severity prediction.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Data Augmentation on Predictive Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In supervised machine learning (SML) research, large training datasets are essential for valid results. However, obtaining primary data in learning analytics (LA) is challenging. Data augmentation can address this by expanding and diversifying data, though its use in LA remains underexplored. This paper systematically compares data augmentation techniques and their impact on prediction performance in a typical LA task: prediction of academic outcomes. Augmentation is demonstrated on four SML models, which we successfully replicated from a previous LAK study based on AUC values. Among 21 augmentation techniques, SMOTE-ENN sampling performed the best, improving the average AUC by 0.01 and approximately halving the training time compared to the baseline models. In addition, we compared 99 combinations of chaining 21 techniques, and found minor, although statistically significant, improvements across models when adding noise to SMOTE-ENN (+0.014). Notably, some augmentation techniques significantly lowered predictive performance or increased performance fluctuation related to random chance. This paper's contribution is twofold. Primarily, our empirical findings show that sampling techniques provide the most statistically reliable performance improvements for LA applications of SML, and are computationally more efficient than deep generation methods with complex hyperparameter settings. Second, the LA community may benefit from validating a recent study through independent replication.</description>

      <title>CEGI: Measuring the trade-off between efficiency and carbon emissions for SLMs and VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the performance of Small Language Models (SLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) and evaluates the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions across 4 essential tasks: Image Captioning, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Dialogue Summarization and Text-to-SQL conversion. Various SLMs and VLMs belonging to the Qwen and LLaMA architecture family are chosen and variants based on model size in terms of the number of parameters, quantization level and fine-tuning parameters are evaluated. The model variant's performance and carbon emissions are calculated. To quantify the trade-off between model performance and carbon emissions, we introduce a novel metric called CEGI (Carbon Efficient Gain Index). This metric represents the carbon emission per unit percentage gain per million trainable parameters . This metric provides a normalized measure to compare model's efficiency in terms of performance improvement relative to their environmental cost. The experiment's outcome demonstrates that fine-tuning SLMs and VLMs can achieve performance levels comparable to Large Language Models (LLMs) while producing significantly less carbon emissions. Our findings suggest that the marginal gains in accuracy from larger models do not justify the substantial increase in carbon emissions. Leveraging lower-bit quantization levels, the proposed metric further enhances energy efficiency without compromising performance. This study highlights balancing high performance and environmental sustainability. It offers a valuable metric for selecting models suitable for environmentally-friendly AI development.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Analysis of Copyright Disputes and Generative AI Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a probabilistic approach to analyzing copyright infringement disputes by formalizing relevant judicial principles within a coherent framework based on the random-worlds method. It provides a structured analysis of key evidentiary principles, with a particular focus on the ``inverse ratio rule"--a controversial doctrine adopted by some courts. Although this rule has faced significant criticism, a formal proof demonstrates its validity, provided it is properly defined. Additionally, the paper examines the heightened copyright risks posed by generative AI, highlighting how extensive access to copyrighted material by generative models increases the risk of infringement. Utilizing the probabilistic approach, the Near Access-Free (NAF) condition, previously proposed as a potential mitigation strategy, is evaluated. The analysis reveals that while the NAF condition mitigates some infringement risks, its justifiability and efficacy are questionable in certain contexts. These findings demonstrate how a rigorous probabilistic approach can advance our understanding of copyright jurisprudence and its interaction with emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Teaching Cloud Infrastructure and Scalable Application Deployment in an Undergraduate Computer Science Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making successful use of cloud computing requires nuanced approaches to both system design and deployment methodology, involving reasoning about the elasticity, cost, and security models of cloud services. Building cloud-native applications without a firm understanding of the fundamentals of cloud engineering can leave students susceptible to cost and security pitfalls. Yet, cloud computing is not commonly taught at the undergraduate level. To address this gap, we designed an undergraduate-level course that frames cloud infrastructure deployment as a software engineering practice. Our course featured a number of hands-on assignments that gave students experience with modern, best-practice concepts and tools including infrastructure-as-code (IaC). We describe the design of the course, our experience teaching its initial offering, and provide our reflections on what worked well and potential areas for improvement. Our course material is available at https://infracourse.cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08802v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), specifically large language models like ChatGPT, has swiftly entered organizations without adequate governance, posing both opportunities and risks. Despite extensive debates on GenAI's transformative nature and regulatory measures, limited research addresses organizational governance, encompassing technical and business perspectives. Although numerous frameworks for governance of AI exist, it is not clear to what extent they apply to GenAI. Our review paper fills this gap by surveying recent works with the purpose of better understanding fundamental characteristics of GenAI and adjusting prior frameworks specifically towards GenAI governance within companies. To do so, it extends Nickerson's framework development processes to include prior conceptualizations.

      <title>Developing Story: Case Studies of Generative AI's Use in Journalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Journalists are among the many users of large language models (LLMs). To better understand the journalist-AI interactions, we conduct a study of LLM usage by two news agencies through browsing the WildChat dataset, identifying candidate interactions, and verifying them by matching to online published articles. Our analysis uncovers instances where journalists provide sensitive material such as confidential correspondence with sources or articles from other agencies to the LLM as stimuli and prompt it to generate articles, and publish these machine-generated articles with limited intervention (median output-publication ROUGE-L of 0.62). Based on our findings, we call for further research into what constitutes responsible use of AI, and the establishment of clear guidelines and best practices on using LLMs in a journalistic context.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review on Process Mining for Curricular Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Educational Process Mining (EPM) is a data analysis technique that is used to improve educational processes. It is based on Process Mining (PM), which involves gathering records (logs) of events to discover process models and analyze the data from a process-centric perspective. One specific application of EPM is curriculum mining, which focuses on understanding the learning program students follow to achieve educational goals. This is important for institutional curriculum decision-making and quality improvement. Therefore, academic institutions can benefit from organizing the existing techniques, capabilities, and limitations. We conducted a systematic literature review to identify works on applying PM to curricular analysis and provide insights for further research. We reviewed 27 primary studies published across seven major databases. Our analysis classified these studies into five main research objectives: discovery of educational trajectories, identification of deviations in student behavior, bottleneck analysis, dropout / stopout analysis, and generation of recommendations. Key findings highlight challenges such as standardization to facilitate cross-university analysis, better integration of process and data mining techniques, and improved tools for educational stakeholders. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape in curricular process mining and outlines specific research opportunities to support more robust and actionable curricular analyses in educational settings.</description>

      <title>On the Unknowable Limits to Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short Correspondence critiques the classic dichotomization of prediction error into reducible and irreducible components, noting that certain types of error can be eliminated at differential speeds. We propose an improved analytical framework that better distinguishes epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty, emphasizing that predictability depends on information sets and cautioning against premature claims of unpredictability.</description>

      <title>TransFair: Transferring Fairness from Ocular Disease Classification to Progression Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in automated disease classification significantly reduces healthcare costs and improves the accessibility of services. However, this transformation has given rise to concerns about the fairness of AI, which disproportionately affects certain groups, particularly patients from underprivileged populations. Recently, a number of methods and large-scale datasets have been proposed to address group performance disparities. Although these methods have shown effectiveness in disease classification tasks, they may fall short in ensuring fair prediction of disease progression, mainly because of limited longitudinal data with diverse demographics available for training a robust and equitable prediction model. In this paper, we introduce TransFair to enhance demographic fairness in progression prediction for ocular diseases. TransFair aims to transfer a fairness-enhanced disease classification model to the task of progression prediction with fairness preserved. Specifically, we train a fair EfficientNet, termed FairEN, equipped with a fairness-aware attention mechanism using extensive data for ocular disease classification. Subsequently, this fair classification model is adapted to a fair progression prediction model through knowledge distillation, which aims to minimize the latent feature distances between the classification and progression prediction models. We evaluate FairEN and TransFair for fairness-enhanced ocular disease classification and progression prediction using both two-dimensional (2D) and 3D retinal images. Extensive experiments and comparisons with models with and without considering fairness learning show that TransFair effectively enhances demographic equity in predicting ocular disease progression.</description>
