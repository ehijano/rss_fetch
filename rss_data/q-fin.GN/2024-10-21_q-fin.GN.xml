      <title>Corporate Non-Disclosure Disputes: Equilibrium Settlements with a Probabilistic Burden of Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The literature of damages-assessment under the US disclosure 10b-5 rule proposes multiple formulations for a "proper measure" based on the legal "out-of-pocket" principle, i.e. the difference between original and an observed later price consequent on revealed information, with suspected prior disclosure omission. Key is the evolution of a putative "price-but for the omission". Proposed procedures include back-casting and forward-casting (between two dates, or via multiple intervening dates) -- Ferrell and Saha (2011). We derive, consistently with fair-pricing, a new model of induced litigation-behaviour referring to prices at and just before the revelation date. Parameters incentivise withholding of price-sensitive news under a `sparing' strategy.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Finance: Impact on Financial Services and required DeFi Literacy in 2034</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14173v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the potential future impact of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) on the financial services industry and the competencies financial professionals will require in a decade from now, in 2034. Using a survey of 109 experts from industry, academia, and regulatory bodies, the research highlights growing confidence in DeFi's potential to reshape critical areas such as risk management and operations. Over 40% of respondents anticipate high levels of DeFi adoption by 2034. However, the study identifies critical issues that need to be addressed, particularly in the areas of data management &amp; privacy, and security. These concerns, alongside regulatory challenges, underscore the need for financial institutions to prepare carefully. The findings also suggest that strategic competencies, sector-specific domain expertise, and technological skills will become increasingly vital. The insights offered are valuable for regulators, policymakers, and industry professionals, emphasizing the need for continuous upskilling to remain competitive in an evolving financial services landscape.</description>

      <title>Social Dynamics of Consumer Response: A Unified Framework Integrating Statistical Physics and Marketing Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how consumers react to advertising inputs is essential for marketers aiming to optimize advertising strategies and improve campaign effectiveness. This study examines the complex nature of consumer behaviour by applying theoretical frameworks derived from physics and social psychology. We present an innovative equation that captures the relation between spending on advertising and consumer response, using concepts such as symmetries, scaling laws, and phase transitions. By validating our equation against well-known models such as the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, we prove its effectiveness in accurately representing the complexity of consumer response dynamics. The analysis emphasizes the importance of key model parameters, such as marketing effectiveness, response sensitivity, and behavioural sensitivity, in influencing consumer behaviour. The work explores the practical implications for advertisers and marketers, as well as discussing the limitations and future research directions. In summary, this study provides a thorough framework for comprehending and forecasting consumer reactions to advertising, which has implications for optimizing advertising strategies and allocating resources.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Method for Predicting Mergers and Acquisitions: Temporal Dynamic Industry Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07298v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Merger and Acquisition (M&amp;A) activities play a vital role in market consolidation and restructuring. For acquiring companies, M&amp;A serves as a key investment strategy, with one primary goal being to attain complementarities that enhance market power in competitive industries. In addition to intrinsic factors, a M&amp;A behavior of a firm is influenced by the M&amp;A activities of its peers, a phenomenon known as the "peer effect." However, existing research often fails to capture the rich interdependencies among M&amp;A events within industry networks.
  An effective M&amp;A predictive model should offer deal-level predictions without requiring ad-hoc feature engineering or data rebalancing. Such a model would predict the M&amp;A behaviors of rival firms and provide specific recommendations for both bidder and target firms. However, most current models only predict one side of an M&amp;A deal, lack firm-specific recommendations, and rely on arbitrary time intervals that impair predictive accuracy. Additionally, due to the sparsity of M&amp;A events, existing models require data rebalancing, which introduces bias and limits their real-world applicability.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Temporal Dynamic Industry Network (TDIN) model, leveraging temporal point processes and deep learning to capture complex M&amp;A interdependencies without ad-hoc data adjustments. The temporal point process framework inherently models event sparsity, eliminating the need for data rebalancing. Empirical evaluations on M&amp;A data from January 1997 to December 2020 validate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting M&amp;A events and offering actionable, deal-level recommendations.</description>
