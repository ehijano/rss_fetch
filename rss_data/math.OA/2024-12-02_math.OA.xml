      <title>Operator Algebras of Universal Quantum Homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two unital C*-algebras $A$ and $B$, we study, when it exists, the universal unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{U}(A,B)$ generated by the coefficients of a unital $*$-homomorphism $\rho\,:\, A\rightarrow B\otimes\mathcal{U}(A,B)$. When $B$ is finite dimensional, it is well known that $\mathcal{U}(A,B)$ exists and we study in this case properties LP, RFD, primitiveness and the UCT as well as $K$-theory. We also construct a reduced version of $\mathcal{U}(A,B)$ for which we study exactness, nuclearity, simplicity, absence of non-trivial projection and $K$-theory. Then, we consider the von Neumann algebra generated by the reduced version and study factoriality, amenability, fullness, primeness, absence of Cartan, Connes' invariants, Haagerup property and Connes' embeddability. Next, we consider the case when $B$ is infinite dimensional: we show that for any non-trivial separable unital $C^*$-algebra $A$, $\mathcal{U}(A,B)$ exists if and only if $B$ is finite dimensional. Nevertheless, we show that there exists a unique unital locally $C^*$-algebra generated by the coefficients of a unital continuous $*$-homomorphism $\rho\,:\, A\rightarrow B\otimes\mathcal{U}(A,B)$. Finally, we study a natural quantum semigroup structure on $\mathcal{U}(A,A)$.</description>

      <title>A new definition of outsplitting on $k$-graphs preserving Morita equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher rank graphs, also known as $k$-graphs, are a $k$-dimensional generalization of directed graphs and a rich source of examples of $C^*$-algebras. In the present paper, we contribute to the geometric classification program for $k$-graph $C^*$-algebras by introducing a new move on $k$-graphs, called LiMaR-split, which is a generalization of outsplit for directed graphs. We show, under one additional assumption, that LiMaR-split preserves the $k$-graph $C^*$-algebras up to Morita equivalence.</description>

      <title>Continuous symmetry entails the Jordan algebra structure of quantum theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry postulates play a crucial role in various reconstructions of quantum mechanics. Discrete and continuous symmetries are considered in different approaches. The continuous case better matches the physical needs for mathematical models of dynamical processes and is studied here. Applying the representation theory of the orthomodular lattices, we show that the continuous symmetry, together with spectrality and a few further requirements, entails that the underlying mathematical structure of a finite-dimensional generalized probabilistic theory becomes a simple Euclidean Jordan algebra.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrics on crossed products with groups of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how to equip the crossed product between a group of polynomial growth and a compact quantum metric space with a compact quantum metric space structure. When the quantum metric on the base space arises from a spectral triple, which is compatible with the action of the group, we furthermore show that the crossed product becomes a spectral metric space. Lastly, we analyse the spectral triple at the crossed product level from the point of view of unbounded $KK$-theory and show that it arises as an internal Kasparov product of unbounded Kasparov modules.</description>

      <title>Post-Hopf algebra in non-commutative probability theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study $\mathcal{O}$-operators and post-Lie products over the same Lie algebra compatible in a certain sense. We prove that the group product corresponding to the formal integration of the Lie algebra, which is adjacent to the sum of two compatible post-Lie products, can be factorized in a way reminiscent of the classical Semenov-Tian-Shanskii factorization. In the second part, we explore applications in non-commutative probability. We introduce new transforms that facilitate the computation of conditionally free and conditionally monotone multiplicative convolutions involving operator-valued non-commutative distributions.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Stieltjes algebras, decomposable Fourier multipliers and amenability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.13823v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Fourier-Stieltjes algebra $\mathrm{B}(G)$ of a discrete group $G$ is isometrically isomorphic to the algebra $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G)$ of decomposable Fourier multipliers on the group von Neumann algebra $\mathrm{VN}(G)$. In contrast, we show that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G) \neq \mathrm{B}(G)$ for some classes of non-discrete locally compact groups, while we prove that $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{dec}}(G) = \mathrm{B}(G)$ holds for any (unimodular) inner amenable locally compact group. To prove these results, we leverage groupoid theory and investigate the problem of whether a contractive projection exists, preserving complete positivity, from the space of normal completely bounded operators on $\mathrm{VN}(G)$ onto the space $\mathfrak{M}^{\infty,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers. We provide an affirmative solution in the inner amenable case and demonstrate that such projections do not exist for non-amenable connected locally compact groups. Further, we investigate whether the space $\mathfrak{M}^{p,\mathrm{cb}}(G)$ of completely bounded Fourier multipliers on the noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-space $\mathrm{L}^p(\mathrm{VN}(G))$ is complemented in the space of completely bounded operators, where $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. Using doubling metrics on Lie groups and structural results from the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem, we establish that any (unimodular) amenable locally compact group admits compatible bounded projections at the levels $p=1$ and $p=\infty$, which has applications to decomposable Fourier multipliers. Moreover, we present a new characterization of amenability.</description>

      <title>Graphon-Theoretic Approach to Central Limit Theorems for $\epsilon$-Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem for the sum of $\epsilon$-independent random variables, extending both the classical and free probability setting. Central to our approach is the use of graphon limits to characterize the limiting distribution, which depends on the asymptotic structure of the underlying graphs governing $\epsilon$-independence. This framework yields a range of exotic limit laws, interpolating between free and classical cases and allowing for mixtures such as free and classical convolutions of the semi-circle and Gaussian distributions. We provide a complete characterization of the limiting law, captured as the distribution of an operator on the full Fock space. We extend our main result to the multivariate setting as well as the non-identically distributed case. The proof provides insights into the combinatorial structure of $\epsilon$-independence, shedding light on a natural connection between the graph of crossings of the partitions involved and the graphon limit of the graphs of $\epsilon$-independence.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Representation of the Density Operator: Bopp Pseudodifferential Calculus and Moyal Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bopp shifts, introduced in 1956, played a pivotal role in the statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics. As demonstrated in our previous work, Bopp's construction provides a phase-space perspective of quantum mechanics that is closely connected to the Moyal star product and its role in deformation quantization. In this paper, we both review and expand on our exploration of Bopp quantization, emphasizing its relationship with the Moyal product and its applications in elementary deformation quantization. Notably, we apply these constructions to the density operator, which represents mixed states in quantum mechanics, offering novel insights into its role within this framework.</description>
