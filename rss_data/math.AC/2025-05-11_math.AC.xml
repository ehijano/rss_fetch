      <title>Algebraically Closed Fields in Equivariant Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Burklund-Schlank-Yuan abstraction of ``algebraically closed" to ``Nullstellensatzian", we show that a $G$-Tambara functor is Nullstellensatzian if and only if it is the coinduction of an algebraically closed field (for any finite group $G$). As a consequence we deduce an equivalence between the $K$-theory spectrum of any Nullstellensatzian $G$-Tambara functor with the $K$ theory of some algebraically closed field.</description>

      <title>Numerical characterizations for integral dependence of graded ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R=\oplus_{m\geq 0}R_m$ be a standard graded equidimensional ring over a field $R_0$, and $I\subseteq J$ be two non-nilpotent graded ideals in $R$. Then we give a set of numerical characterizations of the integral dependence of $I$ and $J$ in terms of certain multiplicities. A novelty of this approach is that it does not involve localization and only requires checking computable and well-studied invariants.
  In particular, we show the following: let $S=R[y]$, $\mathsf{I} = IS$ and $\mathsf{J} = JS$ and $\bf d$ be the maximum of the generating degrees of both $I$ and $J$. Let $c&gt;{\bf d}$ be any given integer. Then $$\overline{I} = \overline{J}\iff e\big(S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big) = e\big(S[\mathsf{J}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big),$$ where $e\big(S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big)$ denotes the Hilbert-Samuel multiplicity of the standard graded domain $S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}} = \oplus_{n\geq 0}(\mathsf{I}^n)_{cn}t^n$. Further, if $I$ is of finite colength in $R$ then $e\big(S[\mathsf{I}t]_{\Delta_{(c,1)}}\big) = c^de(R) - e(I,R)$.
  If $R$ is also a domain, then other numerical criteria are the following: \begin{align*} \overline{I} = \overline{J} &amp; \iff \varepsilon(I)=\varepsilon(J)\;\;\mbox{and}\;\; e_i(R[It]) = e_i(R[Jt])\;\;\mbox{for all}\;\; 0\leq i &lt;\dim(R/I), \end{align*} where $\varepsilon(I)$ denotes the epsilon multiplicity of $I$, and $e_i(R[It])$'s are the mixed multiplicities of the Rees algebra $R[It]$. The relation between $e_i(S[\mathsf{I}t])$ and the polar multiplicities of $\mathsf{I}_{\geq {\bf d}}$ provides another criterion in terms of polar multiplicities of $\mathsf{I}_{\geq {\bf d}}$.
  The first two characterizations generalize Rees's classical result for ideals of finite colengths. Apart from several well-established results, the proofs of these results use the theory of density functions, which was developed in arXiv:2311.17679.</description>

      <title>Generalization of semi-regular sequences: Maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree, variants of genericness, and related conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, the notion of semi-regular sequences, originally proposed by Fr\"oberg, becomes very important not only in Mathematics, but also in Information Science, in particular Cryptology. For example, it is highly expected that randomly generated polynomials form a semi-regular sequence, and based on this observation, secure cryptosystems based on polynomial systems can be devised. In this paper, we deal with a semi-regular sequence and its extension, named a generalized cryptographic semi-regular sequence, and give precise analysis on the complexity of computing a Gr\"obner basis of the ideal generated by such a sequence with help of several regularities of the ideal related to Lazard's bound on maximal Gr\"{o}bner basis degree and other bounds. We also study the genericness of the property that a sequence is semi-regular, and its variants related to Fr\"oberg's conjecture. Moreover, we discuss on the genericness of another important property that the initial ideal is weakly reverse lexicographic, related to Moreno-Soc\'{i}as' conjecture, and show some criteria to examine whether both Fr\"oberg's conjecture and Moreno-Soc\'{i}as' one hold at the same time.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers of normal edge rings (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the Betti numbers of the edge rings of multi-path graphs using the \emph{induced-subgraph approach} introduced in \cite{WL1}. Here, a multi-path graph refers to a simple graph composed of several paths that have the same starting point and the same ending point. Special cases include the graph $G_{r,d}$ introduced in \cite{GHK}, the graph $G_{r,s,d}$ introduced in \cite{NN}, and the graph $B_{\underline{\ell},h}$ introduced in \cite{LZ}. In particular, we show that all the multi-graded Betti numbers of a multi-path graph are the top multi-graded Betti numbers of some of its induced subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity free covering of a graded manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a multiplicity-free covering of a graded manifold. We compute its deck transformation group, which is isomorphic to the permutation group $S_n$. We show that it is not possible to construct a covering of a graded manifold in the category of $n$-fold vector bundles. As an application of our research, we give a new conceptual proof of the equivalence of the categories of graded manifolds and symmetric $n$-fold vector bundles.</description>
