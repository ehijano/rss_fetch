      <title>Synthesis of omnidirectional path loss model based on directional model and multi-elliptical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology offers high throughput but has a limited radio range, necessitating the use of directional antennas or beamforming systems such as massive MIMO. Path loss (PL) models using narrow-beam antennas are known as directional models, while those using omnidirectional antennas are referred to as omnidirectional models. To standardize the analysis, omnidirectional PL models for mmWave ranges have been introduced, including TR 38.901 by 3GPP, which is based on measurements from directional antennas. However, synthesizing these measurements can be complex and time-consuming. This study proposes a numerical approach to derive an omnidirectional model from directional data using multi-elliptical geometry. We assessed the effectiveness of this method against existing PL models for mmWaves that are available in the literature.</description>

      <title>MTLoc: A Confidence-Based Source-Free Domain Adaptation Approach For Indoor Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various deep learning models have been developed for indoor localization based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. However, they often require adaptation to ensure accurate tracking in new target operational domains. To address this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been proposed to align pre-trained models with data from target environments. However, they rely on large annotated datasets from the initial domain (source). Source data access is limited by privacy, storage, computational, and transfer constraints. Although many source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) methods address these constraints in classification, applying them to regression models for localization remains challenging. Indeed, target datasets for indoor localization are typically small, with few features and samples, and are noisy. Adapting regression models requires high-confidence target pseudo-annotation to avoid over-training. In this paper, a specialized mean-teacher method called MTLoc is proposed for SFDA. MTLoc updates the student network using noisy data and teacher-generated pseudo-labels. The teacher network maintains stability through exponential moving averages. To further ensure robustness, the teacher's pseudo-labels are refined using k-nearest neighbor correction. MTLoc allows for self-supervised learning on target data, facilitating effective adaptation to dynamic and noisy indoor environments. Validated using real-world data from our experimental setup with INLAN Inc., our results show that MTLoc achieves high localization accuracy under challenging conditions, significantly reducing localization error compared to baselines, including the state-of-the-art adversarial UDA approach with access to source data.</description>

      <title>Robust Transmission of Punctured Text with Large Language Model-based Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent advancements in deep learning, semantic communication which transmits only task-oriented features, has rapidly emerged. However, since feature extraction relies on learning-based models, its performance fundamentally depends on the training dataset or tasks. For practical scenarios, it is essential to design a model that demonstrates robust performance regardless of dataset or tasks. In this correspondence, we propose a novel text transmission model that selects and transmits only a few characters and recovers the missing characters at the receiver using a large language model (LLM). Additionally, we propose a novel importance character extractor (ICE), which selects transmitted characters to enhance LLM recovery performance. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed filter selection by ICE outperforms random filter selection, which selects transmitted characters randomly. Moreover, the proposed model exhibits robust performance across different datasets and tasks and outperforms traditional bit-based communication in low signal-to-noise ratio conditions.</description>

      <title>MetaFAP: Meta-Learning for Frequency Agnostic Prediction of Metasurface Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces, and in particular reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), are revolutionizing wireless communications by dynamically controlling electromagnetic waves. Recent wireless communication advancements necessitate broadband and multi-band RIS, capable of supporting dynamic spectrum access and carrier aggregation from sub-6 GHz to mmWave and THz bands. The inherent frequency dependence of meta-atom resonances degrades performance as operating conditions change, making real-time, frequency-agnostic metasurface property prediction crucial for practical deployment. Yet, accurately predicting metasurface behavior across different frequencies remains challenging. Traditional simulations struggle with complexity, while standard deep learning models often overfit or generalize poorly. To address this, we introduce MetaFAP (Meta-Learning for Frequency-Agnostic Prediction), a novel framework built on the meta-learning paradigm for predicting metasurface properties. By training on diverse frequency tasks, MetaFAP learns broadly applicable patterns. This allows it to adapt quickly to new spectral conditions with minimal data, solving key limitations of existing methods. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that MetaFAP reduces prediction errors by an order of magnitude in MSE and MAE while maintaining high Pearson correlations. Remarkably, it achieves inference in less than a millisecond, bypassing the computational bottlenecks of traditional simulations, which take minutes per unit cell and scale poorly with array size. These improvements enable real-time RIS optimization in dynamic environments and support scalable, frequency-agnostic designs. MetaFAP thus bridges the gap between intelligent electromagnetic systems and practical deployment, offering a critical tool for next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A Cost Effective Deaf-mute Electronic Assistant System Using Myo Armband and Smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Communication is essential feature in human communities. For some reasons, deaf-mute disabled people lose their ability to hear, speak, or both which makes them suffer to communicate and convey their ideas, especially with normal people. Sign language is the solution for communication in the deaf-mute societies, but it is difficult for the rest of people to understand. Therefore, in this work, a cost effective Deaf-Mute Electronic Assistant System (DMEAS) has been developed to help in solving the communication problem between the deaf-mute people and the normal people. The system hardware consists only of a Myo armband from \textit{Thalmic Labs} and a smartphone. The Myo armband reads the electromyographic signals of the muscles of the disabled person's forearm through non-invasive, surface mounted electrodes (sEMG) and sends the data directly to the smartphone via Bluetooth. The smartphone will recognize and interpret them to a predefined word depending on the hand gestures. The recognized gesture will be displayed on the smartphone screen as well as displaying the text of the word related to the gesture and its voice record. All the EMG signals are processed using discrete wavelet transform and classified by neural network classifier. The system was extensively tested through experiments by normal subjects to prove its functionality.</description>

      <title>A low-PAPR Pilot Design and Optimization for OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has been proposed recently as a new waveform in the context of doubly-selective multi-path channels. This article proposes a novel pilot design that improves OTFS spectral efficiency (SE) while reducing its peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Instead of adopting an embedded data-orthogonal pilot for channel estimation, our scheme relies on Chu sequences superimposed to data symbols. We optimize the construction by investigating the best energy split between pilot and data symbols. Two equalizers, and an iterative channel estimation and equalization procedure are considered. We present extensive numerical results of relevant performance metrics, including the normalized mean squared error of the estimator, bit error rate, PAPR and SE. Our results show that, while the embedded pilot scheme estimates the channel more accurately, our approach yields a better tradeoff by achieving much higher spectral efficiency and lower PAPR.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of Radar Receive Filter and Unimodular ISAC Waveform with Sidelobe Level Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has been considered a key feature of next-generation wireless networks. This paper investigates the joint design of the radar receive filter and dual-functional transmit waveform for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) ISAC system. While optimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the radar receive spatial response and maximizing the achievable rate at the communication receiver, besides the constraints of full-power radar receiving filter and unimodular transmit sequence, we control the maximum range sidelobe level, which is often overlooked in existing ISAC waveform design literature, for better radar imaging performance. To solve the formulated optimization problem with convex and nonconvex constraints, we propose an inexact augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) algorithm. For each subproblem in the proposed inexact ALM algorithm, we custom-design a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) scheme with closed-form solutions for all blocks of variable to enhance the computational efficiency. Convergence analysis shows that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to provide a stationary and feasible solution. Extensive simulations are performed to investigate the impact of different system parameters on communication and radar imaging performance. Comparison with the existing works shows the superiority of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Movable-Element RIS-Aided Wireless Communications: An Element-Wise Position Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A point-to-point movable element (ME) enabled reconfigurable intelligent surface (ME-RIS) communication system is investigated, where each element position can be flexibly adjusted to create favorable channel conditions. For maximizing the communication rate, an efficient ME position optimization approach is proposed. Specifically, by characterizing the cascaded channel power gain in an element-wise manner, the position of each ME is iteratively updated by invoking the successive convex approximation method. Numerical results unveil that 1) the proposed element-wise ME position optimization algorithm outperforms the gradient descent algorithm; and 2) the ME-RIS significantly improves the communication rate compared to the conventional RIS with fixed-position elements.</description>

      <title>Waveform and Filter Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication Against Signal-dependent Modulated Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in the presence of signal-dependent modulated jamming (SDMJ). Our goal is to suppress jamming while carrying out simultaneous communications and sensing. We minimize the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the mismatch filter output for the transmitted waveform and the integrated level (IL) of the mismatch filter output for the jamming, under the constraints of the loss in-processing gain (LPG) and the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the transmitted waveform. Meanwhile, the similarity constraint is introduced for information-bearing transmit waveform. We develop a decoupled majorization minimization (DMM) algorithm to solve the proposed multi-constrained optimization problem. In contrast to the existing approaches, the proposed algorithm transforms the difficult optimization problem involving two variables into two parallel sub-problems with one variable, thus significantly speeding up the convergence rate. Furthermore, fast Fourier transform (FFT) is introduced to compute the closed-form solution of each sub-problem, giving rise to a greatly reduced computation complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed ISAC system which strikes a proper trade-off among sensing and jamming suppression.</description>

      <title>Gridless Chirp Parameter Retrieval via Constrained Two-Dimensional Atomic Norm Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the fundamental problem of estimating chirp parameters from a mixture of linear chirp signals. Unlike most previous methods, which solve the problem by discretizing the parameter space and then estimating the chirp parameters, we propose a gridless approach by reformulating the inverse problem as a constrained two-dimensional atomic norm minimization from structured measurements. This reformulation enables the direct estimation of continuous-valued parameters without discretization, thereby resolving the issue of basis mismatch. An approximate semidefinite programming (SDP) is employed to solve the proposed convex program. Additionally, a dual polynomial is constructed to certify the optimality of the atomic decomposition. Numerical simulations demonstrate that exact recovery of chirp parameters is achievable using the proposed atomic norm minimization.</description>

      <title>Sig2text, a Vision-language model for Non-cooperative Radar Signal Parsing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic non-cooperative analysis of intercepted radar signals is essential for intelligent equipment in both military and civilian domains. Accurate modulation identification and parameter estimation enable effective signal classification, threat assessment, and the development of countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a symbolic approach for radar signal recognition and parameter estimation based on a vision-language model that combines context-free grammar with time-frequency representation of radar waveforms. The proposed model, called Sig2text, leverages the power of vision transformers for time-frequency feature extraction and transformer-based decoders for symbolic parsing of radar waveforms. By treating radar signal recognition as a parsing problem, Sig2text can effectively recognize and parse radar waveforms with different modulation types and parameters. We evaluate the performance of Sig2text on a synthetic radar signal dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in recognizing and parsing radar waveforms with varying modulation types and parameters. The training code of the model is available at https://github.com/Na-choneko/sig2text.</description>

      <title>Variational Message Passing-based Multiobject Tracking for MIMO-Radars using Raw Sensor Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a direct multiobject tracking (MOT) approach for MIMO-radar signals that operates on raw sensor data via variational message passing (VMP). Unlike classical track-before-detect (TBD) methods, which often rely on simplified likelihood models and exclude nuisance parameters (e.g., object amplitudes, noise variance), our method adopts a superimposed signal model and employs a mean-field approximation to jointly estimate both object existence and object states. By considering correlations within in the radar signal due to closely spaced objects and jointly estimating nuisance parameters, the proposed method achieves robust performance for close-by objects and in low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. Our numerical evaluation based on MIMO-radar signals demonstrate that our VMP-based direct-MOT method outperforms a detect-then-track (DTT) pipeline comprising a super-resolution sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based estimation stage followed by classical MOT using global nearest neighbour data association and a Kalman filter.</description>

      <title>Joint Hybrid Precoding and Multi-IRS Optimization for mmWave MU-MISO Communication Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper attempts to jointly optimize the hybrid precoding (HP) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) beamforming matrices in a multi-IRS-aided mmWave communication network, utilizing the Alamouti scheme at the base station (BS). Considering the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as the objective function, the underlying problem is cast as an optimization problem, which is shown to be non-convex in general. To tackle the problem, noting that the unknown matrices contribute multiplicatively to the objective function, they are reformulated into two new matrices with rank constraints. Then, using the so-called inner approximation (IA) technique in conjunction with majorization-minimization (MM) approaches, these new matrices are solved iteratively. From one of these matrices, the IRS beamforming matrices can be effectively extracted. Meanwhile, HP precoding matrices can be solved separately through a new optimization problem aimed at minimizing the Euclidean distance between the fully digital (FD) precoder and HP analog/digital precoders. This is achieved through the use of a modified block coordinate descent (MBCD) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms various benchmark schemes in terms of achieving a higher achievable rate.</description>

      <title>Satellite Selection for In-Band Coexistence of Dense LEO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spectrum sharing between two dense low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, an incumbent primary system and a secondary system that must respect interference protection constraints on the primary system. In particular, we propose a secondary satellite selection framework and algorithm that maximizes capacity while guaranteeing that the time-average interference and absolute interference inflicted upon each primary ground user never exceeds specified thresholds. We solve this NP-hard constrained, combinatorial satellite selection problem through Lagrangian relaxation to decompose it into simpler problems which can then be solved through subgradient methods. A high-fidelity simulation is developed based on public FCC filings and technical specifications of the Starlink and Kuiper systems. We use this case study to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach and that explicit protection is indeed necessary for healthy coexistence. We further demonstrate that deep learning models can be used to predict the primary satellite system associations, which helps the secondary system avoid inflicting excessive interference and maximize its own capacity.</description>

      <title>A Sigma Point-based Low Complexity Algorithm for Multipath-based SLAM in MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach in wireless networks to jointly obtain position information of transmitters/receivers and information of the propagation environment. MP-SLAM models specular reflections at flat surfaces as virtual anchors (VAs), which are mirror images of base stations (BSs). Particlebased methods offer high flexibility and can approximate posterior probability density functions (PDFs) with complex shapes. However, they often require a large number of particles to counteract degeneracy in high-dimensional parameter spaces, leading to high runtimes. Conversely using too few particles leads to reduced estimation accuracy. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity algorithm for MP-SLAM in MIMO systems that employs sigma point (SP) approximations via the sum-product algorithm (SPA). Specifically, we use Gaussian approximations through SP-transformations, drastically reducing computational overhead without sacrificing accuracy. Nonlinearities are handled by SP updates, and moment matching approximates the Gaussian mixtures arising from probabilistic data association (PDA). Numerical results show that our method achieves considerably shorter runtimes than particle-based schemes, with comparable or even superior performance.</description>

      <title>Inductive Position Sensors based on Coupling of Coils on Printed Circuit Boards for Demanding Automotive Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotor position feedback is required in many industrial and automotive applications, e.g. for field-oriented control of brushless motors. Traditionally, magnetic sensors, resolvers or optical encoders are used to measure the rotor position. However, advances in inductive sensing concepts enable a low-cost, high-precision position measurement principle which is robust against magnetic stray fields exceeding 4000 A/m. The operating principle is based on the coupling of a transmitter coil with several receiver coils in the megahertz frequency range. The coils are part of a printed circuit board (PCB) which also comprises circuitry for demodulation and signal processing. The transmitter coil induces eddy currents in an electrically conductive passive coupling element, which provides position-dependent amplitude modulation. The voltage induced in the receiver coils encodes the rotor angle information, typically in quadrature signals. The coupling element requires no rare-earth materials and can be made of stainless steel, for instance. The PCB-based design of the sensor offers considerable flexibility in optimizing its performance. By tailoring the coil geometry and arrangement, accuracy, air gap and overall sensor dimensions can be adjusted to meet a broad range of application-specific requirements. A sensor design sample exhibits a mechanical angle error less than 0.02{\deg} (0.1{\deg} electrical) in both, finite-element simulation and test bench measurement, with good agreement.</description>

      <title>Pruning-Based TinyML Optimization of Machine Learning Models for Anomaly Detection in Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the growing need for real-time processing on IoT devices, optimizing machine learning (ML) models' size, latency, and computational efficiency is essential. This paper investigates a pruning method for anomaly detection in resource-constrained environments, specifically targeting Electric Vehicle Charging Infrastructure (EVCI). Using the CICEVSE2024 dataset, we trained and optimized three models-Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and XGBoost-through hyperparameter tuning with Optuna, further refining them using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-based feature selection (FS) and unstructured pruning techniques. The optimized models achieved significant reductions in model size and inference times, with only a marginal impact on their performance. Notably, our findings indicate that, in the context of EVCI, pruning and FS can enhance computational efficiency while retaining critical anomaly detection capabilities.</description>

      <title>Project Jenkins: Turning Monkey Neural Data into Robotic Arm Movement, and Back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Project Jenkins explores how neural activity in the brain can be decoded into robotic movement and, conversely, how movement patterns can be used to generate synthetic neural data. Using real neural data recorded from motor and premotor cortex areas of a macaque monkey named Jenkins, we develop models for decoding (converting brain signals into robotic arm movements) and encoding (simulating brain activity corresponding to a given movement). For the interface between the brain simulation and the physical world, we utilized Koch v1.1 leader and follower robotic arms. We developed an interactive web console that allows users to generate synthetic brain data from joystick movements in real time. Our results are a step towards brain-controlled robotics, prosthetics, and enhancing normal motor function. By accurately modeling brain activity, we take a step toward flexible brain-computer interfaces that generalize beyond predefined movements. To support the research community, we provide open source tools for both synthetic data generation and neural decoding, fostering reproducibility and accelerating progress.

      <title>Communication-Efficient Distributed On-Device LLM Inference Over Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across various application domains, but their enormous sizes and computational demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address this issue, we propose a novel distributed on-device LLM inference framework that leverages tensor parallelism to partition the neural network tensors (e.g., weight matrices) of one LLM across multiple edge devices for collaborative inference. A key challenge in tensor parallelism is the frequent all-reduce operations for aggregating intermediate layer outputs across participating devices, which incurs significant communication overhead. To alleviate this bottleneck, we propose an over-the-air computation (AirComp) approach that harnesses the analog superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels to perform fast all-reduce steps. To utilize the heterogeneous computational capabilities of edge devices and mitigate communication distortions, we investigate a joint model assignment and transceiver optimization problem to minimize the average transmission error. The resulting mixed-timescale stochastic non-convex optimization problem is intractable, and we propose an efficient two-stage algorithm to solve it. Moreover, we prove that the proposed algorithm converges almost surely to a stationary point of the original problem. Comprehensive simulation results will show that the proposed framework outperforms existing benchmark schemes, achieving up to 5x inference speed acceleration and improving inference accuracy.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Modes and Interference in the Spectrogram of Multicomponent Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how the spectrogram of multicomponent signals can be decomposed into a mode part and an interference part. We explore two approaches: (i) a variational method inspired by texture-geometry decomposition in image processing, and (ii) a supervised learning approach using a U-Net architecture, trained on a dataset encompassing diverse interference patterns and noise conditions. Once the interference component is identified, we explain how it enables us to define a criterion to locally adapt the window length used in the definition of the spectrogram, for the sake of improving ridge detection in the presence of close modes. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages and limitations of both approaches for spectrogram decomposition, highlighting their potential for enhancing time-frequency analysis in the presence of strong interference.</description>

      <title>A Robust Routing Protocol for 5G Mesh Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a novel routing protocol suitable for ad-hoc networks with dynamically changing topologies, such as DECT 2020 NR (NR+) systems, which often lead to missing links between the nodes and thus, incomplete or inefficient routes. A key point of the proposed protocol is the combination of network discovery and matrix completion techniques, which allow the nodes to establish communication paths efficiently and reliably. Additionally, multihop localization is performed to estimate the location of the nodes without needing to broadcast each node's geographical position, thus preserving privacy during the routing process and enabling nodes in the network to independently find potentially missing paths in a decentralized manner instead of flooding the whole network. Simulation results illustrate the good performance of the proposed technique in terms of the average number of hops of the obtained routes in different scenarios, with different network densities and amounts of incompleteness.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Based Beamformed Resource Allocation in Standalone Millimeter-Wave Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 3GPP New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X), the new standard for next-generation vehicular networks, vehicles can autonomously select sidelink resources for data transmission, which permits network operations without cellular coverage. However, standalone resource allocation is uncoordinated, and is complicated by the high mobility of the nodes that may introduce unforeseen channel collisions (e.g., when a transmitting vehicle changes path) or free up resources (e.g., when a vehicle moves outside of the communication area). Moreover, unscheduled resource allocation is prone to the hidden node and exposed node problems, which are particularly critical considering directional transmissions. In this paper, we implement and demonstrate a new channel access scheme for NR V2X in Frequency Range 2 (FR2), i.e., at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, based on directional and beamformed transmissions along with Sidelink Control Information (SCI) to select resources for transmission. We prove via simulation that this approach can reduce the probability of collision for resource allocation, compared to a baseline solution that does not configure SCI transmissions.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Perfect Multimodal Alignment and Gaussian Assumptions for Cross-modal Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal alignment aims to construct a joint latent vector space where two modalities representing the same concept map to the same vector. We formulate this as an inverse problem and show that under certain conditions perfect alignment can be achieved. We then address a specific application of alignment referred to as cross-modal transfer. Unsupervised cross-modal transfer aims to leverage a model trained with one modality to perform inference on another modality, without any labeled fine-tuning on the new modality. Assuming that semantic classes are represented as a mixture of Gaussians in the latent space, we show how cross-modal transfer can be performed by projecting the data points from the representation space onto different subspaces representing each modality. Our experiments on synthetic multimodal Gaussian data verify the effectiveness of our perfect alignment and cross-modal transfer method. We hope these findings inspire further exploration of the applications of perfect alignment and the use of Gaussian models for cross-modal learning.</description>

      <title>Fast Two-photon Microscopy by Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in neural imaging have enabled neuroscience to study how the joint activity of large neural populations conspire to produce perception, behavior and cognition. Despite many advances in optical methods, there exists a fundamental tradeoff between imaging speed, field of view, and resolution that limits the scope of neural imaging, especially for the raster-scanning multi-photon imaging needed for imaging deeper into the brain. One approach to overcoming this trade-off is in computational imaging: the co-development of optics and algorithms where the optics are designed to encode the target images into fewer measurements that are faster to acquire, and the algorithms compensate by inverting the optical image coding process to recover a larger or higher resolution image. We present here one such approach for raster-scanning two-photon imaging: Neuroimaging with Oblong Random Acquisition (NORA). NORA quickly acquires each frame in a microscopic video by subsampling only a fraction of the fast scanning lines, ignoring large portions of each frame. NORA mitigates the information loss by extending the point-spread function in the slow-scan direction to integrate the fluorescence of neighboring lines into a single set of measurements. By imaging different, randomly selected, lines at each frame, NORA diversifies the information collected across frames and enables video-level reconstruction. Rather than reconstruct the video frame-by-frame using image-level recovery, NORA recovers full video sequences through a nuclear-norm minimization (i.e., matrix completion) on the pixels-by-time matrix. We simulated NORA imaging using the Neural Anatomy and Optical Microscopy (NAOMi) biophysical simulation suite. Using these simulations we demonstrate that NORA imaging can accurately recover 400 um X 400 um fields of view at subsampling rates up to 20X, despite realistic noise and motion conditions.</description>

      <title>SARLink: Satellite Backscatter Connectivity using Synthetic Aperture Radar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09682v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SARLink is a passive satellite backscatter communication system that uses existing spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging satellites to provide connectivity in remote regions. It achieves orders of magnitude more range than traditional backscatter systems, enabling communication between a passive ground node and a satellite in low earth orbit. The system is composed of a cooperative ground target, a SAR satellite, and a data processing algorithm. A mechanically modulating reflector was designed to apply amplitude modulation to ambient SAR backscatter signals by changing its radar cross section. These communication bits are extracted from the raw SAR data using an algorithm that leverages subaperture processing to detect multiple bits from a target in a single image dataset. A theoretical analysis of this communication system using on-off keying is presented, including the expected signal model, throughput, and bit error rate. The results suggest a 5.5 ft by 5.5 ft modulating corner reflector could send 60 bits every satellite pass, enough to support low bandwidth sensor data and messages. Using Sentinel-1A, a SAR satellite at an altitude of 693~km, we deployed static and modulating reflectors to evaluate the system. The results, successfully detecting the changing state of a modulating ground target, demonstrate our algorithm's effectiveness for extracting bits, paving the way for ultra-long-range, low-power satellite backscatter communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an efficient design approach for a fast-convolution-based variable-bandwidth (VBW) filter. The proposed approach is based on a hybrid of frequency sampling and optimization (HFSO), that offers significant computational complexity reduction compared to existing solutions for a given performance. The paper provides a design procedure based on minimax optimization to obtain the minimum complexity of the overall filter. A design example includes a comparison of the proposed design-based VBW filter and time-domain designed VBW filters implemented in the time domain and in the frequency domain. It is shown that not only the implementation complexity can be reduced but also the design complexity by excluding any computations when the bandwidth of the filter is adjusted. Moreover, memory requirements are also decreased compared to the existing frequency-domain implementations.</description>

Abstract: This paper tackles limitations in existing non-line-of-sight (NLoS) ultraviolet (UV) channel models, where conventional approaches assume obstacle-free propagation or uniform radiation intensity. In this paper, we develop a path loss model incorporating scattering and reflection, and then propose an obstacle-boundary approximation method to achieve computational tractability. Our framework systematically incorporates spatial obstacle properties, including dimensions, coordinates, contours, and orientation angles, while employing the Lambertian radiation pattern for source modeling. Additionally, the proposed path loss model is validated by comparing it with the Monte-Carlo photon-tracing model and analytical integral model via numerical results, which indicate that when obstacle reflection is prominent, an approximation treatment of obstacle boundaries has a negligible influence on the path loss estimation of NLoS UV communication channels.</description>

      <title>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</description>

      <title>WiFo: Wireless Foundation Model for Channel Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel prediction permits to acquire channel state information (CSI) without signaling overhead. However, almost all existing channel prediction methods necessitate the deployment of a dedicated model to accommodate a specific configuration. Leveraging the powerful modeling and multi-task learning capabilities of foundation models, we propose the first space-time-frequency (STF) wireless foundation model (WiFo) to address time-frequency channel prediction tasks in a one-for-all manner. Specifically, WiFo is initially pre-trained over massive and extensive diverse CSI datasets. Then, the model will be instantly used for channel prediction under various CSI configurations without any fine-tuning. We propose a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based network structure for WiFo to handle heterogeneous STF CSI data, and design several mask reconstruction tasks for self-supervised pre-training to capture the inherent 3D variations of CSI. To fully unleash its predictive power, we build a large-scale heterogeneous simulated CSI dataset consisting of 160K CSI samples for pre-training. Simulations validate its superior unified learning performance across multiple datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art (SOTA) zero-shot generalization performance via comparisons with other full-shot baselines.</description>

      <title>Blind Training for Channel-Adaptive Digital Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic encoders and decoders for digital semantic communication (SC) often struggle to adapt to variations in unpredictable channel environments and diverse system designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for training semantic encoders and decoders to enable channel-adaptive digital SC. The core idea is to use binary symmetric channel (BSC) as a universal representation of generic digital communications, eliminating the need to specify channel environments or system designs. Based on this idea, our framework employs parallel BSCs to equivalently model the relationship between the encoder's output and the decoder's input. The bit-flip probabilities of these BSCs are treated as trainable parameters during end-to-end training, with varying levels of regularization applied to address diverse requirements in practical systems. The advantage of our framework is justified by developing a training-aware communication strategy for the inference stage. This strategy makes communication bit errors align with the pre-trained bit-flip probabilities by adaptively selecting power and modulation levels based on practical requirements and channel conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing training approaches in terms of both task performance and power consumption.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Method for Optimum Biomedical Wireless Power Transfer using Inductive Links in Area-Constrained Implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of implantable bioelectronics, this work provides new insights into maximizing biomedical wireless power transfer (BWPT) via the systematic development of inductive links. This approach addresses the specific challenges of power transfer efficiency (PTE) optimization within the area constraints of bio-implants embedded in tissue. Key contributions include the derivation of an optimal self-inductance with S-parameter-based analyses leading to the co-design of planar spiral coils and L-section impedance matching networks. To validate the proposed design methodology, two coil prototypes -- one symmetric (type-1) and one asymmetric (type-2) -- were fabricated and tested for PTE in pork tissue. Targeting a 20 MHz design frequency, the type-1 coil demonstrated a state-of-the-art PTE of $\sim$ 4\% (channel length = 15 mm) with a return loss (RL) $&gt;$ 20 dB on both the input and output sides, within an area constraint of $&lt;$ 18 $ \times $ 18 mm$^{2}$. In contrast, the type-2 coil achieved a PTE of $\sim$ 2\% with an RL $&gt;$ 15 dB, for a smaller receiving coil area of $&lt;$ 5x5 mm$^{2}$ for the same tissue environment. To complement the coils, we demonstrate a 65 nm test chip with an integrated energy harvester, which includes \asif{a} 30-stage rectifier and low-dropout regulator (LDO), producing a stable $\sim$ 1V DC output within tissue medium, matching theoretical predictions and simulations. Furthermore, we provide a robust and comprehensive guideline for advancing efficient inductive links for various BWPT applications, with shared resources in GitHub available for utilization by the broader community.</description>

      <title>ISLS: IoT-Based Smart Lighting System for Improving Energy Conservation in Office Buildings</title>

Abstract: With the Internet of Things (IoT) fostering seamless device-to-human and device-to-device interactions, the domain of intelligent lighting systems have evolved beyond simple occupancy and daylight sensing towards autonomous monitoring and control of power consumption and illuminance levels. To this regard, this paper proposes a new do-it-yourself (DIY) IoT-based method of smart lighting system featuring an illuminance control algorithm. The design involves the integration of occupancy and presence sensors alongside a communication module, to enable real-time wireless interaction and remote monitoring of the system parameters from any location through an end-user application. A constrained optimization problem was formulated to determine the optimal dimming vector for achieving target illuminance at minimal power consumption. The simplex algorithm was used to solve this problem, and the system's performance was validated through both MATLAB simulations and real-world prototype testing in an indoor office environment. The obtained experimental results demonstrate substantial power savings across multiple user occupancy scenarios, achieving reductions of approx. 80%, 48%, and 26% for one, two, and four user settings, respectively, in comparison to traditional basic lighting installation systems.</description>

      <title>FLP-XR: Future Location Prediction on Extreme Scale Maritime Data in Real-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movements of maritime vessels are inherently complex and challenging to model due to the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of maritime operations. Even within structured maritime environments, such as shipping lanes and port approaches, where vessels adhere to navigational rules and predefined sea routes, uncovering underlying patterns is far from trivial. The necessity for accurate modeling of the mobility of maritime vessels arises from the numerous applications it serves, including risk assessment for collision avoidance, optimization of shipping routes, and efficient port management. This paper introduces FLP-XR, a model that leverages maritime mobility data to construct a robust framework that offers precise predictions while ensuring extremely fast training and inference capabilities. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach through an extensive experimental study using three real-world AIS datasets. According to the experimental results, FLP-XR outperforms the current state-of-the-art in many cases, whereas it performs 2-3 orders of magnitude faster in terms of training and inference.</description>

      <title>Modeling, Analysis, and Optimization of Cascaded Power Amplifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with modeling, analysis, and optimization of power amplifiers (PAs) placed in a cascaded structure, particularly the effect of cascaded nonlinearities is studied by showing potential ways to minimize the total nonlinearities. The nonlinear least-squares algorithm is proposed to optimize the PA parameters along with the input power level, and thereby minimize the total nonlinearities in the cascaded structure. The simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the optimized configurations for up to five PAs using the proposed framework can improve the linearity properties of the overall cascade.</description>

      <title>SNAIL Radar: A large-scale diverse benchmark for evaluating 4D-radar-based SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 4D radars are increasingly favored for odometry and mapping of autonomous systems due to their robustness in harsh weather and dynamic environments. Existing datasets, however, often cover limited areas and are typically captured using a single platform. To address this gap, we present a diverse large-scale dataset specifically designed for 4D radar-based localization and mapping. This dataset was gathered using three different platforms: a handheld device, an e-bike, and an SUV, under a variety of environmental conditions, including clear days, nighttime, and heavy rain. The data collection occurred from September 2023 to February 2024, encompassing diverse settings such as roads in a vegetated campus and tunnels on highways. Each route was traversed multiple times to facilitate place recognition evaluations. The sensor suite included a 3D lidar, 4D radars, stereo cameras, consumer-grade IMUs, and a GNSS/INS system. Sensor data packets were synchronized to GNSS time using a two-step process including a convex-hull-based smoothing and a correlation-based correction. The reference motion for the platforms was generated by registering lidar scans to a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) point cloud map by a lidar inertial sequential localizer which supports forward and backward processing. The backward pass enables detailed quantitative and qualitative assessments of reference motion accuracy. To demonstrate the dataset's utility, we evaluated several state-of-the-art radar-based odometry and place recognition methods, indicating existing challenges in radar-based SLAM.</description>

      <title>Downlink Channel Covariance Matrix Estimation via Representation Learning with Graph Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18865v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for downlink (DL) channel covariance matrix (CCM) estimation for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with base station (BS) possessing a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna structure. We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.</description>

      <title>A Convex Relaxation Approach to Generalization Analysis for Parallel Positively Homogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for deriving generalization bounds for parallel positively homogeneous neural networks--a class of neural networks whose input-output map decomposes as the sum of positively homogeneous maps. Examples of such networks include matrix factorization and sensing, single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, tensor factorization, deep linear and ReLU networks, and more. Our general framework is based on linking the non-convex empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem to a closely related convex optimization problem over prediction functions, which provides a global, achievable lower-bound to the ERM problem. We exploit this convex lower-bound to perform generalization analysis in the convex space while controlling the discrepancy between the convex model and its non-convex counterpart. We apply our general framework to a wide variety of models ranging from low-rank matrix sensing, to structured matrix sensing, two-layer linear networks, two-layer ReLU networks, and single-layer multi-head attention mechanisms, achieving generalization bounds with a sample complexity that scales almost linearly with the network width.</description>

      <title>Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC Waveform Design Based on Frequency-Domain Phase Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform design is a crucial issue in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper introduces an OFDM-ISAC waveform design that utilizes the entire spectrum simultaneously for both communication and sensing by leveraging a novel degree of freedom (DoF): the frequency-domain phase difference (PD). Based on this concept, we develop a novel PD-based OFDM-ISAC waveform structure and utilize it to design a PD-based Low-PAPR OFDM-ISAC (PLPOI) waveform. The design is formulated as an optimization problem incorporating four key constraints: the time-frequency relationship equation, frequency-domain unimodular constraints, PD constraints, and time-domain low PAPR requirements. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we develop an efficient algorithm, ADMM-PLPOI, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PLPOI waveform achieves significant improvements in both PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance compared to conventional OFDM-ISAC waveforms.</description>
