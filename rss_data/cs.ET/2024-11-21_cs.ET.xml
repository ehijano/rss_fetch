      <title>Advanced Plaque Modeling for Atherosclerosis Detection Using Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide, plaque formation in human arteries, known as atherosclerosis, is the focus of many research efforts. Previously, molecular communication (MC) models have been proposed to capture and analyze the natural processes inside the human body and to support the development of diagnosis and treatment methods. In the future, synthetic MC networks are envisioned to span the human body as part of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT), turning blood vessels into physical communication channels. By observing and characterizing changes in these channels, MC networks could play an active role in detecting diseases like atherosclerosis. In this paper, building on previous preliminary work for simulating an MC scenario in a plaque-obstructed blood vessel, we evaluate different analytical models for non-Newtonian flow and derive associated channel impulse responses (CIRs). Additionally, we add the crucial factor of flow pulsatility to our simulation model and investigate the effect of the systole-diastole cycle on the received particles across the plaque channel. We observe a significant influence of the plaque on the channel in terms of the flow profile and CIR across different emission times in the cycle. These metrics could act as crucial indicators for early non-invasive plaque detection in advanced future MC methods.</description>

      <title>Design of an FPGA-Based Neutral Atom Rearrangement Accelerator for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atoms have emerged as a promising technology for implementing quantum computers due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, the execution frequency of neutral atom quantum computers is constrained by image processing procedures, particularly the assembly of defect-free atom arrays, which is a crucial step in preparing qubits (atoms) for execution. To optimize this assembly process, we propose a novel quadrant-based rearrangement algorithm that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy and also enables the simultaneous movement of multiple atoms, even across different columns and rows. We implement the algorithm on FPGA to handle each quadrant independently (hardware-level optimization) while maximizing parallelization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first hardware acceleration work for atom rearrangement, and it significantly reduces the processing time. This achievement also contributes to the ongoing efforts of tightly integrating quantum accelerators into High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems. Tested on a Zynq RFSoC FPGA at 250 MHz, our hardware implementation is able to complete the rearrangement process of a 30$\times$30 compact target array, derived from a 50$\times$50 initial loaded array, in approximately 1.0 $\mu s$. Compared to a comparable CPU implementation and to state-of-the-art FPGA work, we achieved about 54$\times$ and 300$\times$ speedups in the rearrangement analysis time, respectively. Additionally, the FPGA-based acceleration demonstrates good scalability, allowing for seamless adaptation to varying sizes of the atom array, which makes this algorithm a promising solution for large-scale quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a case study in implementing a variational quantum algorithm for solving the Poisson equation, which is a commonly encountered partial differential equation in science and engineering. We highlight the practical challenges encountered in mapping the algorithm to physical hardware, and the software engineering considerations needed to achieve realistic results on today's non-fault-tolerant systems.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Arbitrary Single-Qubit Rotations on an Embedded Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present a technique for using machine learning (ML) for single-qubit gate synthesis on field programmable logic for a superconducting transmon-based quantum computer based on simulated studies. Our approach is multi-stage. We first bootstrap a model based on simulation with access to the full statevector for measuring gate fidelity. We next present an algorithm, named adapted randomized benchmarking (ARB), for fine-tuning the gate on hardware based on measurements of the devices. We also present techniques for deploying the model on programmable devices with care to reduce the required resources. While the techniques here are applied to a transmon-based computer, many of them are portable to other architectures.</description>

By integrating cutting-edge technologies such as generative and agentic AI, cross-layer automation and optimization, unified control plane, and composable and adaptive system architecture, the proposed framework addresses critical challenges in energy efficiency, performance, and cost-effectiveness. Incorporating quantum computing as it matures will enable quantum-accelerated simulations for materials science, climate modeling, and other high-impact domains. Collaborative efforts between academia and industry are central to this vision, driving advancements in foundation models for material design and climate solutions, scalable multimodal data processing, and enhanced physics-based AI emulators for applications like weather forecasting and carbon sequestration. Research priorities include advancing AI agentic systems, LLM as an Abstraction (LLMaaA), AI model optimization and unified abstractions across heterogeneous infrastructure, end-to-end edge-cloud transformation, efficient programming model, middleware and platform, secure infrastructure, application-adaptive cloud systems, and new quantum-classical collaborative workflows. These ideas and solutions encompass both theoretical and practical research questions, requiring coordinated input and support from the research community. This joint initiative aims to establish hybrid clouds as secure, efficient, and sustainable platforms, fostering breakthroughs in AI-driven applications and scientific discovery across academia, industry, and society.</description>

      <title>DATTA: Domain-Adversarial Test-Time Adaptation for Cross-Domain WiFi-Based Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-domain generalization is an open problem in WiFi-based sensing due to variations in environments, devices, and subjects, causing domain shifts in channel state information. To address this, we propose Domain-Adversarial Test-Time Adaptation (DATTA), a novel framework combining domain-adversarial training (DAT), test-time adaptation (TTA), and weight resetting to facilitate adaptation to unseen target domains and to prevent catastrophic forgetting. DATTA is integrated into a lightweight, flexible architecture optimized for speed. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of DATTA, including an ablation study on all key components using publicly available data, and verify its suitability for real-time applications such as human activity recognition. When combining a SotA video-based variant of TTA with WiFi-based DAT and comparing it to DATTA, our method achieves an 8.1% higher F1-Score. The PyTorch implementation of DATTA is publicly available at: https://github.com/StrohmayerJ/DATTA.</description>

      <title>Eco-Friendly 0G Networks: Unlocking the Power of Backscatter Communications for a Greener Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscatter Communication (BackCom) technology has emerged as a promising paradigm for the Green Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, offering advantages such as low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. While traditional BackCom systems, such as RFID technology, have found widespread applications, the advent of ambient backscatter presents new opportunities for expanding applications and enhancing capabilities. Moreover, ongoing standardization efforts are actively focusing on BackCom technologies, positioning them as a potential solution to meet the near-zero power consumption and massive connectivity requirements of next-generation wireless systems. 0G networks have the potential to provide advanced solutions by leveraging BackCom technology to deliver ultra-low-power, ubiquitous connectivity for the expanding IoT ecosystem, supporting billions of devices with minimal energy consumption. This paper investigates the integration of BackCom and 0G networks to enhance the capabilities of traditional BackCom systems and enable Green IoT. We conduct an in-depth analysis of BackCom-enabled 0G networks, exploring their architecture and operational objectives, and also explore the Waste Factor (WF) metric for evaluating energy efficiency and minimizing energy waste within integrated systems. By examining both structural and operational aspects, we demonstrate how this synergy enhances the performance, scalability, and sustainability of next-generation wireless networks. Moreover, we highlight possible applications, open challenges, and future directions, offering valuable insights for guiding future research and practical implementations aimed at achieving large-scale, sustainable IoT deployments.</description>
