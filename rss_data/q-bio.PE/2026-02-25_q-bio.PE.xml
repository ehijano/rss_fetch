      <title>Tipping points in complex ecological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tipping points are one of the hot topics in modern physics of complex systems. But what is a tipping point? A generic definition declares it as ``a state of the system where a small change in its parameters can lead to a significant change in its properties''. Additional ingredients that often enter the definition of tipping process are the abruptness of the resulting change and its irreversibility, i.e. it is impossible to recover the initial state if one reverses the protocol of change of the parameters. However, there exists a number of different mathematical structures that can show this behavior, the one that was originally suggested as a tipping point (nowadays usually referred to as bifurcation induced tipping) is just one of many. Different preconditions and/or different level of details included into the model, reflecting also different environmental forcing, can lead to a variety of tipping mechanisms. Furthermore, in a spatially extended system and/or a system with multiple scales, different parts can react to a change in environmental conditions differently or at a different time, interacting with each other to create a tipping cascade. In this paper, using ecosystems as a paradigm of complex nonlinear open systems, we provide a critical overview of the progress made in tipping point science over the last 15 years. We highlight the main findings, identify gaps in our knowledge, and outline a roadmap for further progress.</description>

      <title>Adaptation by Cumulative Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems like long-lived clonal organisms, holobionts and clades challenge traditional evolutionary thinking since they adapt without populations or reproduction. This paper aims to provide an overarching theoretical framework which encompasses standard Darwinian evolution as well as other processes of adaptation. This framework is cumulative selection and I provide a general `recipe' for it to occur. Lewontin's recipe for evolution by natural selection is shown to be a particular example of cumulative selection, but not the only one. Similarly, reproduction, inheritance and populations are just one way to perform cumulative selection. I discuss several other examples of cumulative selection including clonal organisms, dioecious populations, Gaia and neural networks.</description>

      <title>Age Structured Epidemic Model under Vaccination with Vector Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dengue remains a major global public health concern due to its high mortality and economic burden. Mathematical modeling is essential to understand its transmission mechanisms and for evaluating intervention strategies. In this paper, we formulate a vector host model in which the human population is structured by age, and vaccinated individuals are further described by time since vaccination. The mosquito population is coupled to the host dynamics and reduced under a quasi steady state assumption. By integrating over vaccination age, we obtain a nonlinear steady state formulation and express the endemic equilibrium as a fixed point problem for the infected mosquito population. Using Lipschitz estimates and a contraction argument, we establish existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium under a weak transmission condition. The analysis highlights the influence of age dependent vaccination on long term dengue dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multiple Poisson-Dirichlet diffusions on generalized Kingman simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new class of infinite-dimensional diffusions taking values in a generalized Kingman simplex. Our model describes the temporal evolution of the relative frequencies of infinitely-many types which are "labeled" by an arbitrary finite number of marks or colors, but "unlabeled" within each mark. We start with a finite-dimensional construction which extends to Wright-Fisher diffusions a self-similarity property known for Dirichlet distributions, and corresponds to a multiple skew-product representation of the Wright-Fisher diffusion relative to the marks in the population. After ranking decreasingly the frequencies within each mark, we identify the limit in distribution of the resulting diffusion when the number of types for each mark goes to infinity, and describe its infinitesimal operator. The limiting process reduces to a diffusion in the Thoma simplex in the special case of only two marks, whereas the infinitely-many-neutral-alleles model is recovered when all frequencies have the same mark. The stationary measure of the limit diffusion is shown to be the recently introduced multiple Poisson-Dirichlet distribution, which extends Kingman's Poisson-Dirichlet distribution and is the de Finetti representing measure for a family of random partitions whose elements are marked.</description>

      <title>Modelling the transmission and impact of Omicron variants of Covid-19 in different ethnicity groups in Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous pandemics, including influenza pandemics and Covid-19, have disproportionately impacted M\=aori and Pacific populations in Aotearoa New Zealand. The reasons for this are multi-faceted, including differences in socioeconomic deprivation, housing conditions and household size, vaccination rates, access to healthcare, and prevalence of pre-existing health conditions. Many mathematical models that were used to inform the response to the Covid-19 pandemic did not explicitly include ethnicity or other socioeconomic variables. This limited their ability to predict, understand and mitigate inequitable impacts of the pandemic. Here, we extend a model that was developed during the Covid-19 pandemic to support the public health response by stratifying the population into four ethnicity groups: M\=aori, Pacific, Asian and European/other. We include three ethnicity-specific components in the model: vaccination rates, clinical severity parameters, and contact patterns. We compare model results to ethnicity-specific data on Covid-19 cases, hospital admissions and deaths between 1 January 2022 and 30 June 2023, under different model scenarios in which these ethnicity-specific components are present or absent. We find that differences in vaccination rates explain only part of the observed disparities in outcomes. While no model scenario is able to fully capture the heterogeneous temporal dynamics, our results suggest that differences between ethnicities in the per-infection risk of clinical severe disease is an important factor. Our work is an important step towards models that are better able to predict inequitable impacts of future pandemic and emerging disease threats, and investigate the ability of interventions to mitigate these.</description>

      <title>Experimental and numerical modeling of liposome congregation in meteorite craters of Early Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides experimental and numerical evidence supporting the occurrence of liposome congregation at the floors of meteor craters on Early Earth. This work builds on our earlier research, which demonstrated that liposomes submerged in a shallow Archean pond are protected from harmful UV radiation. This protection allows them to survive long enough for autocatalytic replication of amphiphiles and for mutation and selection of assemblies that maximize membrane stability. For liposomes to fuse, grow, exchange contents and membranes, and divide, they need to establish a population, which means forming a dense conglomerate that enables close physical contact. The study demonstrates that such a congregation is feasible in bowl-shaped meteor craters on Early Earth, especially under periodic seismic disturbances.</description>
