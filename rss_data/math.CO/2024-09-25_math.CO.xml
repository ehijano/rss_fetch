      <title>Two hardness results for the maximum 2-edge-colorable subgraph problem in bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the maximum $k$-edge-colorable subgraph problem. In this problem we are given a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, the goal to take $k$ matchings of $G$ such that their union contains maximum number of edges. This problem is NP-hard in cubic graphs, and polynomial time solvable in bipartite graphs as we observe in our paper. We present two NP-hardness results for two versions of this problem where we have weights on edges or color constraints on vertices. In fact, we show that these versions are NP-hard already in bipartite graphs of maximum degree three. In order to achieve these results, we establish a connection between our problems and the problem of construction of special maximum matchings considered in the Master thesis of the author and defended back in 2003.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for proper rainbow saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, we say that a graph $G$ is properly rainbow $H$-saturated if: (1) There is a proper edge colouring of $G$ containing no rainbow copy of $H$; (2) For every $e \notin E(G)$, every proper edge colouring of $G+e$ contains a rainbow copy of $H$. The proper rainbow saturation number $\text{prsat}(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges in a properly rainbow $H$-saturated graph. In this paper we use connections to the classical saturation and semi-saturation numbers to provide new upper bounds on $\text{prsat}(n,H)$ for general cliques, cycles, and complete bipartite graphs. We also provide some general lower bounds on $\text{prsat}(n,H)$ and explore several other interesting directions.</description>

      <title>Claw-free cubic graphs are $(1, 1, 2, 2)$-colorable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $(1,1,2,2)$-coloring of a graph is a partition of its vertex set into four sets two of which are independent and the other two are $2$-packings. In this paper, we prove that every claw-free cubic graph admits a $(1,1,2,2)$-coloring. This implies that the conjecture from [Packing chromatic number, $(1,1,2,2)$-colorings, and characterizing the Petersen graph, Aequationes Math.\ 91 (2017) 169--184] that the packing chromatic number of subdivisions of subcubic graphs is at most $5$ is true in the case of claw-free cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Extremal values for the square energies of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with $n$ non-isolated vertices and $m$ edges. The positive / negative square energies of $G$, denoted $s^+(G)$ / $s^-(G)$, are defined as the sum of squares of the positive / negative eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of $G$. In this work, we provide several new tools for studying square energy encompassing semi-definite optimization, graph operations, and surplus. Using our tools, we prove the following results on the extremal values of $s^{\pm}(G)$ with a given number of vertices and edges.
  1. We have $\min(s^+(G), s^-(G)) \geq n - \gamma \geq \frac{n}{2}$, where $\gamma$ is the domination number of $G$. This verifies a conjecture of Elphick, Farber, Goldberg and Wocjan up to a constant, and proves a weaker version of this conjecture introduced by Elphick and Linz.
  2. We have $s^+(G) \geq m^{6/7 - o(1)}$ and $s^-(G) = \Omega(m^{1/2})$, with both exponents being optimal.</description>

      <title>On the $f$-vectors of flow polytopes for the complete graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chan-Robbins-Yuen polytope ($CRY_n$) of order $n$ is a face of the Birkhoff polytope of doubly stochastic matrices that is also a flow polytope of the directed complete graph $K_{n+1}$ with netflow $(1,0,0, \ldots , 0, -1)$. The volume and lattice points of this polytope have been actively studied, however its face structure has received less attention. We give generating functions and explicit formulas for computing the $f$-vector by using Hille's (2003) result bijecting faces of a flow polytope to certain graphs, as well as Andresen-Kjeldsen's (1976) result that enumerates certain subgraphs of the directed complete graph. We extend our results to flow polytopes of the complete graph having arbitrary (non-negative) netflow vectors and recover the $f$-vector of the Tesler polytope of M\'esz\'aros--Morales--Rhoades (2017).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph (with multiple edges allowed) and let $T$ be a tree in $G$. We say that $T$ is $\textit{even}$ if every leaf of $T$ belongs to the same part of the bipartition of $T$, and that $T$ is $\textit{weakly even}$ if every leaf of $T$ that has maximum degree in $G$ belongs to the same part of the bipartition of $T$. We confirm two recent conjectures of Jackson and Yoshimoto by showing that every connected graph that is not a regular bipartite graph has a spanning weakly even tree.</description>

      <title>Independent set sequence of linear hyperpaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The independent set sequence of trees has been well studied, with much effort devoted to the (still open) question of Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s on whether the independent set sequence of any tree is unimodal.
  Much less attention has been given to the independent set sequence of hypertrees. Here we study one natural first question in this realm -- the unimodality of the strong independent set sequence of linear uniform hyperpaths. Via both an inductive and a combinatorial argument we obtain an explicit expression for the terms of this sequence, and we establish unimodality via an interlacing roots argument. We also suggest some further questions.</description>

      <title>A Bijection Between All Shi Regions and Core Partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the bijection of Fishel-Vazirani on dominant regions of the $m$-Shi arrangement. Our map puts the set of all minimal chambers of the $m$-Shi arrangement of Type $A_{n}$ in bijection with a certain set of (equivalence classes of) $n$-core partitions. As a step to our proof, we give a potentially interesting classification of the alcoves in the $S_{n}$-orbit of an $m$-minimal alcove which are themselves $m$-minimal.</description>

      <title>Ricci Curvature Formula: Applications to Bonnet-Myers Sharp Irregular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a simple formula for computing the Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature on graphs. For any edge $xy$ in a simple locally finite graph $G$, the curvature $\kappa(x,y)$ can be expressed as a cost function of an optimal bijection between two blow-up sets of the neighbors of $x$ and $y$. Utilizing this approach, we derive several results including a structural theorem for the Bonnet-Myers sharp irregular graphs of diameter $3$ and a theorem on $C_3$-free Bonnet-Myers sharp graphs.</description>

      <title>Spectral extrema of graphs with fixed size: forbidden fan graph,friendship graph or theta graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'an-type problem asks what is the maximum spectral radius $\lambda(G)$ of an $F$-free graph $G$ with $m$ edges? It can be viewed as a spectral characterization on the existence of the subgraph $F$ in $G.$ A nice contribution on the above problem is due to Nikiforov (2002), which states that $\lambda(G)\leqslant \sqrt{2m(1-1/r)}$ for every $K_{r+1}$-free graph of size $m$. Let $\theta_{1,p,q}$ be the theta graph, which is obtained by connecting two vertices with 3 internally disjoint paths of lengths $1,p,q$, respectively. Let $F_k$ be the fan graph, i.e., the join of a $K_1$ and a path $P_{k-1}$, and let $F_{k,3}$ be the friendship graph obtained from $k$ triangles by sharing a common vertex. In this paper, we use $k$-core method and spectral techniques to resolve some spectral extrema of graphs with fixed size. Firstly, we show that, for $k\geqslant3$ and $m\geqslant \frac{9}{4}k^6+6k^5+46k^4+56k^3+196k^2$, if $G$ is $F_{2k+2}$-free, then $\lambda(G)\leqslant\frac{k-1+\sqrt{4m-k^2+1}}{2},$ equality holds if and only if $G \cong K_k\vee(\frac{m}{k}-\frac{k-1}{2})K_1.$ Secondly, we show that, for $k\geqslant 3$ and $m\geqslant \frac{9}{4}k^6+6k^5+46k^4+56k^3+196k^2$, if $G$ is $F_{k,3}$-free of size $m$, then $\lambda(G)\leqslant\frac{k-1+\sqrt{4m-k^2+1}}{2},$ equality holds if and only if $G\cong K_k\vee(\frac{m}{k}-\frac{k-1}{2})K_1$. This confirms a conjecture proposed by Li, Lu and Peng [Discrete Math. 346(2023)113680]. Finally, we identify the $\theta_{1,p,q}$-free graph of size $m$ having the largest spectral radius, where $q\geqslant p\geqslant 3$ and $p+q\geqslant 2k+1.$ Some further research problems are also proposed.</description>

      <title>The ascent lattice on Dyck paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Stanley lattice defined on Dyck paths of size $n$, cover relations are obtained by replacing a valley $DU$ by a peak $UD$. We investigate a greedy version of this lattice, first introduced by Chenevi\`ere, where cover relations replace a factor $DU^k D$ by $U^kD^2$. By relating this poset to another poset recently defined by Nadeau and Tewari, we prove that this still yields a lattice, which we call the ascent lattice $L_n$.
  We then count intervals in $L_n$. Their generating function is found to be algebraic of degree $3$. The proof is based on a recursive decomposition of intervals involving two catalytic parameters. The solution of the corresponding functional equation is inspired by recent work on the enumeration of walks confined to a quadrant.
  We also consider the order induced in $L_{mn}$ on $m$-Dyck paths, that is, paths in which all ascent lengths are multiples of $m$, and on mirrored $m$-Dyck paths, in which all descent lengths are multiples of $m$. The first poset $L_{m,n}$ is still a lattice for any $m$, while the second poset $L'_{m,n}$ is only a join semilattice when $m&gt;1$. In both cases, the enumeration of intervals is still described by an equation in two catalytic variables. Interesting connections arise with the sylvester congruence of Hivert, Novelli and Thibon, and again with walks confined to a quadrant. We combine the latter connection with probabilistic results to give asymptotic estimates of the number of intervals in both $L_{m,n}$ and $L'_{m,n}$. Their form implies that the generating functions of intervals are no longer algebraic, nor even D-finite, when $m&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>On the Incidence matrices of hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the incidence matrices of hypergraphs, with a focus on two types: the edge-vertex incidence matrix and the vertex-edge incidence matrix. The edge-vertex incidence matrix is a matrix in which the rows represent hyperedges and the columns represent vertices. For a given hyperedge $e$ and vertex $u$, the $(e,u)$-th entry of the matrix is $1$ if $u$ is incident to $e$; otherwise, this entry is $0$. The vertex-edge incidence matrix is simply the transpose of the edge-vertex incidence matrix. This study examines the ranks and null spaces of these incidence matrices. It is shown that certain hypergraph structures, such as $k$-uniform cycles, units, and equal partitions of hyperedges and vertices, can influence specific vectors in the null space. In a hypergraph, a unit is a maximal collection of vertices that are incident with the same set of hyperedges. Identification of vertices within the same unit leads to a smaller hypergraph, known as unit contraction. The rank of the edge-vertex incidence matrix remains the same for both the original hypergraph and its unit contraction. Additionally, this study establishes connections between the edge-vertex incidence matrix and certain eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the hypergraph.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of $m$-ary functions and low degree partitions of Hamming graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of complexity measures of Boolean functions led Nisan and Szegedy to state the sensitivity conjecture in 1994, claiming a polynomial relation between degree and sensitivity. This problem remained unsolved until 2019, when Huang proved the conjecture via an equivalent graph theoretical reformulation due to Gotsman and Linial.
  We study $m$-ary functions, i.e., functions $f: T^n \rightarrow T$ where $T\subseteq \mathbb{C}$ is a finite alphabet of cardinality $|T| = m $ and extend the notions of degree $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ and sensitivity $s(f)$ to $m$-ary functions and show $s(f)\in O(\mathrm{deg}(f)^2)$. This generalizes results of Nisan and Szegedy. Conversely, we introduce the $m$-ary sensitivity conjecture, claiming a polynomial upper bound for $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ in terms of $s(f)$. Analogously to results of Gotsman and Linial, we provide a formulation of the conjecture in terms of imbalanced partitions of Hamming graphs into low degree subgraphs. Combining this with ideas of Chung, F\"uredi, Graham and Seymour, we show that for any prime $p$ the bound in the $p$-ary sensitivity conjecture has to be at least quadratic: there exist $p$-ary functions $f$ of arbitrarily large degree and $\mathrm{deg}(f)\in \Omega(s(f)^2)$.</description>

      <title>Equiangular lines in the exponential regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of lines passing through the origin in an inner product space is said to be equiangular if every pair of lines defines the same angle. In 1973, Lemmens and Seidel raised what has since become a central question in the study of equiangular lines in Euclidean spaces. They asked for the maximum number of equiangular lines in $\mathbb{R}^r$ with a common angle of $\arccos{\frac{1}{2k-1}}$ for any integer $k \geq 2$. We show that the answer equals $r-1+\left\lfloor\frac{r-1}{k-1}\right\rfloor,$ provided that $r$ is at least exponential in a polynomial in $k$. This improves upon a recent breakthrough of Jiang, Tidor, Yao, Zhang, and Zhao [Ann. of Math. (2) 194 (2021), no. 3, 729--743], who showed that this holds for $r$ at least doubly exponential in a polynomial in $k$.
  The key new ingredient which underlies our result is an improved upper bound on the multiplicity of the second-largest eigenvalue of a connected graph in terms of the size of the second-largest eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>Positive Geometries for Scattering Amplitudes in N=4 SYM and ABJM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis investigates geometric descriptions of scattering amplitudes, with a specific focus on scattering amplitudes in N=4 SYM and ABJM theory. The recent development of the field of positive geometries provides us with a suitable framework for this endeavour. In particular, we will give a detailed account of the amplituhedron, the momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum amplituhedron. Alongside these geometries, we will also discuss the ABHY associahedron, which encapsulates tree-level scattering amplitudes in bi-adjoint scalar theory. We provide a detailed introduction to these positive geometries, which includes a comprehensive discussion of their structure. For the momentum amplituhedron, ABJM momentum amplituhedron, and ABHY associahedron we give a full stratification of their boundaries, which equivalently elucidates the singularity structure of the tree-level scattering amplitudes. Notably, we show that the ABJM momentum amplituhedron has an Euler characteristic equal to one. Furthermore, we explore the interconnections between these, and other, positive geometries. These connections are in part obtained via push forwards through the scattering equations. We develop techniques to calculate these push forwards which circumvents the necessity to solve the scattering equations explicitly. Beyond tree-level, we illustrate how positive geometries can be used to describe loop integrands in planar N=4 SYM and ABJM. A new framework is established to investigate these loop geometries in the space of dual momenta. The construction relies solely on lightcones and their intersections, and the framework simultaneously encompasses the loop level structure of the amplituhedron, momentum amplituhedron, and the ABJM momentum amplituhedron. This further leads to compact general formulae for all one-loop integrands in N=4 SYM and ABJM.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing SLE-decorated Liouville quantum gravity surfaces from random permutons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Permutons constructed from a Liouville quantum gravity surface and a pair of space-filling Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLEs) have been shown -- or are conjectured -- to describe the scaling limit of various natural models of random constrained permutations. We prove that, in two distinct and natural settings, these permutons uniquely determine, modulo rotation, scaling, translation and reflection, both the Liouville quantum gravity surface and the pair of space-filling SLEs used in their construction. In other words, the Liouville quantum gravity surface and the pair of space-filling SLEs can be deterministically reconstructed from the permuton.
  Our results cover the cases of the skew Brownian permutons, the universal limits of pattern-avoiding permutations, and the meandric permuton, which is the conjectural permuton limit of permutations obtained from uniform meanders.
  In the course of the proof, we give a detailed description of how the support of the permuton relates to the multiple points of the two space-filling SLEs.</description>

      <title>Listing spanning trees of outerplanar graphs by pivot exchanges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the spanning trees of any outerplanar triangulation $G$ can be listed so that any two consecutive spanning trees differ in an exchange of two edges that share an end vertex. For outerplanar graphs $G$ with faces of arbitrary lengths (not necessarily 3) we establish a similar result, with the condition that the two exchanged edges share an end vertex or lie on a common face. These listings of spanning trees are obtained from a simple greedy algorithm that can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ per generated spanning tree, where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$. Furthermore, the listings correspond to Hamilton paths on the 0/1-polytope that is obtained as the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all spanning trees of $G$.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic monotiles: from geometry to groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: &lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, two striking, nearly simultaneous, mathematical discoveries have excited their respective communities, one by Greenfeld and Tao, the other (the Hat tile) by Smith, Myers, Kaplan and Goodman-Strauss, which can both be summed up as the following: there exists a single tile that tiles, but not periodically (sometimes dubbed the einstein problem). The two settings and the tools are quite different (as emphasized by their almost disjoint bibliographies): one in euclidean geometry, the other in group theory. Both are highly nontrivial: in the first case, one allows complex shapes; in the second one, also the space to tile may be complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We propose here a framework that embeds both of these problems. We illustrate our setting by transforming the Hat tile into a new aperiodic group monotile, and we describe its symmetries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Abstract: We determine the p-Kazhdan-Lusztig bases for antispherical (co)minuscule Hecke categories in all characteristics, and for spherical (co)minuscule Hecke categories in good characteristic. This is achieved using geometric and diagrammatic methods. The 2-Kazhdan-Lusztig bases of antispherical cominuscule Hecke categories exhibit extremely pathological behaviour. The notions of p-small resolutions and p-tight elements are introduced and conjecturally explain this behaviour.</description>

      <title>On 1-Planar Graphs with Bounded Cop-Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a type of pursuit-evasion game played on a graph where a set of cops try to capture a single robber. The cops first choose their initial vertex positions, and later the robber chooses a vertex. The cops and robbers make their moves in alternate turns: in the cops' turn, every cop can either choose to move to an adjacent vertex or stay on the same vertex, and likewise the robber in his turn. If the cops can capture the robber in a finite number of rounds, the cops win, otherwise the robber wins. The cop-number of a graph is the minimum number of cops required to catch a robber in the graph. It has long been known that graphs embedded on surfaces (such as planar graphs and toroidal graphs) have a small cop-number. Recently, Durocher et al. [Graph Drawing, 2023] investigated the problem of cop-number for the class of $1$-planar graphs, which are graphs that can be embedded in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once. They showed that unlike planar graphs which require just three cops, 1-planar graphs have an unbounded cop-number. On the positive side, they showed that maximal 1-planar graphs require only three cops by crucially using the fact that the endpoints of every crossing in an embedded maximal 1-planar graph induce a $K_4$. In this paper, we show that the cop-number remains bounded even under the relaxed condition that the endpoints induce at least three edges. More precisely, let an $\times$-crossing of an embedded 1-planar graph be a crossing whose endpoints induce a matching; i.e., there is no edge connecting the endpoints apart from the crossing edges themselves. We show that any 1-planar graph that can be embedded without $\times$-crossings has cop-number at most 21. Moreover, any 1-planar graph that can be embedded with at most $\gamma$ $\times$-crossings has cop-number at most $\gamma + 21$.</description>

Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem for the length of the longest subsequence of a random permutation which follows one of a class of repeating patterns. This class includes every fixed pattern of ups and downs having at least one of each, such as the alternating case considered by Stanley in arXiv:math/0511419 and Widom in arXiv:math/0511533. In every case considered the convergence in the limit of long permutations is to normal with mean and variance linear in the length of the permutation.</description>

      <title>A note on the random greedy independent set algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3732</link>
      <description>arXiv:1308.3732v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $r\ge 3$ be a fixed constant and let $ {\mathcal H}$ be an $r$-uniform, $D$-regular hypergraph on $N$ vertices. Assume further that $ D &gt; N^\varepsilon $ for some $ \varepsilon&gt;0 $. Consider the random greedy algorithm for forming an independent set in $ \mathcal{H}$. An independent set is chosen at random by iteratively choosing vertices at random to be in the independent set. At each step we chose a vertex uniformly at random from the collection of vertices that could be added to the independent set (i.e. the collection of vertices $v$ with the property that $v$ is not in the current independent set $I$ and $ I \cup \{v\}$ contains no edge in $ \mathcal{H}$). Note that this process terminates at a maximal subset of vertices with the property that this set contains no edge of $ \mathcal{H} $; that is, the process terminates at a maximal independent set.
  We prove that if $ \mathcal{H}$ satisfies certain degree and codegree conditions then there are $ \Omega\left( N \cdot ( (\log N) / D )^{\frac{1}{r-1}} \right) $ vertices in the independent set produced by the random greedy algorithm with high probability. This result generalizes a lower bound on the number of steps in the $ H$-free process due to Bohman and Keevash and produces objects of interest in additive combinatorics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14332v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and a coloring of its edges, a subgraph of $G$ is called rainbow if its edges have distinct colors. The rainbow girth of an edge coloring of G is the minimum length of a rainbow cycle in G. A generalization of the famous Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture, proposed by the first author, is that if in an coloring of the edge set of an $n$-vertex graph by $n$ colors, in which each color class is of size $k$, the rainbow girth is at most $\lceil \frac{n}{k} \rceil$. In the known examples for sharpness of this conjecture the color classes are stars, suggesting that when the color classes are matchings, the result may be improved. We show that the rainbow girth of $n$ matchings of size at least 2 is $O(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>On entropic and almost multilinear representability of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies two notions of generalized matroid representations motivated by algorithmic information theory and cryptographic secret sharing. The first (entropic representability) involves discrete random variables, while the second (almost-multilinear representability) deals with approximate subspace arrangements. In both cases, we prove that determining whether an input matroid has such a representation is undecidable. Consequently, the conditional independence implication problem is also undecidable, providing an independent answer to a question posed by Geiger and Pearl, recently resolved by Cheuk Ting Li. These problems are also closely related to characterizing achievable rates in network coding and constructing secret sharing schemes. For example, another corollary of our work is that deciding whether an access structure admits an ideal secret sharing scheme is undecidable. Our approach reduces undecidable problems from group theory to matroid representation problems. Specifically, we reduce the uniform word problem for finite groups to entropic representability and the word problem for sofic groups to almost-multilinear representability. A key part of this reduction involves modifying group presentations into forms where linear or sofic representations are generic in an appropriate sense when restricted to the generating set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12243v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A generalization of the famous Caccetta--H\"aggkvist conjecture, suggested by Aharoni [Rainbow triangles and the Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture, J. Graph Theory (2019)], is that any family $\mathcal{F}=(F_1, \ldots,F_n)$ of sets of edges in $K_n$, each of size $k$, has a rainbow cycle of length at most $\lceil \frac{n}{k}\rceil$. In [Rainbow cycles for families of matchings, Israel J. Math. (2023)] and [Non-uniform degrees and rainbow versions of the Caccetta-H\"aggkvist conjecture, SIAM J. Discrete Math. (2023)] it was shown that asymptotically this can be improved to $O(\log n)$ if all sets are matchings of size 2, or all are triangles. We show that the same is true in the mixed case, i.e., if each $F_i$ is either a matching of size 2 or a triangle. We also study the case that each $F_i$ is a matching of size 2 or a single edge, or each $F_i$ is a triangle or a single edge, and in each of these cases we determine the threshold proportion between the types, beyond which the rainbow girth goes from linear to logarithmic.</description>

      <title>Posets are easily testable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alon and Shapira proved that every monotone class (closed under taking subgraphs) of undirected graphs is strongly testable, that is, under the promise that a given graph is either in the class or $\varepsilon$-far from it, there is a test using a constant number of samples (depending on $\varepsilon$ only) that rejects every graph not in the class with probability at least one half, and always accepts a graph in the class. However, their bound on the number of samples is quite large since they heavily rely on Szemer\'edi's regularity lemma. We study the case of posets and show that every monotone class of posets is easily testable, that is, a polynomial (of $\varepsilon^{-1}$) number of samples is sufficient. We achieve this via proving a polynomial removal lemma for posets.
  We give a simple classification: for every monotone class of posets, there is an $h$ such that the class is indistinguishable (every large enough poset in one class is $\varepsilon$-close to a poset in the other class) from the class of $C_h$-free posets, where $C_h$ denotes the chain with $h$ elements. This allows us to test every monotone class of posets using $O(\varepsilon^{-1})$ samples. The test has a two-sided error, but it is almost complete: the probability of refuting a poset in the class is polynomially small in the size of the poset.
  The analogous results hold for comparability graphs, too.</description>

Abstract: A family of sets $\mathcal{A}$ is union-closed if it is finite and nonempty with member sets that are all finite and distinct (at least one of which is nonempty) and it satisfies the property $X, Y \in \mathcal{A} \implies X \cup Y \in \mathcal{A}$. Let $\binom{S}{k}$ be the set of all $k$-element subsets of a set $S$, and let $[n]=\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$ represent $\bigcup_{A \in \mathcal{A}}A$. Further, let $\mathcal{A}_B=\{A\in\mathcal{A} \ | \ A \cap B = B\}$ and $\mathcal{A}_{\underline{B}}=\{A\in\mathcal{A} \ | \ A \cap B = \emptyset\}$. We consider, for any union-closed family $\mathcal{A}$, the class of conjectures $\textrm{UC}_x \colon \ \exists B \in \binom{[n]}{n-x+1} \ | \ |\mathcal{A}_B| \geq |\mathcal{A}_{\underline{B}}|$, where $x \in [n]$. The extremal case $x=n$ is equivalent to the union-closed sets conjecture, also known as Frankl's conjecture, which states that there exists an element of $[n]$ that is in at least $\frac{|\mathcal{A}|}{2}$ member sets of $\mathcal{A}$. We prove $\textrm{UC}_x$ for $x \in [\lceil \frac{n}{3} \rceil + 1]$, and also investigate two strengthenings of the union-closed sets conjecture.</description>

      <title>A bump statistic on permutations resulting from the Robinson-Schensted correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a permutation statistic that was independently introduced by Romik in 2005. This statistic counts the number of bumps that occur during the execution of the Robinson-Schensted procedure when applied to a given permutation. We provide several interpretations of this bump statistic that include the tableaux shape and also as an extremal problem concerning permutations and increasing subsequences. Several aspects of this bump statistic are investigated from both structural and enumerative viewpoints.</description>

      <title>A Dirac-type theorem for arbitrary Hamiltonian $H$-linked digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any digraph $D$, let $\mathcal{P}(D)$ be the family of all directed paths in $D$, and let $H$ be a digraph with the arc set $A(H)=\{a_1, \ldots, a_k\}$. The digraph $D$ is called arbitrary Hamiltonian $H$-linked if for any injective mapping $f: V(H)\rightarrow V(D)$ and any integer set $\mathcal{N}=\{n_1, \ldots, n_k\}$ with $n_i\geq4$ for each $i\in\{1, \ldots, k\}$, there exists a mapping $g: A(H)\rightarrow \mathcal{P}(D)$ such that for every arc $a_i=uv$, $g(a_i)$ is a directed path from $f(u)$ to $f(v)$ of length $n_i$, and different arcs are mapped into internally vertex-disjoint directed paths in $D$, and $\bigcup_{i\in[k]}V(g(a_i))=V(D)$. In this paper, we prove that for any digraph $H$ with $k$ arcs and $\delta(H)\geq1$, every digraph of sufficiently large order $n$ with minimum in- and out-degree at least $n/2+k$ is arbitrary Hamiltonian $H$-linked. Furthermore, we show that the lower bound is best possible. Our main result extends some work of K\"{u}hn and Osthus et al. \cite{20081,20082} and Ferrara, Jacobson and Pfender \cite{Jacobson}. Besides, as a corollary of our main theorem, we solve a conjecture of Wang \cite{Wang} for sufficiently large graphs.</description>

      <title>Self-Avoiding Walks on Cayley Graphs Through the Lens of Symbolic Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study dynamical and computational properties of the set of bi-infinite self-avoiding walks on Cayley graphs, as well as ways to compute, approximate and bound their connective constant. To do this, we introduce the skeleton $X_{G,S}$ of a finitely generated group $G$ relative to a generating set $S$, which is a one-dimensional subshift made of configurations on $S$ that avoid all words that reduce to the identity. We provide a characterization of groups which have SFT skeletons and sofic skeletons: first, there exists a finite generating set $S$ such that $X_{G,S}$ is a subshift of finite type if and only if $G$ is a plain group; second, there exists $S$ such that $X_{G,S}$ is sofic if and only if $G$ is a plain group, $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathcal{D}_{\infty}\times\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. We also characterize finitely generated torsion groups as groups whose skeletons are aperiodic.
  For connective constants, using graph height functions and bridges, we show that Cayley graphs of finitely generated torsion groups do not admit graph height functions, and that for groups that admit transitive graph height functions, the connective constant is equal to the growth rate of periodic points of the skeleton. Finally, we take a brief look at the set of bi-infinite geodesics and introduce an analog of the connective constant for the geodesic growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ehrhart polynomial and Ehrhart series count lattice points in integer dilations of a lattice polytope. We introduce and study a $q$-deformation of the Ehrhart series, based on the notions of harmonic spaces and Macaulay's inverse systems for coordinate rings of finite point configurations. We conjecture that this $q$-Ehrhart series is a rational function, and introduce and study a bigraded algebra whose Hilbert series matches the $q$-Ehrhart series. Defining this algebra requires a new result on Macaulay inverse systems for Minkowski sums of point configurations.</description>

      <title>Spectral bounds of multi-way Cheeger constants via cyclomatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a non-trivial extension of the celebrated Cheeger inequality, the higher-order Cheeger inequalities for graphs due to Lee, Oveis Gharan and Trevisan provide for each $k$ an upper bound for the $k$-way Cheeger constant in forms of $C(k)\sqrt{\lambda_k(G)}$, where $\lambda_k(G)$ is the $k$-th eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian and $C(k)$ is a constant depending only on $k$. In this article, we prove some new bounds for multi-way Cheeger constants. By shifting the index of the eigenvalue via cyclomatic number, we establish upper bound estimates with an absolute constant instead of $C(k)$. This, in particular, gives a more direct proof of Miclo's higher order Cheeger inequalities on trees. We also show a new lower bound of the multi-way Cheeger constants in terms of the spectral radius of the graph. The proofs involve the concept of discrete nodal domains and a probability argument showing generic properties of eigenfunctions.</description>

      <title>On Christoffel words &amp; their lexicographic array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a Christoffel matrix we mean a $n\times n$ matrix corresponding to the lexicographic array of a Christoffel word of length $n.$ If $R$ is an integral domain, then the product of two Christoffel matrices over $R$ is commutative and is a Christoffel matrix over $R.$ Furthermore, if a Christoffel matrix over $R$ is invertible, then its inverse is a Christoffel matrix over $R.$ Consequently, the set $GC_n(R)$ of all $n\times n$ invertible Christoffel matrices over $R$ forms an abelian subgroup of $GL_n(R).$ The subset of $GC_n(R)$ consisting all invertible Christoffel matrices having some element $a$ on the diagonal and $b$ elsewhere (with $a,b \in R$ distinct) forms a subgroup $H$ of $GC_n(R).$ If $R$ is a field, then the quotient $GC_n(R)/H$ is isomorphic to $(\Z/nZ)^\times,$ the multiplicative group of integers modulo $n.$ It follows from this that for each finite field $F$ and each finite abelian group $G,$ there exists $n\geq 2$ and a faithful representation $G\rightarrow GL_n(F)$ consisting entirely of $n\times n$ (invertible) Christoffel matrices over $F.$ We compute the group $GC_n(\F_2)$ and show that $GC_n(\F_2) \simeq (\Z/nZ)^\times$ for $n$ odd. As an application, we define an associative and commutative binary operation on the set of all $\{0,1\}$-Christoffel words of length $n$ which in turn induces an associative and commutative binary operation on $\{0,1\}$-central words of length $n-2.$</description>

      <title>Minimum degree $k$ and $k$-connectedness usually arrive together</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $d,n\in \mathbb{N}$ be such that $d=\omega(1)$, and $d\le n^{1-a}$ for some constant $a&gt;0$. Consider a $d$-regular graph $G=(V, E)$ and the random graph process that starts with the empty graph $G(0)$ and at each step $G(i)$ is obtained from $G(i-1)$ by adding uniformly at random a new edge from $E$. We show that if $G$ satisfies some (very) mild global edge-expansion, and an almost optimal edge-expansion of sets up to order $O(d\log n)$, then for any constant $k\in \mathbb{N}$ in the random graph process on $G$, typically the hitting times of minimum degree at least $k$ and of $k$-connectedness are equal. This, in particular, covers both $d$-regular high dimensional product graphs and pseudo-random graphs, and confirms a conjecture of Joos from 2015. We further demonstrate that this result is tight in the sense that there are $d$-regular $n$-vertex graphs with optimal edge-expansion of sets up to order $\Omega(d)$, for which the probability threshold of minimum degree at least one is different than the probability threshold of connectivity.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the automorphism group of the cyclic orbifold of a vertex operator algebra associated with a rootless even lattice for a lift of a fixed-point free isometry of odd prime order $p$. We prove that such a cyclic orbifold contains extra automorphisms, not induced from automorphisms of the lattice vertex operator algebra, if and only if the rootless even lattice can be constructed by Construction B from a code over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ or is isometric to the coinvariant lattice of the Leech lattice associated with a certain isometry of order $p$.</description>

      <title>Discreteness of asymptotic tensor ranks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor parameters that are amortized or regularized over large tensor powers, often called "asymptotic" tensor parameters, play a central role in several areas including algebraic complexity theory (constructing fast matrix multiplication algorithms), quantum information (entanglement cost and distillable entanglement), and additive combinatorics (bounds on cap sets, sunflower-free sets, etc.). Examples are the asymptotic tensor rank, asymptotic slice rank and asymptotic subrank. Recent works (Costa-Dalai, Blatter-Draisma-Rupniewski, Christandl-Gesmundo-Zuiddam) have investigated notions of discreteness (no accumulation points) or "gaps" in the values of such tensor parameters.
  We prove a general discreteness theorem for asymptotic tensor parameters of order-three tensors and use this to prove that (1) over any finite field (and in fact any finite set of coefficients in any field), the asymptotic subrank and the asymptotic slice rank have no accumulation points, and (2) over the complex numbers, the asymptotic slice rank has no accumulation points.
  Central to our approach are two new general lower bounds on the asymptotic subrank of tensors, which measures how much a tensor can be diagonalized. The first lower bound says that the asymptotic subrank of any concise three-tensor is at least the cube-root of the smallest dimension. The second lower bound says that any concise three-tensor that is "narrow enough" (has one dimension much smaller than the other two) has maximal asymptotic subrank.
  Our proofs rely on new lower bounds on the maximum rank in matrix subspaces that are obtained by slicing a three-tensor in the three different directions. We prove that for any concise tensor, the product of any two such maximum ranks must be large, and as a consequence there are always two distinct directions with large max-rank.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a central limit theorem in the framework of the group algebra of the Thompson group $F$. We consider the sequence of self-adjoint elements given by $a_n=\frac{g_n+g_n^{*}}{\sqrt{2}}$ in the noncommutative probability space $(\mathbb{C}(F),\varphi)$, where the expectation functional $\varphi$ is the trace associated to the left regular representation of $F$, and the $g_n$-s are the generators of $F$ in its standard infinite presentation. We show that the limit law of the sequence $s_n = \frac{a_0+\cdots+a_{n-1}}{\sqrt{n}}$ is the standard normal distribution.</description>

Abstract: In this note we connect the language of Bessis's Garisde categories with Salvetti's metrical-hemisphere complexes in order to find new examples of weak Garside groups. As our main example, we show that the fundamental group of the (appropriately defined) complexified complement of a pseudohyperplane arrangement is a weak Garside group. As a consequence of the Folkman-Lawrence topological realization theorem, we also show that fundamental group of the Salvetti complex of a ("simplicial") oriented matroid is a weak Garside group. This provides novel examples of weak Garside groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is conflict-free $k$-edge-colorable if there exists an assignment of $k$ colors to $E(G)$ such that for every edge $e\in E(G)$, there is a color that is assigned to exactly one edge among the closed neighborhood of $e$. The smallest $k$ such that $G$ is conflict-free $k$-edge-colorable is called the conflict-free chromatic index of $G$, denoted $\chi'_{CF}(G)$. D\c{e}bski and Przyby\a{l}o showed that $2\le\chi'_{CF}(T)\le 3$ for every tree $T$ of size at least two. In this paper, we present an algorithm to determine the conflict-free chromatic index of a tree without 2-degree vertices, in time $O(|V(T)|)$. This partially answer a question raised by Kamyczura, Meszka and Przyby\a{l}o.</description>

      <title>Hikita conjecture for classical Lie algebras</title>

Abstract: Let $G$ be $Sp_{2n}$, $SO_{2n}$ or $SO_{2n+1}$ and let $G^\vee$ be its Langlands dual group. Barbash and Vogan based on earlier work of Lusztig and Spaltenstein, define a duality map $D$ that sends nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee} \subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$ to special nilpotent orbits $\mathbb{O}_e\subset \mathfrak{g}$. In a work by Losev, Mason-Brown and Matvieievskyi, an upgraded version $\tilde{D}$ of this duality is considered, called the refined BVLS duality. $\tilde{D}(\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee})$ is a $G$-equivariant cover $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e$ of $\mathbb{O}_e$. Let $S_{{e^\vee}}$ be the nilpotent Slodowy slice of the orbit $\mathbb{O}_{e^\vee}$. The two varieties $X^\vee= S_{e^\vee}$ and $X=$ Spec$(\mathbb{C}[\tilde{\mathbb{O}}_e])$ are expected to be symplectic dual to each other. In this context, a version of the Hikita conjecture predicts an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of the Springer fiber $\mathcal{B}_{e^\vee}$ and the ring of regular functions on the scheme-theoretic fixed point $X^T$ for some torus $T$. This paper verifies the isomorphism for certain pairs $e$ and $e^\vee$. These cases are expected to cover almost all instances in which the Hikita conjecture holds when $e^\vee$ regular in a Levi $\mathfrak{l}^\vee\subset \mathfrak{g}^\vee$. Our results in these cases follow from the relations of three different types of objects: generalized coinvariant algebras, equivariant cohomology rings, and functions on scheme-theoretic intersections. We also give evidence for the Hikita conjecture when $e^\vee$ is distinguished.</description>

      <title>Minimal and Maximal Distances in Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given functions $f,g: [n] \rightarrow [n]$ do there exist $n$ points $A_1,A_2\ldots A_n$ in some metric space such that $A_{f(i)},A_{g(i)}$ are the points closest and farthest from point $A_i$? In this paper we characterize precisely which pairs of functions have this property. If the metric space is $\mathbb{R}^k$ we show that the maximal number $m(k)$ so that any pair of functions $f,g: [m(k)]\rightarrow [m(k)]$ realizable in some metric space is also realizable in $\mathbb{R}^k$ grows exponentially in $k$. In the final section of this paper we consider what happens when we look at minimal and maximal distances separately. We show that any function $g$ that can be a maximal distance function can also be a maximal distance function in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We also find an interesting family of functions that can be minimal distance functions but not in $\mathbb{R}^k$.</description>
