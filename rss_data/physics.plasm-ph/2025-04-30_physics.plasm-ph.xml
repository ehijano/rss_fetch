      <title>Desynchronization in multilayer p-i-n drift step recovery diode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact semiconductor drift step recovery diodes (DSRDs) can have on high-power microwave applications make them a device of interest for future solid-state electronics. However, there is little known about their functionality and degradation under over-voltaging or high average power dissipation conditions that could therefore hinder their continual design and optimization toward better performance. The experiments on a Si seven layer DSRD conducted in the present paper allowed to broaden the understanding of its opening switching performance under over-voltaging conditions. A striking desynchronization was discovered and linked to junction and electro-neutral region damage through experiments and PSpice modelling.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing energy transfer mechanisms in the quenching process of microwave air plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A time-dependent multi-temperature quenching model at atmospheric pressure, incorporating chemical and vibrational kinetics, is introduced. The model provides insights into the pathways of NOx formation and destruction in the downstream region of a microwave air plasma. The relaxation of the temperatures during the forced cooling trajectory by the wall is modelled. A Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor model and a Plug Flow Reactor model represent the plasma and quenching regions, respectively. For the non-thermal conditions, where gas and vibrational temperatures differ, most reaction rate coefficients, except those obtained from molecular dynamics methods, are determined based on a generalized Fridman-Macheret scheme. The energy transfer channels involved in the quenching process are tracked across different time scales. By varying the gas temperature in the plasma region and the cooling rate, the reaction pathways for the NOx synthesis mechanism are analysed. This research provides a first step for the further advancement and optimisation of plasma reactors for efficient NOx production.</description>

      <title>Wave Particle Interaction in the Upstream of ICME Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shocks associated with Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejections are known to energize charged particles and give rise to Solar Energetic Particles. Many of these energetic particles move ahead of the shock to create a foreshock region. The foreshock region primarily consists of solar wind plasma, exhibiting turbulent velocity and magnetic fields. Such turbulent behavior results from inherent solar wind turbulence modified by energetic particles. We analyze magnetic field data from six such ICME shocks observed by the Wind spacecraft. The analysis of the shock upstream shows that the magnetic power spectral density (PSD) maintains a power-law slope of $-5/3$. We also identify clear intermittent peaks in the PSD. After characterizing these peaks, we investigate various possibilities for their generation. Our analysis indicates that these peaks in the PSD are due to the resonant interaction of Alfv\'en waves with the bulk solar wind protons and protons with energy up to $10$~keV. However, evidence of Alfv\'en wave interaction with highly energetic protons is not evident in our analysis, and we anticipate that such evidence is obscured by the prevailing solar wind turbulence in the shock upstream.</description>

      <title>Neutral pressure measurement in TCV tokamak using ASDEX-type pressure gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the neutral gas distribution at the edge of magnetic confinement fusion devices is critical for plasma exhaust studies. In the TCV tokamak, a set of ASDEX-type hot ionization pressure gauges (APGs) has been installed for fast, in-situ measurements of the neutral pressure distribution in the TCV chamber. The APGs have been calibrated against baratron pressure gauges (BPGs) for pressures ranging from less than 1 mPa to several hundred mPa. A correction to account for the residual pressure in the pumped torus is proposed to improve the measurement accuracy. APG measurements in a series of plasma discharges with varied density ramp rates are analyzed and compared with the BPG pressure measurements. APG measurements feature a significantly faster time response and extend the BPG measurement range to lower pressures. Systematically higher neutral pressures measured with APGs compared to BPGs connected to the same TCV port, are attributed to the BPG's slower time response and a nonuniform neutral distribution in gauge ports during the plasma discharge. The initial APG operations in TCV have been proven successful, which validates the APG as an adequate pressure measurement technique for the upcoming TCV divertor upgrades.</description>

      <title>Reactor-scale stellarators with force and torque minimized dipole coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we utilize new coil objectives for stellarator optimization with autodifferentiation, including pointwise and net coil-coil forces and torques. We use these methods to perform the first large-scale optimization of planar dipole coil arrays, since arrays of small and geometrically simple coils have been proposed to partially produce the 3D magnetic fields for stellarators, generate advantageous magnetic field perturbations in tokamaks, and provide active, real-time control capabilities. We perform an ablation study to show that minimizing the orientation and location of each coil may be essential to get coil forces, coil torques, and field errors to tolerable levels. We conclude with solutions for three reactor-scale quasi-symmetric stellarators by jointly optimizing nonplanar TF coils and planar coil arrays.</description>

      <title>Visualization of high-intensity laser-matter interactions in virtual reality and web browser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Virtual Beamline (VBL) application, an interactive web-based platform for visualizing high-intensity laser-matter interactions using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, with future potential for experimental data visualization. These interactions include ion acceleration, electron acceleration, $\gamma$-flash generation, electron-positron pair production, and attosecond and spiral pulse generation. Developed at the ELI Beamlines facility, VBL integrates a custom-built WebGL engine with WebXR-based Virtual Reality (VR) support, allowing users to explore complex plasma dynamics in non-VR mode on a computer screen or in fully immersive VR mode using a head-mounted display. The application runs directly in a standard web browser, ensuring broad accessibility. VBL enhances the visualization of PIC simulations by efficiently processing and rendering four main data types: point particles, 1D lines, 2D textures, and 3D volumes. By utilizing interactive 3D visualization, it overcomes the limitations of traditional 2D representations, offering enhanced spatial understanding and real-time manipulation of visualization parameters such as time steps, data layers, colormaps. Users can interactively explore the visualized data by moving their body or using a controller for navigation, zooming, and rotation. These interactive capabilities improve data exploration and interpretation, making VBL a valuable tool for both scientific analysis and educational outreach. The visualizations are hosted online and freely accessible on our server, providing researchers, the general public, and broader audiences with an interactive tool to explore complex plasma physics simulations. By offering an intuitive and dynamic approach to large-scale datasets, VBL enhances both scientific research and knowledge dissemination in high-intensity laser-matter physics.</description>
