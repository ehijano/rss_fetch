      <title>Strategic Interactions between Large Language Models-based Agents in Beauty Contests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing adoption of large language models (LLMs) presents substantial potential for deeper understanding of human behaviours within game theory frameworks through simulations. Leveraging on the diverse pool of LLM types and addressing the gap in research on competitive games, this paper examines the strategic interactions among multiple types of LLM-based agents in a classical game of beauty contest. Drawing parallels to experiments involving human subjects, LLM-based agents are assessed similarly in terms of strategic levels. They demonstrate varying depth of reasoning that falls within a range of level-0 and 1, and show convergence in actions in repeated settings. Furthermore, I also explore how variations in group composition of agent types influence strategic behaviours, where I found higher proportion of fixed-strategy opponents enhances convergence for LLM-based agents, and having a mixed environment with agents of differing relative strategic levels accelerates convergence for all agents. There could also be higher average payoffs for the more intelligent agents, albeit at the expense of the less intelligent agents. These results not only provide insights into outcomes for simulated agents under specified scenarios, it also offer valuable implications for understanding strategic interactions between algorithms.</description>

      <title>Natural disasters and social entrepreneurship: An attention-based view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on the attention based view, this study explores the joint effects of natural disaster intensity at the country level with personal attributes in terms of gender, human capital, and fear of failure on the likelihood to enter social entrepreneurship. Using data on 107,386 observations across 30 countries, we find that natural disaster intensity has a positive effect on individuals likelihood to engage in social entrepreneurship. In addition, the effect of natural disaster intensity is greater for males, individuals lacking human capital, and those who fear failure. Our study helps elaborate on the antecedents of social entrepreneurship and extends the consequences of natural disasters to entrepreneurship at the individual level.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Influence of Climate on Human Mind and Culture: Evidence from Visual Art</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While connections between climate and the human mind and culture are widely acknowledged, they are not thoroughly quantified. Analyzing 100,000 paintings and data on 2,000 artists from the 13th to 21st centuries, the study reveals that the lightness of the paintings exhibited an interesting U-shaped pattern mirroring global temperature trends. There is a significant association between the two, even after controlling for various factors. Event study analysis using the artist-level data further reveals that high-temperature shocks resulted in brighter paintings in later periods for artists who experienced them compared to the control group. The effect is particularly pronounced in art genres that rely on artists' imaginations, indicating a notable influence on artists' minds. These findings underscore the enduring impact of climate on the human mind and culture throughout history and highlight art as a valuable tool for understanding people's minds and cultures.</description>
