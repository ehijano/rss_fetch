      <title>Aggregation of vortex structures in 2D: the blob-wave system and its role in zonal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a rigorous mathematical result, supported by accurate numerical simulations, of the aggregation of a concentrated vortex blob with an underlying non constant vorticity field: the blob moves in the direction of the gradient of the field. It is a unique example of Lagrangian explanation of aggregation of vortex structures of the same sign in 2D inviscid fluids. A conceptual model of zonal flow maintenance and modulation based on this idea is then developed, which produces shapes in accordance with observations.</description>

      <title>The second order Huang-Yang approximation to the Fermi thermodynamic pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a dilute Fermi gas in the thermodynamic limit with interaction potential scattering length $\mathfrak{a}_0$ at temperature $T&gt;0$. We prove the 2nd order Huang-Yang approximation for the Fermi pressure of the system, in which there is a 2nd order term carrying the positive temperature efffect.Our formula is valid up to the temperature $T&lt;\rho^{\frac{2}{3}+\frac{1}{6}}$, which is, by scaling, also necessary for the Huang-Yang formula to hold. Here, $T_F\sim\rho^{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the Fermi temperature. We also establish during the course of the proof, a conjecture regarding the second order approximation of density $\rho$ by R. Seiringer \cite{FermithermoTpositive}. Our proof uses frequency localization techniques from the analysis of nonlinear PDEs and does not involve spatial localization or Bosonization. In particular, our method covers the classical Huang-Yang formula at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Direct approach to approximate conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, non-variational systems of differential equations containing small terms are considered, and a consistent approach for deriving approximate conservation laws through the introduction of approximate Lagrange multipliers is developed. The proposed formulation of the approximate direct method starts by assuming the Lagrange multipliers to be dependent on the small parameter; then, by expanding the dependent variables in power series of the small parameter, we consider the consistent expansion of all the involved quantities (equations and Lagrange multipliers) in such a way the basic principles of perturbation analysis are not violated. Consequently, a theorem leading to the determination of approximate multipliers whence approximate conservation laws arise is proved, and the role of approximate Euler operators emphasized. Some applications of the procedure are presented.</description>

      <title>On the independent set polynomial of graphs and claw-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two new contributions to the study of the independence polynomial $Z_\GI(z)$ of a finite simple graph $\GI = (\VU,\EE)$. First, we establish a novel combinatorial expression for $Z_\GI(z)$, inspired by the connection with the abstract polymer gas models in statistical mechanics, which offers a new structural interpretation of the polynomial and may be of independent interest. Second, we provide an improved lower bound for the zero-free region of $Z_\GI(z)$ in the complex plane for the important class of claw-free graphs. Our bound exceeds the classical Shearer radius and is derived through a refined application of the Fern\'andez-Procacci criterion using properties of the local neighborhood structure in claw-free graphs. These results strengthen the connection between statistical physics, combinatorics, and graph theory, and suggest new approaches for analytic exploration</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Quantum Thermal State Preparation via Local Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta}\propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved {in principle} by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F. Chen {\it et al}, arXiv:2311.09207] -- their implementation requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging {in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately preparing quantum thermal states that only requires the [repeated] implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous performance guarantees independent of detailed physical knowledge of $H$ beyond its locality.</description>

      <title>Constrained Hamiltonian Systems on Observation-Induced Fiber Bundles: Theory of Symmetry and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical constrained Hamiltonian theory assumes complete observability of system states, but in reality only partial state information is often available. This paper establishes a complete geometric theoretical framework for handling such incompletely observed systems. By introducing the concept of observation-induced fiber bundles, we naturally extend Dirac constraint theory to the fiber bundle setting, unifying the treatment of state constraints and observation constraints. Main results include: (1) Classification of existence conditions for observation fiber bundles based on characteristic class theory; (2) Complete characterization of Poisson structures on fiber bundles and corresponding symplectic reduction theory; (3) Geometric necessary and sufficient conditions for integrability and Lax pair construction; (4) Extension of Noether's theorem under symmetry group actions. The theoretical framework naturally encompasses a wide range of applications from classical mechanics to modern safety-critical control systems, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for dynamical analysis under incomplete information.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic behaviour of plane partitions distributed according to a weighted $q^{Volume}$ Muttalib--Borodin ensemble. Specifically, we establish a Large Deviation principle for the discrete Muttalib--Borodin process, characterising the rate function. Furthermore, through Riemann--Hilbert analysis, we give an explicit expression for the asymptotic shape of the partition.</description>

      <title>Graded Paraparticle Algebra of Majorana Fields for Multidimensional Quantum Computing with Structured Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that integrates Majorana's infinite-component relativistic equation within the algebraic structure of paraparticles through the minimal nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$--graded Lie algebras and $R$-matrix quantization. By mapping spin-dependent mass spectra to graded sectors associated with generalized quantum statistics, we derive an equation embodying Majorana's mass-spin relation describing Majorana quasiparticles of structured light carrying spin and orbital angular momentum. These quanta in the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$--graded algebras and $R$-matrix formulations extend the previous results from superconducting qubits to photonic platforms and set up deterministic 2-photon gates involving at least two qubits encoded in a single photon without nonlinear effects. This makes feasible general quantum computing pathways exploiting fractional statistics through Nelson's quantum mechanics and implement a novel procedure for error correction in photonic platforms. Furthermore, this approach makes possible to set paraparticle-based quantum information processing, beyond fermions and bosons, using graded qudits.</description>

      <title>Quantum cohomology, shift operators, and Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a complex reductive group $G$ and a $G$-representation $\mathbf{N}$, there is an associated quantized Coulomb branch algebra $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ defined by Braverman, Finkelberg and Nakajima. In this paper, we give a new interpretation of $\mathcal{A}_{G,\mathbf{N}}^\hbar$ as the largest subalgebra of the equivariant Borel--Moore homology of the affine Grassmannian on which shift operators can naturally be defined. As a main application, we show that if $X$ is a smooth semiprojective variety equipped with a $G$-action, and $X \to \mathbf{N}$ is a $G$-equivariant proper holomorphic map, then the equivariant big quantum cohomology $QH_G^\bullet(X)$ defines a quasi-coherent sheaf of algebras on the Coulomb branch with coisotropic support. Upon specializing the Novikov and bulk parameters, this sheaf becomes coherent with Lagrangian support. We also apply our construction to recover Teleman's gluing construction for Coulomb branches and derive different generalizations of the Peterson isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Locating Extremal Periodic Orbits for the Planar Circular Restricted Three Body Problem using Polynomial Sum-of-Squares Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With an increasing interest in the design of long and complex space missions, the search for orbits that require the least amount of fuel is of fundamental interest. This paper develops existing computational models for locating Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs) in polynomial dynamical systems using Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization technique and proposes a numerical framework to converge UPOs for the Planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (PCR3BP) in astrodynamics. This is done by developing the polynomial SOS optimization technique with extension to systems with non-polynomial and Hamiltonian dynamics. First, we demonstrate and exploit the dependency of convergence of tight bounds on an observable of interest with varying scaling factors for large polynomial degrees. SOS optimization is then used to compute nonnegative polynomials, the minimization sublevel sets of which, approximately localise parts of the corresponding UPO. Improvements in current non-linear optimization techniques are suggested to compute a large number of points inside the relevant sublevel sets. Such points provide good initial conditions for UPO computations with existing algorithms. The distinguishing feature of such UPOs is that they optimize the long-time average of an input observable of interest which is a function of state variables. For the PCR3BP this means that such orbits in space can be traversed indefinitely in time without continuous fuel expenditure. As practical applications to space mission designs, we converge UPOs that minimise transmitted power required by satellites for the Earth-Moon system in a communication relay problem by minimizing the infinite-time average of sum of squares of distances of a satellite from Earth and the Moon.</description>

      <title>Structure Scalars for Charged Dissipative Spherical Collapse in $f(R, T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the structure scalars formed from the orthogonal splitting of the Riemann tensor of the spacetime metric describing the interior of a charged matter configuration undergoing dissipative collapse in $f(R,T)$ gravity, and how they influence the various physical parameters of the collapsing matter. A treatment is provided for the unspecified $f(R, T)$ function, and the nature of the results for a linear $f(R, T)$ function is presented. In the absence of dissipation, the energy density inhomogeneity is influenced by $X_{TF}$ and the mass function. Further, the presence of charge affects the structure scalars and the total mass-energy content. The dependence of various physical parameters, such as heat dissipation, energy density inhomogeneity, evolution of the expansion scalar, the shear scalar, effective homogeneous energy density, and pressure anisotropy, on the structure scalars has been clearly indicated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the derivation of the Einstein field equations via Hamilton's principle, the inclusion of a boundary term is essential to render the variational problem well-posed, as it addresses variations that do not vanish at the boundary of the spacetime manifold. Typically, this term is chosen as the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. In this work, we propose an alternative treatment of the boundary term within a cosmological framework by employing the Lagrange multiplier method. This approach enforces the vanishing of the boundary term throughout the evolution of the Universe, leading to the prediction of a fluid component that decays as the sixth power of the scale factor. This type of fluid has been studied in the context of the early universe under the name of stiff matter, and it can be related to a scalar field known as kination.</description>

      <title>Unified Structural Embedding of Orbifold Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a new unified structural framework for orbifold sigma models that incorporates twisted sectors, singularities, and smooth regions into a single algebraic object. Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat such sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing at capturing inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. Therefore, the scope of this study aims at resolving these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Examples demonstrate the applicability, including explicit calculations for the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions.</description>

Abstract: This article establishes cutoff convergence or abrupt convergence of three statistical quantities for multivariate (Hurwitz) stable geometric Brownian motion: the autocorrelation function, the Wasserstein distance between the current state and its degenerate limiting measure, and, finally, anti-concentration probabilities, which yield a fine-tuned trade-off between almost sure rates and the respective integrability of the random modulus of convergence using a quantitative Borel--Cantelli Lemma. We obtain in case of simultaneous diagonalizable drift and volatility matrices a complete representation of the mean square and derive nontrivial, sufficient and necessary mean square stability conditions, which include all real and imaginary parts of the volatility matrices' spectra.</description>

Abstract: We provide a general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of perturbative contributions to observables in arbitrary power-law FRW cosmologies, indistinctly the Bunch-Davies wavefunction and cosmological correlators. We consider a large class of scalar toy models, including conformally-coupled and massless scalars in arbitrary dimensions, that admits a first principle definition in terms of (generalised/weighted) cosmological polytopes. The perturbative contributions to an observable can be expressed as an integral of the canonical function associated to such polytopes and to weighted graphs. We show how the asymptotic behaviour of these integrals is governed by a special class of nestohedra living in the graph-weight space, both at tree and loop level. As the singularities of a cosmological process described by a graph can be associated to its subgraphs, we provide a realisation of the nestohedra as a sequential truncation of a top-dimensional simplex based on the underlying graph. This allows us to determine all the possible directions -- both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet --, where the integral can diverge as well as their divergence degree. Both of them are associated to the facets of the nestohedra, which are identified by overlapping tubings of the graph: the specific tubing determines the divergent directions while the number of overlapping tubings its degree of divergence. This combinatorial formulation makes straightforward the application of sector decomposition for extracting both leading and subleading divergences from the integral, as the sectors in which the integration domain can be tiled are identified by the collection of compatible facets of the nestohedra, with the latter that can be determined via the graph tubings. Finally, the leading divergence can be interpreted as a restriction of the canonical function of the relevant polytope onto a special hyperplane.</description>

      <title>Area measures and branched polymers in supercritical Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) phase, which has background charge $Q \in (0,2)$ and central charge $\mathbf{c}_{\mathrm{L}} = 1+6Q^2 \in (1,25)$. Recent works have shown how to define LQG in this phase as a planar random geometry associated with a variant of the Gaussian free field, which exhibits "infinite spikes." In contrast, a number of results from physics, dating back to the 1980s, suggest that supercritical LQG surfaces should behave like "branched polymers": i.e., they should look like the continuum random tree. We prove a result which reconciles these two descriptions of supercritical LQG. More precisely, we show that for a family of random planar maps with boundary in the universality class of supercritical LQG, if we condition on the (small probability) event that the planar map is finite, then the scaling limit is the continuum random tree. We also show that there does not exist any locally finite measure associated with supercritical LQG which is locally determined by the field and satisfies the LQG coordinate change formula. Our proofs are based on a branching process description of supercritical LQG which comes from its coupling with CLE$_4$ (Ang and Gwynne, arXiv:2308.11832).</description>

      <title>More accurate slow-roll approximations for inflation in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose new versions of the slow-roll approximation for inflationary models with nonminimally coupled scalar fields. We derive more precise expressions for the standard slow-roll parameters as functions of the scalar field. To verify the accuracy of the proposed approximations, we consider inflationary models with the induced gravity term and the fourth-order monomial potential. For specific values of the model parameters, this model is the well-known Higgs-driven inflationary model. We investigate the inflationary dynamics in the Jordan frame and come to the conclusion that the proposed versions of the slow-roll approximation are not only more accurate at the end of inflation, but also give essentially more precise estimations for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the amplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$.</description>

      <title>Vaidya-Reissner-Nordstr\"om Extension On the White-hole Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic model that extends classical white hole geometry by incorporating both radiative dynamics and electric charge. Starting from a maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild white hole via Kruskal Szekeres coordinates, we introduce a time dependent mass function, representative of outgoing null dust to model evaporation. Building on this foundation, the study then integrates the Reissner-Nordstr\"om framework to obtain a dynamic, charged white hole solution in double null coordinates. In the resulting Vaidya Reissner Nordstr\"om metric, both the Bondi mass and the associated charge decrease monotonically with retarded time, capturing the interplay of radiation and electromagnetic effects. Detailed analysis of horizon behavior reveals how mass loss and charge shedding modify the causal structure, ensuring that energy conditions are preserved and cosmic censorship is maintained.</description>

      <title>Multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) and quantum Calogero-Sutherland system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this first of two articles, we study the multiple radial $\mathrm{SLE}(\kappa)$ systems with parameter $\kappa &gt; 0$ -- a family of random multi-curve systems in a simply-connected domain $\Omega$, with marked boundary points $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ and a marked interior point $q$. As a consequence of the domain Markov property and conformal invariance, we show that such systems are characterized by equivalence classes of partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, one can always choose a conformally covariant representative. When the marked interior point $q$ is set at the origin, we demonstrate that the partition function satisfies a system of second-order PDEs, known as the null vector equations, with a null vector constant $h$ and a rotation equation involving a constant $\omega$. Motivated by the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct four families of solutions to the null vector equations, which are naturally classified according to topological link patterns. For $\kappa &gt; 0$, the partition functions of multiple radial SLE($\kappa$) systems correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Sutherland (CS) Hamiltonian beyond the states built upon the fermionic states.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Young diagrams for symplectic groups and semiclassical orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider an $n\times k$ matrix of i.i.d. Bernoulli random numbers with $p=1/2$. Dual RSK algorithm gives a bijection of this matrix to a pair of Young tableaux of conjugate shape, which is manifestation of skew Howe $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-duality. Thus the probability measure on zero-ones matrix leads to the probability measure on Young diagrams proportional to the ratio of the dimension of $GL_{n}\times GL_{k}$-representation and the dimension of the exterior algebra $\bigwedge\left(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{k}\right)$.
  Similarly, by applying Proctor's algorithm based on Berele's modification of the Schensted insertion, we get skew Howe duality for the pairs of groups $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$. In the limit when $n,k\to\infty$ $GL$-case is relatively easily studied by use of free-fermionic representation for the correlation kernel. But for the symplectic groups there is no convenient free-fermionic representation. We use Christoffel transformation to obtain the semiclassical orthogonal polynomials for $Sp_{2n}\times Sp_{2k}$ from Krawtchouk polynomials that describe $GL_{2n}\times GL_{2k}$ case. We derive an integral representation for semiclassical polynomials. The study of the asymptotic of this integral representation gives us the description of the limit shapes and fluctuations of the random Young diagrams for symplectic groups.</description>

      <title>Multiple chordal SLE($\kappa$) and quantum Calogero-Moser system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiple chordal SLE$(\kappa)$ systems in a simply connected domain $\Omega$, where $z_1, \ldots, z_n \in \partial \Omega$ are boundary starting points, and $q \in \partial \Omega$ is an additional marked boundary point.
  Based on the framework introduced in \cite{Dub07}, we show that the partition functions in the upper half-plane $\mathbb{H}$ satisfy both the null vector equations and a dilatation equation with scaling constant $d$.
  We show that the presence of the marked boundary point $q$ introduces a natural equivalence relation among partition functions, which are not necessarily conformally covariant. Nevertheless, within each equivalence class, a conformally covariant representative can always be chosen.
  Using techniques from the Coulomb gas formalism in conformal field theory, we construct two distinct families of solutions, each indexed by a topological link pattern of type $(n,m)$, where $2m \leq n$.
  In the special case where $\Omega = \mathbb{H}$ and $q = \infty$, we demonstrate that these partition functions correspond to eigenstates of the quantum Calogero-Moser system, extending the known correspondence beyond the standard $(2n,n)$ setting.</description>

      <title>LSZ ghostbusters in the quadratic gravity stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, It is of interest the derivation of the LSZ rules in this context, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks, due to the non standard oscillator algebra and the redefinitions of the states.This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>
