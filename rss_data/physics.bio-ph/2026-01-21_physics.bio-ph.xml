      <title>Intelligent Nano-Fingerprinting: An Efficient and Precise Approach for Liquid Biopsy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological matrices are rich in information related to life processes, serving as invaluable media for assessing an individual's overall physiological status and its dynamic fluctuations, as well as crucial foundations for disease diagnosis. However, the inherent complexity of these matrices, coupled with our incomplete understanding of their full composition, presents significant challenges for comprehensive analysis and accurate diagnostic interpretation. The advent of single-molecule technologies has revolutionized biomedical research, enabling the direct observation of life processes at the molecular scale. We have proposed an Intelligent Nano-Fingerprinting strategy based on single-molecule nanopore technology, designed to capture the global molecular fingerprints of complex plasma matrices. Furthermore, we developed an intelligent algorithmic model capable of achieving precise classification of plasma samples. This approach is characterized by its simplicity, efficiency, and considerable potential for large-scale adoption and transferable applications.</description>

      <title>Supercontraction-Induced Twist in Spider Silk Is a Dual Poynting Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spider dragline silk supercontracts as humidity increases, displaying large axial shortening together with a reproducible macroscopic twist. The physical origin of this torsion remains debated and is often attributed to helically arranged load-bearing elements, despite the lack of direct evidence for helicity in the native fiber. Here we show that torsion can arise generically from nonlinear anisotropic elasticity: humidity-driven shortening of the amorphous matrix, mechanically constrained by stiff, axially aligned $\beta$-sheet--rich load-bearing segments and their experimentally induced prestretch, drives the system into a dual Poynting regime in which axial shortening couples to spontaneous twist. Coupling a diffusion-based water-uptake law to irreversible matrix remodeling and fiber plasticity, the model quantitatively reproduces monotonic and cyclic torsional measurements using parameter values consistent with available experimental material parameters. These results identify supercontraction-induced torsion in spider silk as a manifestation of a dual Poynting effect and provide a minimal, physically grounded framework for humidity-driven torsional actuation in matrix--fiber architectures.</description>

      <title>Low-Dimensional Interaction Spaces Impose Geometric Constraints On Collective Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective organization in physical, biophysical, and biological systems often emerges from many weak, local interactions, yet the resulting global structures display striking regularities and apparent limits in diversity. Existing theoretical approaches typically emphasize specific mechanisms, detailed dynamics, or energetic optimization, making it difficult to identify constraints that are independent of microscopic realization. Here we develop a general theoretical framework showing that, when effective interactions among system components compress into a low-dimensional interaction space, global organization is governed by geometric constraints rather than detailed dynamics. We formalize interaction spaces as metric manifolds derived from coarse-grained effective couplings and show that low interaction dimensionality imposes upper bounds on the number, separability, and robustness of distinct collective organizations. These results yield impossibility statements: many conceivable macroscopic organizations are excluded a priori, even when locally compatible interactions exist. The framework applies across equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems without assuming specific symmetries or conservation laws. By shifting the explanatory focus from generative mechanisms to structural constraints, this work establishes a general, geometry-based perspective on collective organization.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS): A Unified Spectral Topology Framework for Stability in Turbulence, AI, and Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems frequently encounter a recurrent structural instability: the collapse of the spectral gap, driving the system toward a low-dimensional "Zero-Mode Attractor" (e.g., spectral pile-up or over-smoothing). Building upon recent global well-posedness estimates [Hou, arXiv:2601.00638], this work generalizes the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information System (MNCIS) framework. We postulate that global stability requires an active topological operator -- Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) -- functioning as a state-dependent high-pass filter that penalizes entropy accumulation at spectral boundaries. We validate this unified framework via three implementations:(1) Hydrodynamics: In 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence ($N=256^3$), ASNC acts as a global-enstrophy adaptive sub-grid scale (SGS) model, stabilizing the inviscid limit and preserving the Kolmogorov $-5/3$ inertial range without artificial hyper-viscosity.(2) Artificial Intelligence: Addressing Over-smoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we implement ASNC as a parameter-free topological constraint. Unlike baselines (e.g., DeepGCNs) relying on dense residual connections to bypass signal decay, our framework enables the training of ultra-deep 64-layer networks without residual connections, maintaining perfectly stationary feature variance ($\sigma^2 \equiv 1.0$) on the ogbn-arxiv benchmark. (3) Biological Physics: In reaction-diffusion morphogenesis, it stabilizes Turing patterns against diffusive washout in high-entropy regimes. Our results suggest that the MNCIS framework provides a base-independent topological condition for distinguishing viable complex systems from those collapsing into thermal equilibrium, bridging physical stability and information persistence.</description>

      <title>Optical Self-Trapping and Nonlinear Light-Matter Interactions in Biological Soft Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-scattering, deep-penetration light transport in biological media remains a pivotal challenge for biophotonic technologies, including biomedical imaging, optical diagnostics, and photodynamic therapy. This review builds upon and extends our earlier studies of nonlinear optical self-trapping and optically induced waveguiding in biological suspensions, such as human erythrocytes and cyanobacteria, where light-matter coupling is governed by optical-force-mediated particle redistribution. Recent progress has revealed increasingly rich and complex regimes, including the propagation and nonlinear self-action of structured (vortex) beams in biological environments, as well as nonlinear responses dominated by thermally driven mechanisms in absorptive biomolecular solutions (e.g., heme and chlorophyll). We place particular emphasis on distinctive nonlinear phenomena observed in these systems, including spatial self-phase modulation, optical-force-induced sculpturing of effective energy landscapes, and quasi-waveguide formation in soft, heterogeneous biological media. We conclude by highlighting emerging opportunities to harness these nonlinear behaviors for deep-tissue imaging, label-free biosensing, and the realization of biocompatible photonic structures and devices assembled directly from living or hybrid biological matter.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Shaping of Ultrasound Vortex through the Human Skull Enabled by Binary Acoustic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrasound vortices have rapidly expanded their applications to areas like particle trapping, contactless manipulation, acoustic communications. In ultrasonic imaging and therapy involving bone tissues, these vortex beams offer intriguing possibilities but transmitting them through bone (especially the skull) poses challenges. Traditional acoustic lenses were engineered to rectify skull-induced beam aberration, and their capacity was limited to generating only static ultrasound fields within the brain. To overcome this constraint, our study presents a novel method for transcranially steering focused ultrasound vortex using 3D printed binary acoustic metasurfaces (BAMs) with a thickness of 0.8 {\lambda}. We tackled the challenge of skull-induced phase aberration by computing the phase distribution via a time reversal technique, which concurrently enabled the generation of a steerable focused vortex inside an ex vivo human skull by adjusting the operating frequency. Both numerical and simulations experiments were conducted to validate the capabilities of BAMs. Furthermore, we explored the generation of higher-order topological charge acoustic vortices within the brain utilizing the BAM. This development paves the way for designing cost-effective particle-trapping systems, facilitating clot manipulation, and applying acoustic-radiation forces and torques within or across bone structures, thus presenting a new frontier for potential biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>In Vivo Quantification of Arterial Active Mechanics Using Deep Learning-Assisted Pressure-Area Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active arterial mechanics, governed by vascular smooth muscle contraction, are critical to physiological regulation, cardiovascular disease progression, and clinical diagnosis. Although various in vivo methods have been developed to assess arterial stiffness, most cannot distinguish the contribution of smooth muscle tone; therefore, quantitative characterization of arterial activity remains challenging. In this study, we developed a pressure-area analysis framework integrating ultrasound imaging, blood pressure measurement, neural network-based segmentation of arterial cross-sectional area, and biomechanical model-driven inversion to infer active mechanical properties. A total of 233 volunteers (aged 18-65 year) were recruited to acquire cross-sectional ultrasound videos of the right common carotid artery for training the neural network. The segmentation results demonstrate good spatial and temporal performance of the neural network. We further recruited 10 additional volunteers (aged 25 +/- 3 year) to perform a 1-minute step test, followed by pressure-area measurements over a 30-minute recovery period. Using the proposed approach, we quantified post-exercise changes in carotid arterial active mechanics relative to baseline (i.e., the resting state). Results showed that active mechanics remained elevated for approximately 15 minutes compared to baseline (p &lt; 0.05), whereas systolic pressure differed significantly only within the first approximately 5 minutes post-exercise (p &lt; 0.001). These results indicate a dissociation between blood pressure and smooth muscle recovery, which may offer new insight into vascular smooth muscle regulation during physiological stress.</description>

      <title>Pollutant-induced changes in fish pigmentation and spatial patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pigmentation abnormalities, ranging from hypo- to hyperpigmentation, can serve as biomarkers of developmental disruption in fish exposed to environmental contaminants. However, the mechanistic pathways underlying these alterations remain poorly understood. Studies have shown that pattern formation in fish development requires specific pigment cell interactions. Motivated by experimental observations of pigmentation alterations following contaminant exposure, we investigate how pollutants influence pigment cell self-organization using a continuum reaction-diffusion-advection framework. The model incorporates nonlocal Morse-type kernels to describe short- and long-range interactions among melanophores and xanthophores. Our results show that perturbations to the strengths of adhesion or repulsion can drive transitions between stripes, spots, and mixed patterns, reproducing phenotypes characteristic of fish pigmentation mutants. In particular, homotypic interactions are sensitive to contamination, leading to pronounced changes in melanophore density and resulting pigmentation patterns. Time-dependent simulations indicate that pigment changes from early short-term contaminant exposure may be recoverable, whereas prolonged exposure can lead to sustained pigment loss. In a growing fish, contaminant-induced changes in cell-cell interactions directly influence stripe formation rate, stripe number, and pigmentation levels. Overall, our study provides insight into the mechanistic link between experimentally observed pigmentation alterations and the changes in spatial patterns of adult fish.</description>

      <title>Flapping strategies for flying formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long arrays of identical, self-propelling flapping flyers are inherently unstable and thus unlikely to exist without active control mechanisms. One approach to enable long in-line formations is to enforce a constant separation between the group members. The objective then becomes to determine the flapping strategies the flyers should adopt to achieve a certain separation. Using an aerodynamic model of vortex wake production and inter-flyer effects, we explore different flapping strategies for followers given the motion of the leader. The choice of tactic is dependent upon the aerodynamic, kinematic, and physical parameters of the system, and reflects an interplay between efficiency and stability. We find that whether a flyer flaps in or out of phase with its upstream neighbour, together with the target separation, strongly affect the flapping amplitude and, therefore, the energetic cost of group flight. In certain regimes, group flight is energetically favourable compared to isolated flight, while in others, flying in formation becomes less efficient. We also identify "goldilocks zones", ranges of separation in which one of the in- or out-of-phase motions can be simultaneously energetically efficient and dynamically stable. Outside these regions, energetically favourable flight is unstable and therefore unlikely to occur.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the Orderphobic Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation-induced forces, such as the Critical Casimir Effect (CCE), are fundamental mechanisms driving organization and self-assembly near second-order phase transitions. The existence of a comparable, universal force for systems undergoing a first-order transition has remained an unresolved fundamental question. The proposed Orderphobic Effect is one such potential mechanism. It arises from minimisation of the interfacial free energy between solutes that locally nucleate a disordered phase. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration and quantitative measurement of the Orderphobic Effect. Using a driven, non-equilibrium quasi-2D granular fluid undergoing a first-order order-disorder transition, we show that specifically designed solutes in an ordered phase nucleate a coexisting ``bubble'' of the disordered phase. By analysing its capillary fluctuations, we confirm that this phenomenon occurs due to the proximity to phase-coexistence, and we directly quantify the attractive force by measuring the interaction free energy between solutes. The observation of this general fluctuation-mediated force in a non-equilibrium steady state strongly supports its claimed universality. Our work establishes the Orderphobic Effect as the first-order equivalent to the CCE, providing a new, general route for controlling self-assembly and aggregation in soft matter and non-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacteria regulate their motility through a variety of mechanisms, including quorum sensing (QS) and other density-dependent responses mediated by diffusible signals. While nonlinear density-dependent motility is well known in active-matter theory to generate nonequilibrium spatial patterns, its consequences for the coexistence of growing, interacting species remain less explored. Here we develop a minimal spatially structured model for two strongly competing species in which local demographic interactions are coupled to an escape response: each species increases its motility nonlinearly (sigmoidal) with the local abundance of its competitor. We show that this sigmoidal motility regulation promotes optimal spatial self-organization and can sustain long term coexistence via segregation, even in parameter regimes that yield competitive exclusion in well-mixed Lotka-Volterra dynamics. On two-dimensional lattices, the interplay between demographic competition and density-dependent motility generates a range of emergent patterns, including regimes in which the weaker competitor counterintuitively has higher total abundance. Overall, our results identify nonlinear, competitor-induced motility as a fundamental mechanism capable of sustaining coexistence in competing microbial populations.</description>

      <title>Invariance under Structure Translation as the Origin of Host Immune Capacity Conservation from Noether's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The capacity to resist pathogens is recognized as a fundamental property of the immune system, yet the capacity itself remains a phenomenological concept and lacks a defined physical basis. Its fundamental entity, definition, and quantification are thus unresolved. Here, we address these questions by introducing a theoretical framework based on Lagrangian analytical mechanics, which recasts immune recognition as a dynamical system in an immunological state space. Generalized coordinates are used to describe the conformational states of immune receptors, and their evolution is governed by Euler-Lagrange equations constructed from the antigen-receptor interaction. Central to our theory is the identification of a continuous symmetry: the action remains invariant under specific translations within the antigenic structure space or time. From this symmetry, Noether's theorem dictates a conserved quantity, $I$. We propose that $I$ is the physical embodiment of host immunity, a quantifiable measure that integrates the system's protective sensitivity (with dimensions of action) and response intensity (with dimensions of energy). Furthermore, this framework unifies key immunological phenomena as dynamical consequences of the same underlying conservation law, including vaccination, immune memory, tolerance, original antigenic sin, and T cell exhaustion. The consistency of this model with established clinical observations (e.g., conserved symptom profiles across distinct influenza strains) and published experimental data provides its initial validation. By transforming immune capacity from a phenomenological concept into a quantifiable physical entity defined by a conservation law, this work establishes a foundational framework for a unified, predictive immunology.</description>

      <title>A Polarization Hall Effect in Hydrated DNA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how soft matter systems, including biological ones, can develop collective electromagnetic phenomena under external fields at ambient conditions remains a central challenge, as thermal fluctuations are generally expected to suppress long-range organization. Here, we report that hydrated DNA exhibits a reproducible magnetic-field-induced transition characterized by a sharp transverse-voltage threshold, followed by a regime of regular, phase-stable oscillations in the transverse polarization signal. These features emerge only beyond the threshold and display a pronounced temperature dependence, consistent with the formation of a collective mode within the hydrogen-bond network of the DNA-water interface. Motivated by recent studies of Hall-like responses carried by neutral excitations, including phonons, magnons, and excitons, we interpret the observed transverse signal in terms of coherent polarization dynamics of proton - proton-hole dipoles confined to a quasi-two-dimensional hydrated layer. Within this framework, the transverse response is attributed to a field-organized polarization mode; the measured transverse voltage arises from collective dipolar dynamics rather than steady carrier transport. These results identify hydrated DNA as a soft-matter system in which magnetic field and temperature jointly modulate collective polarization dynamics, providing a biologically relevant platform for exploring coherence and transverse phenomena in hydrogen-bonded media.</description>

      <title>Information-Thermodynamic Analysis of the DNA--RNA Polymerase Complex via Interface Dissipation: Based on Observer--Observed Swap Symmetry</title>

Abstract: RNA polymerase (RNAP) elongates RNA by walking along a DNA template and selectively incorporating ribonucleoside triphosphates (rNTPs). Rather than mechanically replicating the base sequence, RNAP conditions binding and chemistry on the currently read template nucleotide, converting sequence dependence into a bias in its stochastic motion. Thermal fluctuations generate forward/backward translocation attempts; cognate rNTP binding and incorporation stabilize the forward register and suppress backward return, yielding net advance via a Brownian-ratchet mechanism.
  We formulate the DNA--RNAP complex as a bipartite stochastic system, separating template-side degrees of freedom $X$ from RNAP-side response degrees of freedom $Y$. Irreversibility is quantified by a Kullback--Leibler divergence between forward and time-reversed path measures, yielding joint and marginal dissipations. From these we define an exchange-invariant interface dissipation $\Sigma_{\mathrm{int}}$ that isolates time-reversal asymmetry generated specifically by coupling across the DNA--RNAP interface. We prove an exchange-symmetric second law, $\Sigma_{\mathrm{int}}\ge 0$, and show that this interface measure is well defined without invoking local detailed balance.
  To connect the framework to data analysis, we present a minimal continuous-time Markov jump model implementing the Brownian-ratchet logic and a likelihood-ratio protocol to estimate dissipation rates from discretely sampled trajectories. Finite-sample convergence is assessed via Markov-order diagnostics, clarifying bias--variance tradeoffs under coarse-graining. The interface-centered measure provides a consistent basis for comparing energetic cost across regimes (sequence-dependent kinetics, misincorporation, backtracking, proofreading) and can be combined with hidden-state inference when internal states are partially observed.</description>
