      <title>Three-dimensional flat bands and possible interlayer triplet pairing superconductivity in the alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices hosting flat bands and correlated states have emerged as a focal topic in condensed matter research. Through first-principles calculations, we investigate three-dimensional flat bands in alternating twisted NbSe$_2$ moir\'e bulk structures. These structures exhibit enhanced interlayer interactions compared to twisted bilayer configurations. Our results demonstrate that moir\'e bulks undergo spontaneous large-scale structural relaxation, resulting in the formation of remarkably flat energy bands at twist angles $\leq$ 7.31{\deg}. The $k_z$-dependent dispersion of flat bands across different moir\'e bulks reveals their intrinsic three-dimensional character. The presence of out-of-plane mirror symmetry in these moir\'e bulk structures suggests possible interlayer triplet superconducting pairing mechanisms that differ from those in twisted bilayer systems. Our work paves the way for exploring potential three-dimensional flat bands in other moir\'e bulk systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces: Regular hyperbolic lattices and Ginzburg-Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $s$-wave superconductivity in hyperbolic spaces using the Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory for discrete hyperbolic lattices and the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the continuous hyperbolic plane. Hyperbolic lattices maintain a finite fraction of boundary sites regardless of system size, thus fundamentally altering superconductivity through enhanced boundary effects absent in flat space. Within the BCS framework for hyperbolic lattices, uniform systems reproduce standard bulk behavior, whereas finite systems with open boundaries, studied through exact diagonalization and Cayley-tree approximations, exhibit boundary-enhanced superconductivity and boundary-only superconducting states that persist above the bulk critical temperature. Numerical studies further reveal that boundary termination critically determines superconducting properties; in particular, rough boundaries with dangling bonds generate zero-energy modes that raise critical temperatures by several times relative to smooth boundaries. Turning to the complementary Ginzburg-Landau analysis of the hyperbolic plane, we find that finite geometries permit radial variations of the condensate absent in infinite space. Owing to the interplay between coherence length and curvature radius, the theory exhibits two types of superconductivity even without magnetic fields, with vortices replaced by lines of vanishing order parameter in the nontrivial type. Our findings establish hyperbolic geometry as a platform for engineering boundary-controlled superconductivity, opening new directions for physics in curved spaces in condensed matter and holography.</description>

      <title>Observation of the crossover from quantum fluxoid to half-quantum fluxoid in a chiral superconducting device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductors are one of the intriguing material groups from the viewpoint of not only condensed matter physics but also industrial application such as quantum computers based on Majorana fermion. For the real application, developments of the thin-film topological superconductors are highly desirable. Bi/Ni bilayer is a possible candidate for thin-film chiral superconductors where the time-reversal symmetry is broken. Here we report the phase shift of resistance oscillations by half flux quantum in a ring-shaped device of epitaxial Bi/Ni bilayer induced by a small magnetic field through the ring. The half quantum fluxoid can be a decisive evidence for unconventional superconductors where the superconducting order parameter has an internal degree of freedom. The present result provides a functional operating principle for quantum devices where the phase of the supercurrent can be shifted by \pi with a small magnetic field, based on the internal degree of freedom possessed by topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Prediction of several Co-based La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-like superconducting materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High temperature superconductivity has been found in Fe, Ni, and Cu compounds, but not Co, where the Ni compounds include the recently found bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. Here we theoretically predict several Co-based La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-like high-temperature superconducting materials. With electron doping to high-pressure bilayer cobaltate La$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$, we find that LaTh$_2$Co$_2$O$_7$, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$, and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Br$_2$ may show similar crystal structures and strongly correlated electronic structures to bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. Within the random-phase approximation (RPA), the leading pairing symmetry in these materials is $s$-wave.</description>

      <title>Dichotomy in Low- and High-energy Band Renormalizations in Trilayer Nickelate $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$: a Comparison with Cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band renormalizations comprise crucial insights for understanding the intricate roles of electron-boson coupling and electron correlation in emergent phenomena such as superconductivity. In this study, by combining high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and theoretical calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure of the trilayer nickelate superconductor $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ at ambient pressure. We reveal a dichotomy in the electronic band renormalizations of $La_{4}Ni_{3}O_{10}$ in comparison to cuprate superconductors. At a high energy scale of hundreds of meV, its band structure is strongly renormalized by electron correlation effect enhanced by Hund coupling. The resultant waterfall-like dispersions resemble the high-energy kinks in cuprate superconductors. However, at low energy scales of tens of meV, the dispersive bands are nearly featureless and devoid of any resolvable electron-boson interactions, in drastic contrast to the low-energy kinks observed in cuprates and other correlated 3d transition-metal compounds. The dichotomic band renormalizations highlight the disparity between nickelate and cuprate superconductors and emphasize the importance of strong electron-correlation in the superconductivity of Ruddlesden-Popper phase nickelates.</description>

      <title>Surfaces and interfaces of infinite-layer nickelates studied by dynamical mean-field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinite-layer nickelate superconductors are typically synthesized as thin films and thus include, besides the more bulk-like inner layers, distinct surface and interface layers in contact with the vacuum and substrate, respectively. Here, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to investigate how electronic correlations influence these surface and interface regions. Our results show that electronic correlations can significantly modify the electronic structure, even driving surface layers into a Mott-insulating state with a 3$d^8$ electronic configuration. Moreover, surface termination effects induce a polar field that can shift the $\Gamma$ and $A$ pocket above the Fermi level, even for the undoped parent compound NdNiO$_2$. Finally, for an $n$-type interface, often synthesized experimentally, we find the Ti 3$d$ orbitals to become electron doped.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive framework for constructing various architectures of globally driven quantum computers, with a focus on superconducting qubits. Our approach leverages static inhomogeneities in the Rabi frequencies of qubits controlled by a common classical pulse -- a technique we refer to as the "crossed-qubit" method. We detail the essential components and design principles required to realize such systems, highlighting how global control can be harnessed to perform local operations, enabling universal quantum computation. This framework offers a scalable pathway toward quantum processors by striking a balance between wiring complexity and computational efficiency, with potential applications in addressing current challenges to scalability.</description>

      <title>Quenched disorder and the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of weak quenched disorder on the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model within a functional-integral framework. By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled framework for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.</description>

      <title>Bogoliubov quasi-particles in superconductors are integer-charged particles inapplicable for braiding quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof that under a number-conserving Hamiltonian, one-body quasi-particles generally possess quantized charge and inertial mass identical to the bare particles. It follows that, Bogoliubov zero modes in the vortex (or on the edge) of superconductors $\textit{cannot}$ be their own anti-particles capable of braiding quantum information. As such, the heavily pursued Majorana zero mode-based route for quantum computation requires a serious re-consideration. This study further reveals the conceptual challenge in preparing and manipulating braid-able quantum states via physical thermalization or slow external fields. These profound results should reignite the long-standing quest for a number-conserving theory of superconductivity and superfluidity without fictitiously breaking global U(1) symmetry.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent surface superconductivity in time-reversal symmetric Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weyl semimetals host topologically protected surface states, the so-called Fermi arcs, that have a penetration depth into the bulk that depends on surface-momentum, and diverges at the Weyl points. It has recently been observed in PtBi$_2$ that such Fermi arc states can become superconducting, with a critical temperature larger than that of the bulk. Here we introduce a general variational method that captures the interplay between surface and bulk superconductivity, for any bulk Hamiltonian that harbors (topological) surface states with varying penetration depth. From the self-consistent solutions we establish that the surface state localization length of Weyl semimetals leads to characteristic features in the surface superconductivity, with a gap depending on surface momentum and a penetration length for the order parameter that is temperature-dependent due to competition with the bulk superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Signatures of edge states in antiferromagnetic van der Waals Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of superconductivity and magnetic textures represents a promising approach to explore unconventional superconducting phenomena, including new correlated and topological phases. Van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged in this context as a versatile platform to explore the interplay between these two competing orders. Here, we report on individual NbSe2/NiPS3/NbSe2 vdW Josephson junctions behaving as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which we attribute to the interplay between the superconductivity of NbSe2 and the spin texture of the vdW antiferromagnetic insulator NiPS3. The SQUID behavior, which persists for in-plane magnetic fields of at least 6 T, is the result of interference between localized transport channels that form in two separate regions of the sample. Microscopic modeling of the antiferromagnet insulator/superconductor (AFI/S) interface reveals the formation of localized states at the edges of the junction that can lead to localized channels that dominate the transport. Our findings highlight the potential of vdW superconducting heterostructures with AFs as platforms for engineering and probing novel superconducting phenomena, and they establish a new route for lithographic-free SQUIDs that operate in high magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated intrinsic topological superconductivity in Fermi arcs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that phonons can intrinsically mediate topological superconductivity on the surface of Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are gapless topological materials with nondegenerate zero energy surface states known as Fermi arcs. We derive the phonon spectrum and electron-phonon coupling in an effective model of a Weyl semimetal and apply weak-coupling Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In a slab geometry, we find that surface superconductivity dominates over bulk superconductivity in a range of chemical potentials around the Weyl nodes. The superconducting gap function realizes spinless chiral $p$-wave Cooper pairing in the Fermi arcs, leading to Majorana bound states in the core of vortices. Furthermore, we find a suppression of the absolute value of the gap in the center of the Fermi arcs, which is not captured by a local Hubbard attraction. The suppression is due to the nonlocal origin of electron-phonon coupling, leading to a layer dependence which has important consequences for topological surface states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nonreciprocal superconductors, inversion and time-reversal symmetries are absent, which may be broken extrinsically or spontaneously. Here, we consider a simple BCS model with both attractive singlet and attractive triplet pairing channels. We show that when the triplet instability dominates, the model predicts a nonreciprocal superconducting state of the axionic subtype, in which both inversion and time-reversal symmetries are spontaneously broken by the superconductivity without requiring spin-orbit coupling. This leads to characteristic experimental signatures of spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, such as a two-step transition in the specific heat. We critically analyze whether familiar pairing mechanisms such as the electron-phonon interaction and ferromagnetic spin fluctuations could produce such an axionic state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) nickelates have emerged as a crucial platform for exploring the mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity. However, the Fermi surface topology required for superconductivity remains elusive. Here, we report the thin film growth and ambient-pressure superconductivity of both hybrid monolayer-bilayer (1212) and pure bilayer (2222) structures, together with the absence of superconductivity in hybrid monolayer-trilayer (1313) structure, under identical compressive epitaxial strain. The onset superconducting transition temperature is up to 50 K, exceeding the McMillan limit, in the 1212 structure. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy reveals key Fermi surface differences in these atomically-engineered structures. In superconducting 1212 and 2222 films, a dispersive hole-like band (i.e. the {\gamma} band) crosses the Fermi level, surrounding the Brillouin zone corner. In contrast, the top of the {\gamma} flat band is observed ~70 meV below the Fermi level in the non-superconducting 1313 films. Our findings expand the family of ambient-pressure nickelate superconductors and establish a connection between structural configuration, electronic structure, and the emergence of superconductivity in nickelates.</description>

Abstract: $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, a nickelate compound with a reported superconducting transition temperature of $\rm 80~K$, has attracted significant attention in recent years. Density-wave phenomena arising from strong electron correlations are widely regarded as key to unraveling the superconductivity mechanism, but the ordering and stability of these density waves remain a subject of contention in existing theoretical studies. In this work, we employ the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method to thoroughly examine the nature of density waves as functions of Coulomb repulsion and exchange interactions in bilayer two-orbital model proposed for the high pressure phase of $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$. We analyse the spin and charge correlation functions in a wide range of parameter space, and delineate a schematic phase diagram that separates different density-wave ground states. Our results provide useful insights into the understanding of electron correlations in $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, and highlight the potential of VMC to elucidate its superconducting mechanism.</description>
