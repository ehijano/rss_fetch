      <title>The fantastic single-molecule techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past 40 years, single-molecule techniques have been rapidly developed and widely applied in numerous fields of biology researches, offering new insights that conventional biochemical assays cannot discover. In this review, to help fully appreciate the powerfulness of single-molecule methods, we systemically summarize the various advantages of performing biochemical assays at the single-molecule level. Inspired by these examples, we propose a new single-molecule polysome profiling technique, to demonstrate that this strategy is not limited to the few special "outliers". Finally, we point out a possibility in the future of unifying different biochemical assays on the platform of single-molecule microscopy, which will reduce the cost of instrumentation and inevitably promote the applicability and adoptability of new biochemical and biophysical methods.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of blood vessel models, Part I: 3D-1D to 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a family of models describing blood perfusion through a tissue surrounding a thin blood vessel. Our goal is to rigorously establish convergence results among 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D Green's function methods commonly used to model this process. In Part I, we propose a 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille system where the coupling across the permeable vessel surface involves an angle-averaged Neumann boundary condition coupled with a geometrically constrained Robin boundary condition. We show that this model is well-posed and moreover limits to a 1D Green's function model as the maximum vessel radius $\epsilon\to 0$. In the 1D model, the exterior blood pressure is given by an explicit Green's function expression involving the interior blood pressure. The interior pressure satisfies a novel 1D integrodifferential equation in which the integral term incorporates the effects of the exterior pressure and the vessel geometry. Much of this paper is devoted to analyzing this integrodifferential equation. Using the \emph{a priori} bounds obtained here, we show that the solution to the 1D model converges to the 3D-1D solution with a rate proportional to $\epsilon^{1/2}|\log\epsilon|$. In Part II [Ohm \&amp; Strikwerda, arXiv preprint July 2025], we rely on the 1D estimates to show that both the 1D and 3D-1D models converge to a coupled 3D-3D Darcy-Stokes system as $\epsilon\to 0$, thereby establishing a convergence chain among all hierarchy levels.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of blood vessel models, Part II: 3D-3D to 3D-1D and 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a hierarchy of three models of blood perfusion through a tissue surrounding a thin arteriole or venule. Our goal is to rigorously link 3D-3D Darcy--Stokes, 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille, and 1D Green's function methods commonly used to model this process. Here in Part II, we consider the most detailed level, a 3D-3D Darcy-Stokes system coupled across the permeable vessel surface by mass conservation and pressure/stress balance conditions. We derive a convergence result between the 3D-3D model and both the 3D-1D Darcy--Poiseuille model and 1D Green's function model proposed in Part I [Ohm \&amp; Strikwerda, arXiv preprint July 2025] at a rate proportional to $\epsilon^{1/6}|\log\epsilon|$, where $\epsilon$ is the maximum vessel radius. The rate is limited by the inclusion of a degenerate endpoint where the vessel radius vanishes, i.e. becomes indistinguishable from a capillary. Key to our proof are \emph{a priori} estimates for the 1D integrodifferential model obtained in Part I.</description>

      <title>Enzyme as Maxwell's Demon: Steady-state Deviation from Chemical Equilibrium by Enhanced Enzyme Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED), in which the diffusion coefficient of an enzyme transiently increases during catalysis, has been extensively reported experimentally. We numerically and analytically demonstrate that such enzymes can act as Maxwell's demons. They use their enhanced diffusion as a memory of the previous catalytic reaction, to gain information and drive steady-state chemical concentrations away from chemical equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis identifies the conditions for this process, highlighting the functional role of EED and its relevance to cellular systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating nano- and micrometer-scale energy deposition models for mechanistic prediction of radiation-induced DNA damage and cell survival</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an integrated modeling framework that combines the Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model (GSM2), used to predict cell survival fractions, with MINAS-TIRITH, a fast and efficient Geant4 DNA-based tool for simulating radiation-induced DNA damage in cell populations. This approach enables the generation of spatially and structurally resolved double-strand break (DSB) distributions, capturing key features such as damage complexity and chromosome specificity. A novel application of the DBSCAN clustering algorithm is introduced to group DSBs at the micrometer scale. This allows the identification of physical aggregates of DNA damage and their association with subnuclear domains, providing a direct link to the cell survival probability as predicted by \gsm.
  The model was validated using experimental data from HUVEC cells irradiated with 220 kV X-rays and H460 cells exposed to protons over a wide linear energy transfer (LET) range, from approximately 4 keV/{\mu}m to over 20 keV/{\mu}m. Results show excellent agreement between simulations and experimental survival probabilities, making this one of the first consistent multi-scale models to bridge nanodosimetric and microdosimetric representations of radiation with biological outcomes such as cell survival.
  By incorporating the inherent stochastic nature of radiation-matter interactions, this framework effectively connects the physical properties of the radiation field to the biological response at the cellular level. Its accuracy across various radiation types and energies supports its potential for use in biologically optimized radiotherapy.</description>
