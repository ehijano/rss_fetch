      <title>Exploring the User Experience of AI-Assisted Sound Searching Systems for Creative Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Locating the right sound effect efficiently is an important yet challenging topic for audio production. Most current sound-searching systems rely on pre-annotated audio labels created by humans, which can be time-consuming to produce and prone to inaccuracies, limiting the efficiency of audio production. Following the recent advancement of contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) models, we explore an alternative CLAP-based sound-searching system (CLAP-UI) that does not rely on human annotations. To evaluate the effectiveness of CLAP-UI, we conducted comparative experiments with a widely used sound effect searching platform, the BBC Sound Effect Library. Our study evaluates user performance, cognitive load, and satisfaction through ecologically valid tasks based on professional sound-searching workflows. Our result shows that CLAP-UI demonstrated significantly enhanced productivity and reduced frustration while maintaining comparable cognitive demands. We also qualitatively analyzed the participants' feedback, which offered valuable perspectives on the design of future AI-assisted sound search systems.</description>

      <title>FADEL: Uncertainty-aware Fake Audio Detection with Evidential Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, fake audio detection has gained significant attention, as advancements in speech synthesis and voice conversion have increased the vulnerability of automatic speaker verification (ASV) systems to spoofing attacks. A key challenge in this task is generalizing models to detect unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) attacks. Although existing approaches have shown promising results, they inherently suffer from overconfidence issues due to the usage of softmax for classification, which can produce unreliable predictions when encountering unpredictable spoofing attempts. To deal with this limitation, we propose a novel framework called fake audio detection with evidential learning (FADEL). By modeling class probabilities with a Dirichlet distribution, FADEL incorporates model uncertainty into its predictions, thereby leading to more robust performance in OOD scenarios. Experimental results on the ASVspoof2019 Logical Access (LA) and ASVspoof2021 LA datasets indicate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance of baseline models. Furthermore, we demonstrate the validity of uncertainty estimation by analyzing a strong correlation between average uncertainty and equal error rate (EER) across different spoofing algorithms.</description>

      <title>SimulS2S-LLM: Unlocking Simultaneous Inference of Speech LLMs for Speech-to-Speech Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation (SST) outputs translations in parallel with streaming speech input, balancing translation quality and latency. While large language models (LLMs) have been extended to handle the speech modality, streaming remains challenging as speech is prepended as a prompt for the entire generation process. To unlock LLM streaming capability, this paper proposes SimulS2S-LLM, which trains speech LLMs offline and employs a test-time policy to guide simultaneous inference. SimulS2S-LLM alleviates the mismatch between training and inference by extracting boundary-aware speech prompts that allows it to be better matched with text input data. SimulS2S-LLM achieves simultaneous speech-to-speech translation (Simul-S2ST) by predicting discrete output speech tokens and then synthesising output speech using a pre-trained vocoder. An incremental beam search is designed to expand the search space of speech token prediction without increasing latency. Experiments on the CVSS speech data show that SimulS2S-LLM offers a better translation quality-latency trade-off than existing methods that use the same training data, such as improving ASR-BLEU scores by 3 points at similar latency.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Source Speaker Leakage in One-to-One Voice Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a multi-accented corpus of parallel utterances for use with commercial speech devices, we present a case study to show that it is possible to quantify a degree of confidence about a source speaker's identity in the case of one-to-one voice conversion. Following voice conversion using a HiFi-GAN vocoder, we compare information leakage for a range speaker characteristics; assuming a "worst-case" white-box scenario, we quantify our confidence to perform inference and narrow the pool of likely source speakers, reinforcing the regulatory obligation and moral duty that providers of synthetic voices have to ensure the privacy of their speakers' data.</description>

      <title>EmoVoice: LLM-based Emotional Text-To-Speech Model with Freestyle Text Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12867v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human speech goes beyond the mere transfer of information; it is a profound exchange of emotions and a connection between individuals. While Text-to-Speech (TTS) models have made huge progress, they still face challenges in controlling the emotional expression in the generated speech. In this work, we propose EmoVoice, a novel emotion-controllable TTS model that exploits large language models (LLMs) to enable fine-grained freestyle natural language emotion control, and a phoneme boost variant design that makes the model output phoneme tokens and audio tokens in parallel to enhance content consistency, inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) and chain-of-modality (CoM) techniques. Besides, we introduce EmoVoice-DB, a high-quality 40-hour English emotion dataset featuring expressive speech and fine-grained emotion labels with natural language descriptions. EmoVoice achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English EmoVoice-DB test set using only synthetic training data, and on the Chinese Secap test set using our in-house data. We further investigate the reliability of existing emotion evaluation metrics and their alignment with human perceptual preferences, and explore using SOTA multimodal LLMs GPT-4o-audio and Gemini to assess emotional speech. Demo samples are available at https://yanghaha0908.github.io/EmoVoice/. Dataset, code, and checkpoints will be released.</description>

      <title>EMelodyGen: Emotion-Conditioned Melody Generation in ABC Notation with the Musical Feature Template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The EMelodyGen system focuses on emotional melody generation in ABC notation controlled by the musical feature template. Owing to the scarcity of well-structured and emotionally labeled sheet music, we designed a template for controlling emotional melody generation by statistical correlations between musical features and emotion labels derived from small-scale emotional symbolic music datasets and music psychology conclusions. We then automatically annotated a large, well-structured sheet music collection with rough emotional labels by the template, converted them into ABC notation, and reduced label imbalance by data augmentation, resulting in a dataset named Rough4Q. Our system backbone pre-trained on Rough4Q can achieve up to 99% music21 parsing rate and melodies generated by our template can lead to a 91% alignment on emotional expressions in blind listening tests. Ablation studies further validated the effectiveness of the feature controls in the template. Available code and demos are at https://github.com/monetjoe/EMelodyGen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17615v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interpreting the decisions of deep learning models, including audio classifiers, is crucial for ensuring the transparency and trustworthiness of this technology. In this paper, we introduce LMAC-ZS (Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers in the Zero-Shot context), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first decoder-based post-hoc interpretation method for explaining the decisions of zero-shot audio classifiers. The proposed method utilizes a novel loss function that maximizes the faithfulness to the original similarity between a given text-and-audio pair. We provide an extensive evaluation using the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) model to showcase that our interpreter remains faithful to the decisions in a zero-shot classification context. Moreover, we qualitatively show that our method produces meaningful explanations that correlate well with different text prompts.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analysis for Assisted Diagnosis of Vocal Fold Paralysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the Multimodal Laryngoscopic Video Analyzing System (MLVAS), a novel system that leverages both audio and video data to automatically extract key video segments and metrics from raw laryngeal videostroboscopic videos for assisted clinical assessment. The system integrates video-based glottis detection with an audio keyword spotting method to analyze both video and audio data, identifying patient vocalizations and refining video highlights to ensure optimal inspection of vocal fold movements. Beyond key video segment extraction from the raw laryngeal videos, MLVAS is able to generate effective audio and visual features for Vocal Fold Paralysis (VFP) detection. Pre-trained audio encoders are utilized to encode the patient voice to get the audio features. Visual features are generated by measuring the angle deviation of both the left and right vocal folds to the estimated glottal midline on the segmented glottis masks. To get better masks, we introduce a diffusion-based refinement that follows traditional U-Net segmentation to reduce false positives. We conducted several ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and modalities in the proposed MLVAS. The experimental results on a public segmentation dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed segmentation module. In addition, unilateral VFP classification results on a real-world clinic dataset demonstrate MLVAS's ability of providing reliable and objective metrics as well as visualization for assisted clinical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised Self-Learning Enhanced Music Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21897v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify the emotions conveyed in a given musical piece. However, currently, in the field of MER, the available public datasets have limited sample sizes. Recently, segment-based methods for emotion-related tasks have been proposed, which train backbone networks on shorter segments instead of entire audio clips, thereby naturally augmenting training samples without requiring additional resources. Then, the predicted segment-level results are aggregated to obtain the entire song prediction. The most commonly used method is that the segment inherits the label of the clip containing it, but music emotion is not constant during the whole clip. Doing so will introduce label noise and make the training easy to overfit. To handle the noisy label issue, we propose a semi-supervised self-learning (SSSL) method, which can differentiate between samples with correct and incorrect labels in a self-learning manner, thus effectively utilizing the augmented segment-level data. Experiments on three public emotional datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve better or comparable performance.</description>

      <title>WhisperFlow: speech foundation models in real time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech foundation models, such as OpenAI's Whisper, become the state of the art in speech understanding due to their strong accuracy and generalizability. Yet, their applications are mostly limited to processing pre-recorded speech, whereas processing of streaming speech, in particular doing it efficiently, remains rudimentary. Behind this inefficiency are multiple fundamental reasons: (1) speech foundation models are trained to process long, fixed-length voice inputs (often 30 seconds); (2) encoding each voice input requires encoding as many as 1,500 tokens with tens of transformer layers; (3) decoding each output entails an irregular, complex beam search. As such, streaming speech processing on resource-constrained client devices is more expensive than other AI tasks, e.g., text generation.
  To this end, we present a novel framework, WhisperFlow, which embodies both model and system optimizations. (1) Hush word as a short, learnable audio segment; appended to a voice input, a hush word gracefully stops the speech model from processing more input without hallucination; (2) Beam pruning, which aligns streaming audio buffers over time and reuses results from earlier decoding rounds, therefore significantly accelerating decoding; and (3) CPU/GPU pipelining, which not only maps to the encoding/decoding stages dynamically, but also tunes to an optimal resource ratio, respecting the encoding/decoding speed that varies across voice inputs, models, and hardware.
  We test WhisperFlow on commodity ARM platforms with 4-12 CPU cores and 10-30 GPU cores. It reduces per-word latency by 1.6x-4.7x to as low as 0.5 second, while seeing negligible accuracy degradation. On an entry-level MacBook Air, WhisperFlow can keep the per-word latency around 1 second, with the whole device drawing only 7 Watts in total.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Whisper on Low-Resource Languages for Real-World Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model for low-resource languages by introducing a novel data generation method that converts sentence-level data into a long-form corpus, using Swiss German as a case study. Non-sentence-level data, which could improve the performance of long-form audio, is difficult to obtain and often restricted by copyright laws. Our method bridges this gap by transforming more accessible sentence-level data into a format that preserves the model's ability to handle long-form audio and perform segmentation without requiring non-sentence-level data. Our data generation process improves performance in several real-world applications and leads to the development of a new state-of-the-art speech-to-text (STT) model for Swiss German. We compare our model with a non-fine-tuned Whisper and our previous state-of-the-art Swiss German STT models, where our new model achieves higher BLEU scores. Our results also indicate that the proposed method is adaptable to other low-resource languages, supported by written guidance and code that allows the creation of fine-tuned Whisper models, which keep segmentation capabilities and allow the transcription of longer audio files using only sentence-level data with high quality.</description>

      <title>Audio signal interpolation using optimal transportation of spectrograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating an artificial audio signal that interpolates between given source and target sounds. Our approach relies on the computation of Wasserstein barycenters of the source and target spectrograms, followed by phase reconstruction and inversion. In contrast with previous works, our new method considers the spectrograms globally and does not operate on a temporal frame-to-frame basis. Another contribution is to endow the transportation cost matrix with a specific structure that prohibits remote displacements of energy along the time axis, and for which optimal transport is made possible by leveraging the unbalanced transport framework. The proposed cost matrix makes sense from the audio perspective and also allows to reduce the computation load. Results with synthetic musical notes and real environmental sounds illustrate the potential of our novel approach.</description>

      <title>F5R-TTS: Improving Flow-Matching based Text-to-Speech with Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present F5R-TTS, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system that integrates Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into a flow-matching based architecture. By reformulating the deterministic outputs of flow-matching TTS into probabilistic Gaussian distributions, our approach enables seamless integration of reinforcement learning algorithms. During pretraining, we train a probabilistically reformulated flow-matching based model which is derived from F5-TTS with an open-source dataset. In the subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) phase, we employ a GRPO-driven enhancement stage that leverages dual reward metrics: word error rate (WER) computed via automatic speech recognition and speaker similarity (SIM) assessed by verification models. Experimental results on zero-shot voice cloning demonstrate that F5R-TTS achieves significant improvements in both speech intelligibility (a 29.5% relative reduction in WER) and speaker similarity (a 4.6% relative increase in SIM score) compared to conventional flow-matching based TTS systems. Audio samples are available at https://frontierlabs.github.io/F5R.</description>

      <title>VocalNet: Speech LLM with Multi-Token Prediction for Faster and High-Quality Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a prominent research focus in speech processing. We introduce VocalNet-1B and VocalNet-8B, a series of high-performance, low-latency speech LLMs enabled by a scalable and model-agnostic training framework designed for real-time voice interaction. Central to our contribution is the first application of multi-token prediction (MTP) to speech LLMs. This approach represents a paradigm shift from standard next-token prediction (NTP), offering simultaneous improvements in generation speed and quality. Informed by analysis of MTP's effect on speech generation and experimental comparisons, we designed a straightforward and highly effective MTP implementation. Experiments demonstrate that VocalNet performs on par with mainstream Omni LLMs even with limited training data, and significantly surpasses existing open-source speech LLMs. To foster reproducibility and community advancement, all model weights, inference code, training data, and framework implementations have been made publicly available at https://github.com/SJTU-OmniAgent/VocalNet</description>

Abstract: Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) combines the Sound Event Detection (SED) with the corresponding Direction Of Arrival (DOA). Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</description>
