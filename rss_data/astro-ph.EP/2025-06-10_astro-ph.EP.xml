      <title>Maximizing Ariel's Survey Leverage for Population-Level Studies of Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ESA's Ariel mission will be uniquely suited to performing population-level studies of exoplanets. Most of these studies consist of quantifying trends between an Ariel-measured quantity, y, and an a priori planetary property, x; for example, atmospheric metallicity as inferred from Ariel transit spectroscopy vs. planetary radius. We define the leverage of a survey with N targets as L = sqrt(N)stdev(x) and show that it quantitatively predicts the precision of population-level trends. The target selection challenge of Ariel can therefore be summarized as maximizing L along some axes of diversity for a given cumulative observing time. To this end, we consider different schemes to select the mission reference sample for a notional three year transit spectroscopy survey with Ariel. We divide the exoplanets in the mission candidate sample into logarithmic classes based on radius, equilibrium temperature, and host star temperature. We then construct a target list by cyclically choosing the easiest remaining target in each class. We find that in many cases the leverage is greatest for a single class: dividing planets into multiple classes increases the diversity of targets, but reduces their numbers. The leverage on a single axis of diversity can be increased by dividing that axis into many planet classes, but this sacrifices leverage along other axes of diversity. We conclude that a modest number of classes, possibly only one, should be defined when selecting Ariel targets. Lastly, we note that the statistical leverage of the Ariel transit survey would be significantly increased if current candidate planets were confirmed. This highlights the urgency of vetting and confirming the easiest transmission and emission spectroscopy targets in the Ariel mission candidate sample.</description>

      <title>Grand Design Spiral Arms in the Compact, Embedded Protoplanetary Disk of Haro 6-13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter continuum spiral arms have so far only been detected in a handful of protoplanetary disks, and thus we have a limited understanding of the circumstances in which they can form. In particular, substructures in small disks ($R\lessapprox 50$ au) have not been well-characterized in comparison with large disks. We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of the disk around the T Tauri star Haro 6-13 at a resolution of $\sim0.04''$ ($\sim5$ au). A pair of low-contrast spiral arms are detected at disk radii from $\sim10-35$ au. They can be approximated as Archimedean spirals with pitch angles ranging from $\sim10-30^\circ$. The low value of the disk-averaged spectral index between 1.3 and 3 mm ($\alpha=2.1$) and the high brightness temperatures suggest that the millimeter continuum is likely optically thick and thus may hide sufficient mass for the disk to become gravitationally unstable and form spiral arms. CO observations have shown that Haro 6-13 is surrounded by an envelope, raising the possibility that infall is facilitating spiral arm formation.</description>

      <title>Multi-band, Multi-epoch Photometry of the Spot-crossing System TOI-3884: Refined System Geometry and Spot Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spot-crossing transits offer a unique opportunity to probe spot properties such as temperature, size, and surface distribution. TOI-3884 is a rare system in which spot-crossing features are persistently observed during every transit. This is due to its unusual configuration: a polar-orbiting super-Neptune transits a pole-on mid-M dwarf, repeatedly crossing a polar spot. However, previous studies have reported discrepant values in key system parameters, such as stellar inclination and obliquity. To address this, we conducted multi-band, multi-epoch transit observations of TOI-3884b using the MuSCAT instrument series, along with photometric monitoring with the LCO 1m telescopes/Sinistro. We detected time-dependent variations in the spot-crossing signals, indicating that the spot is not exactly on the pole. From the monitoring data, we measured a stellar rotation period of $11.043_{-0.053}^{+0.054}$ days with a modulation amplitude of $\sim$5% in the r-band, consistent with the time variability in the spot-crossing features. Our analysis reconciles previous discrepancies and improves the constraints on the parameters of the system geometry ($i_\star = 40.1^{+2.0}_{-1.2}$ deg and $\lambda =139.0^{+9.0}_{-3.7}$ deg) and those of the spot properties (spot radius of $0.425_{-0.011}^{+0.018} R_\star$ and spot-photosphere temperature difference of $200_{-9}^{+11}$ K). These results provide a critical context for interpreting upcoming transmission spectroscopy of TOI-3884b, as well as yielding new insights into the magnetic activity and spin-orbit geometry of M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Quaoar's rings and atmosphere from JWST/NIRCam observations of a stellar occultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of stellar occultations have revealed that small bodies are capable of hosting ring systems. The trans-Neptunian object (TNO) Quaoar, is the host of an enigmatic ring system, with two rings located well-outside the Roche limit. To better understand these structures, we observed a stellar occultation by Quaoar and its rings using the James Webb Space Telescope's (JWST) NIRCam instrument. Our observations detect both known rings, although Q2R -- the inner known ring -- is not detected on both sides of Quaoar, showing that it has substantial azimuthal variations similar to Q1R -- the outer ring. We also fit a model of the ring radii and pole orientation of the ring system, which confirms that Quaoar's spin-orbit and Weywot's mean motion resonances (especially Weywot's 6:1) may play a role in the rings' confinement and stability. In addition to examination of Quaoar's ring system, we also use our observations to place upper limits on a putative CH$_4$ atmosphere around Quaoar, finding that no global atmosphere with surface pressure $&gt;1$ nbar can exist (at 3$\sigma$ significance). The lack of atmosphere supports the hypothesis that atmospheric processes are not the source of Quaoar's recently discovered inventory of light hydrocarbons.</description>

      <title>A circularly polarized low-frequency radio burst from the exoplanetary system HD 189733</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to detect low-frequency radio emission from exoplanetary systems, which can provide insights into planetary magnetic fields, star-planet interactions, stellar activity, and exo-space weather. The HD 189733 system, hosting a well-studied hot Jupiter, is a prime target for such searches. We conducted NenuFAR imaging observations in the 15-62 MHz range, in order to cover the entire orbital phase of HD 189733 b. Dynamic spectra were generated for the target and other sources in the field, followed by a transient search in the time-frequency plane. The data processing pipeline incorporated direction-dependent calibration and noise characterization to improve sensitivity. We also searched for periodic signals using Lomb-Scargle analysis. A highly circularly polarized radio burst was detected at 50 MHz with a flux density of 1.5 Jy and a significance of 6 sigma at the position of HD 189733. No counterpart was found in Stokes I, likely because the emission is embedded in confusion noise and remains below the detection threshold. The estimated minimum fractional circular polarization of 38% suggests a coherent emission process. A periodicity search revealed no weaker signals linked to the planet's orbital period, the star's rotational period, or the synodic period and harmonic period between them. The burst's properties are consistent with cyclotron maser instability (CMI) emission, but the origin is still ambiguous. The comparison with theoretical models suggests star-planet interaction or stellar activity as potential origins. However, alternative explanations such as contamination from other sources along the line of sight (e.g. the companion M dwarf) or noise fluctuation cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>A transiting giant planet in orbit around a 0.2-solar-mass host star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07931v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet formation models suggest that the formation of giant planets is significantly harder around low-mass stars, due to the scaling of protoplanetary disc masses with stellar mass. The discovery of giant planets orbiting such low-mass stars thus imposes strong constraints on giant planet formation processes. Here, we report the discovery of a transiting giant planet orbiting a $0.207 \pm 0.011 M_{\odot}$ star. The planet, TOI-6894 b, has a mass and radius of $M_P = 0.168 \pm 0.022 M_J (53.4 \pm 7.1 M_{\oplus})$ and $R_P = 0.855 \pm 0.022 R_J$, and likely includes $12 \pm 2 M_{\oplus}$ of metals. The discovery of TOI-6894 b highlights the need for a better understanding of giant planet formation mechanisms and the protoplanetary disc environments in which they occur. The extremely deep transits (17% depth) make TOI-6894 b one of the most accessible exoplanetary giants for atmospheric characterisation observations, which will be key for fully interpreting the formation history of this remarkable system and for the study of atmospheric methane chemistry.</description>

      <title>Why M-dwarf flares have limited impact on sub-Neptunes' atmospheric evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M-type stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches within their habitable zones (HZs). M-type stars also exhibit significant magnetic flaring activity, especially during the first billion years, which can potentially accelerate the evaporation of the hydrogen-helium envelopes of close-in planets. We use the time-dependent photo-ionization hydrodynamics code ATES to investigate the impact of flares on atmospheric escape, focusing on a sub-Neptune-sized planet orbiting an early M-type star at distances of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.18-0.36 AU--the inner and outer edges of the HZ. Stellar flaring is modeled as a 1 Gyr-long high-activity phase followed by a 4 Gyr-long low-activity phase, each characterized by a suitable flare frequency distribution. We find that flares have a modest impact (i.e., less than a factor of two) on increasing the cumulative atmospheric mass loss, with the greatest enhancement occurring when the planet is at its closest separation. However, the relative enhancement in mass loss between flaring and non-flaring cases is greater at larger separations. This trend arises because, as stellar irradiation fluctuates between quiescent levels and peak flares, the proportion of time the planet spends in energy-limited versus recombination-limited mass loss regimes depends on its orbital separation. Additionally, we demonstrate the existence of a characteristic flare energy, intermediate between the minimum and maximum values, that maximizes the fractional contribution to flare-driven mass loss. Our results indicate that the flaring activity of M-dwarfs does not significantly affect the atmospheric retention of close-in Neptune-sized planets, including within the HZ. The potential occurrence of rare super-flares, which observational campaigns might be biased against, does not alter our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Additive Manufacturing of Lunar Regolith for Reconfigurable Building Blocks toward Lunar Habitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing locally available materials is a crucial step towards sustainable planetary habitation. Lunar regolith has gained tremendous interest in additive manufacturing in the past decades. However, due to the constrained manufacturing facilities and materials on the moon, many existing additive manufacturing methods are not suitable for practical on-site manufacturing. Here, we envision that light-based direct sintering of lunar regolith can be a feasible approach. Instead of directly manufacturing large structures, we hypothesize that small-scale, reconfigurable building blocks can be an alternative to form large and complex structures. To verify the feasibility, we conducted laser sintering of lunar regolith simulants as a proof of concept, following a simple theoretical calculation for direct sintering using the light available in space. Different laser processing parameters are investigated to obtain controllable lunar regolith sintering. We further designed Lego-like interlocking bricks that are reconfigurable for different structure assemblies without additional material. Mechanical performance (compressive strength) of sintered cubic blocks is evaluated, showing a peak stress of ~1.5 MPa. We hope this work will inspire other in-space manufacturing techniques and enable low-cost space habitation.</description>

      <title>FAUST XXVI. The dust opacity spectral indices of protostellar envelopes bridge the gap between interstellar medium and disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sub-millimetre dust opacity spectral index is a critical observable to constrain dust properties, such as the maximum grain size of an observed dust population. It has been widely measured at galactic scales and down to protoplanetary disks. However, because of observational and analytical challenges, quite a gap exists in measuring dust properties in the envelopes that feed newborn protostars and their disks. To fill this gap, we use sensitive dust continuum emission data at 1.2 and 3.1 mm from the ALMA FAUST Large Program and constrain the dust opacity millimetre spectral index around a sample of protostars. Our high-resolution data, along with a more refined methodology with respect to past efforts, allow us to disentangle disk and envelope contributions in the uv-plane, and thus measure spectral indices for the envelopes uncontaminated by the optically thick emission of the inner regions. First, we find that the young disks are small and optically thick. Secondly, we measure the dust opacity spectral index at envelope scales for n=11 sources: the beta of n=9 sources had never been constrained in the literature. We effectively double the number of sources for which the dust opacity spectral index beta has been measured at these scales. Third, combining the available literature measurements with our own (total n=18), we show how envelope spectral indices distribute between ISM-like and disk-like values, bridging the gap in the inferred dust evolution. Finally, we statistically confirm a significant correlation between beta and the mass of protostellar envelopes, previously suggested in the literature. Our findings indicate that the dust optical properties smoothly vary from the ISM, through envelopes and all the way down to disks. Multi-wavelength surveys are needed to further this study and make more general claims on dust evolution in its pathway from cloud to disks.</description>

      <title>Circumbinary disc interactions and stochastic dust obscuration in the post-asymptotic-giant-branch binary HD 213985</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HD 213985 is an eccentric binary system with a post-AGB primary and a jet-launching secondary star. We confirm that the system photometric variability is likely due to obscuration by the inner edge of a circumbinary disc, similar to RVb-type RV Tau stars. The system has shown an increase in the orbital variability amplitude in optical photometric bands, along with irregular changes in its shape that often started to appear skewed. Variability in the Na D lines suggests that this behaviour may be driven by interactions between the circumbinary disc and outflows through the L2 Lagrange point. Moreover, HD 213985 has exhibited episodes of short-term fluctuations whose appearance is not strictly related to the orbital phase. This variability is consistent with obscuration by transient dust structure leading to weather-like variability patterns.</description>

      <title>Limb-Darkening Coefficients for the 4-Term and Power-2 Laws for the JWST Space Mission, Adopting PHOENIX Spherical Models at High Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling observations of transiting exoplanets or close binary systems by comparing the observations with theoretical light curves requires precise knowledge of the distribution of specific intensities across the stellar disk. We aim to facilitate this type of research by providing extensive tabulations of limb-darkening coefficients for 11 frequently used near- and mid-infrared passbands on the NIRCam, NIRISS, and NIRSpec instruments installed on board the James Webb Space Telescope. The calculation of the limb-darkening coefficients was based on spherically symmetric atmosphere models from the PHOENIX series, with high spectral resolution (approximately $10^{6}$ wavelengths), and covering the wavelength range $0.1-6.0~\mu$m. The models were computed for solar composition, and a microturbulent velocity of 1.0 km s$^{-1}$. We adopted two of the more accurate parametrizations for the coefficients: the 4-term law, and the power-2 law. We applied the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares minimization method, with a strategy to determine the critical value $\mu_{\rm crit}$ of the cosine of the viewing angle near the limb that is designed to improve numerical accuracy. The limb-darkening coefficients were derived based on a total of 306 atmosphere models covering an effective temperature range of $2400-7800$ K, and a $\log g$ interval between 3.0 and 5.5. We discuss the quality of the fits to the specific intensities provided by the power-2 and 4-term laws, as well as by the often used quadratic law. Based on a comparison, we recommend the use of the 4-term or power-2 laws, in that order of preference.</description>

      <title>A Resonant Beginning for the Solar System Terrestrial Planets</title>

Abstract: In the past two decades, transit surveys have revealed a class of planets with thick atmospheres -- sub-Neptunes -- that must have completed their accretion in protoplanet disks. When planets form in the gaseous disk, the gravitational interaction with the disk gas drives their migration and results in the trapping of neighboring planets in mean motion resonances, though these resonances can later be broken when the damping effects of disk gas or planetesimals wane. It is widely accepted that the outer Solar System gas giant planets originally formed in a resonant chain, which was later disrupted by dynamical instabilities. Here, we explore whether the early formation of the terrestrial planets in a resonance chain (including Theia) can evolve to the present configuration. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the giant planet instability would also have destabilized the terrestrial resonance chain, triggering moon-forming giant impacts in 20--50\% of our simulated systems, dependent on the initial resonance architecture. After the instability, the eccentricity and inclination of the simulated planets match their present-day values. Under the proposed scenario, the current period ratio of 3.05 between Mars and Venus -- devoid of any special significance in traditional late formation models -- naturally arises as a relic of the former resonance chain.</description>

      <title>Benchmark brown dwarfs -- I. A blue M2 + T5 wide binary and a probable young [M4 + M4] + [T7 + T8] hierarchical quadruple</title>

Abstract: Benchmark brown dwarfs in wide binary systems are crucial for characterizing substellar objects and calibrating atmospheric and evolutionary models. However, brown dwarf benchmarks with subsolar metallicity, very cool temperatures, or suitability for dynamical mass measurements are rare, limiting our understanding across the full range of mass, age, and metallicity. We present the discovery of two new multiple systems containing T dwarf companions, identified through a targeted search using CatWISE2020 and Gaia catalogues. L 122-88 AB is a wide binary comprising a mildly metal-poor M2 dwarf and a T5 dwarf, separated by 215.6 arcsec at a distance of 33.106+/-0.014 pc. Atmospheric model fitting to the near infrared spectrum of L 122-88 A suggests a mildly metal-poor composition ([Fe/H] = -0.2). UPM J1040-3551 AB is a candidate hierarchical quadruple system at 25.283+/-0.013 pc, consisting of a likely astrometric binary of two M4 dwarfs and a probable unresolved spectral binary of T7 and T8 dwarfs, separated by 65.48 arcsec from the primary. The H-alpha emission detected in UPM J1040-3551 A indicates an age range of 0.3-2.0 Gyr. This age estimate suggests that the T8 component has a mass between 9 and 28 Jupiter masses, potentially classifying it as a planetary-mass object. These systems augment the sample of benchmark brown dwarfs, particularly in the underexplored regime of cool temperature, providing valuable opportunities for refining our understanding of substellar objects.</description>
