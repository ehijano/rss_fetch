      <title>In Praise of Slowness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While speed is an ubiquitous concept in physics, its inverse - known as slowness - sometimes proves more relevant. We discuss some case studies within classical physics where such a notion is fruitful, before exploring how it can be realized within the relativistic and thermodynamical frameworks. This leads us to a generalized slowness, not specifically defined in relation with speed but as characterizing the evolution of any physical parameter. We advocate the pedagogical relevance of slowness, by analogy with other couples of quantities, inverse of each other, commonly used in physics.</description>

      <title>IPPOG: a global network for particle physics outreach and education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG), a global network dedi- cated to connecting students, educators, and the general public with the world of particle physics. In this paper, we outline the need to bridge the existing gap between the particle physics community and the wider audience, and we present the solutions that IPPOG has implemented to overcome it through three pillar Activities: the International Masterclasses and the Global Cosmics hands-on activities network, which have engaged together over 200 000 high-school students to date, and the curation of an Outreach Resource Database and web portal.</description>

      <title>Solving Linear Systems of Equations with the Quantum HHL Algorithm: A Tutorial on the Physical and Mathematical Foundations for Undergraduate Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing enables the efficient resolution of complex problems, often outperforming classical methods across various applications. In 2009, Harrow, Hassidim and Lloyd proposed an algorithm for solving linear systems of equations, demonstrating exponential speedup (under ideal conditions) with a complexity of $poly(\log N)$, in contrast to classical approaches, which in the general case exhibit a complexity of $O(N^3)$, although they can achieve $O(N)$ in specific cases involving sparse matrices. This algorithm holds promise for advancements in machine learning, the solution of differential equations, linear regression, and cryptographic analysis. However, its structure is intricate, and there is a notable lack of detailed instructional materials in the literature. In this context, this paper presents a tutorial addressing the physical and mathematical foundations of the HHL algorithm, aimed at undergraduate students, explaining its theoretical construction and its implementation for solving linear equation systems. After discussing the underlying mathematical and physical concepts, we present numerical examples that illustrate the evolution of the quantum circuit. Finally, the algorithm's complexity, limitations, and future prospects are analyzed. The examples are compared with their classical simulations, allowing for an operational assessment of the algorithm's performance.</description>

      <title>High stakes exams inflate a gender gap and contribute to systematic grading errors in one introductory physics series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous research has suggested that changing the percentage of the course grade associated with exam grades in STEM courses can change the gender gap in the course. It has also been shown that assessments with the highest stakes have the lowest (relative) scores for female students. Previous research by the authors has shown that the implementation of retake exams can eliminate the gender gap in introductory physics courses. This paper explores several different hypotheses for why retake exams are associated with a zeroed gender gap. Two independent measurements comparing exams with different stakes are used in support of the argument that the entire gender gap on introductory physics exams may be due to the stakes associated with those exams. In other words, these data support the idea that a gender grade gap on exams is not measuring a gender difference in the physics knowledge or physics ability of these students. Implications suggest that instructors should choose lower stakes assessment options if they are interested in exam measurements that are not influenced by differences in students' performance related to exam stakes.</description>
