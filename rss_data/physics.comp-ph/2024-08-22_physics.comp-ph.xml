      <title>Structure and dynamics of the magnetite(001)/water interface from molecular dynamics simulations based on a neural network potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetite/water interface is commonly found in nature and plays a crucial role in various technological applications. However, our understanding of its structural and dynamical properties at the molecular scale remains still limited. In this study, we develop an efficient Behler-Parrinello neural network potential (NNP) for the magnetite/water system, paying particular attention to the accurate generation of reference data with density functional theory. Using this NNP, we performed extensive molecular dynamics simulations of the magnetite (001) surface across a wide range of water coverages, from the single molecule to bulk water. Our simulations revealed several new ground states of low coverage water on the Subsurface Cation Vacancy (SCV) model and yielded a density profile of water at the surface that exhibits marked layering. By calculating mean square displacements, we obtained quantitative information on the diffusion of water molecules on the SCV for different coverages, revealing significant anisotropy. Additionally, our simulations provided qualitative insights into the dissociation mechanisms of water molecules at the surface.</description>

      <title>Kinetic scrape off layer simulations with semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin solver for the simulation of the scrape off layer for an electron-ion plasma. We use a time adaptive velocity space to deal with fast particles leaving the computational domain, a block structured mesh to resolve the sharp gradient in the plasma sheath, and limiters to avoid oscillations in the density function. In particular, we propose a limiter that can be computed directly from the information used in the semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin advection step. This limiter is particularly efficient on graphic processing units (GPUs) and compares favorable with limiters from the literature. We provide numerical results for a set of benchmark problems and compare different limiting strategies.</description>

      <title>Perturbing scattering resonances in non-Hermitian systems: a generalized Wigner-Smith operator formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonances of open non-Hermitian systems are associated with the poles of the system scattering matrix. Perturbations of the system cause these poles to shift in the complex frequency plane. In this work, we introduce a novel method for calculating shifts in scattering matrix poles using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We link our method to traditional cavity perturbation theory and validate its effectiveness through application to complex photonic networks. Our findings underscore the versatility of generalized Wigner-Smith operators for analyzing a broad spectrum of resonant systems and provides new insight into resonant properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Dissecting mode-coupling theory for supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mode-coupling theory (MCT) of the glass transition ranks among the most successful first-principles kinetic theories to describe glassy dynamics. However, MCT does not fully account for crucial aspects of the dynamics near the glass transition. To facilitate improving the theory, we critically test the approximations inherent in MCT for a supercooled mixture using Brownian dynamics simulations. Although each MCT approximation significantly impacts the predicted dynamics, our findings show that long-time cancellations of errors occur due to static and dynamic approximations of four-point correlation functions, with the validity of these approximations remaining relatively constant across different temperatures. Notably, the MCT form of the memory functional maintains remarkably high accuracy even in the supercooled regime when evaluated with the intermediate scattering function from simulations. The primary discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results arise from the self-consistent nature of the MCT equations, which amplify minor errors in the memory kernel. This suggests that minor corrections to the memory functional could substantially enhance the theory's predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Systematic study of confinement induced effects on atomic electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that although a litany of studies have been published on atoms in hard-wall confinement, they have either not been systematic, having only looked at select atoms and/or select electronic configurations, or they have not used robust numerical methods. To remedy the situation, we perform in this work a methodical study of atoms in hard-wall confinement with the HelFEM program, which employs the finite element method (FEM) that trivially implements the hard-wall potential, guarantees variational results, and allows easily finding the numerically exact solution.
  We systematically examine low lying configurations of the H-Xe atoms and their monocations, and investigate how the states - especially the ground state - behave as a function of the position of the hard-wall boundary. Our fully numerical calculations are based on non-relativistic density functional theory (DFT), employing the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange-correlation functional and spherically averaged densities. We consider calculations with both spin-polarized as well as spin-restricted densities, and demonstrate that spin-polarization effects are significant in open shell configurations, even though some previous studies have only considered the spin-restricted model.
  We demonstrate the importance of considering ground state changes for confined atoms by computing the ionization radii for the H-Xe atoms and observe significant differences to earlier studies. Confirming previous observations, we identify electron shifts on the outermost shells for a majority of the elements: valence $s$ electrons are highly unfavored under strong confinement, and the high-lying $3d$ and $4f$ orbitals become occupied in atoms of periods 2-3 and 4, respectively.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of autoresonant ions oscillations in an anharmonic electrostatic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the results of modelling the ion dynamics in the ART-MS (Autoresonant Trap Mass Spectrometry) device in the quasi-static approximation. This instrument utilizes an anharmonic, purely electrostatic trap for ion confinement and a radio frequency (RF) voltage source with decrementally varying frequency for selective ion extraction. The autoresonant interaction between the oscillatory motion of the ion and the RF voltage causes an increase in the amplitude of certain confined ions, allowing their selective extraction. Numerical modelling shows that the extraction of ions with a given mass occurs not only at the fundamental frequency but also at its harmonics. This effect reduces the selective properties of devices of this type because along with the main mass component for a given frequency, it is possible to enter the detector channel of ions with another mass, for which this frequency corresponds to the second or higher harmonics, even a superposition of some of these harmonics of different ions.</description>

      <title>Ab initio uncertainty quantification in scattering analysis of microscopy</title>

Abstract: Estimating parameters from data is a fundamental problem in physics, customarily done by minimizing a loss function between a model and observed statistics. In scattering-based analysis, researchers often employ their domain expertise to select a specific range of wavevectors for analysis, a choice that can vary depending on the specific case. We introduce another paradigm that defines a probabilistic generative model from the beginning of data processing and propagates the uncertainty for parameter estimation, termed ab initio uncertainty quantification (AIUQ). As an illustrative example, we demonstrate this approach with differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) that extracts dynamical information through Fourier analysis at a selected range of wavevectors. We first show that DDM is equivalent to fitting a temporal variogram in the reciprocal space using a latent factor model as the generative model. Then we derive the maximum marginal likelihood estimator, which optimally weighs information at all wavevectors, therefore eliminating the need to select the range of wavevectors. Furthermore, we substantially reduce the computational cost by utilizing the generalized Schur algorithm for Toeplitz covariances without approximation. Simulated studies validate that AIUQ significantly improves estimation accuracy and enables model selection with automated analysis. The utility of AIUQ is also demonstrated by three distinct sets of experiments: first in an isotropic Newtonian fluid, pushing limits of optically dense systems compared to multiple particle tracking; next in a system undergoing a sol-gel transition, automating the determination of gelling points and critical exponent; and lastly, in discerning anisotropic diffusive behavior of colloids in a liquid crystal. These outcomes collectively underscore AIUQ's versatility to capture system dynamics in an efficient and automated manner.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Physics-informed neural networks for multiscale heat conduction via phonon Boltzmann transport equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) is widely used for describing multiscale heat conduction (from nm to $\mu$m or mm) in solid materials. Developing numerical approaches to solve this equation is challenging since it is a 7-dimensional integral-differential equation. In this work, we propose Monte Carlo physics-informed neural networks (MC-PINNs), which do not suffer from the "curse of dimensionality", to solve the phonon BTE to model the multiscale heat conduction in solid materials. MC-PINNs use a deep neural network to approximate the solution to the BTE, and encode the BTE as well as the corresponding boundary/initial conditions using the automatic differentiation. In addition, we propose a novel two-step sampling approach to address inefficiency and inaccuracy issues in the widely used sampling methods in PINNs. In particular, we first randomly sample a certain number of points in the temporal-spatial space (Step I), and then draw another number of points randomly in the solid angular space (Step II). The training points are constructed using the tensor product of the data drawn from the above two steps. The two-step sampling strategy enables MC-PINNs (1) to model the heat conduction from ballistic to diffusive regimes, and (2) is more memory-efficient compared to conventional numerical solvers or existing PINNs for BTE. A series of numerical examples including quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) steady/unsteady heat conduction in a film, and the heat conduction in a quasi-two- and three-dimensional square domain, are conducted to justify the effectiveness of the MC-PINN for heat conduction spanning diffusive and ballistic regimes. Finally, we compare the computational time and memory usage of the MC-PINN and a state-of-art numerical methods to demonstrate the potential of the MC-PINN for large scale problems in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A priori analysis of a tensor ROM for parameter dependent parabolic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A space-time-parameters structure of parametric parabolic PDEs motivates the application of tensor methods to define reduced order models (ROMs). Within a tensor-based ROM framework, the matrix SVD - a traditional dimension reduction technique - yields to a low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD). Such tensor extension of the Galerkin proper orthogonal decomposition ROMs (POD-ROMs) benefits both the practical efficiency of the ROM and its amenability for rigorous error analysis when applied to parametric PDEs. The paper addresses the error analysis of the Galerkin LRTD-ROM for an abstract linear parabolic problem that depends on multiple physical parameters. An error estimate for the LRTD-ROM solution is proved, which is uniform with respect to problem parameters and extends to parameter values not in a sampling/training set. The estimate is given in terms of discretization and sampling mesh properties, and LRTD accuracy. The estimate depends on the local smoothness rather than on the Kolmogorov n-widths of the parameterized manifold of solutions. Theoretical results are illustrated with several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-particle theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widely used thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is generalized to include the effect of electron correlation while maintaining its quasi-independent-particle framework. An electron-correlated internal energy (or grand potential) is postulated in consultation with the second-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which then dictates the corresponding thermal orbital (quasi-particle) energies in such a way that all fundamental thermodynamic relations are obeyed. The associated density matrix is of a one-electron type, whose diagonal elements take the form of the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions, when the grand potential is minimized. The formulas for the entropy and chemical potential are unchanged from those of Fermi-Dirac or thermal HF theory. The theory thus constitutes a finite-temperature extension of the second-order Dyson self-energy of one-particle many-body Green's function theory and can be viewed as a second-order, diagonal, frequency-independent, thermal inverse Dyson equation. At low temperature, the theory approaches finite-temperature MBPT of the same order, but it may outperform the latter at intermediate temperature by including additional electron-correlation effects through orbital energies. A physical meaning of these thermal orbital energies is proposed (encompassing that of thermal HF orbital energies, which has been elusive) as a finite-temperature version of Janak's theorem.</description>
