      <title>Semantics-Aware Status Updates with Energy Harvesting Devices: Query Version Age of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the freshness and significance of information in an IoT status update system where an Energy Harvesting (EH) device samples an information source and forwards the update packets to a destination node through a direct channel. We introduce and optimize a semantics-aware metric, Query Version Age of Information (QVAoI), in the system along with other semantic metrics: Query Age of Information (QAoI), Version Age of Information (VAoI), and Age of Information (AoI). By employing the MDP framework, we formulate the optimization problem and determine the optimal transmission policies at the device, which involve deciding the time slots for updating, subject to the energy limitations imposed by the device's battery and energy arrivals. Through analytical and numerical results, we compare the performance of the semantics-aware QVAoI-Optimal, QAoI-Optimal, VoI-Optimal, and AoI-Optimal policies with a baseline greedy policy. All semantics-aware policies show significantly improved performance compared to the greedy policy. The QVAoI-Optimal policy, in particular, demonstrates a significant performance improvement by either providing fresher, more relevant, and valuable updates with the same amount of energy arrivals or reducing the number of transmissions in the system to maintain the same level of freshness and significance of information compared to the QAoI-Optimal and other policies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Threshold AoII-Optimum Sampling Policies for CTMC Information Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study push-based sampling and transmission policies for a status update system consisting of a general finite-state continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) information source with known dynamics, with the goal of minimizing the average age of incorrect information (AoII). The problem setting we investigate involves an exponentially distributed delay channel for transmissions and a constraint on the average sampling rate. We first show that the optimum sampling and transmission policy is a 'multi-threshold policy', where the thresholds depend on both the estimation value and the state of the original process, and sampling and transmission need to be initiated when the instantaneous AoII exceeds the corresponding threshold, called the estimation- and state-aware transmission (ESAT) policy. Subsequently, we formulate the problem of finding the thresholds as a constrained semi-Markov decision process (CSMDP) and the Lagrangian approach. Additionally, we propose two lower complexity sub-optimum policies, namely the estimation-aware transmission (EAT) policy, and the single-threshold (ST) policy, for which it is possible to obtain these thresholds for CTMCs with relatively larger number of states. The underlying CSMDP formulation relies on the 'multi-regime phase-type' (MRPH) distribution which is a generalization of the well-known phase-type distribution, which allows us to obtain the distribution of time until absorption in a CTMC whose transition rates change with respect to time in a piece-wise manner. The effectiveness of the proposed ESAT, EAT and ST sampling and transmission policies are shown through numerical examples, along with comparisons with a baseline scheme that transmits packets according to a Poisson process in out-of-sync periods.</description>

      <title>Multi-Group Proportional Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image search and retrieval tasks can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, erase cultural identities, and amplify social disparities. Current approaches to mitigate these representational harms balance the number of retrieved items across population groups defined by a small number of (often binary) attributes. However, most existing methods overlook intersectional groups determined by combinations of group attributes, such as gender, race, and ethnicity. We introduce Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR), a novel metric that measures representation across intersectional groups. We develop practical methods for estimating MPR, provide theoretical guarantees, and propose optimization algorithms to ensure MPR in retrieval. We demonstrate that existing methods optimizing for equal and proportional representation metrics may fail to promote MPR. Crucially, our work shows that optimizing MPR yields more proportional representation across multiple intersectional groups specified by a rich function class, often with minimal compromise in retrieval accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Markov-Chain Polytope with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of finding a minimum-cost $m$-state Markov chain $(S_0,\ldots,S_{m-1})$ in a large set of chains. The chains studied have a reward associated with each state. The cost of a chain is its "gain", i.e., its average reward under its stationary distribution.
  Specifically, for each $k=0,\ldots,m-1$ there is a known set ${\mathbb S}_k$ of type-$k$ states. A permissible Markov chain contains exactly one state of each type; the problem is to find a minimum-cost permissible chain.
  The original motivation was to find a cheapest binary AIFV-$m$ lossless code on a source alphabet of size $n$. Such a code is an $m$-tuple of trees, in which each tree can be viewed as a Markov Chain state. This formulation was then used to address other problems in lossless compression. The known solution techniques for finding minimum-cost Markov chains were iterative and ran in exponential time.
  This paper shows how to map every possible type-$k$ state into a type-$k$ hyperplane and then define a "Markov Chain Polytope" as the lower envelope of all such hyperplanes. Finding a minimum-cost Markov chain can then be shown to be equivalent to finding a "highest" point on this polytope.
  The local optimization procedures used in the previous iterative algorithms are shown to be separation oracles for this polytope. Since these were often polynomial time, an application of the Ellipsoid method immediately leads to polynomial time algorithms for these problems.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Majority Vote Computation with Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new approach to compute the majority vote (MV) function based on modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (MOCZ) and introduce three different methods. In these methods, each transmitter maps the votes to the zeros of a Huffman polynomial, and the corresponding polynomial coefficients are transmitted. The receiver evaluates the polynomial constructed by the elements of the superposed sequence at conjugate-reciprocal zero pairs and detects the MV with a direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoder. With differential and index-based encoders, we eliminate the need for power-delay information at the receiver while improving the computation error rate (CER) performance. The proposed methods do not use instantaneous channel state information at the transmitters and receiver. Thus, they provide robustness against phase and time synchronization errors. We theoretically analyze the CERs of the proposed methods. Finally, we demonstrate their efficacy in a distributed median computation scenario.</description>

      <title>Homotopy Theoretic and Categorical Models of Neural Information Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.15136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a novel mathematical formalism for the modeling of neural information networks endowed with additional structure in the form of assignments of resources, either computational or metabolic or informational. The starting point for this construction is the notion of summing functors and of Segal's Gamma-spaces in homotopy theory. The main results in this paper include functorial assignments of concurrent/distributed computing architectures and associated binary codes to networks and their subsystems, a categorical form of the Hopfield network dynamics, which recovers the usual Hopfield equations when applied to a suitable category of weighted codes, a functorial assignment to networks of corresponding information structures and information cohomology, and a cohomological version of integrated information.</description>

      <title>The Origin and Evolution of Information Handling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04374v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major challenge when describing the origin of life is to explain "how instructional information control systems emerge naturally and spontaneously from mere molecular dynamics". So far, no one has clarified how information control emerged ab initio and how primitive control mechanisms in life might have evolved, becoming increasingly refined. Based on recent experimental results showing that chemical computation does not require the presence of life-related chemistry, we elucidate the origin and early evolution of information handling by chemical automata, from information processing (computation) to information storage (memory) and information transmission (communication) and later digital messengers, covering at the same time its syntactic, semantic and pragmatic flavors. In contrast to other theories that assume the existence of initial complex structures, our representation starts from trivial self-replicators whose interaction leads to the arising of more powerful molecular machines. By describing precisely the primordial transitions in chemistry-based computation, our framework is capable of explaining the above-mentioned gaps and can be translated to other models of computation, which allow us to explore biological phenomena at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Being compatible with the free energy principle, we have developed a computational enactivist theoretical framework that could be able to describe from the origin of life to high-level cognition, as if it were a purely constructivist narrative. At the end of our manuscript, we propose some ways to extend our ideas, including experimental validation of our theory (both in vitro and in silico).</description>
