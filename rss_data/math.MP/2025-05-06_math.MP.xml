      <title>Asymptotics of zeta determinants of Laplacians on large degree abelian covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be some smooth, closed, compact Riemannian manifold and $(M_N\mapsto M)_N$ be an increasing sequence of large degree cyclic covers of $M$ that converges when $N\rightarrow +\infty$, in a suitable sense, to some limit $\mathbb{Z}^p$ cover $M_\infty$ over $M$. Motivated by recent works on zeta determinants on random surfaces and some natural questions in Euclidean quantum field theory, we show the convergence of the sequence $ \frac{\log\det_\zeta(\Delta_{N})}{\text{Vol}(M_N)} $ when $N\rightarrow +\infty$ where $\Delta_N$ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $M_N$. We also generalize our results to the case of twisted Laplacians coming from certain flat unitary vector bundles over $M$.</description>

      <title>On the quantum dynamics of long-ranged Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonians with long-ranged (power law) terms. We prove two ballistic propagation bounds for suitable initial states: (i) A bound on all moments of the local particle number for all power law exponents $\alpha&gt;d+1$ in $d$ dimensions, the sharp condition. (ii) The first thermodynamically stable Lieb-Robinson bound (LRB) for these Hamiltonians. To handle the long-ranged and unbounded terms, we further develop the multiscale ASTLO (adiabatic space time localization observables) method introduced in our recent work [arXiv:2310.14896].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-trivial Chern classes pose an obstruction to the existence of exponentially decaying Wannier functions which provide natural bases for spectral subspaces. For non-trivial Bloch bundles, we obtain decay rates of Wannier functions in dimensions $d=2,3$. For $d=2$, we construct Wannier functions with full asymptotics and optimal decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$ as conjectured by Thouless; for $d=3$, we construct Wannier functions with the uniform decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.</description>

      <title>Chemical hydrodynamics of nuclear spin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical equations of motion are strictly linear in state descriptors, such as wavefunctions and density matrices, but equations describing chemical kinetics and hydrodynamics may be non-linear in concentrations. This incompatibility is fundamental, but special cases can be handled - for example, in magnetic resonance where nuclear spin interactions may be too weak influence concentration dynamics. For processes involving single spins and first-order chemical reactions, this is a well-researched topic, but time evolution of complex nuclear spin systems in the presence of second-order kinetics, diffusion, and flow has so far remained intractable. This creates obstacles in microfluidics, homogeneous catalysis, and magnetic resonance imaging of metabolic processes.
  In this communication we report a numerically stable formalism for time-domain quantum mechanical description of nuclear spin dynamics and decoherence in the simultaneous presence of diffusion, flow, and second-order chemical reactions. The formalism is implemented in versions 2.11 and later of the open-source Spinach library. As an illustration, we use Diels-Alder cycloaddition of acrylonitrile to cyclopentadiene, yielding endo- and exo-norbornene carbonitrile, in the presence of diffusion and flow in the detection chamber of a microfluidic NMR probe (a finite element model with thousands of Voronoi cells) with a spatially localised stripline radiofrequency coil.</description>

      <title>Bogomol'nyi Equations and Coexistence of Vortices and Antivortices in Generalized Abelian Higgs Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Bogomol'nyi equations in generalized Abelian Higgs theories which allow the coexistence of vortices and antivortices over a compact Riemann surface or the full plane. In the compact surface situation, we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique solution describing a system of coexisting vortices and antivortices. In the full-plane situation, we prove the existence of a unique solution representing an arbitrary distribution of vortices and antivortices and obtain sharp asymptotic behavior of the solution near infinity. These solutions carry quantized magnetic fluxes and energies explicitly expressed in terms of the numbers of vortices and antivortices topologically characterized by the first Chern and Thom classes.</description>

      <title>Spectral parameter power series for Zakharov-Shabat direct and inverse scattering problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the direct and inverse scattering problems for the Zakharov-Shabat system. Representations for the Jost solutions are obtained in the form of the power series in terms of a transformed spectral parameter. In terms of that parameter, the Jost solutions are convergent power series in the unit disk. The coefficients of the series are computed following a simple recurrent integration procedure. This essentially reduces the solution of the direct scattering problem to the computation of the coefficients and location of zeros of an analytic function inside of the unit disk. The solution of the inverse scattering problem reduces to the solution of a system of linear algebraic equations for the power series coefficients, while the potential is recovered from the first coefficient. The overall approach leads to a simple and efficient method for the numerical solution of both direct and inverse scattering problems, which is illustrated by numerical examples.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Random Energy Model is the Limit of Quantum $ p $-Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the free energy of a class of spin glass models with $ p$-spin interactions in a transverse magnetic field. As $ p \to \infty $, the infinite system-size free energy is proven to converge to that of the quantum random energy model. This is accomplished by combining existing analytical techniques addressing the non-commutative properties of such quantum glasses, with the description of the typical geometry of extreme negative deviations of the classical $ p $-spin glass. We also review properties of the corresponding classical free energy and conjectures addressing $ 1/p $-corrections in the quantum case.</description>

      <title>About diffusion equations in bounded systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential equations need boundary conditions (BC's) for their solution. It is commonly acknowledged that differential equations and BC's are representative of independent physical processes, and no correlations between them is required. Two recent papers [D. Hilhorst, et al, Nonlinear Analysis, 245, 113561 (2024); J-W.Chung, et al, Jour. Math. Phys. 65, 071501 (2024)] focus on diffusion equations (DE's) in a case with continuity of the physics at the boundary, where transport coefficients go smoothly to zero in a very small layer about it. They argue that, once the analytical expression of the DE is chosen, only one kind of BC's may emerge (e.g., Neumann rather than Dirichlet). In this paper, we show that this case is very peculiar. Indeed, DE's generally arise as long-wavelength limit out of a stochastic picture of microscopic dynamics, in the form of an integro-differential Master Equation (ME). Accordingly, they are justified only on a statistical basis, provide accurate pictures of the system's evolution only over large enough length and time scales. In realistic cases, the width of the interface between the interior and exterior of the system is much smaller than transport scales, providing effectively a discontinuity and therefore a decorrelation between DE and BC.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Gaussian Tensor Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The starting point of this work is a theorem due to Maxwell characterizing the distribution of a Gaussian vector with at least two coordinates. We define the Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic Tensor Ensembles for notions of real symmetric, hermitian and self-dual hermitian tensors which recover the classical vector and matrix Gaussian Ensembles when the order is one and two. We give a basis of invariant polynomials for orthogonal, unitary and symplectic transformations and we prove a Maxwell-type theorem for these Gaussian tensor distributions unifying and extending the ones known for vectors and matrices.</description>

      <title>Super-Universal Behavior of Outliers Diffusing in a Space-Time Random Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I characterize the extreme location and extreme first passage time of a system of $N$ particles independently diffusing in a space-time random environment. I show these extreme statistics are governed by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation and derive their mean and variance. I find the scalings of the statistics depend on the moments of the environment. Each scaling regime forms a universality class which is controlled by the lowest order moment which exhibits random fluctuations. When the first moment is random, the environment plays the role of a random velocity field. When the first moment is fixed but the second moment is random, the environment manifests as fluctuations in the diffusion coefficient. As each higher moment is fixed, the next moment determines the scaling behavior. Since each scaling regime forms a universality class, this model for diffusion forms a super-universality class. I confirm my theoretical predictions using numerics for a wide class of underlying environments.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Quantization of Gauge Field Theories: Sandwich Quantization Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantization of field theories with gauge symmetry is an extensively discussed and well-established topic. In this short note, we revisit this old problem. The gauge degrees of freedom have vanishing momenta, and hence their equations of motion appear as constraints on the system. We argue that to ensure consistency of quantization one can impose these constraints as "sandwich conditions": The physical Hilbert space of the theory consists of all states for which the constraints sandwiched between any two physical states vanish. We solve the sandwich constraints and show they have solutions not discussed in the gauge field theory literature. We briefly discuss the physical meaning of these solutions and implications of the "sandwich quantization scheme".</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Even-Valent Graphs on Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for determining the topological expansion of the recurrence coefficients of orthogonal polynomials with weights of the form \( e^{-N\mathscr{V}(z)} \), where \( \mathscr{V}(z) = \frac{z^2}{2} + \frac{u z^{2\nu}}{2\nu} \) with \( u &gt; 0 \) and \( \nu \in \mathbb{N} \). A key feature of our approach is that it is non-recursive in \( \nu \). For fixed choices of vertices, $j$, and genus, $g$, our expansion yields closed-form formulae in $\nu$ which in turn count the number of connected \( 2\nu \)-valent labeled graphs (and their 2-legged counterparts) with \( j \) vertices on a compact Riemann surface of genus \( g \).
  We also outline the steps required to extend the methodology of \cite{BGM} to hexic weights, where \( \mathscr{V}(z) = \frac{z^2}{2} + \frac{u z^6}{6} \). This enables us to derive closed-form formulae in $j$ for the number of connected 6-valent labeled graphs with \( j \) vertices on a compact Riemann surface of genus \( g \), for \( g = 0, 1, \) and \( 2 \). Note the difference to our new method which instead holds for general $\nu$ and fixed $j$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a one-parameter family of infinite line ensembles on $[0, \infty)$ that are natural half-space analogues of the Airy line ensemble. Away from the origin these ensembles are locally described by avoiding Brownian bridges, and near the origin they are described by a sequence of avoiding reverse Brownian motions with alternating drifts, that depend on the parameter of the model. In addition, the restrictions of our ensembles to finitely many vertical lines form Pfaffian point processes with the crossover kernels obtained by Baik-Barraquand-Corwin-Suidan (Ann. Probab., 46(6), 3015-3089, 2018)</description>

      <title>Syllepses from 3-shifted Poisson structures and second-order integration of infinitesimal 2-braidings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper follows on from ``Infinitesimal 2-braidings from 2-shifted Poisson structures". It is demonstrated that the hexagonators appearing at second order satisfy the requisite axioms of a braided monoidal cochain 2-category provided that the strict infinitesimal 2-braiding is totally symmetric and coherent (in Cirio and Faria Martins' sense). We show that those infinitesimal 2-braidings induced by 2-shifted Poisson structures are indeed totally symmetric and we relate coherency to the third-weight component of the Maurer-Cartan equation that a 2-shifted Poisson structure must satisfy. Furthermore, we show that 3-shifted Poisson structures and ``coboundary" 2-shifted Poisson structures induce syllepses.</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of soliton gas primitive potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a class of soliton gas primitive potentials for the Korteweg--de Vries equation that arise from the accumulation of solitons on an infinite interval in the physical domain, extending to $-\infty$. This accumulation results in an associated Riemann--Hilbert problem on a number of disjoint intervals. In the case where the jump matrices have specific square-root behavior, we describe an efficient and accurate numerical method to solve this Riemann--Hilbert problem and extract the potential. The keys to the method are, first, the deformation of the Riemann--Hilbert problem, making numerical use of the so-called $g$-function, and, second, the incorporation of endpoint singularities into the chosen basis to discretize and solve the associated singular integral equation.</description>

Abstract: This survey explores knot polynomials and their categorification, culminating in the homological invariants of knots. We begin with an overview of classical knot polynomials, progressing towards the superpolynomial and its role in unifying various knot homologies. Along the way, we provide physical and geometric insights into the unification of the $sl(N)$ Khovanov-Rozansky and the knot Floer homology. We then turn our attention to the intriguing correspondence between knots and quivers, examining how this perspective sheds light on the integrality of BPS states encoded in the Labastida-Mari\~no-Ooguri-Vafa (LMOV) invariants. We will further investigate the knot-quiver correspondence from a physics and geometric side and study the 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory $T[Q_K]$ for the quivers.</description>

      <title>Boundary value problem of magnetically insulated diode: existence of solutions and complex bifurcation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the stationary self-consistent problem of magnetic insulation for a vacuum diode with space-charge limitation, described by a singularly perturbed Vlasov-Maxwell system of dimension 1.5. The case of insulated diode when the electrons are deflected back towards the cathode at the point $x^{*}$ is considered. First, the initial VM system is reduced to the nonlinear singular limit system of ODEs for the potentials of electric and magnetic fields. The second step deals with the limit system's reduction to the new nonlinear singular ODE equation for effective potential $\Theta(x)$. The existence of non-negative solutions is proved for the last equation on the interval $[0, x^{*})$ where $\Theta(x)&gt;0$. The most interesting and unexplored case is when $\Theta(x)&lt;0$ on the interval $(x^{*}, 1]$ and corresponds to the case of an insulated diode. For the first time, a numerical analysis of complex bifurcation of solutions in insulated diode is considered for $\Theta(x)&lt;0$ depending on parameters and boundary conditions. Bifurcation diagrams of the dependence of solution $\Theta(x)$ on a free point (free boundary) $x^{*}$ were constructed. Insulated diode spacing is found.</description>

      <title>Towards Lagrangian dynamics for constrained mixed-symmetric interacting higher-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The necessary and sufficient conditions to construct consistent Lagrangian formulation for irreducible interacting massless higher-spin (HS) fields on $d$-dimensional Minkowski space within approach with incomplete BRST operator and off-shell holonomic constraints are found. It is shown that in addition to superconmmuting of incomplete BRST operator with appropriate traceless and Young constraints, which annihilate the field and gauge parameter vectors, these constraints should form Abelian superalgebra both with BRST operator and with operators of cubic, quartic and etc. vertices. The consistent deformation of free model with constrained HS fields with integer spin requires for the cubic vertex to be by BRST-closed, traceless and Young-symmetric solution of the generating equations. The explicit form for the vertices for irreducible constrained interacting fields are obtained by means of projectors on traceless and Young-symmetric modes.</description>

      <title>Packaged Quantum States for Gauge-Invariant Quantum Computation and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Packaged quantum states are gauge-invariant states in which all internal quantum numbers (IQNs) form an inseparable block. This feature gives rise to novel packaged entanglements that encompass all IQNs, which is important both for fundamental physics and for quantum technology. Here we develop a framework for gauge-invariant quantum information processing based on packaged quantum states. We propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for a valid packaged superposition state of a single particle and multi-particle. We then present the details of constructing gauge-invariant packaged qubits (or qudits), packaged gates, and packaged circuits (which commute with the total charge operator). These serve as alternative foundation for gauge-invariant quantum information science. We then adapt conventional quantum error-correction codes, quantum algorithms, and quantum communication protocols to the ($d \times D$)-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace. This high-dimensional hybrid-packaged subspace is flexible for pruning and scaling to match available physics systems. Thus, packaged quantum information processing becomes feasible and testable. 
Our results show that the gauge-invariant packaged quantum states may provide a possible route toward robust, fault-tolerant, and secure quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Wormhole Nucleation via Topological Surgery in Lorentzian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for the nucleation of a wormhole within a Lorentzian spacetime by employing techniques from topological surgery and Morse theory. In our framework, a $0$-surgery process describes the neighborhood of the nucleation point inside a compact region of spacetime, yielding a singular Lorentzian cobordism that connects two spacelike regions with different topologies. To avoid the singularity at the critical point of the Morse function, we employ the Misner trick of taking a connected sum with a closed $4$-manifold -- namely $\mathbb{CP}^2$ -- to obtain an everywhere non-degenerate Lorentzian metric. This connected sum replaces the naked singularity -- unavoidable in topology-changing spacetimes -- with a region containing closed timelike curves. The obtained spacetime is, therefore, non-singular but violates all the standard energy conditions. Our construction thus shows that a wormhole can be "created" without singularities in classical general relativity.</description>

      <title>Information geometry and entanglement under phase-space deformation through nonsymplectic congruence transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao (FR) information matrix is a central object in multiparameter quantum estimation theory. The geometry of a quantum state can be envisaged through the Riemannian manifold generated by the FR-metric corresponding to the quantum state. Interestingly, any congruence transformation $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$ in phase-space leaves the FR-distance for Gaussian states invariant. In the present paper, we investigate whether this isometry affects the entanglement in the bipartite system. It turns out that, even a simple choice of a congruence transformation, induces the entanglement in a bipartite Gaussian system.
  To make our study relevant to physical systems, we choose Bopp's shift in phase-space as an example of $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$, so that the results can be interpreted in terms of noncommutative (NC) phase-space deformation. We explicitly provide a quantitative measure of the dependence of separability on NC parameters. General expressions for the metric structure are also provided.
  The crucial point in the present piece of study is the identification of the connection of phase-space deformation-induced entanglement through a general class of congruence transformation and the identification of a trade-off relationship between the initial correlations and deformation parameters.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove quantum ergodicity (a form of delocalization for eigenfunctions) for the Dirichlet truncations of the adjacency matrix on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. We also extend the result to the cases of finite range observables and periodic Schr\"odinger operators with periods of length at most two. This work partially answers a question asked by McKenzie and Sabri (Comm. Math. Phys. 403(3), 1477--1509(2023)).</description>

      <title>Spectral gap of the KMP and other stochastic exchange models on arbitrary graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simple strategy to derive universal bounds on the spectral gap of reversible stochastic exchange models on arbitrary graphs. The Kipnis-Marchioro-Presutti (KMP) model, the harmonic process (HP), and the immediate exchange model (IEM) are all examples that fall into this class. Our upper and lower bounds depend only on two features: worst-case linear statistics and a kinetic factor, which is, in essence, graph-independent. For the three aforementioned examples, these bounds are sharp, and even saturate to an identity for HP and IEM in some log-concave regimes. The proof -- which yields bounds for eigenvalues even in the non-reversible context -- crucially exploits the rigidity of the eigenstructure of these models and quantitative contraction rates of the corresponding hidden parameter models recently introduced in [DMFG24, GRT25].</description>

      <title>Revisiting the relaxation of constraints in gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there were works claiming that path integral quantisation of gauge theories necessarily requires relaxation of Lagrangian constraints. As has also been noted in the literature, it is of course wrong since there perfectly exist gauge field quantisations respecting the constraints, and at the same time the very idea of changing the classical theory in this way has many times appeared in other works. On the other hand, what was done in the path integral approach is fixing a gauge in terms of zero-momentum variables. We would like to show that this relaxation is what normally happens when one fixes such a gauge at the level of action principle in a Lagrangian theory. Moreover, there is an interesting analogy to be drawn. Namely, one of the ways to quantise a gauge theory is to build an extended Hamiltonian and then add new conditions by hand such as to make it a second class system. The constraints' relaxation occurs when one does the same at the level of the total Hamiltonian, i.e. a second class system with the primary constraints only.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Schr\"odinger operators on domains with scaled resonant potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Schr\"odinger operators on a bounded, smooth domain of dimension $d \ge 2$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions and a properly scaled potential, which depends only on the distance to the boundary of the domain. Our aim is to analyse the convergence of these operators as the scaling parameter tends to zero. If the scaled potential is resonant, the limit in strong resolvent sense is a Robin Laplacian with boundary coefficient expressed in terms of the mean curvature of the boundary. A counterexample shows that norm resolvent convergence cannot hold in general in this setting. If the scaled potential is non-negative (hence non-resonant), the limit in strong resolvent sense is the Dirichlet Laplacian. We conjecture that we can drop the non-negativity assumption in the non-resonant case.</description>

      <title>The Multidimensional Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform: Theoretical Analysis and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT) is a generalization of several well-known integral transforms, including the linear canonical transform (LCT), fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), and Fourier transform (FT). This paper introduces the multidimensional QPFT and investigates its theoretical properties, including Parseval's identity and inversion theorems. Generalized convolutions and correlation for multiple variables, extending the conventional convolution for single-variable functions, are proposed within the QPFT setting. Additionally, a Boas-type theorem for the multidimensional QPFT is established. As applications, multiplicative filter design and the solution of integral equations using the proposed convolution operation are explored.</description>

We formulate the map between the descendant observables in the GW theory on the projective line and the descendant observables in the mirror LGS theory. We prove that the LGS correlation functions of the mirror observables are equal to the GW invariants with descendants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology and cryptography can be combined in a distributed and/or remote sensing setting, where distant end-users with limited quantum capabilities can employ quantum states, transmitted by a quantum-powerful provider via a quantum network, to perform quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in a private fashion. Previous works on the subject have been limited by restricted assumptions on the capabilities of a potential eavesdropper and the use of abort-based protocols that prevent a simple practical realization. Here we introduce, theoretically analyze, and experimentally demonstrate single- and two-way protocols for distributed sensing combining several unique and desirable features: (i) a safety-threshold mechanism that allows the protocol to proceed in low-noise cases and quantifying the potential tampering with respect to the ideal estimation procedure, effectively paving the way for wide-spread practical realizations; (ii) equivalence of entanglement-based and mutually-unbiased-bases-based formulations; (iii) robustness against collective attacks via a LOCC-de-Finetti theorem, for the first time to our knowledge. Finally, we demonstrate our protocols in a photonic-based implementation, observing that the possibility of guaranteeing a safety threshold may come at a significant price in terms of the estimation bias, potentially overestimating the effect of tampering in practical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the cosmological dynamics of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity models in a four-dimensional spatially flat FLRW metric. These models are described by $f\left( R,\mathcal{G}\right) =f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $ theory of gravity. They are equivalent to models linear in the Ricci scalar $R$ and in the Gauss-Bonnet scalar $\mathcal{G}$ with one nonminimally coupled scalar field without kinetic term. We analyze the stability of the de Sitter solutions and construct the phase space of the field equations to investigate the cosmological evolution. We show that $f\left( R+\mu \mathcal{G}\right) $-theory provides a double inflationary epoch, this can be used to unify the early-time and late-time acceleration phases of the universe. Moreover, we discuss the initial value problem for theory to be cosmologically viable. Finally, the effects of the cold dark matter in cosmic evolution are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) and exceptional points (EPs) are often assumed to be inherently linked. Here we investigate the intricate relationship between SSB and specific classes of EPs across three distinct, real-world scenarios in nonlinear optics. In these systems, the two phenomena do not coincide for all classes of EPs; they can occur at dislocated points in parameter space. This recurring behavior across disparate platforms implies that such decoupling is not unique to these optical systems, but likely reflects a more general principle. Our results highlight the need for careful analysis of assumed correlations between SSB and EPs in both theoretical and applied contexts. They deepen our understanding of nonlinear dynamics in optical systems and prompt a broader reconsideration of contexts where EPs and SSB are thought to be interdependent.</description>

      <title>Sharp stability of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle: Second-Order and Curl-Free Field Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using techniques from harmonic analysis, we derive several sharp stability estimates for the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. We also present the explicit lower and upper bounds for the sharp stability constants and compute their exact limits when the dimension $N\rightarrow\infty$. Our proofs rely on spherical harmonics decomposition and Fourier analysis, differing significantly from existing approaches in the literature. Our results substantially improve the stability constants of the second order Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle recently obtained in [26]. As direct consequences of our main results, we also establish the sharp stability, with exact asymptotic behavior of the stability constants, of the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle with curl-free vector fields and a sharp version of the second order Poincar\'{e} type inequality with Gaussian measure.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ measures on compact Riemannian $3$-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10185v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on an arbitrary 3-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold without boundary as an invariant probability measure of a singular stochastic partial differential equation. Proving the nontriviality and the covariance under Riemannian isometries of that measure gives for the first time a non-perturbative, non-topological interacting Euclidean quantum field theory on curved spaces in dimension 3. This answers a longstanding open problem of constructive quantum field theory on curved 3 dimensional backgrounds. To control analytically several Feynman diagrams appearing in the construction of a number of random fields, we introduce a novel approach of renormalization using microlocal and harmonic analysis. This allows to obtain a renormalized equation which involves some universal constants independent of the manifold. We also define a new vectorial Cole-Hopf transform which allows to deal with the vectorial $\Phi^4_3$ model where $\Phi$ is now a bundle valued random field. In a companion paper, we develop in a self-contained way all the tools from paradifferential and microlocal analysis that we use to build in our manifold setting a number of analytic and probabilistic objects.</description>

Abstract: This paper aims to develop a non-commutative geometrical version of the theory of Yang--Mills--Scalar--Matter fields. To accomplish this purpose, we will dualize the geometrical formulation of this theory, in which principal $G$--bundles, principal connections, and linear representations play the most important role. In addition, we will present the non-commutative geometrical Lagrangian of the system as well as non-commutative geometrical associated field equations. At the end of this work, we show some examples</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the representation theory of the subregular W-algebra $\mathcal{W}^k(\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1},f_{sub})$ of type B and the principal W-superalgebra $\mathcal{W}^\ell(\mathfrak{osp}_{2|2n})$, which are related by an orthosymplectic analogue of Feigin-Semikhatov duality in type A. We establish a block-wise equivalence of weight modules over the W-superalgebras by using the relative semi-infinite cohomology functor and spectral flow twists, which generalizes the result of Feigin-Semikhatov-Tipunin for the N=2 superconformal algebra. In particular, the correspondence of Wakimoto type free field representations is obtained. When the level of the subregular W-algebra is exceptional, we classify the simple modules over the simple quotients $\mathcal{W}_k(\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1},f_{sub})$ and $\mathcal{W}_\ell(\mathfrak{osp}_{2|2n})$ and derive the character formulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-established organisational principle for Argyres--Douglas-type $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories in four dimensions is to characterise such theories by the data defining a(n irregular) Hitchin system on $\mathbb{CP}^1$. The dictionary between Hitchin system data and various features of the corresponding SCFT has been studied extensively, but the overall structure of the resulting space of SCFTs still appears quite complicated. In this work, we systematically delineate a variety of simplifications that arise within this class of constructions due to several large classes of isomorphisms between SCFTs associated with inequivalent Hitchin system data (and their exactly marginal gaugings). We restrict to the most studied class of theories, namely the type $A$ theories without outer automorphism twists.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis and experimental control of transformations of domain walls in magnetic cylindrical nanowires</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topology is a powerful tool for categorizing magnetization textures by defining a topological index in both two-dimensional (2D) systems, such as thin films or curved surfaces, and in 3D bulk systems. In the emerging field of 3D nanomagnetism, both volume and surface topological numbers must be considered, requiring the identification of a proper global topological invariant to support categorization. Here we consider domain walls in cylindrical nanowires as an excellent playground for 3D nanomagnetic systems, excited by a charge current, that generates an OErsted field. We first provide experimental evidence of previously unreported domain-wall transformations of topology occurring at the nanosecond timescale. We investigate these transformations with micromagnetic simulations, tracking both bulk and surface topological signatures.We demonstrate a topological invariant combining both signatures, while the topological charge varies from bulk to surface during the dynamics. The experimental change of topology is reproduced when the pulse duration matches the timescale of the internal transformations of the wall, and the current is switched off before the transformation is complete. We expect that the topological categorization and dynamical exploitation apply to any 3D nanomagnetic system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04852v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the small and large $x$ asymptotics of the special function solutions of Painlev\'e-III equation in the complex plane. We use the representation in terms of Toeplitz determinants of Bessel functions obtained in arXiv:nlin/0302026. Toeplitz determinants are rewritten as multiple contour integrals using Andr\`eief's identity. The small and large $x$ asymptotics are obtained using elementary asymptotic methods applied to the multiple contour integral. The asymptotics is extended to the whole complex plane using analytic continuation formulas for Bessel functions. The claimed result has not appeared in the literature before. We note that Toeplitz determinant representation is useful for numerical computations of corresponding solutions of the Painlev\'e-III equation.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Fr\'echet--Lie groups of the form $C^{\infty}(M)\rtimes \mathbb{R}$ resulting from smooth flows on compact manifolds $M$ fail to be locally exponential in several cases: when at least one non-periodic orbit is locally closed, or when the flow restricts to a linear one on an orbit closure diffeomorphic to a torus. As an application, we prove that the Bondi--Metzner--Sachs group of symmetries of an asymptotically flat spacetime is not locally exponential.</description>

Abstract: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion algorithm which is demonstrated for representative bulk materials, specifically bulk silicon, gallium arsenide, and potassium chloride. Our inversion algorithm allows the construction of rigorous error bounds that we are able to verify numerically. This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate functionals.</description>

      <title>A universal inequality on the unitary 2D CFT partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the conjecture proposed by Hartman, Keller and Stoica [HKS14]: the grand-canonical free energy of a unitary 2D CFT with a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12}+\epsilon$ and below the twist $\frac{c}{12}$ is universal in the large $c$ limit for all $\beta_L\beta_R \neq 4\pi^2$.
  The technique of the proof allows us to derive a one-parameter (with parameter $\alpha\in(0,1]$) family of universal inequalities on the unitary 2D CFT partition function with general central charge $c\geqslant 0$, using analytical modular bootstrap. We derive an iterative equation for the domain of validity of the inequality on the $(\beta_L,\beta_R)$ plane. The infinite iteration of this equation gives the boundary of maximal-validity domain, which depends on the parameter $\alpha$ in the inequality.
  In the $c \to \infty$ limit, with the additional assumption of a sparse spectrum below the scaling dimension $\frac{c}{12} + \epsilon$ and the twist $\frac{\alpha c}{12}$ (with $\alpha \in (0,1]$ fixed), our inequality shows that the grand-canonical free energy exhibits a universal large $c$ behavior in the maximal-validity domain. This domain, however, does not cover the entire $(\beta_L, \beta_R)$ plane, except in the case of $\alpha = 1$. For $\alpha = 1$, this proves the conjecture proposed by [HKS14], and for $\alpha &lt; 1$, it quantifies how sparseness in twist affects the regime of universality. Furthermore, this implies a precise lower bound on the temperature of near-extremal BTZ black holes, above which we can trust the black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.</description>

      <title>On dual-projectively equivalent connections associated to second order superintegrable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pre-geodesics of an affine connection are the curves that are geodesics after a reparametrization (the analogous concept in K\"ahler geometry is known as J-planar curves). Similarly, dual-geodesics on a Riemannian manifold are curves along which the 1-forms associated to the velocity are preserved after a reparametrization. Superintegrable systems are Hamiltonian systems with a large number of independent constants of the motion. They are said to be second order if the constants of the motion can be chosen to be quadratic polynomials in the momenta. Famous examples include the Kepler-Coulomb system and the isotropic harmonic oscillator. We show that certain torsion-free affine connections which are naturally associated to certain second order superintegrable systems share the same dual-geodesics.</description>

      <title>Renormalon-like factorial enhancements to power expansion/OPE in a super-renormalizable 2D $O(N)$ quartic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02031v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of logarithms on the asymptotic behavior of power expansion/OPE in supper-renormalizable QFTs. We performed a careful investigation of the large $p^2$ expansion of a scalar-scalar two-point function at the next-to-leading order in the large-$N$ expansion, in a large-$N$ $O(N)$ quartic model that is populated by logarithms. We show that because the large-$p^2$ logarithms of the individual bubbles can be amplified by bubble-chains, there are factorial enhancements to the power expansion. We show how the factorial enhancements appear separately in the coefficient functions and operator condensates, and demonstrate how they are cancelled off-diagonally across different powers. Restricted to any given power, the factorial enhancements are no-longer canceled. The large-$p^2$ power expansion is divergent.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for resolutions and smoothings of Calabi-Yau conifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Calabi-Yau metrics with isolated conical singularities of Hein-Sun admit polyhomogeneous expansions near their singularities. Moreover, we show that, under certain generic assumptions, natural families of smooth Calabi-Yau metrics on crepant resolutions and on polarized smoothings of conical Calabi-Yau manifolds degenerating to the initial conical Calabi-Yau metric admit polyhomogeneous expansions where the singularities are forming. The construction proceeds by performing weighted Melrose-type blow-ups and then gluing conical and scaled asymptotically conical Calabi-Yau metrics on the fibers, close to the blow-up's front face without compromising polyhomogeneity. This yields a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics that are approximately Calabi-Yau. Solving formally a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation, we obtain a polyhomogeneous family of K\"ahler metrics with Ricci potential converging rapidly to zero as the family is degenerating. We can then conclude that the corresponding family of degenerating Calabi-Yau metrics is polyhomogeneous by using a fixed point argument.</description>

      <title>Universal inverse Radon transforms: Inhomogeneity, angular restrictions and boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An alternative method to invert the Radon transforms without the use of Courant-Hilbert's identities has been proposed and developed independently from the space dimension. For the universal representation of inverse Radon transform, we study the consequences of inhomogeneity of outset function without the restrictions on the angular Radon coordinates. We show that this inhomogeneity yields a natural evidence for the presence of the extra contributions in the case of the full angular region. In addition, if the outset function is well-localized in the space, we demonstrate that the corresponding boundary conditions and the angular restrictions should be applied for both the direct and inverse Radon transforms. Besides, we relate the angular restrictions on the Radon variable to the boundary exclusion of outset function and its Radon image.</description>

      <title>On the structure of homogeneous local Poisson brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an arbitrary Dubrovin-Novikov bracket of degree $k$, namely a homogeneous degree $k$ local Poisson bracket on the loop space of a smooth manifold $M$ of dimension $n$, and show that $k$ connections, defined by explicit linear combinations with constant coefficients of the standard connections associated with the Poisson bracket, are flat.</description>
