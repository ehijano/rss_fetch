      <title>Impacting the dayside Martian ionosphere from above and below: Effects of the impact of CIRs and ICMEs close to aphelion (April 2021) and during dust storms (June-July 2022) seen with MAVEN ROSE</title>

Abstract: We use 62 electron density profiles collected by the Radio Occultation Science Experiment (ROSE), on MAVEN, when Mars was hit by CIRs and ICMEs close to aphelion (April 2021) and during two dust storms (June-July 2022) to examine the response of the Martian ionosphere to solar events and to solar events hitting during dust storms. We do so through three proxies - variation in total electron content between 80 and 300 km altitude, peak density, and peak altitude - of the aforementioned 62 ROSE electron density profiles, relative to a characterisation of the ionosphere through solar minimum leading to solar maximum, specific to local time sector and season, presented in Segale et al., (COMPANION). We observe an increased Total Electron Content (TEC) between 80 and 300 km altitude up to 2.5 x 10(15) m(-2) in April 2021 and up to 5 x 10(15) m(-2) in June-July 2022 compared to the baseline photochemically produced ionosphere. This increase in TEC corresponds mainly to increases in the solar energetic particles flux (detected by MAVEN SEP) and electron fluxes (detected by MAVEN SWEA). In addition to solar events, in June-July 2022, an A storm and a B storm were occurring and merging on the surface of Mars. We observe a raise in peak altitude in general lower than expected during dust storms, possibly due to high values of solar wind dynamic pressure (derived from MAVEN SWIA). From 31 ROSE profiles collected in this time period that showed both the M2 and M1 layer, we observe that, on average, M1 and M2 peak altitudes raise the same amount, suggesting that the thermosphere might loft as a unit during dust storms. During this time period, several proton aurora events of variable brightness were detected with MAVEN IUVS underlining the complex and multifaceted impact of dust activity and extreme solar activity on the Martian ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Exploring Radio Emissions from Confirmed Exoplanets Using SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, our understanding of magnetic fields in exoplanets remains limited compared to those within our solar system. Planets with magnetic fields emit radio signals primarily due to the Electron Cyclotron Maser Instability mechanism. In this study, we explore the feasibility of detecting radio emissions from exoplanets using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) radio telescope. Utilizing data from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, we compile information on confirmed exoplanets and estimate their radio emissions using the RBL model. Our analysis reveals that three exoplanets- Qatar-4 b, TOI-1278 b, and WASP-173 A b- exhibit detectable radio signals suitable for observation with the SKA telescope.</description>

      <title>Frequency Dispersed Ion Acoustic Waves in the Near Sun Solar Wind: Signatures of Impulsive Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work reports a novel plasma wave observation in the near-Sun solar wind: frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves. Similar waves were previously reported in association with interplanetary shocks or planetary bow shocks, but the waves reported here occur throughout the solar wind sunward of $\sim 60$ solar radii, far from any identified shocks. The waves reported here vary their central frequency by factors of 3 to 10 over tens of milliseconds, with frequencies that chirp up or down in time. Using a semi-automated identification algorithm, thousands of wave instances are recorded during each near-Sun orbit of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft. Wave statistical properties are determined and used to estimate their plasma frame frequency and the energies of protons most likely to be resonant with these waves. Proton velocity distribution functions are explored for one wave interval, and proton enhancements that may be consistent with proton beams are observed. A conclusion from this analysis is that properties of the observed frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves are consistent with driving by cold, impulsively accelerated proton beams near the ambient proton thermal speed. Based on the large number of observed waves and their properties, it is likely that the impulsive proton beam acceleration mechanism generating these waves is active throughout the inner heliosphere. This may have implications for acceleration of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Variation in Path Lengths of Turbulent Magnetic Field Lines and Solar Energetic Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling of time profiles of solar energetic particle (SEP) observations often considers transport along a large-scale magnetic field with a fixed path length from the source to the observer. Here we point out that variability in the turbulent field line path length can affect the fits to SEP data and the inferred mean free path and injection profile. To explore such variability, we perform Monte Carlo simulations in representations of homogeneous 2D MHD + slab turbulence adapted to spherical geometry and trace trajectories of field lines and full particle orbits, considering proton injection from a narrow or wide angular region near the Sun, corresponding to an impulsive or gradual solar event, respectively. We analyze our simulation results in terms of field line and particle path length statistics for $1^\circ\times 1^\circ$ pixels in heliolatitude and heliolongitude at 0.35 and 1 AU from the Sun, for different values of the turbulence amplitude $b/B_0$ and turbulence geometry as expressed by the slab fraction $f_s$. Maps of the most probable path lengths of field lines and particles at each pixel exhibit systematic patterns that reflect the fluctuation amplitudes experienced by the field lines, which in turn relate to the local topology of 2D turbulence. We describe the effects of such path length variations on SEP time profiles, both in terms of path length variability at specific locations and motion of the observer with respect to turbulence topology during the course of the observations.</description>
