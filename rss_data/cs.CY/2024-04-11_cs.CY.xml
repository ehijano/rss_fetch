      <title>From Protoscience to Epistemic Monoculture: How Benchmarking Set the Stage for the Deep Learning Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, AI research has focused heavily on building ever-larger deep learning models. This approach has simultaneously unlocked incredible achievements in science and technology, and hindered AI from overcoming long-standing limitations with respect to explainability, ethical harms, and environmental efficiency. Drawing on qualitative interviews and computational analyses, our three-part history of AI research traces the creation of this "epistemic monoculture" back to a radical reconceptualization of scientific progress that occurred in the 1990s. In the first era of AI research (1950s-late 1980s), researchers and patrons approached AI as a "basic" science that would advance through autonomous exploration and organic assessments of progress (e.g., peer-review, theoretical consensus). The failure of this approach led to a retrenchment of funding in the 1980s. Amid this "AI Winter," an intervention by the U.S. government reoriented the field towards measurable progress on tasks of military and commercial interest. A new evaluation system called "benchmarking" provided an objective way to quantify progress on tasks by focusing exclusively on increasing predictive accuracy on example datasets. Distilling science down to verifiable metrics clarified the roles of scientists, allowed the field to rapidly integrate talent, and provided clear signals of significance and progress. But history has also revealed a tradeoff to this streamlined approach to science: the consolidation around external interests and inherent conservatism of benchmarking has disincentivized exploration beyond scaling monoculture. In the discussion, we explain how AI's monoculture offers a compelling challenge to the belief that basic, exploration-driven research is needed for scientific progress. Implications for the spread of AI monoculture to other sciences in the era of generative AI are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Racial/Ethnic Categories in AI and Algorithmic Fairness: Why They Matter and What They Represent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Racial diversity has become increasingly discussed within the AI and algorithmic fairness literature, yet little attention is focused on justifying the choices of racial categories and understanding how people are racialized into these chosen racial categories. Even less attention is given to how racial categories shift and how the racialization process changes depending on the context of a dataset or model. An unclear understanding of \textit{who} comprises the racial categories chosen and \textit{how} people are racialized into these categories can lead to varying interpretations of these categories. These varying interpretations can lead to harm when the understanding of racial categories and the racialization process is misaligned from the actual racialization process and racial categories used. Harm can also arise if the racialization process and racial categories used are irrelevant or do not exist in the context they are applied.
  In this paper, we make two contributions. First, we demonstrate how racial categories with unclear assumptions and little justification can lead to varying datasets that poorly represent groups obfuscated or unrepresented by the given racial categories and models that perform poorly on these groups. Second, we develop a framework, CIRCSheets, for documenting the choices and assumptions in choosing racial categories and the process of racialization into these categories to facilitate transparency in understanding the processes and assumptions made by dataset or model developers when selecting or using these racial categories.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of a Large Language Model in Distinguishing Anti- And Pro-vaccination Messages on Social Media: The Case of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. Vaccination has engendered a spectrum of public opinions, with social media acting as a crucial platform for health-related discussions. The emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, such as large language models (LLMs), offers a novel opportunity to efficiently investigate public discourses. This research assesses the accuracy of ChatGPT, a widely used and freely available service built upon an LLM, for sentiment analysis to discern different stances toward Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Methods. Messages related to HPV vaccination were collected from social media supporting different message formats: Facebook (long format) and Twitter (short format). A selection of 1,000 human-evaluated messages was input into the LLM, which generated multiple response instances containing its classification results. Accuracy was measured for each message as the level of concurrence between human and machine decisions, ranging between 0 and 1. Results. Average accuracy was notably high when 20 response instances were used to determine the machine decision of each message: .882 (SE = .021) and .750 (SE = .029) for anti- and pro-vaccination long-form; .773 (SE = .027) and .723 (SE = .029) for anti- and pro-vaccination short-form, respectively. Using only three or even one instance did not lead to a severe decrease in accuracy. However, for long-form messages, the language model exhibited significantly lower accuracy in categorizing pro-vaccination messages than anti-vaccination ones. Conclusions. ChatGPT shows potential in analyzing public opinions on HPV vaccination using social media content. However, understanding the characteristics and limitations of a language model within specific public health contexts remains imperative.</description>

      <title>Frontier AI Ethics: Anticipating and Evaluating the Societal Impacts of Generative Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some have criticised Generative AI Systems for replicating the familiar pathologies of already widely-deployed AI systems. Other critics highlight how they foreshadow vastly more powerful future systems, which might threaten humanity's survival. The first group says there is nothing new here; the other looks through the present to a perhaps distant horizon. In this paper, I instead pay attention to what makes these particular systems distinctive: both their remarkable scientific achievement, and the most likely and consequential ways in which they will change society over the next five to ten years. In particular, I explore the potential societal impacts and normative questions raised by the looming prospect of 'Generative Agents', in which multimodal large language models (LLMs) form the executive centre of complex, tool-using AI systems that can take unsupervised sequences of actions towards some goal.</description>

      <title>Leveraging open-source models for legal language modeling and analysis: a case study on the Indian constitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the use of open-source models has gained immense popularity in various fields, including legal language modelling and analysis. These models have proven to be highly effective in tasks such as summarizing legal documents, extracting key information, and even predicting case outcomes. This has revolutionized the legal industry, enabling lawyers, researchers, and policymakers to quickly access and analyse vast amounts of legal text, saving time and resources. This paper presents a novel approach to legal language modeling (LLM) and analysis using open-source models from Hugging Face. We leverage Hugging Face embeddings via LangChain and Sentence Transformers to develop an LLM tailored for legal texts. We then demonstrate the application of this model by extracting insights from the official Constitution of India. Our methodology involves preprocessing the data, splitting it into chunks, using ChromaDB and LangChainVectorStores, and employing the Google/Flan-T5-XXL model for analysis. The trained model is tested on the Indian Constitution, which is available in PDF format. Our findings suggest that our approach holds promise for efficient legal language processing and analysis.</description>

      <title>FairPair: A Robust Evaluation of Biases in Language Models through Paired Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate evaluation of differential treatment in language models to specific groups is critical to ensuring a positive and safe user experience. An ideal evaluation should have the properties of being robust, extendable to new groups or attributes, and being able to capture biases that appear in typical usage (rather than just extreme, rare cases). Relatedly, bias evaluation should surface not only egregious biases but also ones that are subtle and commonplace, such as a likelihood for talking about appearances with regard to women. We present FairPair, an evaluation framework for assessing differential treatment that occurs during ordinary usage. FairPair operates through counterfactual pairs, but crucially, the paired continuations are grounded in the same demographic group, which ensures equivalent comparison. Additionally, unlike prior work, our method factors in the inherent variability that comes from the generation process itself by measuring the sampling variability. We present an evaluation of several commonly used generative models and a qualitative analysis that indicates a preference for discussing family and hobbies with regard to women.</description>

      <title>Federated learning model for predicting major postoperative complications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: The accurate prediction of postoperative complication risk using Electronic Health Records (EHR) and artificial intelligence shows great potential. Training a robust artificial intelligence model typically requires large-scale and diverse datasets. In reality, collecting medical data often encounters challenges surrounding privacy protection. Methods: This retrospective cohort study includes adult patients who were admitted to UFH Gainesville (GNV) (n = 79,850) and Jacksonville (JAX) (n = 28,636) for any type of inpatient surgical procedure. Using perioperative and intraoperative features, we developed federated learning models to predict nine major postoperative complications (i.e., prolonged intensive care unit stay and mechanical ventilation). We compared federated learning models with local learning models trained on a single site and central learning models trained on pooled dataset from two centers. Results: Our federated learning models achieved the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) values ranged from 0.81 for wound complications to 0.92 for prolonged ICU stay at UFH GNV center. At UFH JAX center, these values ranged from 0.73-0.74 for wound complications to 0.92-0.93 for hospital mortality. Federated learning models achieved comparable AUROC performance to central learning models, except for prolonged ICU stay, where the performance of federated learning models was slightly higher than central learning models at UFH GNV center, but slightly lower at UFH JAX center. In addition, our federated learning model obtained comparable performance to the best local learning model at each center, demonstrating strong generalizability. Conclusion: Federated learning is shown to be a useful tool to train robust and generalizable models from large scale data across multiple institutions where data protection barriers are high.</description>

      <title>Biomedical Open Source Software: Crucial Packages and Hidden Heroes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the importance of scientific software for research, it is often not formally recognized and rewarded. This is especially true for foundation libraries, which are used by the software packages visible to the users, being ``hidden'' themselves. The funders and other organizations need to understand the complex network of computer programs that the modern research relies upon.
  In this work we used CZ Software Mentions Dataset to map the dependencies of the software used in biomedical papers and find the packages critical to the software ecosystems. We propose the centrality metrics for the network of software dependencies, analyze three ecosystems (PyPi, CRAN, Bioconductor) and determine the packages with the highest centrality.</description>

      <title>Embedding Economic Incentives in Social Networks Shape the Diffusion of Digital Technological Innovation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital innovation accompanied by explicit economic incentives have fundamentally changed the process of innovation diffusion. As a representative of digital innovation, NFTs provide a decentralized and secure way to authenticate and trade digital assets, offering the potential for new revenue streams in the digital space. However, current researches about NFTs mainly focus on their transaction networks and community culture, leaving the interplay among diffusion dynamics, economic dynamics, and social constraints on Twitter. By collecting and analyzing NFTs-related tweet dataset, the motivations of retweeters, the information mechanisms behind emojis, and the networked-based diffusion dynamics is systematically investigated. Results indicate that Retweeting is fueled by Freemint and trading information, with the higher economic incentives as a major motivation and some potential organizational tendencies. The diffusion of NFT is primarily driven by a 'Ringed-layered' information mechanism involving individual promoters and speculators. Both the frequency and presentation of content contribute positively to the growth of the retweet network. This study contributes to the innovation diffusion theory with economic incentives embedded.</description>

Abstract: The explosion of content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) models has initiated a cultural shift in arts, music, and media, whereby roles are changing, values are shifting, and conventions are challenged. The vast, readily available dataset of the Internet has created an environment for AI models to be trained on any content on the Web. With AI models shared openly and used by many globally, how does this new paradigm shift challenge the status quo in artistic practices? What kind of changes will AI technology bring to music, arts, and new media?</description>

      <title>Leveraging Recommender Systems to Reduce Content Gaps on Peer Production Platforms</title>

Abstract: Peer production platforms like Wikipedia commonly suffer from content gaps. Prior research suggests recommender systems can help solve this problem, by guiding editors towards underrepresented topics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach would result in less relevant recommendations, leading to reduced overall engagement with recommended items. To answer this question, we first conducted offline analyses (Study 1) on SuggestBot, a task-routing recommender system for Wikipedia, then did a three-month controlled experiment (Study 2). Our results show that presenting users with articles from underrepresented topics increased the proportion of work done on those articles without significantly reducing overall recommendation uptake. We discuss the implications of our results, including how ignoring the article discovery process can artificially narrow recommendations on peer production platforms.</description>

      <title>Visibility into AI Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13138v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Increased delegation of commercial, scientific, governmental, and personal activities to AI agents -- systems capable of pursuing complex goals with limited supervision -- may exacerbate existing societal risks and introduce new risks. Understanding and mitigating these risks involves critically evaluating existing governance structures, revising and adapting these structures where needed, and ensuring accountability of key stakeholders. Information about where, why, how, and by whom certain AI agents are used, which we refer to as visibility, is critical to these objectives. In this paper, we assess three categories of measures to increase visibility into AI agents: agent identifiers, real-time monitoring, and activity logging. For each, we outline potential implementations that vary in intrusiveness and informativeness. We analyze how the measures apply across a spectrum of centralized through decentralized deployment contexts, accounting for various actors in the supply chain including hardware and software service providers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our measures for privacy and concentration of power. Further work into understanding the measures and mitigating their negative impacts can help to build a foundation for the governance of AI agents.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Power, Objectivity and Gender in AI Ethics Labor: Legitimizing Located Complaints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What counts as legitimate AI ethics labor, and consequently, what are the epistemic terms on which AI ethics claims are rendered legitimate? Based on 75 interviews with technologists including researchers, developers, open source contributors, and activists, this paper explores the various epistemic bases from which AI ethics is discussed and practiced. In the context of outside attacks on AI ethics as an impediment to ``progress,'' I show how some AI ethics practices have reached toward authority from automation and quantification, and achieved some legitimacy as a result, while those based on richly embodied and situated lived experience have not. This paper draws together the work of feminist Anthropology and Science and Technology Studies scholars Diana Forsythe and Lucy Suchman with the works of postcolonial feminist theorist Sara Ahmed and Black feminist theorist Kristie Dotson to examine the implications of dominant AI ethics practices.
  By entrenching the epistemic power of quantification, dominant AI ethics practices -- Model Cards and similar interventions -- risk legitimizing AI ethics as a project in equal and opposite measure to which they delegitimize and marginalize embodied and lived experiences as legitimate parts of the same project. In response, I propose\textit{ humble technical practices}: quantified or technical practices which specifically seek to make their epistemic limits clear in order to flatten hierarchies of epistemic power.</description>

      <title>Public-private funding models in open source software development: A case study on scikit-learn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Governments are increasingly allocating funding for open source software (OSS) development to address concerns related to software security, digital sovereignty, and national competitiveness in science and innovation, amongst others. While announcements of governmental funding are generally well-received by OSS developers, we still have a limited understanding of OSS developers evaluate the relative benefits and drawbacks of such funding compared to other types of funding. This paper explores this question through a case study on scikit-learn, a Python library for machine learning, whose funding model combines research grants, commercial sponsorship, community donations, and a 32 million euro grant from the France's artificial intelligence strategy. Through 25 interviews with scikit-learn's maintainers and funders, this study makes two key contributions to research and practice. First, the study illustrates how the maintainers have weaved public and private funding into their project to ensure the continued provision of scikit-learn as a digital public good, as well as the importance of diversified funding and governance protocols for funding to safeguard the community ethos of the project. Second, it offers practical recommendations to various stakeholders. For OSS developer communities, it illustrates the benefits of a diversified funding model in balancing the merits and drawbacks of different funding sources. For companies, it serves as a reminder that sponsoring developers or OSS projects can significantly support OSS maintainers, who often struggle with limited resources and towering workloads. For governments, it emphasises the importance of funding the maintenance of existing OSS in addition to or exclusively funding the development of new OSS libraries or features. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research directions.</description>
