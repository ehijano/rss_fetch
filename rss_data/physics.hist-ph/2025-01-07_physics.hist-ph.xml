      <title>Quantum Perspectivism vs Nietzschean Perspectivism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a work of hard physical philosophy, where Quantum Perspectivism is shown to function as both an interpretation of quantum mechanics and a physical model for understanding Nietzsche's perspectivism. This framework combines quantum logic, the principle of complementarity, and contextuality to examine how perspectives construct reality. In this model, measurements correspond to Perspectives and Meta-Perspectives, represented as Boolean subalgebras and Hilbert sub-lattices within the Hilbert lattice, respectively. The Hilbert lattice itself is reinterpreted as Jung's Unus Mundus, a unified ontological reality. A metaphysical observation, made by a metaphysical observer, of a given system (World) is identified with the set of all corresponding meta-perspectives in the Hilbert lattice/Unus Mundus, the ocean of reality.
  Perspectives, likened to islands in this ocean, correspond to single measurements of a system, capturing the logical structure of observed properties. Meta-perspectives, analogous to continents, represent the synthesis of multiple measurements, providing a broader yet inherently incomplete understanding of the system. This structure emphasizes the complementarity and contextual dependencies of measurements while exposing the limitations of classical objectivity in the quantum domain. Advocating for a perspectival view of both the world and truth, Quantum Perspectivism unites quantum mechanics and Nietzschean philosophy into a cohesive framework for exploring the interplay between consciousness, observation, and reality.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Unitarity Violation and Quantum State Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the central foundational problems in quantum mechanics is the inability of Schr\"odinger's unitary time evolution to describe measurement of a quantum state. Recent developments in models of spontaneous unitarity violation (SUV) propose that quantum state reduction can emerge as a thermodynamic phenomenon, offering a natural resolution to the measurement problem. This paper investigates the philosophical implications of SUV in relation to the nature of probabilities in quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics. It provides an alternate interpretation of probabilities in quantum mechanics that aligns with (and improves upon) the arguments of the propensity interpretation of probabilities.</description>

      <title>How do Laws Produce the Future?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The view that the laws of nature produce later states of the universe from earlier ones (prominently defended by Maudlin) faces difficult questions as to how the laws produce the future and whether that production is compatible with special relativity. This article grapples with those questions, arguing that the concerns can be overcome through a close analysis of the laws of classical mechanics and electromagnetism. The view that laws produce the future seems to require that the laws of nature take a certain form, fitting what Adlam has called "the time evolution paradigm." Making that paradigm precise, we might demand that there be temporally local dynamical laws that take properties of the present and the arbitrarily-short past as input, returning as output changes in such properties into the arbitrarily-short future. In classical mechanics, Newton's second law can be fit into this form if we follow a proposal from Easwaran and understand the acceleration that appears in the law to capture how velocity (taken to be a property of the present and the arbitrarily-short past) changes into the arbitrarily-short future. The dynamical laws of electromagnetism can be fit into this form as well, though because electromagnetism is a special relativistic theory we might require that the laws meet a higher standard: linking past light-cone to future light-cone. With some work, the laws governing the evolution of the vector and scalar potentials in the Lorenz gauge, as well as the evolution of charged matter, can be put in a form that meets this higher standard.</description>
