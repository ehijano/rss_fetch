      <title>The Traceplot Thickens: MCMC Diagnostics for Non-Euclidean Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MCMC algorithms are frequently used to perform inference under a Bayesian modeling framework. Convergence diagnostics, such as traceplots, the Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction factor, and effective sample size, are used to visualize mixing and determine how long to run the sampler. However, these classic diagnostics can be ineffective when the sample space of the algorithm is highly discretized (eg. Bayesian Networks or Dirichlet Process Mixture Models) or the sampler uses frequent non-Euclidean moves. In this article, we develop novel generalized convergence diagnostics produced by mapping the original space to the real-line while respecting a relevant distance function and then evaluating the convergence diagnostics on the mapped values. Simulated examples are provided that demonstrate the success of this method in identifying failures to converge that are missed or unavailable by other methods.</description>

      <title>Implementing MCMC: Multivariate estimation with confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the key challenge of estimating the asymptotic covariance associated with the Markov chain central limit theorem, which is essential for visualizing and terminating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations. We focus on summarizing batching, spectral, and initial sequence covariance estimation techniques. We emphasize practical recommendations for modern MCMC simulations, where positive correlation is common and leads to negatively biased covariance estimates. Our discussion is centered on computationally efficient methods that remain viable even when the number of iterations is large, offering insights into improving the reliability and accuracy of MCMC output in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sampling parameters of ordinary differential equations with Langevin dynamics that satisfy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fitting models to data to obtain distributions of consistent parameter values is important for uncertainty quantification, model comparison, and prediction. Standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we obtain more than a hundred fold speedup relative to a leading ensemble MCMC approach that requires numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.</description>

      <title>Cellwise robust and sparse principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first proposal of a sparse and cellwise robust PCA method is presented. Robustness to single outlying cells in the data matrix is achieved by substituting the squared loss function for the approximation error by a robust version. The integration of a sparsity-inducing $L_1$ or elastic net penalty offers additional modeling flexibility. For the resulting challenging optimization problem, an algorithm based on Riemannian stochastic gradient descent is developed, with the advantage of being scalable to high-dimensional data, both in terms of many variables as well as observations. The resulting method is called SCRAMBLE (Sparse Cellwise Robust Algorithm for Manifold-based Learning and Estimation). Simulations reveal the superiority of this approach in comparison to established methods, both in the casewise and cellwise robustness paradigms. Two applications from the field of tribology underline the advantages of a cellwise robust and sparse PCA method.</description>

      <title>NetSurvival.jl: A glimpse into relative survival analysis with Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many population-based medical studies, the specific cause of death is unidentified, unreliable or even unavailable. Relative survival analysis addresses this scenario, outside of standard (competing risks) survival analysis, to nevertheless estimate survival with respect to a specific cause. It separates the impact of the disease itself on mortality from other factors, such as age, sex, and general population trends. Different methods were created with the aim to construct consistent and efficient estimators for this purpose. The R package relsurv is the most commonly used today in application. With Julia continuously proving itself to be an efficient and powerful programming language, we felt the need to code a pure Julia take, thus NetSurvival.jl, of the standard routines and estimators in the field. The proposed implementation is clean, future-proof, well tested, and the package is correctly documented inside the rising JuliaSurv GitHub organization, ensuring trustability of the results. Through a comprehensive comparison in terms of performance and interface to relsurv, we highlight the benefits of the Julia developing environment.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference for the Markov-modulated Poisson process with an outcome process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In medical research, understanding changes in outcome measurements is crucial for inferring shifts in a patient's underlying health condition. While data from clinical and administrative systems hold promise for advancing this understanding, traditional methods for modelling disease progression struggle with analyzing a large volume of longitudinal data collected irregularly and do not account for the phenomenon where the poorer an individual's health, the more frequently they interact with the healthcare system. In addition, data from the claim and health care system provide no information for terminating events, such as death. To address these challenges, we start from the continuous-time hidden Markov model to understand disease progression by modelling the observed data as an outcome whose distribution depends on the state of a latent Markov chain representing the underlying health state. However, we also allow the underlying health state to influence the timings of the observations via a point process. Furthermore, we create an addition "death" state and model the unobserved terminating event, a transition to this state, via an additional Poisson process whose rate depends on the latent state of the Markov chain. This extension allows us to model disease severity and death not only based on the types of care received but also on the temporal and frequency aspects of different observed events. We present an exact Gibbs sampler procedure that alternates sampling the complete path of the hidden chain (the latent health state throughout the observation window) conditional on the complete paths. When the unobserved, terminating event occurs early in the observation window, there are no more observed events, and naive use of a model with only "live" health states would lead to biases in parameter estimates; our inclusion of a "death" state mitigates against this.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discriminant analysis (DA) is one of the most popular methods for classification due to its conceptual simplicity, low computational cost, and often solid performance. In its standard form, DA uses the arithmetic mean and sample covariance matrix to estimate the center and scatter of each class. We discuss and illustrate how this makes standard DA very sensitive to suspicious data points, such as outliers and mislabeled cases. We then present an overview of techniques for robust DA, which are more reliable in the presence of deviating cases. In particular, we review DA based on robust estimates of location and scatter, along with graphical diagnostic tools for visualizing the results of DA.</description>

      <title>A review of sequential Monte Carlo methods for real-time disease modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequential Monte Carlo methods are a powerful framework for approximating the posterior distribution of a state variable in a sequential manner. They provide an attractive way of analyzing dynamic systems in real-time, taking into account the limitations of traditional approaches such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which are not well suited to data that arrives incrementally. This paper reviews and explores the application of Sequential Monte Carlo in dynamic disease modeling, highlighting its capacity for online inference and real-time adaptation to evolving disease dynamics. The integration of kernel density approximation techniques within the stochastic Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartment model is examined, demonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in monitoring time-varying parameters such as the effective reproduction number. Case studies, including simulations with synthetic data and analysis of real-world COVID-19 data from Ireland, demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach for informing timely public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Investigating Complex HPV Dynamics Using Emulation and History Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of transmission and progression of human papillomavirus (HPV) is crucial for understanding the incidence of cervical cancers, and has been identified as a priority worldwide. The complexity of the disease necessitates a detailed model of HPV transmission and its progression to cancer; to infer properties of the above we require a careful process that can match to imperfect or incomplete observational data. In this paper, we describe the HPVsim simulator to satisfy the former requirement; to satisfy the latter we couple this stochastic simulator to a process of emulation and history matching using the R package hmer. With these tools, we are able to obtain a comprehensive collection of parameter combinations that could give rise to observed cancer data, and explore the implications of the variability of these parameter sets as it relates to future health interventions.</description>

      <title>A Model-Free Method to Quantify Memory Utilization in Neural Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the predictive capacity of a neural system, intended as the capability to store information and actively use it for dynamic system evolution, is a key component of neural information processing. Information storage (IS), the main measure quantifying the active utilization of memory in a dynamic system, is only defined for discrete-time processes. While recent theoretical work laid the foundations for the continuous-time analysis of the predictive capacity stored in a process, methods for the effective computation of the related measures are needed to favor widespread utilization on neural data. This work introduces a method for the model-free estimation of the so-called memory utilization rate (MUR), the continuous-time counterpart of the IS, specifically designed to quantify the predictive capacity stored in neural point processes. The method employs nearest-neighbor entropy estimation applied to the inter-spike intervals measured from point-process realizations to quantify the extent of memory used by a spike train. An empirical procedure based on surrogate data is implemented to compensate the estimation bias and detect statistically significant levels of memory. The method is validated in simulated Poisson processes and in realistic models of coupled cortical dynamics and heartbeat dynamics. It is then applied to real spike trains reflecting central and autonomic nervous system activities: in spontaneously growing cortical neuron cultures, the MUR detected increasing memory utilization across maturation stages, associated to emergent bursting synchronized activity; in the study of the neuro-autonomic modulation of human heartbeats, the MUR reflected the sympathetic activation occurring with postural but not with mental stress. The proposed approach offers a computationally reliable tool to analyze spike train data in computational neuroscience and physiology.</description>

      <title>Misspecification-robust likelihood-free inference in high dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.09377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Likelihood-free inference for simulator-based statistical models has developed rapidly from its infancy to a useful tool for practitioners. However, models with more than a handful of parameters still generally remain a challenge for the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) based inference. To advance the possibilities for performing likelihood-free inference in higher dimensional parameter spaces, we introduce an extension of the popular Bayesian optimisation based approach to approximate discrepancy functions in a probabilistic manner which lends itself to an efficient exploration of the parameter space. Our approach achieves computational scalability for higher dimensional parameter spaces by using separate acquisition functions and discrepancies for each parameter. The efficient additive acquisition structure is combined with exponentiated loss -likelihood to provide a misspecification-robust characterisation of the marginal posterior distribution for all model parameters. The method successfully performs computationally efficient inference in a 100-dimensional space on canonical examples and compares favourably to existing modularised ABC methods. We further illustrate the potential of this approach by fitting a bacterial transmission dynamics model to a real data set, which provides biologically coherent results on strain competition in a 30-dimensional parameter space.</description>

      <title>Regularized Step Directions in Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conjugate gradient minimization methods (CGM) and their accelerated variants are widely used. We focus on the use of cubic regularization to improve the CGM direction independent of the step length computation. In this paper, we propose the Hybrid Cubic Regularization of CGM, where regularized steps are used selectively. Using Shanno's reformulation of CGM as a memoryless BFGS method, we derive new formulas for the regularized step direction. We show that the regularized step direction uses the same order of computational burden per iteration as its non-regularized version. Moreover, the Hybrid Cubic Regularization of CGM exhibits global convergence with fewer assumptions. In numerical experiments, the new step directions are shown to require fewer iteration counts, improve runtime, and reduce the need to reset the step direction. Overall, the Hybrid Cubic Regularization of CGM exhibits the same memoryless and matrix-free properties, while outperforming CGM as a memoryless BFGS method in iterations and runtime.</description>
