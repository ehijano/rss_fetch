      <title>Nonequilibrium nonlinear response theory of amplitude-dependent dissipative conductivity in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates amplitude-dependent nonlinear corrections to the dissipative conductivity in superconductors, using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which captures the nonequilibrium dynamics of both quasiparticles and the pair potential. Our rigorous formulation naturally incorporates both the direct nonlinear action of the photon field and indirect contributions mediated by nonequilibrium variations in the pair potential, namely the Eliashberg effect and the Higgs mode. The third-harmonic current, often regarded as a hallmark of the Higgs mode, arises from both the direct photon action and the Higgs mode. Our numerical results are in excellent agreement with previous studies. In contrast, the first-harmonic current, and consequently the dissipative conductivity, receives contributions from all three mechanisms: the direct photon action, the Higgs mode, and the Eliashberg effect. It is shown that that the nonlinear correction to dissipative conductivity can serve as a fingerprint of the Higgs mode, appearing as a resonance peak at a frequency near the superconducting gap \( \Delta \). In addition, our results provide microscopic insight into amplitude-dependent dissipation at frequencies well below \( \Delta \), which is particularly relevant for applied superconducting devices. In particular, the long-standing issue concerning the frequency dependence of the amplitude-dependent quality factor is explained as originating from the direct nonlinear action of the photon field, rather than from contributions by the Higgs mode and the Eliashberg effect. Our practical and explicit expression for the nonlinear conductivity formula makes our results accessible to a broad range of researchers.</description>

      <title>Possible Spin Triplet Pairing due to Altermagnetic Spin Fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between unconventional superconductivity and altermagnetic order has attracted much attentions. In particular, whether spin-triplet superconductivity can be achieved by suppressing altermagnetism remains an open issue. We investigate this issue using a minimal single-orbital Hubbard model on a square lattice with vacancy superstructure, in which both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic order can emerge on equal footing. We illustrate the existence of a metallic normal phase with altermagnetism even at half-filling due to the geometric frustration and Coulomb interaction. Suppressing the altermagnetic long-range order using charge doping can lead to both conventional antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spin fluctuation. The spin-singlet pairing is always favored when the conventional antiferromagnetic spin fluctuation dominates. However, when the altermagnetic spin fluctuation dominates, spin-triplet pairing may be induced. Implications of our results in possible material candidates are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Impact of Disorder on the Superconducting Properties and BCS-BEC Crossover in FeSe Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the crystal structure, transport properties and specific heat in five selected FeSe single crystals containing different amounts of disorder. Transport measurements show that disorder significantly suppresses superconducting transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}$, and upper critical field, $H_\mathrm{c2}$. Specific heat results confirm a robust multi-gap nature, a larger isotropic gap ($\Delta_\mathrm{s}$) and a smaller anisotropic gap ($\Delta_\mathrm{es}$). The smaller gap $\Delta_\mathrm{es}$ becomes more isotropic with increasing disorder. Additionally, FeSe is regarded as a superconductor in the crossover regime from Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) to Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) because of its comparable $\Delta$ and Fermi energy $E_\mathrm{F}$. By introducing disorder, the BCS-BEC crossover in FeSe can be tuned closer to BCS limit, reducing $\Delta/E_\mathrm{F}$ from 1.3 to 0.4.</description>

      <title>Direct evidence for the absence of coupling between shear strain and superconductivity in Sr2RuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting symmetry of Sr2RuO4 has been intensely debated for many years. A crucial controversy recently emerged between shear-mode ultrasound experiments, which suggest a two-component order parameter, and some uniaxial pressure experiments that suggest a one-component order parameter. To resolve this controversy, we use a new approach to directly apply three different kinds of shear strain to single crystals of Sr2RuO4 and investigate the coupling to superconductivity. After characterising the strain by optical imaging, we observe variations of the transition temperature Tc smaller than 10mK/% as measured by low-frequency magnetic susceptibility, indicating that shear strain has little to no coupling to superconductivity. Our results are consistent with a one-component order parameter model, but such a model cannot consistently explain other experimental evidence such as time-reversal symmetry breaking, superconducting domains, and horizontal line nodes, thus calling for alternative interpretations.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the critical state in the ferromagnetic superconductor EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are very few materials in which ferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity due to the destructive effect of the magnetic exchange field on singlet Cooper pairs. The iron-based superconductor EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ is therefore unique in exhibiting robust superconductivity with a maximum critical temperature of 25 K and long-range ferromagnetism below $T_\mathrm{FM}\approx19$ K. Here we report a spatially-resolved study of the irreversible magnetisation in this system that reveals a variety of novel behaviours that are strongly linked with underlying ferromagnetic domain structures. In the superconducting-only state, hysteretic magnetisation due to irreversible vortex motion is consistent with typical weak vortex-pinning behaviour. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$, very narrowly-spaced stripe domains give rise to highly erratic and irreproducible fluctuations in the irreversible magnetisation that we attribute to the dynamics of multi-vortex clusters stabilised by the formation of vortex polarons. In contrast, at lower temperatures, ferromagnetic domains become wider and saturated with spontaneously nucleated vortices and antivortices, leading to a smoother but unconventional evolution of the irreversible state. This observation suggests that the penetrating flux front is roughened by the presence of the magnetic domains in this regime, presenting a clear departure from standard critical state models. Our findings indicate that the mechanism governing irreversibility is strongly influenced by the precise nature of the underlying ferromagnetic domains, being very sensitive to the specific material parameters of EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. We consider the possible microscopic origins of these effects, and suggest further ways to explore novel vortex-domain magnetic behaviours.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>
