      <title>Extremely amenable automorphism groups of countable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we address the question: How many pairwise non-isomorphic extremely amenable groups are there which are seprable metrizable or even Polish? We show that there are continuum many such groups. In fact we construct continuum many pairwise non-isomorphic extremely amenable groups as automorphism groups of countable structures. We also consider this classicfication problem from the point of view of descriptive set theory by showing that the class of all extremely amenable closed subgroups of $S_\infty$ is Borel and by obtaining some lower bounds for their isomorphism relation in the Borel reducibility hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of B\"uchi arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce an axiomatization of B\"uchi arithmetic, i.e., of the elementary theory of natural numbers in the language with addition and function $V_p(a) = p^k$ such that $p^k | a$ and $p^{k + 1} \nmid a$.</description>

      <title>Extending Strongly Ulam Stable Groups and Towards Inductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show some preservation results of amenably extending strongly Ulam stable groups under mild decay assumptions, including quantitative preservation of asymptotic bounds under the assumption that the modulus of stability is H\"older continuous of exponent $s&gt;\frac 1 2$ at 0, utilizing some simplistic integral estimates. Additionally, we show some partial results around inductive preservation of modulus bounds in infinite dimensions using these integral estimates as well as strong quantitative preservation in the finite dimensional case, implying the existence of $\mathfrak{U}$ uniformly stable existential closures among groups with sufficiently large Lipschitz estimates of any countable group.</description>

      <title>A note on Diophantine subsets of large fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large fields (also called ample, anti-mordellic) generalize many fields of classical interest, such as algebraically closed fields, real-closed fields, and $p$-adic fields. In this note we answer a question of Pop by generalizing a result of Fehm and prove that finite unions of affine translates of infinite proper subfields are never diophantine subsets of perfect large fields.</description>

      <title>Two-layered logics for probabilities and belief functions over Belnap--Dunn logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is an extended version of an earlier submission to WoLLIC 2023. We discuss two-layered logics formalising reasoning with probabilities and belief functions that combine the Lukasiewicz $[0,1]$-valued logic with Baaz $\triangle$ operator and the Belnap--Dunn logic. We consider two probabilistic logics that present two perspectives on the probabilities in the Belnap--Dunn logic: $\pm$-probabilities and $\mathbf{4}$-probabilities. In the first case, every event $\phi$ has independent positive and negative measures that denote the likelihoods of $\phi$ and $\neg\phi$, respectively. In the second case, the measures of the events are treated as partitions of the sample into four exhaustive and mutually exclusive parts corresponding to pure belief, pure disbelief, conflict and uncertainty of an agent in $\phi$. In addition to that, we discuss two logics for the paraconsistent reasoning with belief and plausibility functions. They equip events with two measures (positive and negative) with their main difference being whether the negative measure of $\phi$ is defined as the belief in $\neg\phi$ or treated independently as the plausibility of $\neg\phi$. We provide a sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatisation of the logic of $\mathbf{4}$-probabilities and establish faithful translations between it and the logic of $\pm$-probabilities. We also show that the satisfiability problem in all the logics is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Computable one-way functions on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major open problem in computational complexity is the existence of a one-way function, namely a function from strings to strings which is computationally easy to compute but hard to invert. Levin (2023) formulated the notion of one-way functions from reals (infinite bit-sequences) to reals in terms of computability, and asked whether partial computable one-way functions exist. We give a strong positive answer using the hardness of the halting problem and exhibiting a total computable one-way function.</description>
