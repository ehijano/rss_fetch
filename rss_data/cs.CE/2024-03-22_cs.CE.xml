      <title>Modeling and Simulation of Inelastic Effects in Composite Cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work aims at describing hysteresis behaviour arising from cyclic bending experiments on cables by means of the Preisach operator. Pure bending experiments conducted in previous work show that slender structures such as electric cables behave inelastically and open hysteresis loops arise, with noticeable difference between the first load cycle and the following ones. The Preisach operator plays an important role in describing the input-output relation in hysteresis behaviours and it can be expressed as a superposition of relay operators. Here, we utilise data collected from pure bending experiments for a first approach. We introduce a mathematical formulation of the problem, and starting from the curvature of the cable specimen, we recursively define the Preisach plane for this specific case. Therefore, we derive a suitable kernel function in a way that the integration of such function over the Preisach plane results in the bending moment of the specimen.</description>

      <title>Universal Differential Equations as a Common Modeling Language for Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented availability of large-scale datasets in neuroscience has spurred the exploration of artificial deep neural networks (DNNs) both as empirical tools and as models of natural neural systems. Their appeal lies in their ability to approximate arbitrary functions directly from observations, circumventing the need for cumbersome mechanistic modeling. However, without appropriate constraints, DNNs risk producing implausible models, diminishing their scientific value. Moreover, the interpretability of DNNs poses a significant challenge, particularly with the adoption of more complex expressive architectures. In this perspective, we argue for universal differential equations (UDEs) as a unifying approach for model development and validation in neuroscience. UDEs view differential equations as parameterizable, differentiable mathematical objects that can be augmented and trained with scalable deep learning techniques. This synergy facilitates the integration of decades of extensive literature in calculus, numerical analysis, and neural modeling with emerging advancements in AI into a potent framework. We provide a primer on this burgeoning topic in scientific machine learning and demonstrate how UDEs fill in a critical gap between mechanistic, phenomenological, and data-driven models in neuroscience. We outline a flexible recipe for modeling neural systems with UDEs and discuss how they can offer principled solutions to inherent challenges across diverse neuroscience applications such as understanding neural computation, controlling neural systems, neural decoding, and normative modeling.</description>

      <title>DiffSTOCK: Probabilistic relational Stock Market Predictions using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach to generalize denoising diffusion probabilistic models for stock market predictions and portfolio management. Present works have demonstrated the efficacy of modeling interstock relations for market time-series forecasting and utilized Graph-based learning models for value prediction and portfolio management. Though convincing, these deterministic approaches still fall short of handling uncertainties i.e., due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the financial data, it is quite challenging to learn effective deterministic models. Since the probabilistic methods have shown to effectively emulate higher uncertainties for time-series predictions. To this end, we showcase effective utilisation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), to develop an architecture for providing better market predictions conditioned on the historical financial indicators and inter-stock relations. Additionally, we also provide a novel deterministic architecture MaTCHS which uses Masked Relational Transformer(MRT) to exploit inter-stock relations along with historical stock features. We demonstrate that our model achieves SOTA performance for movement predication and Portfolio management.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models such as denoising diffusion models are quickly advancing their ability to approximate highly complex data distributions. They are also increasingly leveraged in scientific machine learning, where samples from the implied data distribution are expected to adhere to specific governing equations. We present a framework to inform denoising diffusion models on underlying constraints on such generated samples during model training. Our approach improves the alignment of the generated samples with the imposed constraints and significantly outperforms existing methods without affecting inference speed. Additionally, our findings suggest that incorporating such constraints during training provides a natural regularization against overfitting. Our framework is easy to implement and versatile in its applicability for imposing equality and inequality constraints as well as auxiliary optimization objectives.</description>

      <title>I-FENN for thermoelasticity based on physics-informed temporal convolutional network (PI-TCN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most currently available methods for modeling multiphysics, including thermoelasticity, using machine learning approaches, are focused on solving complete multiphysics problems using data-driven or physics-informed multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks. Such models rely on incremental step-wise training of the MLPs, and lead to elevated computational expense; they also lack the rigor of existing numerical methods like the finite element method. We propose an integrated finite element neural network (I-FENN) framework to expedite the solution of coupled transient thermoelasticity. A novel physics-informed temporal convolutional network (PI-TCN) is developed and embedded within the finite element framework to leverage the fast inference of neural networks (NNs). The PI-TCN model captures some of the fields in the multiphysics problem; then, the network output is used to compute the other fields of interest using the finite element method. We establish a framework that computationally decouples the energy equation from the linear momentum equation. We first develop a PI-TCN model to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the temperature field across the simulation time based on the energy equation and strain data. The PI-TCN model is integrated into the finite element framework, where the PI-TCN output (temperature) is used to introduce the temperature effect to the linear momentum equation. The finite element problem is solved using the implicit Euler time discretization scheme, resulting in a computational cost comparable to that of a weakly-coupled thermoelasticity problem but with the ability to solve fully-coupled problems. Finally, we demonstrate I-FENN's computational efficiency and generalization capability in thermoelasticity through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>FloodGenome: Interpretable Machine Learning for Decoding Features Shaping Property Flood Risk Predisposition in Cities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental characteristics that shape the inherent flood risk disposition of urban areas is critical for integrated urban design strategies for flood risk reduction. Flood risk disposition specifies an inherent and event-independent magnitude of property flood risk and measures the extent to which urban areas are susceptible to property damage if exposed to a weather hazard. This study presents FloodGenome as an interpretable machine learning model for evaluation of the extent to which various hydrological, topographic, and built-environment features and their interactions shape flood risk disposition in urban areas. Using flood damage claims data from the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program covering the period 2003 through 2023 across four metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), the analysis computes building damage ratios and flood claim counts by employing k-means clustering for classifying census block groups (CBGs) into distinct property flood risk disposition levels. Then a random forest model is created to specify property flood risk levels of CBGs based on various intertwined hydrological, topographic, and built-environment features. The model transferability analysis results show consistent performance across MSAs, revealing the universality of underlying features that shape city property flood risks. The FloodGenome model is then used to:(1) evaluate the extent to which future urban development would exacerbate flood risk disposition of urban areas; and (2) specify property flood risk levels at finer spatial resolution providing critical insights for flood risk management processes. The FloodGenome model and the findings provide novel tools and insights for improving the characterization and understanding of intertwined features that shape flood risk profiles of cities.</description>

      <title>CoQuest: Exploring Research Question Co-Creation with an LLM-based Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing novel research questions (RQs) often requires extensive literature reviews, especially in interdisciplinary fields. To support RQ development through human-AI co-creation, we leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to build an LLM-based agent system named CoQuest. We conducted an experiment with 20 HCI researchers to examine the impact of two interaction designs: breadth-first and depth-first RQ generation. The findings revealed that participants perceived the breadth-first approach as more creative and trustworthy upon task completion. Conversely, during the task, participants considered the depth-first generated RQs as more creative. Additionally, we discovered that AI processing delays allowed users to reflect on multiple RQs simultaneously, leading to a higher quantity of generated RQs and an enhanced sense of control. Our work makes both theoretical and practical contributions by proposing and evaluating a mental model for human-AI co-creation of RQs. We also address potential ethical issues, such as biases and over-reliance on AI, advocating for using the system to improve human research creativity rather than automating scientific inquiry.</description>
