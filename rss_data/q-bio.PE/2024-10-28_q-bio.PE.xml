      <title>The replacement number dynamics in SIR-type epidemic models I: From SSISS to RND picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In SIR-type epidemic models time derivative of prevalence $I$ can always be cast into the form $\dot{I}=(X-1)I$, where $X$ is the replacement number and recovery rate is normalized to one. Assuming $\dot{X}=f(X,I)$ for some smooth function $f$ defines a "replacement number dynamics" (RND). Choosing transmission coefficients $\beta_1&gt;\beta_2$, any such system uniquely maps to an isomorphic "SSISS model", i.e. an abstract SIR-type 3-compartment model. Extending to negative values $\beta_i&lt;0$ takes care of demographic dynamics with compartment dependent birth and death rates. Fixing $f$ and varying $\beta_i$ generates a family of isomorphic SSISS systems, the "SSISS fiber" $\cal{F}(f)$}. A symmetry group $G_\sigma$ acts freely and transitively on fibers $\cal{F}(f)$, so SSISS systems become a principal $G_\sigma$-fiber bundle over the space of RND systems. Choosing two specific 6-parameter polynomials $f$ at most quadratic in $(X,I)$ covers a large class of models in the literature, with in total up to 17 (largely redundant!) parameters, including also reactive social behavior models. Epidemiological admissibility conditions guarantee forward boundedness and absence of periodic solutions in all these models. Part II of this work will prove existence and stability properties of endemic equilibria, which in RND picture simply boils down to analyzing zeros of the parabolas $f|_{I=0}$ and $f|_{X=1}$. This will cover and extend well known results for a wide range of models by a unifying approach while also closing some open issues in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hypothalamic expression analysis of m6A RNA methylation associated genes suggests a potential role of epitransciptomics in sexual maturation of Atlantic salmon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Better understanding the molecular processes contributing to variation in maturation timing is important for Atlantic salmon aquaculture, as early maturation causes considerable financial losses. The m6A RNA methylation is a conserved and dynamically reversible mechanism controlling gene expression in a myriad of biological processes. The role of m6A methylation in sexual maturation, however, has remained largely unexplored and has never been studied in Atlantic salmon. While the maturation process is known to be affected by many genetic and environmental factors, the molecular mechanisms causing variation in the timing of maturation are still poorly understood. Hence, investigation of whether a widespread mechanism like m6A methylation could be involved in controlling of the maturation timing is warranted. In salmon, two genes, also associated with age at maturity in humans, vgll3 and six6, have been shown to play an important role in maturation timing. In this study, we investigated the expression of 16 genes involved in the regulation of m6A RNA methylation in the hypothalamus of Atlantic salmon with different homozygous combinations of late and early alleles for vgll3 and six6 genes. We found differential expression of ythdf2.2, an m6A reader promoting mRNA degradation, with higher expression in six6*LL compared to other genotypes as well as in immature compared to mature males. In addition, we found that the expression levels of genes coding for an eraser, alkbh5, and for a reader, ythdf1, were higher in the hypothalamus of females than in males across all the different genotypes studied. However the total m6A levels between the whole hypothalamus of males and females were similar. Our results indicate a potential role of the m6A methylation process in sexual maturation of salmon, and provide the first evidence for such regulatory mechanism in the hypothalamus of any vertebrate</description>

      <title>Evolution with Opponent-Learning Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are usually constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. In this paper, we study how large heterogeneous populations of learning agents evolve in normal-form games. We show how, under assumptions commonly made in the multi-armed bandit literature, Multi-Agent Policy Gradient closely resembles the Replicator Dynamic, and we further derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Opponent-Learning Awareness tailored for evolutionary simulations. This enables us to simulate the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. We demonstrate our approach in simulations of 200,000 agents, evolving in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game highlights distinct ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects evolution.</description>
