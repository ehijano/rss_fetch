      <title>Open modular functors from non-finite tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a compact rigid balanced braided monoidal category with enough compact projective objects gives rise to a system of mapping class group representations compatible with the gluing along marked intervals. A motivation to consider non-finite tensor categories is the theory of vertex operator algebras where such categories arise as categories of modules. The mapping class group representations presented in this article admit a factorization homology description. In other words, they are of three-dimensional origin and hence obey a holographic principle. A compact projective symmetric Frobenius algebra endows the representations with a pointing that is mapping class group invariant and compatible with the gluing along intervals. This shows that, at least to some extent, many of the tools for the construction and study of spaces of conformal blocks and correlators remain available in a non-finite, but rigid setting.</description>

      <title>On the Quantization-Dequantization Correspondence for (co)Poisson Hopf Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a functorial quantization of (co)Poisson Hopf algebras within a broad categorical framework. We further introduce categories naturally associated with (co)Poisson Hopf algebras, namely Drinfeld-Yetter modules. These categories provide a canonical setting in which we define explicit dequantization functors that are inverse to the quantization functors. Using this framework, we also establish functorial (de)quantization results for the corresponding module categories. Finally, we recover the classical results of Etingof and Kazhdan as special cases of our construction and discuss applications to deformation quantization \`a la Tamarkin.</description>

      <title>Semiseparability of induction functors in a monoidal category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any algebra morphism in a monoidal category, we provide sufficient conditions (which are also necessary if the unit is a left tensor generator) for the attached induction functor being semiseparable. Under mild assumptions, we prove that the semiseparability of the induction functor is preserved if one applies a lax monoidal functor. Similar results are shown for the coinduction functors attached to coalgebra morphisms in a monoidal category. As an application, we study the semiseparability of combinations of (co)induction functors in the context of duoidal categories.</description>

      <title>Two invariant subalgebras of rational Cherednik algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Originally motivated by connections to integrable systems, two natural subalgebras of the rational Cherednik algebra have been considered in the literature. The first is the subalgebra of all degree zero elements and the second is the Dunkl angular momentum subalgebra. In this article, we study the ring-theoretic and homological properties of these algebras. Our approach is to realise them as rings of invariants under the action of certain reductive subgroups of $\rm SL_2$. This allows us to describe their centres. Moreover, we show that they are Auslander-Gorenstein and Cohen-Macaulay and, at $t = 0$, give rise to prime PI-algebras whose PI-degree we compute. Since the degree zero subalgebra can be realized as the ring of invariants for the maximal torus $\rm T \subset SL_2$ and the action of this torus on the rational Cherednik algebra is Hamiltonian, we also consider its (quantum) Hamiltonian reduction with respect to $\rm T$. At $t = 1$, the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of the spherical subalgebra is a filtered quantization of the quotient of the minimal nilpotent orbit closure $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}$ in ${\mathfrak gl}(n)$ by the reflection group $W$. At $t = 0$, we get a graded Poisson deformation of the symplectic singularity $\overline{\mathcal O}_{\min}/W$.</description>

      <title>Quantum spheres as Leavitt path algebras: Quivers with Quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study Leavitt path algebras over quivers with relations such as quantum Yang-Baxter equation, Hecke condition, and RTT conditions. This construction allows us to produce examples of Leavitt path algebras that contain quantum matrix algebra as subalgebra and obtain an algebraic analogue of the Hong-Szyma\'{n}ski result. In particular, we show that the coordinate algebra over odd-dimensional Vaksman-Soibelman quantum sphere can be realized as the Zhang twist of a Leavitt path algebra over a quiver with such relations. Furthermore, we show that the quantum Yang-Baxter equation, and Hecke condition for our RTT construction can be generated intrinsically from the adjacency matrix of certain quivers.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description>

      <title>The center of the BMW algebras and an Okounkov-Vershik like approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Jucys-Murphy elements of the BMW algebra to show that its center over the complex numbers for almost all parameters making it semisimple is given by Wheel Laurent polynomials, a subalgebra of the symmetric Laurent polynomials in the JM elements. As an application, we give an Okounkov-Vershik like approach to its finite dimensional representations. In the non semisimple case related to the type B Lie algebras, the central subalgebra of Wheel Laurent polynomials is large enough to separate blocks of the BMW algebras.</description>
