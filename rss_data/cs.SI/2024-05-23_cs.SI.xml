      <title>KPG: Key Propagation Graph Generator for Rumor Detection based on Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of rumors on social media platforms during significant events, such as the US elections and the COVID-19 pandemic, has a profound impact on social stability and public health. Existing approaches for rumor detection primarily rely on propagation graphs to enhance model effectiveness. However, the presence of noisy and irrelevant structures during the propagation process limits the efficacy of these approaches. To tackle this issue, techniques such as weight adjustment and data augmentation have been proposed. However, these techniques heavily depend on rich original propagation structures, thus hindering performance when dealing with rumors that lack sufficient propagation information in the early propagation stages. In this paper, we propose Key Propagation Graph Generator (KPG), a novel reinforcement learning-based rumor detection framework that generates contextually coherent and informative propagation patterns for events with insufficient topology information, while also identifies indicative substructures for events with redundant and noisy propagation structures. KPG consists of two key components: the Candidate Response Generator (CRG) and the Ending Node Selector (ENS). CRG learns the latent distribution from refined propagation patterns, filtering out noise and generating new candidates for ENS. Simultaneously, ENS identifies the most influential substructures within propagation graphs and generates training data for CRG. Moreover, we introduce an end-to-end framework that utilizes rewards to guide the entire training process via a pre-trained graph neural network. Extensive experiments conducted on four datasets demonstrate the superiority of our KPG compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>GNN-based Anomaly Detection for Encoded Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The early research report explores the possibility of using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for anomaly detection in internet traffic data enriched with information. While recent studies have made significant progress in using GNNs for anomaly detection in finance, multivariate time-series, and biochemistry domains, there is limited research in the context of network flow data. In this report, we explore the idea that leverages information-enriched features extracted from network flow packet data to improve the performance of GNN in anomaly detection. The idea is to utilize feature encoding (binary, numerical, and string) to capture the relationships between the network components, allowing the GNN to learn latent relationships and better identify anomalies.</description>

      <title>A generative model for community types in directed networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large complex networks are often organized into groups or communities. In this paper, we introduce and investigate a generative model of network evolution that reproduces all four pairwise community types that exist in directed networks: assortative, core-periphery, disassortative, and the newly introduced source-basin type. We fix the number of nodes and the community membership of each node, allowing node connectivity to change through rewiring mechanisms that depend on the community membership of the involved nodes. We determine the dependence of the community relationship on the model parameters using a mean-field solution. It reveals that a difference in the swap probabilities of the two communities is a necessary condition to obtain a core-periphery relationship and that a difference in the average in-degree of the communities is a necessary condition for a source-basin relationship. More generally, our analysis reveals multiple possible scenarios for the transition between the different structure types, and sheds light on the mechanisms underlying the observation of the different types of communities in network data.</description>

      <title>Graphlets correct for the topological information missed by random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walks are widely used for mining networks due to the computational efficiency of computing them. For instance, graph representation learning learns a d-dimensional embedding space, so that the nodes that tend to co-occur on random walks (a proxy of being in the same network neighborhood) are close in the embedding space. Specific local network topology (i.e., structure) influences the co-occurrence of nodes on random walks, so random walks of limited length capture only partial topological information, hence diminishing the performance of downstream methods. We explicitly capture all topological neighborhood information and improve performance by introducing orbit adjacencies that quantify the adjacencies of two nodes as co-occurring on a given pair of graphlet orbits, which are symmetric positions on graphlets (small, connected, non-isomorphic, induced subgraphs of a large network). Importantly, we mathematically prove that random walks on up to k nodes capture only a subset of all the possible orbit adjacencies for up to k-node graphlets. Furthermore, we enable orbit adjacency-based analysis of networks by developing an efficient GRaphlet-orbit ADjacency COunter (GRADCO), which exhaustively computes all 28 orbit adjacency matrices for up to four-node graphlets. Note that four-node graphlets suffice, because real networks are usually small-world. In large networks on around 20,000 nodes, GRADCOcomputesthe28matricesinminutes. Onsixrealnetworksfromvarious domains, we compare the performance of node-label predictors obtained by using the network embeddings based on our orbit adjacencies to those based on random walks. We find that orbit adjacencies, which include those unseen by random walks, outperform random walk-based adjacencies, demonstrating the importance of the inclusion of the topological neighborhood information that is unseen by random walks.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Rare Inflammatory Disease Using Large Language Models and Social Media Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas in various organs. The disease presents diagnostic and treatment challenges due to its diverse manifestations and unpredictable nature. In this study, we employed a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze sarcoidosis-related discussions on the social media platform Reddit. Our findings underscore the efficacy of LLMs in accurately identifying sarcoidosis-related content. We discovered a wide array of symptoms reported by patients, with fatigue, swollen lymph nodes, and shortness of breath as the most prevalent. Prednisone was the most prescribed medication, while infliximab showed the highest effectiveness in improving prognoses. Notably, our analysis revealed disparities in prognosis based on age and gender, with women and younger patients experiencing good and polarized outcomes, respectively. Furthermore, unsupervised clustering identified three distinct patient subgroups (phenotypes) with unique symptom profiles, prognostic outcomes, and demographic distributions. Finally, sentiment analysis revealed a moderate negative impact on patients' mental health post-diagnosis, particularly among women and younger individuals. Our study represents the first application of LLMs to understand sarcoidosis through social media data. It contributes to understanding the disease by providing data-driven insights into its manifestations, treatments, prognoses, and impact on patients' lives. Our findings have direct implications for improving personalized treatment strategies and enhancing the quality of care for individuals living with sarcoidosis.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method for News Article Event-Based Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding news articles is a crucial tool for multiple fields, such as media bias detection, identifying fake news, and news recommendations. However, existing news embedding methods are not optimized for capturing the latent context of news events. In many cases, news embedding methods rely on full-textual information and neglect the importance of time-relevant embedding generation. Here, we aim to address these shortcomings by presenting a novel lightweight method that optimizes news embedding generation by focusing on the entities and themes mentioned in the articles and their historical connections to specific events. We suggest a method composed of three stages. First, we process and extract the events, entities, and themes for the given news articles. Second, we generate periodic time embeddings for themes and entities by training timely separated GloVe models on current and historical data. Lastly, we concatenate the news embeddings generated by two distinct approaches: Smooth Inverse Frequency (SIF) for article-level vectors and Siamese Neural Networks for embeddings with nuanced event-related information. To test and evaluate our method, we leveraged over 850,000 news articles and 1,000,000 events from the GDELT project. For validation purposes, we conducted a comparative analysis of different news embedding generation methods, applying them twice to a shared event detection task - first on articles published within the same day and subsequently on those published within the same month. Our experiments show that our method significantly improves the Precision-Recall (PR) AUC across all tasks and datasets. Specifically, we observed an average PR AUC improvement of 2.15% and 2.57% compared to SIF, as well as 2.57% and 2.43% compared to the semi-supervised approach for daily and monthly shared event detection tasks, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the relationship between informational support seeking questions, responses, and helpfulness ratings in online health communities. We created a labeled data set of question-response pairs and developed multimodal machine learning and deep learning models to reliably predict informational support questions and responses. We employed explainable AI to reveal the emotions embedded in informational support exchanges, demonstrating the importance of emotion in providing informational support. This complex interplay between emotional and informational support has not been previously researched. The study refines social support theory and lays the groundwork for the development of user decision aids. Further implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Integrating behavioral experimental findings into dynamical models to inform social change interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing global challenges -- from public health to climate change -- often involves stimulating the large-scale adoption of new products or behaviors. Research traditions that focus on individual decision making suggest that achieving this objective requires better identifying the drivers of individual adoption choices. On the other hand, computational approaches rooted in complexity science focus on maximizing the propagation of a given product or behavior throughout social networks of interconnected adopters. The integration of these two perspectives -- although advocated by several research communities -- has remained elusive so far. Here we show how achieving this integration could inform seeding policies to facilitate the large-scale adoption of a given behavior or product. Drawing on complex contagion and discrete choice theories, we propose a method to estimate individual-level thresholds to adoption, and validate its predictive power in two choice experiments. By integrating the estimated thresholds into computational simulations, we show that state-of-the-art seeding methods for social influence maximization might be suboptimal if they neglect individual-level behavioral drivers, which can be corrected through the proposed experimental method.</description>

      <title>A Privacy Measure Turned Upside Down? Investigating the Use of HTTP Client Hints on the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HTTP client hints are a set of standardized HTTP request headers designed to modernize and potentially replace the traditional user agent string. While the user agent string exposes a wide range of information about the client's browser and device, client hints provide a controlled and structured approach for clients to selectively disclose their capabilities and preferences to servers. Essentially, client hints aim at more effective and privacy-friendly disclosure of browser or client properties than the user agent string.
  We present a first long-term study of the use of HTTP client hints in the wild. We found that despite being implemented in almost all web browsers, server-side usage of client hints remains generally low. However, in the context of third-party websites, which are often linked to trackers, the adoption rate is significantly higher. This is concerning because client hints allow the retrieval of more data from the client than the user agent string provides, and there are currently no mechanisms for users to detect or control this potential data leakage. Our work provides valuable insights for web users, browser vendors, and researchers by exposing potential privacy violations via client hints and providing help in developing remediation strategies as well as further research.</description>

      <title>Attitudes Towards Migration in a COVID-19 Context: Testing a Behavioral Immune System Hypothesis with Twitter Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 outbreak implied many changes in the daily life of most of the world's population for a long time, prompting severe restrictions on sociality. The Behavioral Immune System (BIS) suggests that when facing pathogens, a psychological mechanism would be activated that, among other things, would generate an increase in prejudice and discrimination towards marginalized groups, including immigrants. This study aimed to test if people tend to enhance their rejection of minorities and foreign groups under the threat of contagious diseases, using the users' attitudes towards migrants in Twitter data from Chile, for pre-pandemic and pandemic contexts. Our results only partially support the BIS hypothesis, since threatened users increased their tweet production in the pandemic period, compared to empathetic users, but the latter grew in number and also increased the reach of their tweets between the two periods. We also found differences in the use of language between these types of users. Alternative explanations for these results may be context-dependent.</description>

      <title>Scalable Community Detection in Massive Networks Using Aggregated Relational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB) is a popular Bayesian network model for community detection. Fitting such large Bayesian network models quickly becomes computationally infeasible when the number of nodes grows into hundreds of thousands and millions. In this paper we propose a novel mini-batch strategy based on aggregated relational data that leverages nodal information to fit MMSB to massive networks. We describe a scalable inference method that can utilize nodal information that often accompanies real-world networks. Conditioning on this extra information leads to a model that admits a parallel stochastic variational inference algorithm, utilizing stochastic gradients of bipartite graph formed from aggregated network ties between node subpopulations. We apply our method to a citation network with over two million nodes and 25 million edges, capturing explainable structure in this network. Our method recovers parameters and achieves better convergence on simulated networks generated according to the MMSB.</description>

Abstract: We consider the following problem : we have a high-resolution street network of a given city, and low-resolution measurements of traffic within this city. We want to associate to each measurement the set of streets corresponding to the observed traffic. To do so, we take benefit of specific properties of these data to match measured links to links in the street network. We propose several success criteria for the obtained matching. They show that the matching algorithm generally performs very well, and they give complementary ways to detect data discrepancies that makes any matching highly dubious.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models Help Reveal Unhealthy Diet and Body Concerns in Online Eating Disorders Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eating disorders (ED), a severe mental health condition with high rates of mortality and morbidity, affect millions of people globally, especially adolescents. The proliferation of online communities that promote and normalize ED has been linked to this public health crisis. However, identifying harmful communities is challenging due to the use of coded language and other obfuscations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to surface implicit attitudes of online communities by adapting large language models (LLMs) to the language of the community. We describe an alignment method and evaluate results along multiple dimensions of semantics and affect. We then use the community-aligned LLM to respond to psychometric questionnaires designed to identify ED in individuals. We demonstrate that LLMs can effectively adopt community-specific perspectives and reveal significant variations in eating disorder risks in different online communities. These findings highlight the utility of LLMs to reveal implicit attitudes and collective mindsets of communities, offering new tools for mitigating harmful content on social media.</description>

Abstract: The growing reliance on online services underscores the crucial role of recommendation systems, especially on social media platforms seeking increased user engagement. This study investigates how recommendation systems influence the impact of personal behavioral traits on social network dynamics. It explores the interplay between homophily, users' openness to novel ideas, and recommendation-driven exposure to new opinions. Additionally, the research examines the impact of recommendation systems on the diversity of newly generated ideas, shedding light on the challenges and opportunities in designing effective systems that balance the exploration of new ideas with the risk of reinforcing biases or filtering valuable, unconventional concepts.</description>

      <title>X-posing Free Speech: Examining the Impact of Moderation Relaxation on Online Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of free speech and the relaxation of moderation on online social media platforms using Elon Musk's takeover of Twitter as a case study. By curating a dataset of over 10 million tweets, our study employs a novel framework combining content and network analysis. Our findings reveal a significant increase in the distribution of certain forms of hate content, particularly targeting the LGBTQ+ community and liberals. Network analysis reveals the formation of cohesive hate communities facilitated by influential bridge users, with substantial growth in interactions hinting at increased hate production and diffusion. By tracking the temporal evolution of PageRank, we identify key influencers, primarily self-identified far-right supporters disseminating hate against liberals and woke culture. Ironically, embracing free speech principles appears to have enabled hate speech against the very concept of freedom of expression and free speech itself. Our findings underscore the delicate balance platforms must strike between open expression and robust moderation to curb the proliferation of hate online.</description>

      <title>Learning Social Graph for Inactive User Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288</link>

Abstract: Social relations have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity problem. However, raw social relations don't always benefit recommendation due to their inferior quality and insufficient quantity, especially for inactive users, whose interacted items are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation method called LSIR (\textbf{L}earning \textbf{S}ocial Graph for \textbf{I}nactive User \textbf{R}ecommendation) that learns an optimal social graph structure for social recommendation, especially for inactive users. LSIR recursively aggregates user and item embeddings to collaboratively encode item and user features. Then, graph structure learning (GSL) is employed to refine the raw user-user social graph, by removing noisy edges and adding new edges based on the enhanced embeddings. Meanwhile, mimic learning is implemented to guide active users in mimicking inactive users during model training, which improves the construction of new edges for inactive users. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LSIR achieves significant improvements of up to 129.58\% on NDCG in inactive user recommendation.

      <title>Election Polls on Social Media: Prevalence, Biases, and Voter Fraud Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms allow users to create polls to gather public opinion on diverse topics. However, we know little about what such polls are used for and how reliable they are, especially in significant contexts like elections. Focusing on the 2020 presidential elections in the U.S., this study shows that outcomes of election polls on Twitter deviate from election results despite their prevalence. Leveraging demographic inference and statistical analysis, we find that Twitter polls are disproportionately authored by older males and exhibit a large bias towards candidate Donald Trump relative to representative mainstream polls. We investigate potential sources of biased outcomes from the point of view of inauthentic, automated, and counter-normative behavior. Using social media experiments and interviews with poll authors, we identify inconsistencies between public vote counts and those privately visible to poll authors, with the gap potentially attributable to purchased votes. We also find that Twitter accounts participating in election polls are more likely to be bots, and election poll outcomes tend to be more biased, before the election day than after. Finally, we identify instances of polls spreading voter fraud conspiracy theories and estimate that a couple thousand of such polls were posted in 2020. The study discusses the implications of biased election polls in the context of transparency and accountability of social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Combining Twitter and Mobile Phone Data to Observe Border-Rush: The Turkish-European Border Opening</title>

Abstract: Following Turkey's 2020 decision to revoke border controls, many individuals journeyed towards the Greek, Bulgarian, and Turkish borders. However, the lack of verifiable statistics on irregular migration and discrepancies between media reports and actual migration patterns require further exploration. The objective of this study is to bridge this knowledge gap by harnessing novel data sources, specifically mobile phone and Twitter data, to construct estimators of cross-border mobility and to cultivate a qualitative comprehension of the unfolding events. By employing a migration diplomacy framework, we analyse emergent mobility patterns at the border. Our findings demonstrate the potential of mobile phone data for quantitative metrics and Twitter data for qualitative understanding. We underscore the ethical implications of leveraging Big Data, particularly considering the vulnerability of the population under study. This underscores the imperative for exhaustive research into the socio-political facets of human mobility, with the aim of discerning the potentialities, limitations, and risks inherent in these data sources and their integration. This scholarly endeavour contributes to a more nuanced understanding of migration dynamics and paves the way for the formulation of regulations that preclude misuse and oppressive surveillance, thereby ensuring a more accurate representation of migration realities.</description>

      <title>Translating Subgraphs to Nodes Makes Simple GNNs Strong and Efficient for Subgraph Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04510v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Subgraph representation learning has emerged as an important problem, but it is by default approached with specialized graph neural networks on a large global graph. These models demand extensive memory and computational resources but challenge modeling hierarchical structures of subgraphs. In this paper, we propose Subgraph-To-Node (S2N) translation, a novel formulation for learning representations of subgraphs. Specifically, given a set of subgraphs in the global graph, we construct a new graph by coarsely transforming subgraphs into nodes. Demonstrating both theoretical and empirical evidence, S2N not only significantly reduces memory and computational costs compared to state-of-the-art models but also outperforms them by capturing both local and global structures of the subgraph. By leveraging graph coarsening methods, our method outperforms baselines even in a data-scarce setting with insufficient subgraphs. Our experiments on eight benchmarks demonstrate that fined-tuned models with S2N translation can process 183 -- 711 times more subgraph samples than state-of-the-art models at a better or similar performance level.</description>

      <title>Visiting Distant Neighbors in Graph Convolutional Networks</title>

Abstract: We extend the graph convolutional network method for deep learning on graph data to higher order in terms of neighboring nodes. In order to construct representations for a node in a graph, in addition to the features of the node and its immediate neighboring nodes, we also include more distant nodes in the calculations. In experimenting with a number of publicly available citation graph datasets, we show that this higher order neighbor visiting pays off by outperforming the original model especially when we have a limited number of available labeled data points for the training of the model.</description>

      <title>Omitted Labels in Causality: A Study of Paradoxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore what we call ``omitted label contexts,'' in which training data is limited to a subset of the possible labels. This setting is common among specialized human experts or specific focused studies. We lean on well-studied paradoxes (Simpson's and Condorcet) to illustrate the more general difficulties of causal inference in omitted label contexts. Contrary to the fundamental principles on which much of causal inference is built, we show that ``correct'' adjustments sometimes require non-exchangeable treatment and control groups. These pitfalls lead us to the study networks of conclusions drawn from different contexts and the structures the form, proving an interesting connection between these networks and social choice theory.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks with Diverse Spectral Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in graph machine learning, with polynomial filters applied for graph convolutions, where all nodes share the identical filter weights to mine their local contexts. Despite the success, existing spectral GNNs usually fail to deal with complex networks (e.g., WWW) due to such homogeneous spectral filtering setting that ignores the regional heterogeneity as typically seen in real-world networks. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel diverse spectral filtering (DSF) framework, which automatically learns node-specific filter weights to exploit the varying local structure properly. Particularly, the diverse filter weights consist of two components -- A global one shared among all nodes, and a local one that varies along network edges to reflect node difference arising from distinct graph parts -- to balance between local and global information. As such, not only can the global graph characteristics be captured, but also the diverse local patterns can be mined with awareness of different node positions. Interestingly, we formulate a novel optimization problem to assist in learning diverse filters, which also enables us to enhance any spectral GNNs with our DSF framework. We showcase the proposed framework on three state-of-the-arts including GPR-GNN, BernNet, and JacobiConv. Extensive experiments over 10 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework can consistently boost model performance by up to 4.92% in node classification tasks, producing diverse filters with enhanced interpretability.
