      <title>Teachers' Experiences with Implementing Open-ended Labs in High School Physics Classe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although most teachers acknowledge the importance of taking investigative approached in students' science learning experiences, implementing them in high-school classes can be challenging for teachers. In this work, we analyzed data from multiple sources from a teaching Community of Practice (CoP) to investigate (a) barriers to using open-ended labs in physics classes, (b) shifts in teachers' beliefs about the use of open-ended labs in their classes during teachers' engagement in a physics teacher CoP in a partnership program, and (c) a case study of one teachers whose shifts in perceptions about open-ended labs led to her successful implementation of an open-ended lab in her class. The findings confirm the existence of well-known psychological and structural barriers that can prevent teachers from adopting investigative approaches in teaching physics labs. Moreover, we learned how the interaction of these barriers further complicates the adoption of open-ended approaches in physics classes. The study also revealed a significant gap between teachers' current practices and their desired method for conducting labs, particularly in terms of structured versus open-ended approaches. The case study offered deeper insights into how shifts in teaching practices occur through changes in perceptions within a supportive CoP.</description>

      <title>Conceptualization and Quantitative study of Aesthetic and Affective Perception of Pictures in Physics Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pictures in physics education go beyond instructional functions and serve affective roles, such as attracting attention, creating fascination, and fostering engagement with the depicted content. Recognizing the importance of these affective functions highlights the need to understand and utilize aesthetic pictures in a research-based educational environment. Prior research suggests that aesthetic and affective attractiveness in pictures enhances enjoyment and engagement with the physics content. This paper offers three main contributions: Firstly, it conceptualizes and presents research-based criteria for selecting pictures perceived as aesthetically pleasing, drawing on insights from psychology and physics education research. Following these criteria, aesthetic pictures related to a given curricular content can be selected. Secondly, the paper applies these criteria to selecting pictures showing geometrical optics. It then delves into an evaluation of students' aesthetic and affective perception of the selected pictures. A validated instrument measured these responses, showing strong reliability (aesthetic perception: $\alpha_C$ = 0.87 [0.85, 0.89]; affective perception: $\alpha_C$ = 0.82 [0.80, 0.85]). Thirdly, it combines decorative and instructional functions in tasks and compares students' perceptions of aesthetic pictures (AP) and classroom experiment pictures (CEP) in junior high school ($N$ = 118), using a crossover design. Results indicated significantly better aesthetic and affective evaluations for APs, with large effect sizes (AP vs. CEP, aesthetic and affective perception: $d$ = 1.05 - 1.56 and 0.85 - 1.48, respectively). We conclude that the here developed and investigated criteria are useful for selecting aesthetic and affective pictures. This provides a basis for further leveraging their educational potential to create fascination and engagement in science education.</description>
