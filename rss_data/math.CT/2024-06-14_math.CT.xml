      <title>The higher algebra of weighted colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theory of weighted colimits in the framework of weakly bi-enriched $\infty$-categories, an extension of Lurie's notion of enriched $\infty$-categories. We prove an existence result for weighted colimits, study weighted colimits of diagrams of enriched functors, express weighted colimits via enriched coends, characterize the enriched $\infty$-category of enriched presheaves as the free cocompletion under weighted colimits and develop a theory of universally adjoining weighted colimits to an enriched $\infty$-category. We use the latter technique to construct for every presentably $\mathbb{E}_{k+1}$-monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{V}$ for $1 \leq k \leq \infty$ and class $\mathcal{H}$ of $\mathcal{V}$-weights, with respect to which weighted colimits are defined, a presentably $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal structure on the $\infty$-category of $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories that admit $\mathcal{H}$-weighted colimits. Varying $\mathcal{H}$ this $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal structure interpolates between the tensor product for $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories and the relative tensor product for $\infty$-categories presentably left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$. As an application we prove that forming $\mathcal{V}$-enriched presheaves is $\mathbb{E}_k$-monoidal, construct a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched version of Day-convolution and give a new construction of the tensor product for $\infty$-categories presentably left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$ as a $\mathcal{V}$-enriched localization of Day-convolution. As further applications we construct a tensor product for Cauchy-complete $\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories, a tensor product for $(\infty,2)$-categories with (op)lax colimits and a tensor product for stable $(\infty,n)$-categories.</description>

      <title>Skein Categories in Non-semisimple Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a version of skein categories which depends on a tensor ideal in a ribbon category, thereby extending the existing theory to the setting of non-semisimple TQFTs. We obtain modified notions of skein algebras of surfaces and skein modules of 3-cobordisms for non-semisimple ribbon categories. We prove that these skein categories built from ideals coincide with factorization homology, shedding new light on the similarities and differences between the semisimple and non-semisimple settings. As a consequence, we get a skein-theoretic description of factorization homology for a large class of balanced braided categories in Pr, precisely all those which are expected to induce an oriented categorified 3-TQFT.</description>

      <title>The index in $d$-exact categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from its original definition in module categories with respect to projective modules, the index has played an important role in various aspects of homological algebra, categorification of cluster algebras and $K$-theory. In the last few years, the notion of index has been generalised to several different contexts in (higher) homological algebra, typically with respect to a (higher) cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of the relevant ambient category $\mathcal{C}$. The recent tools of extriangulated and higher-exangulated categories have permitted some conditions on the subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ to be relaxed. In this paper, we introduce the index with respect to a generating, contravariantly finite subcategory of a $d$-exact category that has $d$-kernels. We show that our index has the important property of being additive on $d$-exact sequences up to an error term.</description>

      <title>Projection algebras and free projection- and idempotent-generated regular $*$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new family of semigroups - the free projection-generated regular $*$-semigroups - and initiate their systematic study. Such a semigroup $PG(P)$ is constructed from a projection algebra $P$, using the recent groupoid approach to regular $*$-semigroups. The assignment $P\mapsto PG(P)$ is a left adjoint to the forgetful functor that maps a regular $*$-semigroup $S$ to its projection algebra $P(S)$. In fact, the category of projection algebras is coreflective in the category of regular $*$-semigroups. The algebra $P(S)$ uniquely determines the biordered structure of the idempotents $E(S)$, up to isomorphism, and this leads to a category equivalence between projection algebras and regular $*$-biordered sets. As a consequence, $PG(P)$ can be viewed as a quotient of the classical free idempotent-generated (regular) semigroups $IG(E)$ and $RIG(E)$, where $E=E(PG(P))$; this is witnessed by a number of presentations in terms of generators and defining relations. The semigroup $PG(P)$ can also be viewed as the fundamental groupoid of a simplicial complex explicitly constructed from $P$. The theory is then illustrated on a number of examples. In one direction, the free construction applied to the projection algebras of adjacency semigroups yields a new family of graph-based path semigroups. In another, it turns out that, remarkably, the Temperley-Lieb monoid $TL_n$ is the free regular $*$-semigroup over its own projection algebra $P(TL_n)$.</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>
