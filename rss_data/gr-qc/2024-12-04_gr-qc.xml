      <title>On static and rotating decoupled black holes without inner horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through gravitational decoupling using the extended minimal geometric deformation, a new family of static and rotating ``hairy'' black holes is provided. The background of these models is a generic Schwarzschild metric containing as special cases, the Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-dS, Reissner-Nordstrom and Reissner-Nordstrom-dS black holes. Assuming the Kerr-Schild condition and a general equation of state, the unknown matter sector is solved given rise to black hole space-times without a Cauchy horizon, transforming the original time-like singularity of the Reissner-Nordstrom and Reissner-Nordstrom-dS black holes into a space-like singularity. This fact is preserved for the rotating version of all these solutions.</description>

      <title>Solar GES-structure modified with EiBI gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the post-Newtonian era, the Eddington-inspired Born-Infeld (EiBI) theory, considered as an improved modification of the Einsteinian general relativity formalism in the weak field regime (non-relativistic), has enabled us to study the dynamics of dense astroobjects in light of the modified gravitational effects. This EiBI theory imparts a new shape to the usual gravitational Poisson equation through the addition of a cosmological correction factor, termed as the EiBI gravity parameter. A systematic inclusion of this gravity in the basic structure equation could lead to a realistic picture of the existing solar models free from any end-stage singularity. A theoretic model is accordingly proposed to investigate the effect of the EiBI gravity on the Gravito-Electrostatic Sheath (GES) formalism of the equilibrium solar plasma structure. This study shows that the GES-based solar plasma dynamics is noticeably modified against the previously reported Newtonian GES-model studies. An equilibrium bounded solution for the solar self-gravity shows the EiBI-modified solar surface boundary (SSB) to exist at a new helio-centric radial location $\xi = 4$ (on the Jeansean scale). It is found that the EiBI gravity shifts the present SSB outwards by 14.28% relative to the original Newtonian SSB. The EiBI-modified gravity effects on diverse relevant solar parameters, such as the gravito-electrostatic potentials, fields, and Mach numbers, are illustratively analyzed. It is anticipated that our analyses could be applied further to see the solar plasma equilibrium and fluctuation dynamics in realistically modified post-Newtonian gravity environments on both the bounded (interior) and unbounded (exterior) solar plasma scales.</description>

      <title>High-energy interactions of charged black holes in full general relativity II: Near-extremal merger remnants and universality with the irreducible mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a previous paper, arXiv:2411.11960 [gr-qc], we initiated a study of high-energy interactions of charged binary black holes near the scattering threshold, focusing on zoom-whirl orbits. In this second paper in our series, we focus on merger remnant properties and energetics with new simulations of equal-mass, equal-charge, nonspinning binary black holes with variable impact parameter. We find near-extremal merger remnants with Kerr-Newman parameter reaching $\Upsilon_f = 0.97$, and observe that the maximum $\Upsilon_f$ increases monotonically with $\lambda$ for a fixed initial Lorentz factor. We find that binaries with larger $\lambda$ radiate less total energy despite having stronger electromagnetic emission. The maximum energy radiated by a binary in our study is $31\%$ of its gravitational mass. Increasing $\lambda$ has little effect on the maximum angular momentum radiated, which was $\approx 72\%$ of the spacetime total angular momentum for each $\lambda$ explored here. Lastly, we provide additional evidence for the universality with the irreducible mass that we discovered in arXiv:2411.11960 [gr-qc]. The black hole horizon areal radius determines a fundamental, gauge-invariant length scale governing BH interactions near the scattering threshold.</description>

      <title>Boson star superradiance with spinning effects and in time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiance, the process by which waves are amplified through energy and angular momentum transfer, can also occur in horizonless objects like boson stars, due to both the real space and internal field space rotations. In this work, we study superradiance in the frequency and time domains for static and spinning boson stars, constructed within general relativity and with a self-interacting complex scalar field as a matter source. Using linear perturbation theory and three dimensional nonlinear simulations, we calculate amplification factors and analyze energy and angular momentum transfer in scattering processes, with results showing consistency between approaches. Wave scattering inside a cavity containing a boson star is also examined, demonstrating the effects of confinement on amplification.</description>

      <title>From eccentric binaries to nonstationary gravitational wave backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large population of binary systems in the Universe emitting gravitational waves (GW) would produce a stochastic noise, known as the gravitational wave background (GWB). The properties of the GWB directly depend on the attributes of its constituents. If the binary systems are in eccentric orbits, it is well established that the GW power they radiate strongly depends on their instantaneous orbital phase. Consequently, their power spectrum varies over time, and the resulting GWB can appear nonstationary. In this work, we estimate the amplitude of time-dependent fluctuations in the GWB power spectrum as a function of the eccentricity of the binaries. Specifically, we focus on the GWB produced by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) that should be observable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We show that a large population of homogeneously distributed equal SMBHBs produces nonstationary features that are undetectable by current PTA datasets. However, using more realistic and astrophysically motivated populations of SMBHBs, we show that the nonstationarity might become very large and detectable, especially in the case of more massive and eccentric populations. In particular, when one binary is slightly brighter than the GWB, we demonstrate that time fluctuations can become significant. This is also true for individual binary systems with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) relative to the GWB (SNR $\approx$ 1), which standard data analysis methods would struggle to detect. The detection of nonstationary features in the GWB could indicate the presence of some relatively bright GW sources in eccentric orbits, offering new insights into the origins of the signal.</description>

      <title>Low-curvature quantum corrections from unitary evolution of de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of de Sitter space formulated as a minisuperspace model with flat spatial hypersurfaces in unimodular gravity, both in the Wheeler-DeWitt approach and in loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Time evolution is defined naturally in unimodular time, which appears as conjugate to the cosmological (integration) constant. We show that requiring unitary time evolution "resolves" the de Sitter horizon where the flat slicing breaks down and leads to strong quantum effects there, even though locally nothing special happens at this surface. For a cosmological constant that is far below the Planck scale, loop quantum gravity corrections do not alter the main results in any substantial way. This model illustrates the fundamental clash between general covariance and unitarity in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational memory and soft theorems: the local perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general relativity (GR), gravitational memory describes the lasting change in the separation and relative velocity of freely-falling detectors after the passage of gravitational waves (GWs). The phenomenon is intimately related to Weinberg's soft graviton theorems and the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) symmetries at future null infinity. In this paper, we elucidate the relation between BMS transformations and the description of gravitational memory in synchronous coordinates, commonly used in GW detectors like LISA. We show that gravitational memory corresponds to large residual diffeomorphisms in this gauge, such as volume-preserving spatial rescalings. We derive the associated soft theorems, for both scattering amplitudes and equal-time (in-in) correlation functions. The latter are exactly the flat space analogues of the well-known cosmological consistency relations.</description>

      <title>Linear hyperbolic equations in a double null foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bianchi identities for the Weyl curvature tensor of a spacetime $(M, g)$ solving the vacuum Einstein equations in a double null foliation exhibit a hyperbolic structure, which can be used to obtain detailed nonlinear estimates on the null Weyl tensor components. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we discuss existence and uniqueness for solutions of first-order linear hyperbolic systems of equations in a double null foliation on an arbitrary spacetime, with initial data posed on a past null hypersurface $\underline C_0 \cup C_0$. We prove a global existence and uniqueness theorem for these systems. Then we discuss the relationship between these systems, the Bianchi equations, and the linearized Bianchi equations (the linearized Bianchi equations are obtained from the usual Bianchi equations by replacing the null Weyl tensor components with unknown tensorfields). We derive a novel algebraic constraint which must be satisfied, at every point in the spacetime, by tensorfields satisfying the linearized Bianchi equations.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic regularization for massive and massless spin-$1$ fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adiabatic regularization method is likely the most direct and intuitive renormalization scheme for FLRW cosmologies. The method requires one to start with a nonvanishing mass, but massless theories can be studied by taking the massless limit at the end of the calculations. For spin-$1$, however, this limit changes the number of degrees of freedom, so it cannot be performed directly. In this work, we show a direct approach that begins with the canonical quantization of the physical degrees of freedom of a massive Proca field. We give the details of the construction and show that, in the massless limit, the renormalized stress-energy tensor of the Proca field is closely related to that of a minimally coupled scalar field. For completeness and pedagogical purposes, we also include a brief orientation to the adiabatic method for scalar fields. The construction of the adiabatic subtractions in momentum space is compared with that of the BPHZ method for renormalizing Feynman loop integrals.</description>

      <title>The neutrino flavor oscillations in the static and spherically symmetric black-hole-like wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of neutrino lensing induced by a Damour-Solodukhin wormhole on the neutrino oscillation. We derive and calculate the flavour transition probabilities in the presence of Damour-Solodukhin factor $\Lambda$ as a shift in the massive source to show that the neutrino flavour oscillation is also sensitive not only to the sign of difference between the squared masses but also to the individual mass of neutrinos in both the two-flavour and the three-flavour cases, which is similar to the results for the black holes in the previous works mentioned here. As a consequence of parameter $\Lambda$ within a region, a series of curves of probability function versus the azimuthal angle $\phi$ with definite masses of neutrino can be plotted and their shapes resemble each other in the case of two-flavoured neutrinos and of three-flavoured ones. In view of the probability functions due to the wormhole, we reveal that the contribution of the factor $\Lambda$ is novel. Based on our analytical and numerical discussions on the probability expressions, the difference of the neutrino flavour oscillation arising from the shift in the wormhole factor $\Lambda$ is detectable. It is crucial that the $\Lambda$ as deviation from the black holes can change the shapes of the curves greatly, in the case of three-flavoured neutrinos in particular. The detailed comparisons can be made among our estimations depicted in the figures for neutrino oscillations and the measurements from the detector, which open a new window for judging whether the remote star as lens is black-hole-like wormhole or just a spherically symmetric black hole and further the wormhole factor $\Lambda$ can be estimated.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the viscous fluid cosmological model that when certain conditions are invoked mimics the $\Lambda$CDM model. The background equations governing the evolution of viscous interacting fluids in a multifluid system are derived. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is applied to constrain the best-fit cosmological parameters with Supernova Type 1a data. In addition, linear cosmological perturbations are investigated in a dust-matter-dominated frame using a $1+3$ covariant formalism approach. It is evident from the perturbation results obtained that the model predicts the disintegration of bound structures of large-scale structures in the late-time universe.</description>

      <title>General relativistic heat flow from first order hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the recently proposed stable and causal first-order relativistic hydrodynamics by Bemfica, Disconzi, and Noronha, we find the heat flow equation in the presence of gravity for a non-viscous fluid, which suffers heat dissipation. The derivation is confined to static and stationary backgrounds. We find that in the presence of gravity, the heat flux times a redshift factor is conserved. Then for radial heat flow, the temperature profiles are obtained from the heat equation when the gravity is sourced by Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-dS, Kerr and Kerr-dS black holes, respectively. Consequently, the chemical potential profile is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Tidally induced multipole moments of a charged material body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and calculate the mass multipole moments of a material body of mass $M$ and electric charge $Q$ tidally deformed by a particle of mass $m \ll M$ and charge $q \ll Q$ placed at a distance $r_0$ from the body. Given $Q/M$ and $r_0$, we choose $q/m$ so that the gravitational attraction between body and particle is balanced by the electrostatic repulsion; the system can then be maintained in a static state. The multipole moments are defined in a setting in which the body's self-gravity is allowed to be strong, but the mutual gravity between body and companion is required to be weak. In this setting, the body is described in full general relativity, in terms of a perturbed metric and electromagnetic potential characterized by tidal constants, and the mutual gravity is described within the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity, in terms of objects with a multipole structure. Matching the different descriptions of the same field delivers a relation between the tidal constants and the multipole moments. In our implementation of this program, the calculation is performed in full Einstein-Maxwell theory (as a linearized perturbation of the unperturbed field), without appeal to a post-Newtonian approximation. After the fact we take $M/r_0$ to be small and carry out an expansion of the metric in powers of $M/r$ to obtain the multipole moments and associated Love numbers. The calculations are performed for a body made up of a perfect fluid with a uniform ratio of charge to mass densities, governed by a polytropic equation of state. We show that the Love numbers of a charged body in a situation of balanced gravitational and electrostatic forces are negative. The statement remains true even when $Q/M$ is very small, and we conclude that the tidal deformability of a charged body is radically different from that of an uncharged object, for which the Love numbers are positive.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and decoherence in cosmology and in analogue gravity experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis is dedicated to analysing the generation and destruction of quantum correlations in the context of inflationary cosmology and an experiment of 'analogue' preheating. Inflation is a phase of accelerated expansion of the Universe, preceding the so-called Standard Model of Big Bang cosmology, introduced to solve some shortcomings of this model. It also provides a mechanism for the emergence of primordial inhomogeneities by amplification of initial quantum fluctuations. Inflation is followed by a 'reheating' period, in which most particles are expected to be generated and reach thermal equilibrium, setting the stage for the standard Big Bang of cosmology. During a 'preheating' period, this creation proceeds partly by parametric excitation of resonant modes of the matter fields initially in their vacuum, a genuine quantum process. The physics of both situations, inflation and preheating, is that of a strong classical field acting on a quantum field to produce entangled (quasi-)particles. When the classical source is the space-time metric itself, as in inflation, we are in the framework of Quantum Field Theory in Curved Space-time (QFTCS). The evolution of the generated quantum correlations is the topic of this PhD.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the results of a theoretical study of the trajectories of massive particles in the K\"ottler metric in view of the cosmological constant {\Lambda}. For both negative and positive signs of {\Lambda} a classification of trajectories is proposed, with entries based on different solutions of the trajectory equation, obtained by the expansion of the corresponding algebraic curve in Puiseux series. We also provide some specific types of trajectories which correspond to different values of the cosmological constant. In the case of negative values of the cosmological constant its upper limit is estimated from the galaxy rotation curves</description>

      <title>Black holes and covariance in effective quantum gravity: A solution without Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a continuation of our previous work addressing general covariance in effective quantum gravity models within the Hamiltonian framework, this study presents explicit derivations of the covariance equation proposed earlier. By solving this equation, a new Hamiltonian constraint is obtained, incorporating free functions that can account for quantum gravity effects. Specifying these functions allows for an analysis of the resulting spacetime structure. Remarkably, in this model, the classical singularity is replaced by a region where the metric asymptotically approaches a Schwarzschild-de Sitter one with negative mass. Unlike previously studied spacetime structures, this new quantum-corrected model avoids the presence of Cauchy horizons, potentially suggesting its stability under perturbations. Furthermore, this work establishes a foundation for exploring matter coupling and lays the groundwork for investigating the formation of quantum black holes in covariant effective models.</description>

      <title>Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors: a Review of Acceleration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require billions to quadrillions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to millions of core hours. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from scalar and axion fields: distinguishability and detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation associated with scalar and axion field oscillations in different background field setups. Because the scalar field and axion field have different parity and couple with the EM field in different forms, the EM signals generated by the scalar and axion can be used to distinguish them. More interestingly, resonance effects amplify the difference between the two fields and consequent EM signal strength, which helps us distinguish and detect them in future observations.</description>

      <title>Scattering waveforms for Kerr black holes from the soft expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, I will study the classical scattering problem of two Kerr black holes in general relativity with novel quantum field theory techniques in the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion, generalizing the subleading soft theorem to the case of spinning particles. The leading order term in the soft expansion is uniquely determined by the universal Weinberg pole, but the subleading one depends on the angular momentum of the external particles and receives a new spin corrections for classically spinning black holes. Using this approach, I will compute the gravitational Compton amplitude, both in the quantum and classical theory. I will then compute the tree-level five-point amplitude of two spinning point particles emitting a graviton, using the spinor-helicity formalism combined with the soft expansion. Finally, I will use the KMOC formalism to derive the analytic time-domain waveform for the scattering of two Kerr black holes at leading order in the PM expansion.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Pre-Big Bang scenario from a cosmological interpretation of the NANOGrav data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a recently proposed interpretation of the signal detected by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) as due to a relic stochastic background of primordial gravitons, produced in the context of the string cosmology pre-big bang scenario. We show that such interpretation cannot be reconciled with a phenomenologically viable minimal version of such scenario, while it can be allowed if one considers an equally viable but generalised, non-minimal version of pre-big bang evolution. Maintaining the $S$-duality symmetry throughout the high-curvature string phase is possible although somewhat disfavoured. The implications of this non-minimal scenario for the power spectrum of curvature perturbations are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we show that the so-called matter ansatz at the basis of the three-dimensional model of unconventional supersymmetry by Alvarez-Valenzuela-Zanelli (AVZ) is to be understood as an instance of the Dressing Field Method. The latter is a systematic way to exhibit the gauge-invariant, relational content of general-relativistic gauge field theories. It is shown here to be foundational to (unconventional) supersymmetry: The spin-1/2 Dirac field of the AVZ model being obtained as a supersymmetry invariant variable, encoding physical relational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Generalised second law beyond the semiclassical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the generalised second law (GSL), with an appropriate modification, holds in perturbative gravity to all orders beyond the semiclassical limit and without a UV cutoff imposed on the fields. Our proof uses algebraic techniques and builds on the recent work of Faulkner and Speranza, which combined Wall's proof of the GSL with the identification of generalised entropy as the von Neumann entropy of a boost-invariant crossed product algebra. The key additional step in our approach is to further impose invariance under null translations. Doing so requires one to describe horizon exterior regions in a relational manner, so we introduce `dynamical cuts': quantum reference frames which give the location of a cut of the horizon. We use idealised dynamical cuts, but expect that our methods can be generalised to more realistic models. The modified GSL that we prove says that the difference in generalised entropies of the regions outside two dynamical cuts is bounded below by the free energy of the degrees of freedom giving the location of the later cut. If one takes a semiclassical limit, imposes a UV cutoff, and requires the cuts to obey certain energy conditions, then our result reduces to the standard GSL.</description>

      <title>Exact low-temperature Green's functions in AdS/CFT: From Heun to confluent Heun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain exact expressions for correlation functions of charged scalar operators at finite density and low temperature in CFT$_4$ dual to the RN-AdS$_5$ black brane. We use recent developments in the Heun connection problem in black hole perturbation theory arising from Liouville CFT and the AGT correspondence. The connection problem is solved perturbatively in an instanton counting parameter, which corresponds to a low-temperature expansion in a double-scaling limit where $\omega, T \to 0$ holding $\omega/T$ fixed. We gain analytic control over the emergence of the zero temperature branch cut as a confluent limit of the Heun equation. From the Green's function we extract analytic results for the critical temperature of the holographic superconductor, as well as dispersion relations for both gapped and gapless low temperature quasinormal modes. We demonstrate precise agreement with numerics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study observables in the scattering of classical, spinning objects using the KMOC formalism. In particular, we derive formulas to higher order in spin and one loop $\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ for the spin kick and momentum impulse. Our derivation method is agnostic to the choice of theory or special conditions, such as the spin supplementary condition (SSC); we only rely on the generic structure of long-range scattering amplitudes of non-transverse, massive spinning fields in the classical limit. We check these formulas for the case of gravity and agree with previous results from the eikonal formalism after imposing a SSC.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of spontaneous scalarization of black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in anti-de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spontaneous scalarization in the Einstein-Born-Infeld-Scalar (EBIS) model with asymptotically AdS boundary conditions, revealing novel dynamical critical phenomena in black hole evolution. Through numerical analysis, we discover a distinctive ``flip" phenomenon where the scalar field exhibits critical transitions between different stable configurations. These transitions manifest in two forms: a single flip under variations in initial perturbation amplitude or scalar-electromagnetic coupling, and a double flip when varying black hole charge. Near critical points, the system displays universal relaxation behavior characterized by logarithmic scaling of relaxation time, $\tau \propto \ln |p - p_s|$, where $p_s$ denotes the critical initial amplitude. We demonstrate that these transitions arise from the system's approach to unstable AdS-Born-Infeld black hole configurations, which serve as separatrices between distinct stable phases. The Born-Infeld parameter plays a crucial role in this dynamics, with scalar hair vanishing in the strong nonlinearity limit. These results reveal fundamental aspects of black hole phase transitions in theories with nonlinear electromagnetic couplings and provide new insights into critical phenomena in gravitational systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of an atomic detection of gravitational waves on earth is considered. The combination of extremely high lifetimes and resulting small radiative transition probabilities with rapidly growing interaction strength for Rydberg atoms having principal quantum numbers in a region $10^4\ldots 10^5$ might result in transition probabilities which are high enough to open up such a possibility. Transition probabilities and absorption cross sections are calculated as a function of the relevant quantum numbers of a highly excited electron. The orders of magnitude for the transition rate are evaluated for a realistic source of gravitational radiation. It is shown that no specific particle property enters the expression for the absorption cross section for gravitational waves. The only fundamental constant contained in this cross section is, apart from the fine structure constant $\alpha$, the Planck length $L^*=(\hbar G /c^3)^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Formulation and Proof of the Gravitational Entropy Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a formulation and proof of the gravitational entropy bound. We use a recently given framework which expresses the measurable quantities of a quantum theory as a weighted sum over paths in the theory's phase space. If this framework is applied to a field theory on a spacetime foliated by a hypersurface $\Sigma,$ the choice of a codimension-2 surface $B$ without boundary contained in $\Sigma$ specifies a submanifold in the phase space. We show here that this submanifold is naturally restricted to obey an entropy bound if the field theory is diffeomorphism-invariant. We prove this restriction to arise by considering the quantum-mechanical sum of paths in phase space and exploiting the interplay of the commutativity of the sum with diffeomorphism-invariance. The formulation of the entropy bound, which we state and derive in detail, involves a functional $K$ on the submanifold associated to $B.$ We give an explicit construction of $K$ in terms of the Lagrangian. The gravitational entropy bound then states: For any real $\frac{\lambda}{\hbar},$ consider the set of states where $K$ takes a value not bigger than $\lambda$ and let $V$ denote the phase space volume of this set. One has then $\ln (V) \le \frac{\lambda}{\hbar}.$ Especially, we show for the Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian in any dimension with cosmological constant and arbitrary minimally coupled matter, one has $K = \frac{A}{4G}.$ Hereby, $A$ denotes the area of $B$ in a particular state.</description>

Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>Testing inflation on all scales: a case study with $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plethora of inflationary models can produce interesting small-scale phenomenology, such as enhanced scalar fluctuations leading to primordial black hole (PBH) production and large scalar-induced GW. Nevertheless, good models must simultaneously explain current observations on all scales. In this work, we showcase our methodology to establish the small-scale phenomenology of inflationary models on firm grounds. We consider the case of hybrid $\alpha$-attractors, and focus on a reduced parameter space featuring the two potential parameters which roughly determine the position of the peak in the scalar power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$, and its amplitude. We first constrain the parameter space by comparing the large-scale predictions for $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ with current CMB anisotropies measurements and upper limits on $\mu$-distortions. We take into account uncertainties due to the reheating phase, and observe that the parameter-space area compatible with large-scale constraints shrinks for extended reheating stages. We then move to smaller scales, where we find that non-Gaussianity at peak scales is of the local type and has amplitude $f_\text{NL}\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)$. This ensures that non-linear effects are subdominant, motivating us to employ the tree-level $\mathcal{P}_\zeta$ to compute the abundance of PBHs and the spectrum of induced GWs for models consistent with large-scale tests. The former allows us to further constrain the parameter space, by excluding models which over-produce PBHs. We find that a subset of viable models can lead to significant production of PBHs, and a fraction of these is within reach for LISA, having a signal-to-noise ratio larger than that of astrophysical foregrounds. Our first-of-its-kind study systematically combines tests at different scales, and exploits the synergy between cosmological observations and theoretical consistency requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Unruh effect is a well-understood phenomenon, where one considers a vacuum state of a quantum field in Minkowski spacetime, which appears to be thermally populated for a uniformly accelerating Rindler observer. In this article, we derive a variant of the Unruh effect involving two distinct accelerating observers and aim to address the following questions: (i) Is it possible to selectively thermalize a subset of momentum modes for the case of massless scalar fields, and (ii) Is it possible to excite only the left-handed massless fermions while keeping right-handed fermions in a vacuum state or vice versa? To this end, we consider a Rindler wedge $R_1$ constructed from a class of accelerating observers and another Rindler wedge $R_2$ (with $R_2 \subset R_1$) constructed from another class of accelerating observers such that the wedge $R_2$ is displaced along a null direction w.r.t $R_1$ by a parameter $\Delta$. By first considering a massless scalar field in the $R_1$ vacuum, we show that if we choose the displacement $\Delta$ along one null direction, the positive momentum modes are thermalized, whereas negative momentum modes remain in vacuum (and vice versa if we choose the displacement along the other null direction). We then consider a massless fermionic field in a vacuum state in $R_1$ and show that the reduced state in $R_2$ is such that the left-handed fermions are excited and are thermal for large frequencies. In contrast, the right-handed fermions have negligible particle density and vice versa. We argue that the toy models involving shifted Rindler spacetime may provide insights into the particle excitation aspects of evolving horizons and the possibility of Rindler spacetime having a quantum strand of hair. Additionally, based on our work, we hypothesize that massless fermions underwent selective chiral excitations during the radiation-dominated era of cosmology.</description>

Abstract: Non-pertrubative quantum gravity formulated as a unitary four-dimensional theory suggests that certain amount of non-locality, such as infinite-derivative operators, can be present in the action, in both cases of Analytic Infinite Derivative gravity and Asymptotically Safe gravity. Such operators lead to the emergence of Background Induced States on top of any background deviating from the flat spacetime. Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) corresponding to these excitations are analyzed in the present paper with the use of an example of a static nearly Schwarzschild black hole. We mainly target micro-Black Holes, given that they are strongly affected by the details of UV completion for gravity, while real astrophysical black holes can be well described in EFT framework. We find that frequencies of QNMs are deviating from those in a General Relativity setup and, moreover, that the unstable QNMs are also possible. This leads to the necessity of constraints on gravity modifications or lower bounds on masses of the stable micro-Black Holes or both.</description>

      <title>Can we discern millilensed gravitational-wave signals from signals produced by precessing binary black holes with ground-based detectors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millilensed gravitational waves (GWs) can potentially be identified by the interference signatures caused by $\sim\!O(10\textrm{--}100)~\textrm{ms}$ time delays between multiple overlapping lensed signals. However, distinguishing millilensed GWs from GWs generated by precessing binary black-hole mergers can be challenging due to their apparent similar waveform shapes. This morphological similarity may be an obstacle to template-based searches to correctly identifying the origin of observed GWs and poses a fundamental question, can we discern millilensed GW signals from signals produced by precessing binary black holes? In this study, we investigate the feasibility of distinguishing between these GWs by performing a proof-of-principle injection study of simulated millilensed precessing GW signals, within the context of ground-based LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network detections. Our findings indicate that it is possible to differentiate between the two effects by comparing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) computed using templates based on different hypotheses for the target signal. We further show from the parameter estimation study that while lensing magnification is sensitive to precession, it is possible to identify millilensing in precessing GW signals with an SNR of 18. The recovery of precession in the presence of lensing is more challenging but improves significantly for signals with an SNR of 40. Nonetheless, neglecting millilensing effects results in biases in the recovered spins, revealing the importance of accounting for these effects in accurate GW signal analysis.</description>

      <title>Cosmic primordial density fluctuations and Bell inequalities</title>

Abstract: The temperature measurements, $T$, of the perturbed cosmic microwave background, performed by the cosmic background explorer satellite (COBE), are considered. A dichotomist function, $f = \pm 1$, is defined such that $f =+1$ if $\delta T &gt; 0$ and $f =-1$ if $\delta T &lt; 0$, where $\delta T$ stands for the fluctuation of $T$. Then, it is assumed that behind the appearance of these fluctuations there is local realism. Under this assumption, some specific Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequalities are proved for these fluctuation temperatures measured by COBE in the different sky directions. The calculation of these inequalities from the actual temperature measurements shows that these inequalities are not violated. This result cannot be anticipated by calculating the commutators of the cosmic density quantum operators. This must be remarked here since, in the case of a system of two entangled spin ${\textstyle{1 \over 2}}$ particles, its CHSH inequalities violation can be inferred from the nonvanishing value of the corresponding spin measurement commutators. The above nonviolation of the observed cosmic CHSH inequalities is compatible with the existence of local realism behind the cosmic measurement results. Nevertheless, assuming again local realism, some new cosmic CHSH inequalities can be derived for the case of the WMAP measurements whose accuracy is better than the one of the above considered COBE measurements. More specifically, in the WMAP case, some significant cross correlations between the temperature and polarization maps are detected, and the new cosmic CHSH inequalities are the ones built with these cross correlations. Now, the occasional violation of these CHSH inequalities would mean the failure of the assumed local realism in accordance with the quantum origin of the primordial temperature and polarization fluctuations in the framework of standard inflation.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by a ringing black hole allow us to perform precision tests of general relativity in the strong field regime. With improvements to our current gravitational wave detectors and upcoming next-generation detectors, developing likelihood-free parameter inference infrastructure is critical as we will face complications like nonstandard noise properties, partial data and incomplete signal modeling that may not allow for an analytically tractable likelihood function. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept strategy to perform likelihood-free Bayesian inference on ringdown gravitational waves using simulation based inference. Specifically, our method is based on truncated sequential neural posterior estimation, which trains a neural density estimator of the posterior for a specific observed data segment. We setup the ringdown parameter estimation directly in the time domain. We show that the parameter estimation results obtained using our trained networks are in agreement with well-established Markov-chain methods for simulated injections as well as analysis on real detector data corresponding to GW150914. Additionally, to assess our approach's internal consistency, we show that the density estimators pass a Bayesian coverage test.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigation of the late-time tails of the solutions of the Fackerell-Ipser equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The late-time behaviour of the solutions of the Fackerell-Ipser equation (which is a wave equation for the spin-zero component of the electromagnetic field strength tensor) on the closure of the domain of outer communication of sub-extremal Kerr spacetime is studied numerically. Within the Kerr family, the case of Schwarzschild background is also considered. Horizon-penetrating compactified hyperboloidal coordinates are used, which allow the behaviour of the solutions to be observed at the event horizon and at future null infinity as well. For the initial data, pure multipole configurations that have compact support and are either stationary or non-stationary are taken. It is found that with such initial data the solutions of the Fackerell-Ipser equation converge at late times either to a known static solution (up to a constant factor) or to zero. As the limit is approached, the solutions exhibit a quasinormal ringdown and finally a power-law decay. The exponents characterizing the power-law decay of the spherical harmonic components of the field variable are extracted from the numerical data for various values of the parameters of the initial data, and based on the results a proposal for a Price's law relevant to the Fackerell-Ipser equation is made. Certain conserved energy and angular momentum currents are used to verify the numerical implementation of the underlying mathematical model. In the construction of these currents a discrete symmetry of the Fackerell-Ipser equation, which is the product of an equatorial reflection and a complex conjugation, is also taken into account.</description>

      <title>Whispers from the quantum core: the ringdown of semiclassical stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This investigation delves into the ringdown signals produced by semiclassical stars, which are ultra-compact, regular solutions of the Einstein equations incorporating stress-energy contributions from quantum vacuum polarization. These stars exhibit an approximately Schwarzschild exterior and an interior composed of a constant-density classical fluid and a cloud of vacuum polarization. By adjusting their compactness and density, we can alter the internal structure of these stars without modifying the exterior. This adaptability enables us to examine the sensitivity of the ringdown signal to the innermost regions of the emitting object and to compare it with similar geometries that differ substantially only at the core. Our results indicate that echo signals are intrinsically linked to the presence of stable light rings and can be very sensitive to the internal structure of the emitting object. This point was previously overlooked, either due to the imposition of reflective boundary conditions at the stellar surface or due to the assumption of low curvature interior geometries. Specifically, for stellar-sized semiclassical stars, we find that the interior travel time is sufficiently prolonged to render the echoes effectively unobservable. These findings underscore the potential efficacy of ultra-compact objects as black hole mimickers and emphasize that any phenomenological constraints on such objects necessitate a detailed understanding of their specific properties and core structure.</description>

Abstract: We construct and explore the complex structures of boson stars, drawing inspiration from similar configurations of non-topological solitons in Minkowski space. These "molecular states" of boson stars have a multipolar structure and both positive and negative Noether charges within one star, and the opposite charges swap with time. Thanks to the gravitational attraction, they exist even in the case of a free scalar field. We also explore the effects of scalar self-interactions on these complex structures. We propose to use galactic-scale charge-swapping boson stars as a potential solution to the problem of the observed anisotropic distribution of satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Flexible mapping of ringdown amplitudes for nonprecessing binary black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remnant black hole from a binary coalescence emits ringdown gravitational waves characterized by quasinormal modes, which depend solely on the remnant's mass and spin. In contrast, the ringdown amplitudes and phases are determined by the properties of the merging progenitors. Accurately modeling these amplitudes and phases reduces systematic biases in parameter estimation and enables the development and performance of rigorous tests of general relativity. We present a state-of-the-art, data-driven surrogate model for ringdown amplitudes and phases, leveraging Gaussian process regression trained against SXS numerical-relativity simulations. Focusing on nonprecessing, quasicircular binary black holes, our model offers the most comprehensive fit that includes 16 emission modes, incorporating overtones and quadratic contributions. Our surrogate model achieves reconstruction errors that are approximately 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the typical measurement errors of current gravitational-wave interferometers. An additional benefit of our approach is its flexibility, which allows for future extensions to include features such as eccentricity and precession, broadening the scope of its applicability to more generic astrophysical scenarios. Finally, we are releasing our model in a ready-to-use package called postmerger.</description>

Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study spherically symmetric spacetime perturbations induced by a neutral scalar in the near-horizon region of extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. For the unperturbed black hole, the near-horizon region is given by another exact solution of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, namely the Bertotti-Robinson spacetime. Our aim is to extend this connection beyond the background level and identify perturbations of a Bertotti-Robinson spacetime as near-horizon perturbations of an extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We explain that explicit identification of the perturbative solutions to the two different backgrounds can only work in appropriate gauges. For this reason, we first solve the two perturbation problems in the most general spherically symmetric gauges and then find the necessary gauge conditions for matching the Reissner-Nordstrom and Bertotti-Robinson perturbative solutions in the near-horizon limit.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate head-on collisions of $\ell$-boson stars, potential candidates for dark matter compact objects. We begin with a review of the general properties and features of these stars, leveraging results from prior studies to analyze the gravitational wave signals generated by such collisions. Considering a maximum distance of 100 Mpc for potential events, we identify the range of masses and scalar field frequencies for these stars that would render the gravitational waves detectable by current gravitational wave observatories. Additionally, we process the resulting signals to generate simulated observatory images, highlighting their similarities and differences compared to those produced by black hole collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By regarding the Newton constant $G_{N}$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ as variables, we in this paper study the thermodynamics and phase transition of Reissner-Nordstr$\ddot{o}$m anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black hole with global monopole in the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence. It is found that there are interesting critical phenomena and phase behaviors in the (grand) canonical ensembles of fixed ($\tilde Q,{\cal V},C$), ($\tilde \Phi,{\cal V},C$) and ($\tilde Q,{\cal V},\mu$). When the other parameters are fixed, the free energy decreases with the global monopole increases. In ($\tilde Q,{\cal V},C$) ensemble, the range of unstable region decreases with the increase of global monopole. In ($\tilde \Phi,{\cal V},C$) ensemble, when $\tilde{\Phi} &lt; \Phi_{c}$, the free energy appears two branches, the upper and lower branches correspond to low entropy and high entropy respectively. When ($\tilde Q,{\cal V},\mu$) is fixed, a new zero-order phase transition occurs in the high-entropy phase and the low-entropy phase at certain $\mu$-dependent temperatures. When $\mu$ increases to a certain value, this zero-order phase transition disappears. This certain value is negatively related to the magnitude of the global monopole. Finally, we find that $p-\cal V$ criticality does not appear with the change of global monopole. Therefore, it is important to note that the CFT states of charged black holes with global monopole do not correspond to Van der Waals fluids. Finally, we find that charged black holes with global monopoles can better reflect thermodynamic phase transitions and critical phenomena under the AdS/CFT correspondence. By adjusting the change of the global monopole, the thermodynamic phase transition will also change.</description>

      <title>Weyl Fermion Creation by Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background at 1-loop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weyl fermions of spin $\frac12$ minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity in 4 dimensions cannot be produced purely gravitationally in an expanding Universe at tree level. Surprisingly, as we showed in a recent letter [1], this changes at gravitational 1-loop when cosmic perturbations, like a gravitational wave background, are present. Such a background introduces a new scale, thereby breaking the fermions' conformal invariance. This leads to a non-vanishing gravitational self-energy for Weyl fermions at 1-loop and induces their production. In this paper, we present an extended study of this new mechanism, explicitly computing this effect using the in-in formalism. We work in an expanding Universe in the radiation-dominated era as a fixed background. Gravitational wave-induced fermion production has rich phenomenological consequences. Notably, if Weyl fermions eventually acquire mass, and assuming realistic - and potentially detectable - gravitational wave backgrounds, the mechanism can explain the abundance of dark matter in the Universe. More generally, gravitational-wave induced freeze-in is a new purely gravitational mechanism for generating other feebly interacting fermions, e.g. right-handed neutrinos. We show that this loop level effect can dominate over the conventional - tree-level - gravitational production of superheavy fermions in a sizable part of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Corrections to the CBF Effective Nuclear Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the inclusion of relativistic boost corrections into the CBF effective nuclear Hamiltonian, derived from a realistic model of two- and three-nucleon interactions using the formalism of correlated basis functions and the cluster expansion technique. Different procedures to take into account the effects of boost interactions are compared on the basis of the ability to reproduce the nuclear matter equation of state obtained from accurate many-body calculations. The results of our study show that the repulsive contribution of the boost interaction significantly depends on the underlying model of the non relativistic potential. On the other hand, the dominant relativistic correction turns out to be the corresponding reduction of the strength of repulsive three-nucleon interactions, leading to a significant softening of the equation of state at supranuclear densities.</description>

      <title>Consistency conditions for O-plane unsmearing from second-order perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scale-separated AdS compactifications of string theory can be constructed at the two-derivative supergravity level in the presence of smeared orientifold planes. The unsmearing corrections are known to leading order in the large volume, weak coupling limit. However, first-order perturbative approximations of non-linear problems can often produce spurious solutions, which are only weeded out by additional consistency conditions imposed at higher orders. In this work, we revisit the unsmearing procedure and present consistency conditions obtained from the second order warp factor and dilaton equations. This requires proper treatment of the near-source singularities. The resulting conditions appear as integral constraints on various non-linear combinations of the first order corrections, which we argue can generally be satisfied by appropriate choice of integration constants of the leading-order solutions. This provides a non-trivial consistency check for the perturbative unsmearing procedure and supports the existence of scale-separated AdS vacua in string theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Astronomy With TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The opening of the gravitational wave window has significantly enhanced our capacity to explore the universe's most extreme and dynamic sector. In the mHz frequency range, a diverse range of compact objects, from the most massive black holes at the farthest reaches of the Universe to the lightest white dwarfs in our cosmic backyard, generate a complex and dynamic symphony of gravitational wave signals. Once recorded by gravitational wave detectors, these unique fingerprints have the potential to decipher the birth and growth of cosmic structures over a wide range of scales, from stellar binaries and stellar clusters to galaxies and large-scale structures. The TianQin space-borne gravitational wave mission is scheduled for launch in the 2030s, with an operational lifespan of five years. It will facilitate pivotal insights into the history of our universe. This document presents a concise overview of the detectable sources of TianQin, outlining their characteristics, the challenges they present, and the expected impact of the TianQin observatory on our understanding of them.</description>

      <title>Structure formation with primordial black holes: collisional dynamics, binaries, and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) could compose the dark matter content of the Universe. We present the first simulations of cosmological structure formation with PBH dark matter that consistently include collisional few-body effects, post-Newtonian orbit corrections, orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission, and black-hole mergers. We carefully construct initial conditions by considering the evolution during radiation domination as well as early-forming binary systems. We identify numerous dynamical effects due to the collisional nature of PBH dark matter, including evolution of the internal structures of PBH halos and the formation of a hot component of PBHs. We also study the properties of the emergent population of PBH binary systems, distinguishing those that form at primordial times from those that form during the nonlinear structure formation process. These results will be crucial to sharpen constraints on the PBH scenario derived from observational constraints on the gravitational wave background. Even under conservative assumptions, the gravitational radiation emitted over the course of the simulation appears to exceed current limits from ground-based experiments, but this depends on the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum and PBH merger rate toward lower redshifts.</description>

      <title>Partial suppression of chaos in relativistic 3-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent numerical results seem to suggest that in certain regimes of typical particle velocities the gravitational $N-$body problem (for $3\leq N\lesssim 10^3$) is intrinsically less chaotic when the post-Newtonian (PN) force terms are included, with respect to its classical counterpart that exhibits a slightly larger maximal Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda_{\rm max}$. In this work we explore the dynamics of wildly chaotic, regular and nearly regular configurations of the 3-body problem with and without the PN corrective terms aiming at shedding some light on the behaviour of the Lyapunov spectra under the effect of said corrections. Because the interaction of the tangent-space dynamics in gravitating systems, needed to evaluate the Lyapunov exponents, becomes rapidly computationally heavy due to the complexity of the higher order force derivatives involving multiple powers of $v/c$, we introduce a technique to compute a proxy of the Lyapunov spectrum based on the time-dependent diagonalization of the inertia tensor of a cluster of trajectories in phase-space. We find that, for a broad range of orbital configurations, the relativistic 3-body problem has a smaller $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ than its classical counterpart starting with the exact same initial condition. However, the rest of the Lyapunov spectrum can be either lower or larger in the classical case, suggesting that the relativistic precession effectively reduces chaos only along one (or few) directions in phase-space. As a general trend, the dynamical entropy of the relativistic simulations as function of the rescaled speed of light always has a regime in which falls below the classical value.} We observe that, the sole analysis of $\Lambda_{\rm max}$ could induce possibly misleading conclusions on the chaoticity of systems with small (and possibly large $N$.</description>

      <title>Pre-Big-Bang Cosmology Cannot Explain NANOGrav 15-year Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the Pre-Big Bang (PBB) scenario from string cosmology can explain the stochastic gravitational wave background signal reported in the NANOGrav 15-year dataset. Using Bayesian analysis techniques, we constrain the key parameters of the PBB model by comparing its theoretical predictions with the observed data. Our analysis yields $\beta = -0.12^{+0.06}_{-0.21}$ ($90\%$ credible interval) for the dilaton-dynamics parameter, which lies outside the theoretically allowed range $0 \leq \beta &lt; 3$ with more than $5\sigma$ confidence. Additionally, model comparison strongly favors a simple power-law spectrum over the PBB scenario, with a Bayes factor of approximately $468$. These results demonstrate that the PBB scenario, in its current formulation, cannot adequately explain the NANOGrav observations, highlighting the need for either significant modifications to the model or alternative explanations for the observed signal.</description>
