      <title>Stability of a Delayed Predator-Prey Model for Puma Concolor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a mathematical model that describes the relationship between the Puma concolor and its prey using delay differential equations, a Holling type III functional response, logistic growth for the prey, and a Ricker-type function to model intraspecific competition of the pumas. For positive equilibrium, conditions guaranteeing absolute stability are established, based on the delay value and model parameters. The analysis demonstrates the existence of a unique maximal solution for the proposed model, which remains non-negative for nonnegative initial conditions and is well-defined for all $t$ greater than zero. Furthermore, numerical simulations with different parameter values were performed to investigate the effects of systematically removing a percentage of predators or prey. Numerical simulations attempt to exemplify and put into practice the theorems proved in this article.</description>

      <title>On the shifts of orbits and periodic orbits under perturbation and the change of Poincar\'e map Jacobian of periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic orbits and cycles resp. play a significant role in discrete- and continuous-time dynamical systems (i.e. maps and flows). To succinctly describe their shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional and functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the whole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic orbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are analyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory shall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and optimization of various systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Linearization of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and its variants, such as extended DMD (EDMD), are broadly used to fit simple linear models to dynamical systems known from observable data. As DMD methods work well in several situations but perform poorly in others, a clarification of the assumptions under which DMD is applicable is desirable. Upon closer inspection, existing interpretations of DMD methods based on the Koopman operator are not quite satisfactory: they justify DMD under assumptions that hold only with probability zero for generic observables. Here, we give a justification for DMD as a local, leading-order reduced model for the dominant system dynamics under conditions that hold with probability one for generic observables and non-degenerate observational data. We achieve this for autonomous and for periodically forced systems of finite or infinite dimensions by constructing linearizing transformations for their dominant dynamics within attracting slow spectral submanifolds (SSMs). Our arguments also lead to a new algorithm, data-driven linearization (DDL), which is a higher-order, systematic linearization of the observable dynamics within slow SSMs. We show by examples how DDL outperforms DMD and EDMD on numerical and experimental data.</description>

      <title>Dissolution of variable-in-shape drug particles via the level-set method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with a mathematical model describing the dissolution process of irregularly shaped particles. In particular, we consider a complete dissolution model accounting for both surface kinetics and convective diffusion, for three drugs with different solubility and wettability: theophylline, griseofulvin, and nimesulide. The possible subsequent recrystallization process in the bulk fluid is also considered. The governing differential equations are revisited in the context of the level-set method and Hamilton-Jacobi equations, then they are solved numerically. This choice allows us to deal with the simultaneous dissolution of hundreds of different polydisperse particles. We show the results of many computer simulations which investigate the impact of the particle size, shape, area/volume ratio, and the dependence of the interfacial mass transport coefficient on the surface curvature.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous attractors and box dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterated function systems (IFSs) are one of the most important tools for building examples of fractal sets exhibiting some kind of `approximate self-similarity'. Examples include self-similar sets, self-affine sets etc. A beautiful variant on the standard IFS model was introduced by Barnsley and Demko in 1985 where one builds an \emph{inhomogeneous} attractor by taking the closure of the orbit of a fixed compact condensation set under a given standard IFS. In this expository article I will discuss the dimension theory of inhomogeneous attractors, giving several examples and some open questions. I will focus on the upper box dimension with emphasis on how to derive good estimates, and when these estimates fail to be sharp.</description>

      <title>Metric mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension varying the metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f: M\rightarrow M$ be a continuous map on a compact metric space $M$ equipped with a fixed metric $d$, and let $\tau$ be the topology on $M$ induced by $d$. First, we will establish some fundamental properties of the mean Hausdorff dimension. Furthermore, it is important to note that the metric mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension depend on the metric chosen for $M$. In this work, we will prove that, for a fixed dynamical system $f:M\rightarrow M$, the functions $\text{mdim}_{\text{M}}(M, f):M(\tau)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\cup \{\infty\}$ and $\text{mdim}_{\text{H}}(M, f):M(\tau)\rightarrow \mathbb{R}\cup \{\infty\}$ are not continuous. Here, $ \text{mdim}_{\text{M}}(M, f)(\rho)= \text{mdim}_{\text{M}}(M,\rho, f)$ and $ \text{mdim}_{\text{H}}(M, f)(\rho)= \text{mdim}_{\text{H}}(M,\rho, f)$ represent, respectively, the metric mean dimension and the mean Hausdorff dimension of $f$ with respect to $\rho\in M(\tau)$ and $M(\tau)$ is the set consisting of all equivalent metrics to $d$ on $M$. Furthermore, we will present examples of certain classes of metrics for which the metric mean dimension is a continuous function.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence of some non-commuting double ergodic averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ and $T$ be measure-preserving transformations of a probability space $(X,\mathcal{B},\mu)$. Let $f$ be a bounded measurable functions, and consider the integrals of the corresponding `double' ergodic averages: \[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \int f(S^ix)f(T^ix)\ d\mu(x) \qquad (n\ge 1).\] We provide a new construction of diverse examples for which these integrals do not converge as $n\to\infty$. These include examples in which $S$ and $T$ are rigid, and hence have entropy zero, answering a question of Frantzikinakis and Host. We begin with a corresponding construction of pairs of unitary operators on a complex Hilbert space, and then construct transformations of a Gaussian measure space from them.</description>

      <title>Local limit theorems for expanding maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local central limit theorems for partial sums of the form \newline $\,S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j\circ T_{j-1}\circ\cdots\circ T_1\circ T_0$ where $f_j$ are uniformly H\"older functions and $T_j$ are expanding maps. Using a symbolic representation a similar result follows for maps $T_j$ in a small $C^1$ neighborhood of an Axiom A map and H\"older continuous functions $f_j$. All of our results are already new when all maps are the same $T_j=T$ but observables $(f_j)$ are different. The current paper compliments [43] where Berry--Esseen theorems are obtained. An important step in the proof is developing an appropriate reduction theory in the sequential case.</description>

      <title>Speed and shape of population fronts with density-dependent diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate travelling wave solutions in reaction-diffusion models of animal range expansion in the case that population diffusion is density-dependent. We find that the speed of the selected wave depends critically on the strength of diffusion at low density. For sufficiently large low-density diffusion, the wave propagates at a speed predicted by a simple linear analysis. For small or zero low-density diffusion, the linear analysis is not sufficient, but a variational approach yields exact or approximate expressions for the speed and shape of population fronts.</description>

      <title>Solution space characterisation of perturbed linear functional and integrodifferential Volterra convolution equations: Ces\`aro limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we discuss the requirements needed in order to characterise the solution space of perturbed linear integrodifferential Volterra convolution equations. We highlight how integrodifferential equations react far better under perturbations than their integral equation counterparts in regards to stability of solutions. To illustrate this idea we give a characterisation of when the Ces\`aro mean of solutions converge to a limit, which is explicitly identified and given in terms of the problem data. Additionally we note how all results can also be applied to functional differential equations.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of power-free integers in number fields and their shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the group of $\mathbb Z$-linear automorphisms of the ring of integers of a number field $K$ that preserve the set $V_{K,k}$ of $k$th power-free integers: every such map is the composition of a field automorphism and the multiplication by a unit.
  We show that those maps together with translations generate the extended symmetry group of the shift space $\mathbb D_{K,k}$ associated to $V_{K,k}$. Moreover, we show that no two such dynamical systems $\mathbb D_{K,k}$ and $\mathbb D_{L,l}$ are topologically conjugate and no one is a factor system of another.
  We generalize the concept of $k$th power-free integers to sieves and study the resulting admissible shift spaces.</description>

      <title>How more data can hurt: Instability and regularization in next-generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been found recently that more data can, counter-intuitively, hurt the performance of deep neural networks. Here, we show that a more extreme version of the phenomenon occurs in data-driven models of dynamical systems. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training. Our results highlight the importance of proper regularization in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09146v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces an advanced Koopman mode decomposition (KMD) technique -- coined Featurized Koopman Mode Decomposition (FKMD) -- that uses delay embedding and a learned Mahalanobis distance to enhance analysis and prediction of high dimensional dynamical systems. The delay embedding expands the observation space to better capture underlying manifold structure, while the Mahalanobis distance adjusts observations based on the system's dynamics. This aids in featurizing KMD in cases where good features are not a priori known. We show that FKMD improves predictions for a high-dimensional linear oscillator, a high-dimensional Lorenz attractor that is partially observed, and a cell signaling problem from cancer research.</description>

Abstract: Recently, M. Tsukamoto (New approach to weighted topological entropy and pressure, Ergod. Theory Dyn. Syst. 43 (2023) 1004-1034) used a new approach to define the weighted topological entropy and pressure. Inspired by his ideas, we introduce the relative weighted topological and entropy for factors and establish several variational principles. One of these results answers a question raised by D. Feng and W. Huang (Variational principle for weighted topological pressure, J. Math. Pures Appl. 106 (2016) 411-452) which positively answers that there is a relative version of the weighted variation principle. Furthermore, we generalize the Ledrappier and Walters' type relative variational principle to the weighted version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fine local scaling properties of a class of self-affine fractal sets called Gatzouras-Lalley carpets. More precisely, we establish a formula for the Assouad spectrum of all Gatzouras-Lalley carpets as the concave conjugate of an explicit piecewise-analytic function combined with a simple parameter change. Our formula implies a number of novel properties for the Assouad spectrum not previously observed for dynamically invariant sets; in particular, the Assouad spectrum can be a non-trivial differentiable function on the entire domain $(0,1)$ and can be strictly concave on open intervals. Our proof introduces a general framework for covering arguments using techniques developed in the context of multifractal analysis, including the method of types from large deviations theory and Lagrange duality from optimisation theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Marden's Theorem from geometric theory of polynomials, we show that for every triangle there is a unique ellipse such that the triangle is a billiard trajectory within that ellipse. Since $3$-periodic trajectories of billiards within ellipses are examples of the Poncelet polygons, our considerations provide a new insight into the relationship between Marden's Theorem and the Poncelet Porism, two gems of exceptional classical beauty. We also show that every parallelogram is a billiard trajectory within a unique ellipse. We prove a similar result for the self-intersecting polygonal lines consisting of two pairs of congruent sides, named "Darboux butterflies". In each of three considered cases, we effectively calculate the foci of the boundary ellipses.</description>

Abstract: A subset $R$ of integers is a set of Bohr recurrence if every rotation on $\mathbb{T}^d$ returns arbitrarily close to zero under some non-zero multiple of $R$. We show that the set $\{k!\, 2^m3^n\colon k,m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is a set of Bohr recurrence. This is a particular case of a more general statement about images of such sets under any integer polynomial with zero constant term. We also show that if $P$ is a real polynomial with at least one non-constant irrational coefficient, then the set $\{P(2^m3^n)\colon m,n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is dense in $\mathbb{T}$, thus providing a joint generalization of two well-known results, one of Furstenberg and one of Weyl.</description>

      <title>GIT stability of linear maps on projective space with marked points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct moduli spaces of linear self-maps of projective space with marked points, up to projective equivalence. That is, we let the special linear group act simultaneously by conjugation on projective linear maps and diagonally on $(\mathbb{P}^N)^n$, and we take the geometric invariant theory (GIT) quotient. These moduli spaces arise in algebraic dynamics and integrable systems. Our main result is a dynamical characterization of the GIT semistable and stable loci in the space of linear maps $T$ with marked points. We show that GIT stability can be checked by counting the marked points on flags with certain Hessenberg functions relative to $T$. The proof is combinatorial: to describe the weight polytopes for this action, we compute the vertices and facets of certain convex polyhedra generated by roots of the $A_N$ lattice.</description>

      <title>The logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the logarithmic analogue of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces. This operator is intrinsically defined with spectral properties analogous to those of elliptic pseudo-differential operators on Riemannian manifolds. Specifically, its heat semigroup consists of compact operators which are trace-class after some critical point in time. Moreover, its domain is a Banach module over the Dini continuous functions and every H\"older continuous function is a smooth vector. Finally, the operator is compatible, in the sense of noncommutative geometry, with the action of a large class of non-isometric homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>The Poisson boundary of wreath products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the Poisson boundary of wreath products $A\wr B= \bigoplus_{B} A\rtimes B$ of countable groups $A$ and $B$, for probability measures $\mu$ with finite entropy where lamp configurations stabilize almost surely. If, in addition, the projection of $\mu$ to $B$ is Liouville, we prove that the Poisson boundary of $(A\wr B,\mu)$ is equal to the space of limit lamp configurations, endowed with the corresponding hitting measure. In particular, this answers an open question asked by Kaimanovich, and Lyons-Peres, for $B=\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\ge 3$, and measures $\mu$ with a finite first moment.</description>

      <title>Variationally consistent Hamiltonian model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Though ubiquitous as first-principles models for conservative phenomena, Hamiltonian systems present numerous challenges for model reduction even in relatively simple, linear cases. Here, we present a method for the projection-based model reduction of canonical Hamiltonian systems that is variationally consistent for any choice of linear reduced basis: Hamiltonian models project to Hamiltonian models. Applicable in both intrusive and nonintrusive settings, the proposed method is energy-conserving and symplectic, with error provably decomposable into a data projection term and a term measuring deviation from canonical form. Examples from linear elasticity with realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the advantages of a variationally consistent approach, highlighting the steady convergence exhibited by consistent models where previous methods reliant on inconsistent techniques or specially designed bases exhibit unacceptably large errors.</description>
