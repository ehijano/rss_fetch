      <title>Primitive Euler brick generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The smallest Euler brick, discovered by Paul Halcke, has edges $(177, 44, 240) $ and face diagonals $(125, 267, 244 ) $, generated by the primitive Pythagorean triple $ (3, 4, 5) $. Let $ (u,v,w) $ primitive Pythagorean triple, Sounderson made a generalization parameterization of the edges \begin{equation*} a = \vert u(4v^2 - w^2) \vert, \quad b = \vert v(4u^2 - w^2)\vert, \quad c = \vert 4uvw \vert \end{equation*} give face diagonals \begin{equation*} {\displaystyle d=w^{3},\quad e=u(4v^{2}+w^{2}),\quad f=v(4u^{2}+w^{2})} \end{equation*} leads to an Euler brick. Finding other formulas that generate these primitive bricks, other than formula above, or making initial guesses that can be improved later, is the key to understanding how they are generated.</description>

      <title>Introduction to generalized Leonardo-Alwyn hybrid numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Go}, G\"okba\c{s} defined a new type of number sequence called Leonardo-Alwyn sequence. In this paper, we consider the generalized Leonardo-Alwyn hybrid numbers and investigate some of their properties. We also give some applications related to the generalized Leonardo-Alwyn hybrid numbers in matrices.</description>

      <title>Small Prime $k$th Power Residues and Nonresidues in Arithmetic Progressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a large odd prime, let $x=(\log p)^{1+\varepsilon}$ and let $q\ll\log\log p$ be an integer, where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is a small number. This note proves the existence of small prime quadratic residues and prime quadratic nonresidues in the arithmetic progression $a+qm\ll x$, with relatively prime $1\leq a&lt;q$, unconditionally. The same results are generalized to small prime $k$th power residues and nonresidues, where $k\mid p-1$ and $k\ll\log\log p$.</description>

      <title>Padovan and Perrin Hyperbolic Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we intend to bring together Padovan and Perrin number sequences, which are one of the most popular third-order recurrence sequences, and hyperbolic spinors, which are used in several disciplines from physics to mathematics, with the help of the split quaternions. This paper especially improves the relationship between hyperbolic spinors both a physical and mathematical concept, and number theory. For this aim, we combine the hyperbolic spinors and Padovan and Perrin numbers concerning the split Padovan and Perrin quaternions, and we determine two new special recurrence sequences named Padovan and Perrin hyperbolic spinors. Then, we give Binet formulas, generating functions, exponential generating functions, Poisson generating functions, and summation formulas. Additionally, we present some matrix and determinant equations with respect to them. Then, we construct some numerical algorithms for these special number systems, as well. Further, we give an introduction for $(s,t)$-Padovan and $(s,t)$-Perrin hyperbolic spinors.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tribonacci Hyperbolic Spinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the generalized Tribonacci hyperbolic spinors and properties of this new special numbers system by the generalized Tribonacci numbers, which are one of the most general form of the third-order recurrence sequences, generalized Tribonacci quaternions, and hyperbolic spinors, which have quite an importance and framework from mathematics to physics. This study especially improves the relations between the hyperbolic spinors and generalized Tribonacci numbers with the help of the generalized Tribonacci split quaternions. Furthermore, we examine some special cases of them and construct both new equalities and fundamental properties such as recurrence relation, Binet formula, generating function, exponential generating function, Poisson generating function, summation formulas, special determinant properties, matrix formula, and special determinant equations. Also, we give some numerical algorithms with respect to the obtained materials. In addition to these, we give a brief introduction for further research: generalized Tribonacci polynomial hyperbolic spinor sequence.</description>

      <title>New identities for the Laplace, Glasser, and Widder potential transforms and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we begin by applying the Laplace transform to derive closed forms for several challenging integrals that seem nearly impossible to evaluate. By utilizing the solution to the Pythagorean equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$, these closed forms become even more intriguing. This method allows us to provide new integral representations for the error function. Following this, we use the Fourier transform to derive formulas for the Glasser and Widder potential transforms, leading to several new and interesting corollaries. As part of the applications, we demonstrate the use of one of these integral formulas to provide a new real analytic proof of Euler's reflection formula for the gamma function. Of particular interest is a generalized integral involving the Riemann zeta function, which we also present as an application.</description>
