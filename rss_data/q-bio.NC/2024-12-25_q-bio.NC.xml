      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks can predict the surgery outcome in temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epilepsy surgery, particularly for temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), remains a vital treatment option for patients with drug-resistant seizures. However, accurately predicting surgical outcomes remains a significant challenge. This study introduces a novel biomarker derived from brain connectivity changes caused by TLE surgery, analyzed using hyperbolic graph embeddings, to predict surgical success. Using structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from 51 patients, we examined differences in structural connectivity networks associated to surgical outcomes. Our approach uniquely leveraged hyperbolic Poincare disk embeddings of pre- and post-surgery brain networks, successfully distinguishing patients with favorable outcomes from those with poor outcomes. Notably, the method identified regions in the contralateral hemisphere relative to the epileptogenic zone, whose connectivity patterns emerged as a potential biomarker for favorable surgical outcomes. To validate the model, we employed a leave-one-out cross-validation approach, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 and a balanced accuracy of 0.81. These results underscore the predictive capability of our model and its effectiveness in individual outcome forecasting based on structural network changes. Our findings highlight the use of non-Euclidean hyperbolic graph embeddings to analyze brain networks, offering deeper insights into connectivity alterations in epilepsy, and advancing personalized prediction of surgical outcomes in TLE.</description>

      <title>The same but different: impact of animal facility sanitary status on a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gut-brain axis has emerged as a key player in the regulation of brain function and cognitive health. Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been observed in preclinical models of Alzheimer's disease and patients. Manipulating the composition of the gut microbiota enhances or delays neuropathology and cognitive deficits in mouse models. Accordingly, the health status of the animal facility may strongly influence these outcomes. In the present study, we longitudinally analysed the faecal microbiota composition and amyloid pathology of 5XFAD mice housed in a specific opportunistic pathogen-free (SOPF) and a conventional facility. The composition of the microbiota of 5XFAD mice after aging in conventional facility showed marked differences compared to WT littermates that were not observed when the mice were bred in SOPF facility.
  The development of amyloid pathology was also enhanced by conventional housing. We then transplanted faecal microbiota (FMT) from both sources into wild-type (WT) mice and measured memory performance, assessed in the novel object recognition test, in transplanted animals. Mice transplanted with microbiota from conventionally bred 5XFAD mice showed impaired memory performance, whereas FMT from mice housed in SOPF facility did not induce memory deficits in transplanted mice. Finally, 18 weeks of housing SOPF-born animals in a conventional facility resulted in the reappearance of specific microbiota compositions in 5XFAD vs WT mice. In conclusion, these results show a strong impact of housing conditions on microbiota-associated phenotypes and question the relevance of breeding preclinical models in specific pathogen-free (SPF) facilities.</description>

      <title>Low count of optically pumped magnetometers furnishes a reliable real-time access to sensorimotor rhythm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an analysis of sensorimotor rhythms using an advanced, optically-pumped magnetoencephalography (OPM-MEG) system - a novel and rapidly developing technology. We conducted real-movement and motor imagery experiments with nine participants across two distinct magnetically-shielded environments: one featuring an analog active suppression system and the other a digital implementation. Our findings demonstrate that, under optimal recording conditions, OPM sensors provide highly informative signals, suitable for use in practical motor imagery brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. We further examine the feasibility of a portable, low-sensor-count OPM-based BCI under varied experimental setups, highlighting its potential for real-time control of external devices via user intentions.</description>

      <title>Statistical physics of large-scale neural activity with loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As experiments advance to record from tens of thousands of neurons, statistical physics provides a framework for understanding how collective activity emerges from networks of fine-scale correlations. While modeling these populations is tractable in loop-free networks, neural circuitry inherently contains feedback loops of connectivity. Here, for a class of networks with loops, we present an exact solution to the maximum entropy problem that scales to very large systems. This solution provides direct access to information-theoretic measures like the entropy of the model and the information contained in correlations, which are usually inaccessible at large scales. In turn, this allows us to search for the optimal network of correlations that contains the maximum information about population activity. Applying these methods to 45 recordings of approximately 10,000 neurons in the mouse visual system, we demonstrate that our framework captures more information -- providing a better description of the population -- than existing methods without loops. For a given population, our models perform even better during visual stimulation than spontaneous activity; however, the inferred interactions overlap significantly, suggesting an underlying neural circuitry that remains consistent across stimuli. Generally, we construct an optimized framework for studying the statistical physics of large neural populations, with future applications extending to other biological networks.</description>

      <title>The Thousand Brains Project: A New Paradigm for Sensorimotor Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced rapidly in the last decade, driven primarily by progress in the scale of deep-learning systems. Despite these advances, the creation of intelligent systems that can operate effectively in diverse, real-world environments remains a significant challenge. In this white paper, we outline the Thousand Brains Project, an ongoing research effort to develop an alternative, complementary form of AI, derived from the operating principles of the neocortex. We present an early version of a thousand-brains system, a sensorimotor agent that is uniquely suited to quickly learn a wide range of tasks and eventually implement any capabilities the human neocortex has. Core to its design is the use of a repeating computational unit, the learning module, modeled on the cortical columns found in mammalian brains. Each learning module operates as a semi-independent unit that can model entire objects, represents information through spatially structured reference frames, and both estimates and is able to effect movement in the world. Learning is a quick, associative process, similar to Hebbian learning in the brain, and leverages inductive biases around the spatial structure of the world to enable rapid and continual learning. Multiple learning modules can interact with one another both hierarchically and non-hierarchically via a "cortical messaging protocol" (CMP), creating more abstract representations and supporting multimodal integration. We outline the key principles motivating the design of thousand-brains systems and provide details about the implementation of Monty, our first instantiation of such a system.

      <title>Towards the Automatic Detection of Vection in Virtual Reality Using EEG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vection, the visual illusion of self-motion, provides a strong marker of the VR user experience and plays an important role in both presence and cybersickness. Traditional measurements have been conducted using questionnaires, which exhibit inherent limitations due to their subjective nature and preventing real-time adjustments. Detecting vection in real time would allow VR systems to adapt to users' needs, improving comfort and minimizing negative effects like motion sickness. This paper investigates the presence of vection markers in electroencephalogram (EEG) brain signals using evoked potentials (brain responses to external stimulations).
  We designed a VR experiment that induces vection using two conditions: (1) forward acceleration or (2) backward acceleration. We recorded both electroencephalographic (EEG) signals and gathered subjective reports on thirty (30) participants. We found an evoked potential of vection characterized by a positive peak around 600 ms (P600) after stimulus onset in the parietal region and a simultaneous negative peak in the frontal region. Our results also found participant variability in sensitivity to vection and cybersickness and EEG markers of acceleration across subjects. This result is promising for potential detection of vection using EEG and paves the way for future studies towards a better understanding of vection. It also provides insights into the functional role of the visual system and its integration with the vestibular system during motion-perception. It has the potential to help enhance VR user experience by qualifying users' perceived vection and adapting the VR environments accordingly.</description>
