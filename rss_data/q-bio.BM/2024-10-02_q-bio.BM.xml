      <title>Geometric shape matching for recovering protein conformations from single-particle Cryo-EM data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address recovery of the three-dimensional backbone structure of single polypeptide proteins from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (Cryo-SPA) data. Cryo-SPA produces noisy tomographic projections of electrostatic potentials of macromolecules. From these projections, we use methods from shape analysis to recover the three-dimensional backbone structure. Thus, we view the reconstruction problem as an indirect matching problem, where a point cloud representation of the protein backbone is deformed to match 2D tomography data. The deformations are obtained via the action of a matrix Lie group. By selecting a deformation energy, the optimality conditions are obtained, which lead to computational algorithms for optimal deformations. We showcase our approach on synthetic data, for which we recover the three-dimensional structure of the backbone.</description>

      <title>Response of Worm-like Chains to Traveling-Wave Active Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified theory for semiflexible flagella under the action of a traveling-wave perturbation that emulates the organized active forces generated by molecular motors, capable of inducing beating patterns to the filament. By modeling the flagellum as a worm-like chain (WLC), we explore the interplay (competition) between the externally applied perturbation and the intrinsic bending rigidity of the filament. Our analysis aims to understand how this interplay can lead to a selection of conformations with the spatiotemporal behavior resembling the beating dynamics of axonemes such as those in sperm tails, in Chlamydomonas cilia, or eukaryotic flagella in general. Through a systematic analysis of the WLC's response to traveling-wave perturbations, we try to identify the key parameters that mostly influence the flagellar motion and shape its beating-like profiles.</description>

      <title>Classifier-free graph diffusion for molecular property targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the task of property targeting: that is, generating molecules conditioned on target chemical properties to expedite candidate screening for novel drug and materials development. DiGress is a recent diffusion model for molecular graphs whose distinctive feature is allowing property targeting through classifier-based (CB) guidance. While CB guidance may work to generate molecular-like graphs, we hint at the fact that its assumptions apply poorly to the chemical domain. Based on this insight we propose a classifier-free DiGress (FreeGress), which works by directly injecting the conditioning information into the training process. CF guidance is convenient given its less stringent assumptions and since it does not require to train an auxiliary property regressor, thus halving the number of trainable parameters in the model. We empirically show that our model yields up to 79% improvement in Mean Absolute Error with respect to DiGress on property targeting tasks on QM9 and ZINC-250k benchmarks. As an additional contribution, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to improve chemical validity of generated samples, based on the observation that certain chemical properties such as molecular weight correlate with the number of atoms in molecules.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of docking methods within the broadly applicable context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for applicability to unknown structures); (2) docking multiple ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for unknown pocket generalization). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for broadly applicable protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL docking methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure generation using both single and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that (1) DL methods consistently outperform conventional docking algorithms; (2) most recent DL docking methods fail to generalize to multi-ligand protein targets; and (3) training DL methods with physics-informed loss functions on diverse clusters of protein-ligand complexes is a promising direction for future work. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</description>
