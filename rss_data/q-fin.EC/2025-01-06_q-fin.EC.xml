      <title>Analyzing Country-Level Vaccination Rates and Determinants of Practical Capacity to Administer COVID-19 Vaccines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 vaccine development, manufacturing, transportation, and administration proved an extreme logistics operation of global magnitude. Global vaccination levels, however, remain a key concern in preventing the emergence of new strains and minimizing the impact of the pandemic's disruption of daily life. In this paper, country-level vaccination rates are analyzed through a queuing framework to extract service rates that represent the practical capacity of a country to administer vaccines. These rates are further characterized through regression and interpretable machine learning methods with country-level demographic, governmental, and socio-economic variates. Model results show that participation in multi-governmental collaborations such as COVAX may improve the ability to vaccinate. Similarly, improved transportation and accessibility variates such as roads per area for low-income countries and rail lines per area for high-income countries can improve rates. It was also found that for low-income countries specifically, improvements in basic and health infrastructure (as measured through spending on healthcare, number of doctors and hospital beds per 100k, population percent with access to electricity, life expectancy, and vehicles per 1000 people) resulted in higher vaccination rates. Of the high-income countries, those with larger 65-plus populations struggled to vaccinate at high rates, indicating potential accessibility issues for the elderly. This study finds that improving basic and health infrastructure, focusing on accessibility in the last mile, particularly for the elderly, and fostering global partnerships can improve logistical operations of such a scale. Such structural impediments and inequities in global health care must be addressed in preparation for future global public health crises.</description>

      <title>Agency-Driven Labor Theory: A Framework for Understanding Human Work in the AI Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Agency-Driven Labor Theory as a new theoretical framework for understanding human work in AI-augmented environments. While traditional labor theories have focused primarily on task execution and labor time, ADLT proposes that human labor value is increasingly derived from agency - the capacity to make informed judgments, provide strategic direction, and design operational frameworks for AI systems. The paper presents a mathematical framework expressing labor value as a function of agency quality, direction effectiveness, and outcomes, providing a quantifiable approach to analyzing human value creation in AI-augmented workplaces. Drawing on recent work in organizational economics and knowledge worker productivity, ADLT explains how human workers create value by orchestrating complex systems that combine human and artificial intelligence. The theory has significant implications for job design, compensation structures, professional development, and labor market dynamics. Through applications across various sectors, the paper demonstrates how ADLT can guide organizations in managing the transition to AI-augmented operations while maximizing human value creation. The framework provides practical tools for policymakers and educational institutions as they prepare workers for a labor market where value creation increasingly centers on agency and direction rather than execution.</description>

      <title>Dissertation Paths: Advisors and Students in the Economics Research Production Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elite economics PhD programs aim to train graduate students for a lifetime of academic research. This paper asks how advising affects graduate students' post-PhD research productivity. Advising is highly concentrated: at the eight highly-selective schools in our study, a minority of advisors do most of the advising work. We quantify advisor attributes such as an advisor's own research output and aspects of the advising relationship like coauthoring and research field affinity that might contribute to student research success. Students advised by research-active, prolific advisors tend to publish more, while coauthoring has no effect. Student-advisor research affinity also predicts student success. But a school-level aggregate production function provides much weaker evidence of causal effects, suggesting that successful advisors attract students likely to succeed-without necessarily boosting their students' chances of success. Evidence for causal effects is strongest for a measure of advisors' own research output. Aggregate student research output appears to scale linearly with graduate student enrollment, with no evidence of negative class-size effects. An analysis of gender differences in research output shows male and female graduate students to be equally productive in the first few years post-PhD, but female productivity peaks sooner than male productivity.</description>

      <title>Vulnerabilities and capabilities in the EU Automotive industry: Leveraging Input-Output Analysis and Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structural vulnerabilities and competitive dynamics of the EU27 automotive sector, with a focus on the complexity and the fragmentation of production processes across global value chains. Employing a mixed-methods approach, our analysis integrates input-output tables to quantify the sector's reliance on non-EU economic branches, alongside an economic complexity framework to assess the underlying productive capabilities of European countries in automotive-related industries. The findings indicate an increasing dependency on extra-EU suppliers, particularly China, for critical components such as lithium-ion batteries, which heightens supply chain risks. Currently, Eastern European countries-most notably Poland, Czechia, and Hungary-have enhanced their competitiveness in the production of automotive components, surpassing traditional leaders such as Germany. The paper advances the literature by providing a novel, granular list of 6-digit products within the automotive supply chain and offers new insights into the challenges posed by the ongoing electric mobility transition in the European Union, particularly in relation to electric accumulators.</description>

      <title>ESG Rating Disagreement and Corporate Total Factor Productivity:Inference and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13895v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines how ESG rating disagreement (Dis) affects corporate total factor productivity (TFP) in China based on data of A-share listed companies from 2015 to 2022. We find that Dis reduces TFP, especially in state-owned, non-capital-intensive, low-pollution and high-tech firms, green innovation strengthens the dampening effect of Dis on TFP, and that Dis lowers corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints and weakening human capital. Furthermore, XGBoost regression demonstrates that Dis plays a significant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP showing that the dampening effect of ESG rating disagreement on TFP is still pronounced in firms with large Dis values.</description>

      <title>Can AI Help with Your Personal Finances?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a transformative development in artificial intelligence (AI), drawing significant attention from industry and academia. Trained on vast datasets, these sophisticated AI systems exhibit impressive natural language processing and content generation capabilities. This paper explores the potential of LLMs to address key challenges in personal finance, focusing on the United States. We evaluate several leading LLMs, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and Meta's Llama, to assess their effectiveness in providing accurate financial advice on topics such as mortgages, taxes, loans, and investments. Our findings show that while these models achieve an average accuracy rate of approximately 70%, they also display notable limitations in certain areas. Specifically, LLMs struggle to provide accurate responses for complex financial queries, with performance varying significantly across different topics. Despite these limitations, the analysis reveals notable improvements in newer versions of these models, highlighting their growing utility for individuals and financial advisors. As these AI systems continue to evolve, their potential for advancing AI-driven applications in personal finance becomes increasingly promising.</description>
