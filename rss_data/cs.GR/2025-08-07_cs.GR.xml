      <title>RLGS: Reinforcement Learning-Based Adaptive Hyperparameter Tuning for Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT) dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.</description>

      <title>Radiance Fields in XR: A Survey on How Radiance Fields are Envisioned and Addressed for XR Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04326v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of radiance fields (RF), such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), has revolutionized interactive photorealistic view synthesis and presents enormous opportunities for XR research and applications. However, despite the exponential growth of RF research, RF-related contributions to the XR community remain sparse. To better understand this research gap, we performed a systematic survey of current RF literature to analyze (i) how RF is envisioned for XR applications, (ii) how they have already been implemented, and (iii) the remaining research gaps. We collected 365 RF contributions related to XR from computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, multimedia, human-computer interaction, and XR communities, seeking to answer the above research questions. Among the 365 papers, we performed an analysis of 66 papers that already addressed a detailed aspect of RF research for XR. With this survey, we extended and positioned XR-specific RF research topics in the broader RF research field and provide a helpful resource for the XR community to navigate within the rapid development of RF research.</description>

      <title>Surf3R: Rapid Surface Reconstruction from Sparse RGB Views in Seconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.</description>

      <title>MienCap: Realtime Performance-Based Facial Animation with Live Mood Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive believable 3D stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining traditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning models, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way. For the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes use of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real time system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the character rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition, intensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be implemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Estimation for Higher-order Differentiable Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive methods to compute higher order differentials (Hessians and Hessian-vector products) of the rendering operator. Our approach is based on importance sampling of a convolution that represents the differentials of rendering parameters and shows to be applicable to both rasterization and path tracing. We further suggest an aggregate sampling strategy to importance-sample multiple dimensions of one convolution kernel simultaneously. We demonstrate that this information improves convergence when used in higher-order optimizers such as Newton or Conjugate Gradient relative to a gradient descent baseline in several inverse rendering tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Photo-Realistic Hand Gesture Generation: from Single View to Multiple View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity hand gesture generation represents a significant challenge in human-centric generation tasks. Existing methods typically employ a single-view mesh-rendered image prior to enhancing gesture generation quality. However, the spatial complexity of hand gestures and the inherent limitations of single-view rendering make it difficult to capture complete gesture information, particularly when fingers are occluded. The fundamental contradiction lies in the loss of 3D topological relationships through 2D projection and the incomplete spatial coverage inherent to single-view representations. Diverging from single-view prior approaches, we propose a multi-view prior framework, named Multi-Modal UNet-based Feature Encoder (MUFEN), to guide diffusion models in learning comprehensive 3D hand information. Specifically, we extend conventional front-view rendering to include rear, left, right, top, and bottom perspectives, selecting the most information-rich view combination as training priors to address occlusion. This multi-view prior with a dedicated dual stream encoder significantly improves the model's understanding of complete hand features. Furthermore, we design a bounding box feature fusion module, which can fuse the gesture localization features and multi-modal features to enhance the location-awareness of the MUFEN features to the gesture-related features. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

      <title>XSpecMesh: Quality-Preserving Auto-Regressive Mesh Generation Acceleration via Multi-Head Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current auto-regressive models can generate high-quality, topologically precise meshes; however, they necessitate thousands-or even tens of thousands-of next-token predictions during inference, resulting in substantial latency. We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for auto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight, multi-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel within a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further propose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies each predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality criteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the lightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging their prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of speculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will be released.</description>

      <title>Neighborhood-Preserving Voronoi Treemaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Voronoi treemaps are used to depict nodes and their hierarchical relationships simultaneously. However, in addition to the hierarchical structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities, frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood preservation.</description>

      <title>READ: Real-time and Efficient Asynchronous Diffusion for Audio-driven Talking Head Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.</description>
