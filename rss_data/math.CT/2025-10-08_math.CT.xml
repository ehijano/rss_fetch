      <title>Geometric Construction of Quiver Tensor Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a classic theorem of Beilinson, the perfect derived category $\operatorname{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$ of projective space is equivalent to the category of derived representations of a certain quiver with relations. The vertex-wise tensor product of quiver representations corresponds to a symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes_{\mathsf{Q}}$ on $\operatorname{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$. We prove that, for a certain choice of equivalence, the symmetric monoidal structure $\otimes_{\mathsf{Q}}$ may be described geometrically as an \emph{extended convolution product} in the sense that the Fourier--Mukai kernel is given by the closure of the torus multiplication map in $(\mathbb{P}^n)^3$. We also set up a general framework for such problems, allowing us to generalize the extended convolution description of quiver tensor products to the case where $\mathbb{P}^n$ is replaced by any smooth complete toric variety of Bondal--Ruan type. Under toric mirror symmetry, this extended convolution product corresponds to the tensor product of constructible sheaves on a real torus. As another generalization of our results for $\mathbb{P}^n$, we show that any finite-dimensional algebra $A$ gives rise to a monoidal structure $\star_A'$ on $\operatorname{Perf}(\mathbb{P}(A))$, providing insights into the moduli of monoidal structures on $\operatorname{Perf}(\mathbb{P}^n)$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Concept Music Score from Quantum Picturalism: Musical Incarnation of a Bell-Pair under Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the development of a new language and theory for quantum music, to which we refer as Quantum Concept Music (QCM). This new music formalism is based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its diagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on ZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.
  Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live performed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily relied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately capture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the fundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based technique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition, but also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new template for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.
  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is powerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in terms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of Western classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different genres and directions.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Eilenberg-Watts theorems for locally compact quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two von Neumann algebras $A$ and $B$, the $W^*$-algebraic Eilenberg-Watts theorem, due to M. Rieffel, asserts that there is a canonical equivalence $\operatorname{Corr}(A,B)\simeq \operatorname{Fun}(\operatorname{Rep}(B), \operatorname{Rep}(A))$ of categories, where $\operatorname{Corr}(A,B)$ denotes the category of all $A$-$B$-correspondences, $\operatorname{Rep}(A)$ is the category of all unital normal $*$-representations of $A$ on Hilbert spaces and $\operatorname{Fun}(\operatorname{Rep}(B), \operatorname{Rep}(A))$ denotes the category of all normal $*$-functors $\operatorname{Rep}(B)\to \operatorname{Rep}(A)$. In this paper, we upgrade the von Neumann algebras $A$ and $B$ with actions $A\curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ and $B\curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ of a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$, and we provide several equivariant versions of the $W^*$-algebraic Eilenberg-Watts theorem using the language of module categories. We also prove that for a locally compact quantum group $\mathbb{G}$ with Drinfeld double $D(\mathbb{G})$, the category of unitary $D(\mathbb{G})$-representations is isomorphic to the Drinfeld center of $\operatorname{Rep}(\mathbb{G})$, generalizing a result by Neshveyev-Yamashita from the compact to the locally compact setting.</description>

      <title>An algebra modality admitting countably many deriving transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A differential category is an additive symmetric monoidal category, that is, a symmetric monoidal category enriched over commutative monoids, with an algebra modality, axiomatizing smooth functions, and a deriving transformation on this algebra modality, axiomatizing differentiation. Lemay proved that a comonoidal algebra modality has at most one deriving transformation, thus differentiation is unique in models of differential linear logic. It was then an open problem whether this result extends to arbitrary algebra modalities. We answer this question in the negative. We build a free "commutative rig with a self-map" algebra modality on the category of commutative monoids, where the self-map can be seen as an arbitrary smooth function. We then define a countable family of distinct deriving transformations $({}_{n}\mathsf{d})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ on this algebra modality where the parameter $n$ controls the derivative of the self-map. It shows that in a differential category, a single algebra modality may admit multiple, inequivalent notions of differentiation.</description>

      <title>A categorical account of composition methods in logic (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06664v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a categorical theory of the composition methods in finite model theory -- a key technique enabling modular reasoning about complex structures by building them out of simpler components. The crucial results required by the composition methods are Feferman--Vaught--Mostowski (FVM) type theorems, which characterize how logical equivalence behaves under composition and transformation of models.
  Our results are developed by extending the recently introduced game comonad semantics for model comparison games. This level of abstraction allow us to give conditions yielding FVM type results in a uniform way. Our theorems are parametric in the classes of models, logics and operations involved. Furthermore, they naturally account for the existential and positive existential fragments, and extensions with counting quantifiers of these logics. We also reveal surprising connections between FVM type theorems, and classical concepts in the theory of monads.
  We illustrate our methods by recovering many classical theorems of practical interest, including a refinement of a previous result by Dawar, Severini, and Zapata concerning the 3-variable counting logic and cospectrality. To highlight the importance of our techniques being parametric in the logic of interest, we prove a family of FVM theorems for products of structures, uniformly in the logic in question, which cannot be done using specific game arguments.
  This is an extended version of the LiCS 2023 conference paper of the same name.</description>

      <title>Description of the structure of DG--algebras via characters on a groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a description of graded derivations in group algebras. Using this result for arbitrary graduation of the group algebra, we describe all possible structures of DG algebras. The corresponding examples are given. The description is given in terms of characters on a groupoid analogous to the groupoid of inner action.</description>

      <title>Higher-form symmetries as higher automorphism bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of global higher-form symmetries has received much attention, but leaves room for a more systematic mathematical formulation. In this article, we highlight the concept of higher automorphism bundles from the field of higher categorical differential geometry and higher gauge theory, and we demonstrate that this neatly reproduces and clarifies many examples and phenomena discussed in the literature. We rigorously construct the higher-form symmetries of pure gauge theory of a general strict Lie $2$-group, featuring center higher-form symmetries. We then apply this explicitly to several physically-relevant examples, such as $U(1)$ bundles, bundle gerbes, and certain string $2$-groups related to $SU(n)$ instanton restriction, and $5d$ supergravity. We elaborate on the nontrivial interplay between global higher-form symmetries, connection data, and symmetry gauging.</description>
