      <title>Global YouTube Trending Dataset (2022-2025): Three Years of Platform-Curated, Cross-National Trends in Digital Culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On July 1, 2025, YouTube retired its decade-long public "Trending" pages, ending platform-curated, non-personalized video discovery. The Trending list had long served as a vital lens into algorithmic influence, cultural diffusion, and crisis communication globally, offering a rare "ground-truth" reference to study global attention and cultural salience. We present a three-year archival dataset of YouTube Trending videos, collected from July 1, 2022, to June 30, 2025, with four daily snapshots for each of the 104 countries. The dataset includes 446,971 snapshots, each capturing up to 200 trending videos, encompassing 78.4 million video entries (726,627 unique videos) and associated metadata. Each record includes core identifiers (snapshot time, country, rank) and content metadata (video ID, channel ID, title, description, tags, publication date, category, channel name, language, live status, views, and comments). Unlike previous datasets with limited geographic scope or short timeframes, our non-personalized data provides exceptional cross-national and longitudinal coverage for studying digital culture, platform governance, and temporal dynamics in content popularity. We document the data collection methodology, schema design, coverage, descriptive statistics for both global and U.S. trending videos, and the ethical safeguards implemented throughout.</description>

      <title>Hamming Graph Metrics: A Multi-Scale Framework for Structural Redundancy and Uniqueness in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional graph centrality measures effectively quantify node importance but fail to capture the structural uniqueness of multi-scale connectivity patterns -- critical for understanding network resilience and function. This paper introduces \emph{Hamming Graph Metrics (HGM)}, a framework that represents a graph by its exact-$k$ reachability tensor $\mathcal{B}G\in{0,1}^{N\times N\times D}$ with slices $(\mathcal{B}G){:,:,1}=A$ and, for $k\ge 2$, $(\mathcal{B}G){:,:,k}=\mathbf{1}!\left[\sum{t=1}^{k} A^t&gt;0\right]-\mathbf{1}!\left[\sum_{t=1}^{k-1} A^t&gt;0\right]$ (shortest-path distance exactly $k$). Guarantees. (i) \emph{Permutation invariance}: $d_{\mathrm{HGM}}(\pi(G),\pi(H))=d_{\mathrm{HGM}}(G,H)$ for all vertex relabelings $\pi$; (ii) the \emph{tensor Hamming distance} $d_{\mathrm{HGM}}(G,H):=|,\mathcal{B}G-\mathcal{B}H,|{1}=\sum{i,j,k}\mathbf{1}!\big[(\mathcal{B}G){ijk}\neq(\mathcal{B}H){ijk}\big]$ is a \emph{true metric} on labeled graphs; and (iii) \emph{Lipschitz stability} to edge perturbations with explicit degree-dependent constants (see Graph-to-Graph Comparison'' $\to$ Tensor Hamming metric''; ``Stability to edge perturbations''; Appendix A). We develop: (1) \emph{per-scale spectral analysis} via classical MDS on double-centered Hamming matrices $D^{(k)}$, yielding spectral coordinates and explained variances; (2) \emph{summary statistics} for node-wise and graph-level structural dissimilarity; (3) \emph{graph-to-graph comparison} via the metric above; and (4) \emph{analytic properties} including extremal characterizations, multi-scale limits, and stability bounds.</description>

      <title>RoGBot: Relationship-Oblivious Graph-based Neural Network with Contextual Knowledge for Bot Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting automated accounts (bots) among genuine users on platforms like Twitter remains a challenging task due to the evolving behaviors and adaptive strategies of such accounts. While recent methods have achieved strong detection performance by combining text, metadata, and user relationship information within graph-based frameworks, many of these models heavily depend on explicit user-user relationship data. This reliance limits their applicability in scenarios where such information is unavailable. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates detailed textual features with enriched user metadata while employing graph-based reasoning without requiring follower-following data. Our method uses transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) to extract deep semantic embeddings from tweets, which are aggregated using max pooling to form comprehensive user-level representations. These are further combined with auxiliary behavioral features and passed through a GraphSAGE model to capture both local and global patterns in user behavior. Experimental results on the Cresci-15, Cresci-17, and PAN 2019 datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach, achieving accuracies of 99.8%, 99.1%, and 96.8%, respectively, and highlighting its effectiveness against increasingly sophisticated bot strategies.</description>

      <title>JiuTian Chuanliu: A Large Spatiotemporal Model for General-purpose Dynamic Urban Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a window for urban sensing, human mobility contains rich spatiotemporal information that reflects both residents' behavior preferences and the functions of urban areas. The analysis of human mobility has attracted the attention of many researchers. However, existing methods often address specific tasks from a particular perspective, leading to insufficient modeling of human mobility and limited applicability of the learned knowledge in various downstream applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to push massive amounts of human mobility data into a spatiotemporal model, discover latent semantics behind mobility behavior and support various urban sensing tasks. Specifically, a large-scale and widely covering human mobility data is collected through the ubiquitous base station system and a framework named General-purpose and Dynamic Human Mobility Embedding (GDHME) for urban sensing is introduced. The framework follows the self-supervised learning idea and contains two major stages. In stage 1, GDHME treats people and regions as nodes within a dynamic graph, unifying human mobility data as people-region-time interactions. An encoder operating in continuous-time dynamically computes evolving node representations, capturing dynamic states for both people and regions. Moreover, an autoregressive self-supervised task is specially designed to guide the learning of the general-purpose node embeddings. In stage 2, these representations are utilized to support various tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our GDHME framework, we further construct a multi-task urban sensing benchmark. Offline experiments demonstrate GDHME's ability to automatically learn valuable node features from vast amounts of data. Furthermore, our framework is used to deploy the JiuTian ChuanLiu Big Model, a system that has been presented at the 2023 China Mobile Worldwide Partner Conference.</description>

      <title>Detecting sub-populations in online health communities: A mixed-methods exploration of breastfeeding messages in BabyCenter Birth Clubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parental stress is a nationwide health crisis according to the U.S. Surgeon General's 2024 advisory. To allay stress, expecting parents seek advice and share experiences in a variety of venues, from in-person birth education classes and parenting groups to virtual communities, for example, BabyCenter, a moderated online forum community with over 4 million members in the United States alone. In this study, we aim to understand how parents talk about pregnancy, birth, and parenting by analyzing 5.43M posts and comments from the April 2017--January 2024 cohort of 331,843 BabyCenter "birth club" users (that is, users who participate in due date forums or "birth clubs" based on their babies' due dates). Using BERTopic to locate breastfeeding threads and LDA to summarize themes, we compare documents in breastfeeding threads to all other birth-club content. Analyzing time series of word rank, we find that posts and comments containing anxiety-related terms increased steadily from April 2017 to January 2024. We used an ensemble of topic models to identify dominant breastfeeding topics within birth clubs, and then explored trends among all user content versus those who posted in threads related to breastfeeding topics. We conducted Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to identify the most common topics in the full population, as well as within the subset breastfeeding population. We find that the topic of sleep dominates in content generated by the breastfeeding population, as well anxiety-related and work/daycare topics that are not predominant in the full BabyCenter birth club dataset.</description>

      <title>Assessing the influence of social media feedback on traveler's future trip-planning behavior: A multi-model machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the surge of domestic tourism in India and the influence of social media on young tourists, this paper aims to address the research question on how "social return" - responses received on social media sharing - of recent trip details can influence decision-making for short-term future travels. The paper develops a multi-model framework to build a predictive machine learning model that establishes a relationship between a traveler's social return, various social media usage, trip-related factors, and her future trip-planning behavior. The primary data was collected via a survey from Indian tourists. After data cleaning, the imbalance in the data was addressed using a robust oversampling method, and the reliability of the predictive model was ensured by applying a Monte Carlo cross-validation technique. The results suggest at least 75% overall accuracy in predicting the influence of social return on changing the future trip plan. Moreover, the model fit results provide crucial practical implications for the domestic tourism sector in India with future research directions concerning social media, destination marketing, smart tourism, heritage tourism, etc.</description>

      <title>GRAPHIA: Harnessing Social Graph Data to Enhance LLM-Based Social Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in simulating human-like social behaviors. Social graphs provide high-quality supervision signals that encode both local interactions and global network structure, yet they remain underutilized for LLM training. To address this gap, we propose Graphia, the first general LLM-based social graph simulation framework that leverages graph data as supervision for LLM post-training via reinforcement learning. With GNN-based structural rewards, Graphia trains specialized agents to predict whom to interact with (destination selection) and how to interact (edge generation), followed by designed graph generation pipelines. We evaluate Graphia under two settings: Transductive Dynamic Graph Generation (TDGG), a micro-level task with our proposed node-wise interaction alignment metrics; and Inductive Dynamic Graph Generation (IDGG), a macro-level task with our proposed metrics for aligning emergent network properties. On three real-world networks, Graphia improves micro-level alignment by 6.1% in the composite destination selection score, 12% in edge classification accuracy, and 27.9% in edge content BERTScore over the strongest baseline. For macro-level alignment, it achieves 41.11% higher structural similarity and 32.98% better replication of social phenomena such as power laws and echo chambers. Graphia also supports counterfactual simulation, generating plausible behavioral shifts under platform incentives. Our results show that social graphs can serve as high-quality supervision signals for LLM post-training, closing the gap between agent behaviors and network dynamics for LLM-based simulation.

      <title>Rewarding Engagement and Personalization in Popularity-Based Rankings Amplifies Extremism and Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive research, the mechanisms through which online platforms shape extremism and polarization remain poorly understood. We identify and test a mechanism, grounded in empirical evidence, that explains how ranking algorithms can amplify both phenomena. This mechanism is based on well-documented assumptions: (i) users exhibit position bias and tend to prefer items displayed higher in the ranking, (ii) users prefer like-minded content, (iii) users with more extreme views are more likely to engage actively, and (iv) ranking algorithms are popularity-based, assigning higher positions to items that attract more clicks. Under these conditions, when platforms additionally reward \emph{active} engagement and implement \emph{personalized} rankings, users are inevitably driven toward more extremist and polarized news consumption. We formalize this mechanism in a dynamical model, which we evaluate by means of simulations and interactive experiments with hundreds of human participants, where the rankings are updated dynamically in response to user activity.</description>

      <title>Importance of Overlapping Network Nodes in Influence Spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In complex networks there are overlapping substructures or "circles" that consist of nodes belonging to multiple cohesive subgroups. Yet the role of these overlapping nodes in influence spreading processes remains underexplored. In the present study, we analyse networks with circle structures using a probabilistic influence spreading model for processes of simple and complex contagion. We quantify the roles of nodes using three metrics, i.e., In-Centrality, Out-Centrality, and Betweenness Centrality that represent the susceptibility, spreading power, and mediatory role of nodes, respectively, and find that at each stage of the spreading process the overlapping nodes consistently exhibit greater influence than the non-overlapping ones. Furthermore, we observe that the criteria to define circles shape the overlapping effects. When we restrict our analysis to only largest circles, we find that circles reflect not only node-level attributes but also of topological importance. These findings clarify the distinction between local attribute-driven circles and global community structures, thus highlighting the strategic importanc of overlapping nodes in spreading dynamics. This provides foundation for future research on overlapping nodes in both circles and communities.</description>

      <title>Exploring Emergent Topological Properties in Socio-Economic Networks through Learning Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how individual learning behavior and structural dynamics interact is essential to modeling emergent phenomena in socioeconomic networks. While bounded rationality and network adaptation have been widely studied, the role of heterogeneous learning rates both at the agent and network levels remains under explored. This paper introduces a dual-learning framework that integrates individualized learning rates for agents and a rewiring rate for the network, reflecting real-world cognitive diversity and structural adaptability.
  Using a simulation model based on the Prisoner's Dilemma and Quantal Response Equilibrium, we analyze how variations in these learning rates affect the emergence of large-scale network structures. Results show that lower and more homogeneously distributed learning rates promote scale-free networks, while higher or more heterogeneously distributed learning rates lead to the emergence of core-periphery topologies. Key topological metrics including scale-free exponents, Estrada heterogeneity, and assortativity reveal that both the speed and variability of learning critically shape system rationality and network architecture. This work provides a unified framework for examining how individual learnability and structural adaptability drive the formation of socioeconomic networks with diverse topologies, offering new insights into adaptive behavior, systemic organization, and resilience.</description>

      <title>Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs) in Content Analysis: A Practical Guide for Communication Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language, deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development, (2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5) iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research ethics.</description>

      <title>Pair Approximation Meets Reality: Diffusion of Innovation in Organizational Networks within the biased-independence q-Voter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective adaptation, whether in innovation adoption, pro-environmental or organizational change, emerges from the interplay between individual decisions and social influence. Agent-based modeling provides a useful tool for studying such processes. Here, we introduce the biased-independence $q$-voter model, a generalization of the $q$-voter model with independence, one of the most popular agent-based models of opinion dynamics. In our model, individuals choose between two options, adopt or not adopt, under the competing influences of conformity and independent choice. Independent choice between two options is determined by an engagement parameter, inspired by earlier agent-based model of eco-innovation diffusion. When the engagement parameter equals $0.5$, the model reduces to the original $q$-voter model with independence; values different from $0.5$ break the symmetry between the two options. To place our study in a broader context, we briefly review asymmetric versions of the $q$-voter model proposed to date. The novelty of this work goes beyond introducing a generalized model: we develop the pair approximation (PA) for an asymmetric $q$-voter model and, for the first time, validate it on empirical organizational networks. Our results show that the interplay of social influence, independence, and option preference generates discontinuous phase transitions and irreversible hysteresis, reflecting path-dependent adoption dynamics. Surprisingly, the PA agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations on some empirical networks, even small ones, highlighting its potential as a computationally efficient bridge between individual decision-making and collective actions.</description>

      <title>GNN-based Anchor Embedding for Efficient Exact Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00031v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subgraph matching query is a fundamental problem in graph data management and has a variety of real-world applications. Several recent works utilize deep learning (DL) techniques to process subgraph matching queries. Most of them find approximate subgraph matching results without accuracy guarantees. Unlike these DL-based inexact subgraph matching methods, we propose a learning-based exact subgraph matching framework, called \textit{graph neural network (GNN)-based anchor embedding framework} (GNN-AE). In contrast to traditional exact subgraph matching methods that rely on creating auxiliary summary structures online for each specific query, our method indexes small feature subgraphs in the data graph offline and uses GNNs to perform graph isomorphism tests for these indexed feature subgraphs to efficiently obtain high-quality candidates. To make a tradeoff between query efficiency and index storage cost, we use two types of feature subgraphs, namely anchored subgraphs and anchored paths. Based on the proposed techniques, we transform the exact subgraph matching problem into a search problem in the embedding space. Furthermore, to efficiently retrieve all matches, we develop a parallel matching growth algorithm and design a cost-based DFS query planning method to further improve the matching growth algorithm. Extensive experiments on 6 real-world and 3 synthetic datasets indicate that GNN-AE is more efficient than the baselines, especially outperforming the exploration-based baseline methods by up to 1--2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Detecting Coordinated Behaviour on Video-First Platforms: The Challenge of Multimodality and Complex Similarity on TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research on online coordinated behaviour has predominantly focused on text-based social media platforms. However, the rise of video-first platforms such as TikTok introduces distinct challenges. The multimodal nature of video posts, combining visuals, audio, and text, allows for coordination across various modalities and complicates comparison between posts. This paper proposes an approach to detecting coordination that addresses these characteristic challenges. Our methodology, based on multilayer network analysis, is tailored to capture coordination across multiple modalities, and explicitly handles complex forms of similarity inherent in video and audio content. We test this approach on German political posts regarding the 2024 European Elections retrieved via the TikTok Research API. Our results demonstrate the ability of our approach to identify coordination within the constraints of the API, while also critically highlighting potential pitfalls and limitations.</description>

      <title>Equivariance Everywhere All At Once: A Recipe for Graph Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14291v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph machine learning architectures are typically tailored to specific tasks on specific datasets, which hinders their broader applicability. This has led to a new quest in graph machine learning: how to build graph foundation models capable of generalizing across arbitrary graphs and features? In this work, we present a recipe for designing graph foundation models for node-level tasks from first principles. The key ingredient underpinning our study is a systematic investigation of the symmetries that a graph foundation model must respect. In a nutshell, we argue that label permutation-equivariance alongside feature permutation-invariance are necessary in addition to the common node permutation-equivariance on each local neighborhood of the graph. To this end, we first characterize the space of linear transformations that are equivariant to permutations of nodes and labels, and invariant to permutations of features. We then prove that the resulting network is a universal approximator on multisets that respect the aforementioned symmetries. Our recipe uses such layers on the multiset of features induced by the local neighborhood of the graph to obtain a class of graph foundation models for node property prediction. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on 29 real-world node classification datasets, demonstrating both strong zero-shot empirical performance and consistent improvement as the number of training graphs increases.</description>

      <title>Transfer entropy for finite data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transfer entropy is a widely used measure for quantifying directed information flows in complex systems. While the challenges of estimating transfer entropy for continuous data are well known, it has two major shortcomings for data of finite cardinality: it exhibits a substantial positive bias for sparse bin counts, and it has no clear means to assess statistical significance. By computing information content in finite data streams without explicitly considering symbols as instances of random variables, we derive a transfer entropy measure which is asymptotically equivalent to the standard plug-in estimator but remedies these issues for time series of small size and/or high cardinality, permitting a fully nonparametric assessment of statistical significance without simulation.</description>
