      <title>Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. A low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. Simulation results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate hardware prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally verified through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, indoor communication trials are conducted via a pair of software-defined radios which demonstrate superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype. This work presents the first demonstration of a liquid-based ER-FAS in array configuration for enhancing communication systems.</description>

      <title>ReVeal: A Physics-Informed Neural Network for High-Fidelity Radio Environment Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately mapping the radio environment (e.g., identifying wireless signal strength at specific frequency bands and geographic locations) is crucial for efficient spectrum sharing, enabling secondary users (SUs) to access underutilized spectrum bands while protecting primary users (PUs). However, current models are either not generalizable due to shadowing, interference, and fading or are computationally too expensive, limiting real-world applicability. To address the shortcomings of existing models, we derive a second-order partial differential equation (PDE) for the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based on a statistical model used in the literature. We then propose ReVeal (Re-constructor and Visualizer of Spectrum Landscape), a novel Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) that integrates the PDE residual into a neural network loss function to accurately model the radio environment based on sparse RF sensor measurements. ReVeal is validated using real-world measurement data from the rural and suburban areas of the ARA testbed and benchmarked against existing methods.ReVeal outperforms the existing methods in predicting the radio environment; for instance, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of only 1.95 dB, ReVeal achieves an accuracy that is an order of magnitude higher than existing methods such as the 3GPP and ITU-R channel models, ray-tracing, and neural networks. ReVeal achieves both high accuracy and low computational complexity while only requiring sparse RF sampling, for instance, only requiring 30 training sample points across an area of 514 square kilometers.</description>

      <title>SuPreME: A Supervised Pre-training Framework for Multimodal ECG Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings are critical for diagnosing and monitoring cardiac health, but obtaining large-scale annotated ECG datasets is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Recent ECG Self-Supervised Learning (eSSL) methods mitigate this by learning features without extensive labels but fail to capture fine-grained clinical semantics and require extensive task-specific fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose $\textbf{SuPreME}$, a $\textbf{Su}$pervised $\textbf{Pre}$-training framework for $\textbf{M}$ultimodal $\textbf{E}$CG representation learning. SuPreME applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract structured clinical entities from free-text ECG reports, filter out noise and irrelevant content, enhance clinical representation learning, and build a high-quality, fine-grained labeled dataset. By using text-based cardiac queries instead of traditional categorical labels, SuPreME enables zero-shot classification of unseen diseases without additional fine-tuning. We evaluate SuPreME on six downstream datasets covering 127 cardiac conditions, achieving superior zero-shot AUC performance over state-of-the-art eSSL and multimodal methods by over 1.96\%. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of SuPreME in leveraging structured, clinically relevant knowledge for high-quality ECG representations. All code and data will be released upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Nonlinear Transform Coding for Multi-Rate CSI Compression in MIMO-OFDM Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for channel state information (CSI) compression in multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems, where the frequency-domain channel matrix is treated as a high-dimensional complex-valued image. Our method leverages transformer-based nonlinear transform coding (NTC), an advanced deep-learning-driven image compression technique that generates a highly compact binary representation of the CSI. Unlike conventional autoencoder-based CSI compression, NTC optimizes a nonlinear mapping to produce a latent vector while simultaneously estimating its probability distribution for efficient entropy coding. By exploiting the statistical independence of latent vector entries, we integrate a transformer-based deep neural network with a scalar nested-lattice uniform quantization scheme, enabling low-complexity, multi-rate CSI feedback that dynamically adapts to varying feedback channel conditions. The proposed multi-rate CSI compression scheme achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance, outperforming existing techniques with the same number of neural network parameters. Simulation results further demonstrate that our approach provides a superior rate-distortion trade-off, requiring only 6% of the neural network parameters compared to existing methods, making it highly efficient for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>NeRFCom: Feature Transform Coding Meets Neural Radiance Field for Free-View 3D Scene Semantic Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce NeRFCom, a novel communication system designed for end-to-end 3D scene transmission. Compared to traditional systems relying on handcrafted NeRF semantic feature decomposition for compression and well-adaptive channel coding for transmission error correction, our NeRFCom employs a nonlinear transform and learned probabilistic models, enabling flexible variable-rate joint source-channel coding and efficient bandwidth allocation aligned with the NeRF semantic feature's different contribution to the 3D scene synthesis fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that NeRFCom achieves free-view 3D scene efficient transmission while maintaining robustness under adverse channel conditions.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Positioning Under Adverse Conditions: Interference from Unauthorized RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positioning technology, which aims to determine the geometric information of a device in a global coordinate, is a key component in integrated sensing and communication systems. In addition to traditional active anchor-based positioning systems, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) have shown great potential for enhancing system performance. However, their ability to manipulate electromagnetic waves and ease of deployment pose potential risks, as unauthorized RIS may be intentionally introduced to jeopardize the positioning service. Such an unauthorized RIS can cause unexpected interference in the original localization system, distorting the transmitted signals, and leading to degraded positioning accuracy. In this work, we investigate the scenario of RIS-aided positioning in the presence of interference from an unauthorized RIS. Theoretical lower bounds are employed to analyze the impact of unauthorized RIS on channel parameter estimation and positioning accuracy. Several codebook design strategies for unauthorized RIS are evaluated, and various system arrangements are discussed. The simulation results show that an unauthorized RIS path with a high channel gain or a delay similar to that of legitimate RIS paths leads to poor positioning performance. Furthermore, unauthorized RIS generates more effective interference when using directional beamforming codebooks compared to random codebooks.</description>

      <title>On Outage Analysis of OTFS Based LEO-Satellite Systems With HAPS Relaying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) waveform application along with a high altitude platform station (HAPS) relaying for remedying severe Doppler effects in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs). Taking practical challenges into consideration, HAPS is exploited as a decode and forward relay node to mitigate the high path loss between a satellite and a base station (BS). In addition, a maximum ratio transmission scheme with multiple antennas at the LEO-satellite is utilized to maximize Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). A shadowed Rician fading model is employed for the channel realization between the LEO-satellite and the HAPS while Nakagami-m is used between the HAPS and the BS. We derive the closed-form expression of the outage probability (OP) for the end-to-end system. The theoretical and simulation results demonstrate that the OP can significantly decrease when the OTFS order and the number of transmit antennas increase.</description>

      <title>Learning the Topology of a Simplicial Complex Using Simplicial Signals: A Greedy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are ubiquitous to model the irregular (non-Euclidean) structure of complex data, but they are limited to pairwise relationships and fail to model the complexities of the datasets exhibiting higher-order interactions. In that context, simplicial complexes (SCs) are emerging as a tractable candidate to handle such domains. The first step in using SC-based processing and learning schemes is to identify the topology of the SC, which is the problem investigated in this paper. In particular, we assume that we observe a number of signals (features) associated with the nodes of the SC (simplices of order 0) as well as signals (features) associated with a subset of the edges of the SC (simplices of order 1). The goal is then to use these signals to learn the remaining edges as well as the triangles that are filled (simplices of order 2). To address this problem, we assume that the signals are smooth on the unknown SC and that the higher-order relations are sparse. We then postulate the learning problem as a nonconvex optimization and develop an efficient (block-coordinate) algorithm to identify the SC topology.</description>

      <title>Voting Scheme to Strengthen Localization Security in Randomly Deployed Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aspires to provide a trustworthy solution for target localization in adverse environments, where malicious nodes, capable of manipulating distance measurements (i.e., performing spoofing attacks), are present, thus hindering accurate localization. Besides localization, its other goal is to identify (detect) which of the nodes participating in the process are malicious. This problem becomes extremely important with the forthcoming expansion of IoT and smart cities applications, that depend on accurate localization, and the presence of malicious attackers can represent serious security threats if not taken into consideration. This is the case with most existing localization systems which makes them highly vulnerable to spoofing attacks. In addition, existing methods that are intended for adversarial settings consider very specific settings or require additional knowledge about the system model, making them only partially secure. Therefore, this work proposes a novel voting scheme based on clustering and weighted central mass to securely solve the localization problem and detect attackers. The proposed solution has two main phases: 1) Choosing a cluster of suitable points of interest by taking advantage of the problem geometry to assigning votes in order to localize the target, and 2) Attacker detection by exploiting the location estimate and basic statistics. The proposed method is assessed in terms of localization accuracy, success in attacker detection, and computational complexity in different settings. Computer simulations and real-world experiments corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing that it can accomplish an error reduction of $30~\%$ and is capable of achieving almost perfect attacker detection rate when the ratio between attacker intensity and noise standard deviation is significant.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Integrated Sensing and Communication: Principles, Advances, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) combines CF architecture with ISAC. CF employs distributed access points, eliminates cell boundaries, and enhances coverage, spectral efficiency, and reliability. ISAC unifies radar sensing and communication, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing within shared spectral and hardware resources. CF-ISAC leverages these strengths to improve spectral and energy efficiency while enhancing sensing in wireless networks. As a promising candidate for next-generation wireless systems, CF-ISAC supports robust multi-user communication, distributed multi-static sensing, and seamless resource optimization. However, a comprehensive survey on CF-ISAC has been lacking. This paper fills that gap by first revisiting CF and ISAC principles, covering cooperative transmission, radar cross-section, target parameter estimation, ISAC integration levels, sensing metrics, and applications. It then explores CF-ISAC systems, emphasizing their unique features and the benefits of multi-static sensing. State-of-the-art developments are categorized into performance analysis, resource allocation, security, and user/target-centric designs, offering a thorough literature review and case studies. Finally, the paper identifies key challenges such as synchronization, multi-target detection, interference management, and fronthaul capacity and latency. Emerging trends, including next-generation antenna technologies, network-assisted systems, near-field CF-ISAC, integration with other technologies, and machine learning approaches, are highlighted to outline the future trajectory of CF-ISAC research.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Phase Shift Design for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems offer high spectral efficiency (SE) through multiple distributed access points (APs). However, the large number of antennas increases power consumption. We propose incorporating stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) into CF mMIMO systems as a cost-effective, energy-efficient solution. This paper focuses on optimizing the joint power allocation of APs and the phase shift of SIMs to maximize the sum SE. To address this complex problem, we introduce a fully distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm. Our novel algorithm, the noisy value method with a recurrent policy in multi-agent policy optimization (NVR-MAPPO), enhances performance by encouraging diverse exploration under centralized training and decentralized execution. Simulations demonstrate that NVR-MAPPO significantly improves sum SE and robustness across various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Research on Event-Related Desynchronization of Motor Imagery and Movement Based on Localized EEG Cortical Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates event-related desynchronization (ERD) phenomena during motor imagery and actual movement. Using sLORETA software, we analyzed the cortical current source density distributions in Mu and Beta frequency bands for 33 subjects during rest, motor imagery, and actual movement conditions. The results were normalized for analysis. Using sLORETA's statistical tools, paired t-tests were conducted to compare the normalized current source density results between rest and motor imagery, rest and actual movement, and motor imagery and actual movement conditions in both frequency bands. The findings revealed: In both Mu and Beta frequency bands, during motor imagery, significant ERD (P&lt;0.01) was observed in the salience network, supplementary motor area, primary motor area, premotor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and parietofrontal mirror neuron system. During actual movement, significant ERD (P&lt;0.05) was observed in the primary somatosensory cortex, primary motor area, and parietofrontal mirror neuron system in both frequency bands. Comparing motor imagery to actual movement, the current source density in the primary somatosensory cortex and parietofrontal mirror neuron system was higher during motor imagery, though this difference was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). This paper analyzes the factors contributing to these statistical results and proposes preliminary solutions.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning for photoplethysmography analysis: Benchmarking feature, image, and signal-based approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a widely used non-invasive physiological sensing technique, suitable for various clinical applications. Such clinical applications are increasingly supported by machine learning methods, raising the question of the most appropriate input representation and model choice. Comprehensive comparisons, in particular across different input representations, are scarce. We address this gap in the research landscape by a comprehensive benchmarking study covering three kinds of input representations, interpretable features, image representations and raw waveforms, across prototypical regression and classification use cases: blood pressure and atrial fibrillation prediction. In both cases, the best results are achieved by deep neural networks operating on raw time series as input representations. Within this model class, best results are achieved by modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs). but depending on the task setup, shallow CNNs are often also very competitive. We envision that these results will be insightful for researchers to guide their choice on machine learning tasks for PPG data, even beyond the use cases presented in this work.</description>

      <title>On Performance of FAS-aided Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of deploying the fluid antenna system (FAS) on the performance of covert communications. In particular, we focus on a scenario where a transmitter seeks to covertly communicate with a receiver, while a warden attempts to detect the transmission. Both the receiver and the warden are assumed to utilize planar FAS. We derive compact analytical expressions for the covertness outage probability (COP), defined as the complement of the sum of false alarm (FA) and missed detection (MD) probabilities. By determining the optimal detection threshold that maximizes the COP, we characterize the success probability for the legitimate transmission, highlighting the trade-off between covertness and transmission success. Our numerical results confirm that while deploying FAS at the warden enhances its detection ability compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs), equipping the receiver with FAS rather than FPAs significantly improves reception quality, leading to more reliable transmission.</description>

      <title>Are Medium-Sized Transformers Models still Relevant for Medical Records Processing?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become the standard in many NLP applications, we explore the potential of medium-sized pretrained transformer models as a viable alternative for medical record processing. Medical records generated by healthcare professionals during patient admissions remain underutilized due to challenges such as complex medical terminology, the limited ability of pretrained models to interpret numerical data, and the scarcity of annotated training datasets. Objective: This study aims to classify numerical values extracted from medical records into seven distinct physiological categories using CamemBERT-bio. Previous research has suggested that transformer-based models may underperform compared to traditional NLP approaches in this context. Methods: To enhance the performance of CamemBERT-bio, we propose two key innovations: (1) incorporating keyword embeddings to refine the model's attention mechanisms and (2) adopting a number-agnostic strategy by removing numerical values from the text to encourage context-driven learning. Additionally, we assess the criticality of extracted numerical data by verifying whether values fall within established standard ranges. Results: Our findings demonstrate significant performance improvements, with CamemBERT-bio achieving an F1 score of 0.89 - an increase of over 20% compared to the 0.73 F1 score of traditional methods and only 0.06 units lower than GPT-4. These results were obtained despite the use of small and imbalanced training datasets.</description>

      <title>The Role of Explainable AI in Revolutionizing Human Health Monitoring: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07347v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The complex nature of disease mechanisms and the variability of patient symptoms pose significant challenges in developing effective diagnostic tools. Although machine learning (ML) has made substantial advances in medical diagnosis, the decision-making processes of these models often lack transparency, potentially jeopardizing patient outcomes. This review aims to highlight the role of Explainable AI (XAI) in addressing the interpretability issues of ML models in healthcare, with a focus on chronic conditions such as Parkinson's, stroke, depression, cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases to identify studies that applied XAI techniques in healthcare. The search focused on XAI algorithms used in diagnosing and monitoring chronic diseases. The review identified the application of nine trending XAI algorithms, each evaluated for their advantages and limitations in various healthcare contexts. The findings underscore the importance of transparency in ML models, which is crucial for improving trust and outcomes in clinical practice. While XAI provides significant potential to bridge the gap between complex ML models and clinical practice, challenges such as scalability, validation, and clinician acceptance remain. The review also highlights areas requiring further research, particularly in integrating XAI into healthcare systems. The study concludes that XAI methods offer a promising path forward for enhancing human health monitoring and patient care, though significant challenges must be addressed to fully realize their potential in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>MC2SleepNet: Multi-modal Cross-masking with Contrastive Learning for Sleep Stage Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17470v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sleep profoundly affects our health, and sleep deficiency or disorders can cause physical and mental problems. Despite significant findings from previous studies, challenges persist in optimizing deep learning models, especially in multi-modal learning for high-accuracy sleep stage classification. Our research introduces MC2SleepNet (Multi-modal Cross-masking with Contrastive learning for Sleep stage classification Network). It aims to facilitate the effective collaboration between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer architectures for multi-modal training with the help of contrastive learning and cross-masking. Raw single channel EEG signals and corresponding spectrogram data provide differently characterized modalities for multi-modal learning. Our MC2SleepNet has achieved state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of both 84.6% on the SleepEDF-78 and 88.6% accuracy on the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS). These results demonstrate the effective generalization of our proposed network across both small and large datasets.</description>

      <title>Multi-View Contrastive Network (MVCNet) for Motor Imagery Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: An electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI) serves as a direct communication pathway between the human brain and an external device. While supervised learning has been extensively explored for motor imagery (MI) EEG classification, small data quantity has been a key factor limiting the performance of deep feature learning. Methods: This paper proposes a knowledge-driven time-space-frequency based multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet) for MI EEG decoding in BCIs. MVCNet integrates knowledge from the time, space, and frequency domains into the training process through data augmentations from multiple views, fostering more discriminative feature learning of the characteristics of EEG data. We introduce a cross-view contrasting module to learn from different augmented views and a cross-model contrasting module to enhance the consistency of features extracted between knowledge-guided and data-driven models. Results: The combination of EEG data augmentation strategies was systematically investigated for more informative supervised contrastive learning. Experiments on four public MI datasets and three different architectures demonstrated that MVCNet outperformed 10 existing approaches. Significance: Our approach can significantly boost EEG classification performance beyond designated networks, showcasing the potential to enhance the feature learning process for better EEG decoding.</description>

      <title>Localized and Distributed Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with Lossy Interconnections: Modeling and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a key technology to control the communication environment in future wireless networks. Recently, beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) emerged as a generalization of RIS achieving larger coverage through additional tunable impedance components interconnecting the RIS elements. However, conventional RIS and BD-RIS can effectively serve only users in their proximity, resulting in limited coverage. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we investigate distributed RIS, whose elements are distributed over a wide region, in opposition to localized RIS commonly considered in the literature. The scaling laws of distributed BD-RIS reveal that it offers significant gains over distributed conventional RIS and localized BD-RIS, enabled by its interconnections allowing signal propagation within the BD-RIS. To assess the practical performance of distributed BD-RIS, we model and optimize BD-RIS with lossy interconnections through transmission line theory. Our model accounts for phase changes and losses over the BD-RIS interconnections arising when the interconnection lengths are not much smaller than the wavelength. Numerical results show that the performance of localized BD-RIS is only slightly impacted by losses, given the short interconnection lengths. Besides, distributed BD-RIS can achieve orders of magnitude of gains over conventional RIS, even in the presence of low losses.</description>

      <title>Edge-guided inverse design of digital metamaterial-based mode multiplexers for high-capacity multi-dimensional interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The escalating demands of compute-intensive applications urgently necessitate the adoption of optical interconnect technologies to overcome bottlenecks in scaling computing systems. This requires fully exploiting the inherent parallelism of light across scalable dimensions for data loading. Here we experimentally demonstrate a synergy of wavelength- and mode- multiplexing combined with high-order modulation formats to achieve multi-tens-of-terabits-per-second optical interconnects using foundry-compatible silicon photonic circuits. Implementing an edge-guided analog-and-digital optimization method that integrates high efficiency with fabrication robustness, we achieve the inverse design of mode multiplexers based on digital metamaterial waveguides. Furthermore, we employ a packaged five-mode multiplexing chip, achieving a single-wavelength interconnect capacity of 1.62 Tbit s-1 and a record-setting multi-dimensional interconnect capacity of 38.2 Tbit s-1 across 5 modes and 88 wavelength channels, with high-order formats up to 8-ary pulse-amplitude-modulation (PAM). This study highlights the transformative potential of optical interconnect technologies to surmount the constraints of electronic links, thus setting the stage for next-generation datacenter and optical compute interconnects.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Optimization for Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS)/movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to fully exploit the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model, as a simplified implementation of six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA), to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antenna, the proposed RA system can independently and flexibly change the three-dimensional (3D) orientation/boresight of each antenna by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve desired channel realizations. Specifically, we study an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the base station (BS). In the general multi-user and multi-path setup, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles in an iterative manner. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed RA-enabled system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Dual-Polarized Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) is a family of RIS architectures more flexible than conventional RIS. While BD-RIS has been primarily analyzed assuming uni-polarized systems, modern wireless deployments are dual-polarized. To address this gap, this paper investigates the fundamental limits of dual-polarized BD-RIS-aided systems. We derive the scaling laws governing the performance of BD-RIS and the Pareto frontier of the trade-off between performance and circuit complexity enabled by BD-RIS. Theoretical results show that the group-connected RIS with group size 2 provides remarkable gains over conventional RIS in both Rayleigh and line-of-sight (LoS) channels, while maintaining a reduced circuit complexity.</description>
