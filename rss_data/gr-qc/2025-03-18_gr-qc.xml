      <title>Black Hole Action in Einstein's other Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this thesis is to study the gravitational action for the Schwarzschild black hole and its subsequent regularisation from the perspective of general relativity and teleparallel gravity. The standard approach of general relativity requires the Einstein-Hilbert action to be supplemented with the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary term whenever the underlying spacetime contains a boundary. However, the total action is typically divergent, and thus it needs to be regularised by the so-called background subtraction. Next, we consider the teleparallel geometry characterised by the curvature-free teleparallel spin connection, all the while adopting the tetrad formalism. In contrast to general relativity, teleparallel spin connection is however left undetermined by the field equations. We argue that the correct choice of such a connection in principle regularizes the action as equally as the background subtraction, without the need of introducing any additional regulating terms. In the interior region of a black hole, the teleparallel approach agrees completely with the Gibbons-Hawking (GH) method, but in the exterior region, there appears to be a discrepancy in the overall factor of two. We investigate the origin of this problem by testing various frames, including the so-called proper and canonical frames. Finally, we explore the role of singular points in the action and their contributions to the surface terms structure as a possible remedy to this problem.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of spinning black holes in modified gravity through METRICS: The dynamical Chern-Simons gravity case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first precise calculations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode (QNM) frequencies for spinning black holes with dimensionless angular momenta $J/M^2 := a \lesssim 0.75$ in dynamical Chern-Simons gravity. Using the \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS) framework, we compute the QNM frequencies of both axial and polar metric perturbations, focusing on the $nl m = 022$, $033$, and $032$ modes. The METRICS frequencies for the 022 mode achieve numerical uncertainties $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ when $0 \leq a \leq 0.5$ and $\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for $0.5 \leq a \leq 0.75$, without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations. We also derive optimal fitting polynomials to enable efficient and accurate evaluations of the leading-order frequency shifts in these modes. The METRICS frequencies and fitting expressions are a robust and indispensable step toward enabling gravitational-wave ringdown tests of dynamical Chern-Simons gravity.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andersson and Chru\'sciel showed that generic asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets admit polyhomogeneous expansions, and that only a non-generic subclass of solutions of the conformal constraint equations is free of logarithmic singularities. The purpose of this work is twofold. First, within the evolutionary framework of the constraint equations, we show that the existence of a well-defined Bondi mass brings the asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data sets into a subclass whose Cauchy development guaranteed to admit a smooth boundary, by virtue of the results of Andersson and Chru\'sciel. Second, by generalizing a recent result of Beyer and Ritchie, we show that the existence of well-defined Bondi mass and angular momentum, together with some mild restrictions on the free data, implies that the generic solutions of the parabolic-hyperbolic form of the constraint equations are completely free of logarithmic singularities. We also provide numerical evidence to show that in the vicinity of Kerr, asymptotically hyperboloidal initial data without logarithmic singularities can indeed be constructed.</description>

      <title>Resonance locking: radian-level phase shifts due to nonlinear hydrodynamics of $g$-modes in merging neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A neutron star (NS) in a binary system deforms due to the companion's tidal gravitational field. As the binary inspirals due to gravitational wave (GW) emission, the NS's deformation evolves; this evolution is typically modeled as the star's linear response to the companion's time-evolving tidal potential. In principle, the fluid elements' displacements can be excited and evolve nonlinearly since the equations of hydrodynamics and the tidal forcing have nonlinear terms. Recently, Kwon, Yu, and Venumadhav (KYV I [arXiv:2410.03831]) showed that nonlinear terms in the hydrodynamic equations of motion make the low-frequency response of NSs, characterized by gravity ($g$-) modes, behave in an anharmonic manner. The anharmonicity is dominantly generated by the mutual coupling of the four lowest-order ($n=1$, $l=|m|=2$) $g$-modes, and allows them to stay locked in a resonant state that oscillates phase-coherently with the orbit throughout the inspiral. As a result, the $g$-modes grow to larger amplitudes than the linear response suggests, leading to an extra phase correction to the frequency-domain GW signal $|\Delta \Psi|\approx 3\,{\rm rad}$ at a GW frequency of $1.05\,{\rm kHz}$. This effect is part of the truly dynamical tide, in the sense that the amplitude depends not just on the binary's instantaneous frequency but the entire history of the inspiral. In this paper, we explain the phenomenology of resonance locking in detail and analytically validate the numerical dephasing calculations in KYV I. We also demonstrate that the effect is only significant for the lowest-order $g$-modes.</description>

      <title>Free-falling test particles in a charged Kalb-Ramond black hole: gravitational Doppler effect and tidal forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-times exhibiting spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking have recently attracted much attention, with Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity providing a notable example. In this context, we examine the free-fall motion of a test particle toward an electrically charged black hole arising from the coupling of the KR field with the Maxwell one in General Relativity. We investigate how the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter affects the free-fall velocity of the particle as it approaches black hole inner regions. Additionally, we analyze the influence of this parameter on the emission and detection of signals by observers in different frames. We furthermore explore modifications to the radial and angular components of tidal forces in this space-time and compare the results with those obtained for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Finally, we solve the geodesic deviation equation analytically under two different conditions, identifying a subtle effect of the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter in the charged KR metric. These findings provide useful insights on how spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking models influence gravitational dynamics in charged black hole space-times.</description>

      <title>Alexei Starobinsky and wormhole physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alexei Starobinsky is most famous for his great contribution to cosmology, but he has considerable achievements in other branches of gravitational physics and astrophysics, such as the theory of compact objects including black holes and wormholes. In this note, we give a brief review of Alexei's papers devoted to wormhole physics. They mostly concern such issues of common interest as the necessary conditions for wormhole existence in general relativity and its extensions as well as generic properties of some kinds of wormholes. We also extend one of the no-go theorems on thin-shell wormholes to a wider choice of their symmetry and matter content.</description>

      <title>Photon spheres, gravitational lensing/mirroring, and greybody radiation in deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes with phantom global monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the geodesic structure, gravitational lensing/mirroring phenomena, and scalar perturbations of deformed AdS-Schwarzschild black holes with global monopoles, incorporating both ordinary and phantom configurations. We introduce a modified black hole metric characterized by a deformation parameter $\alpha$, a control parameter $\beta$, and a symmetry-breaking scale parameter $\eta$, which collectively influence the spacetime geometry. Through comprehensive geodesic analysis, we determine the photon sphere radius numerically for various parameter configurations, revealing significant differences between ordinary and phantom global monopoles. The stability of timelike circular orbits is assessed via the Lyapunov exponent, demonstrating how these parameters affect orbital dynamics. Our gravitational lensing analysis, employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, reveals a remarkable gravitational mirroring effect in phantom monopole spacetimes at high AdS curvature radii, where light rays experience negative deflection angles-being repelled rather than attracted by the gravitational field. Furthermore, we analyze massless scalar perturbations and derive the corresponding greybody factors, which characterize the transmission of Hawking radiation through the effective potential barrier surrounding the black hole. Our numerical results indicate that phantom global monopoles substantially modify both gravitational lensing/mirroring properties and the radiation spectrum compared to ordinary monopoles. The presence of the deformation parameter $\alpha$ introduces additional complexity to the system, leading to distinct thermodynamic behavior that deviates significantly from the standard AdS-Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high frequency spikes of relic gravitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximal frequency domain of the cosmic gravitons falls in the THz region where, without conflicting with the existing phenomenological bounds, only few particles with opposite (comoving) three-momenta are produced. Although any reliable scrutiny of the ultra-high frequency spikes should include all the sources of late-time suppression at lower and intermediate frequencies, some relevant properties of the averaged multiplicities and of the spectral energy density can be derived within a reduced set of approximations that may become invalid as the frequency decreases well below the Hz. The accuracy of these concurrent approaches is assessed from the properties of the transition matrix that relates the late-time spectra to the values of the mode functions during an inflationary stage. In the obtained framework the bounds on the post-inflationary expansion rate are swiftly deduced and compare quite well with the ones including a more faithful numerical treatment. It also follows that the timeline of the post-inflationary expansion rate might be observationally accessible, in the years to come, provided the electromechanical detectors (like microwave cavities or waveguides) operating between the MHz and the THz shall eventually reach sensitivities in the chirp amplitudes which are (at least) twelve orders of magnitude smaller than the ones experimentally attainable in the audio band (i.e. between few Hz and the kHz).</description>

      <title>Fermion localization in a extra-dimensional $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity with cuscuton dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fermion localization in extra-dimensional $f(Q,\mathcal{T})$ gravity with cuscuton dynamics. This modified gravity theory is based on the nonmetricity scalar $Q$ and on the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. Using the first-order formalism we construct the complete brane system for three well-known superpotentials, namely the Sine-Gordon, the polynomial and the linear one. We show that the addition of the cuscuton term provides significant modifications to the structure of the brane. In particular,
  the scalar field solutions have the form of a kink-like structure, and the energy density is well localized, depending on both the modified-gravity and the cuscuton parameters. Furthermore, applying probabilistic measures, for the location of the fermions for a minimal Yukawa-type coupling we arrive at a Schr\"odinger-like equation allowing for a normalizable massless mode. Our solutions indicate strong brane localization only for left-chirality fermions. Moreover, the massive modes present solutions similar to free waves, which indicates that these fermions probably escape the brane. Finally, we find that massive fermions have a greater sensitivity to gravitational changes in the core of the brane, where oscillations with more pronounced amplitudes are present.</description>

      <title>VSL-Gravity in light of PSR B1913+16 Full Data Set: Upper limits on graviton mass and its theoretical consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very Special Linear Gravity (VSL-Gravity) is an alternative model of linearized gravity that incorporates massive gravitons while retaining only two physical degrees of freedom thanks to gauge invariance. Recently, the gravitational period-decay dynamics of the model has been determined using effective field theory techniques. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the PSR B1913+16 binary pulsar dataset to test the predictions of VSL-Gravity. Our results place a 95\% confidence level upper bound on the graviton mass at $m_g \lesssim 10^{-19} \, \text{eV}/c^2$. Additionally, we observe a significant discrepancy in the predicted mass of one of the binary's companion stars. Lastly, we discuss the broader implications of a non-zero graviton mass, from astrophysical consequences to potential cosmological effects.</description>

      <title>The Science of the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein Telescope (ET) is the European project for a gravitational-wave (GW) observatory of third-generation. In this paper we present a comprehensive discussion of its science objectives, providing state-of-the-art predictions for the capabilities of ET in both geometries currently under consideration, a single-site triangular configuration or two L-shaped detectors. We discuss the impact that ET will have on domains as broad and diverse as fundamental physics, cosmology, early Universe, astrophysics of compact objects, physics of matter in extreme conditions, and dynamics of stellar collapse. We discuss how the study of extreme astrophysical events will be enhanced by multi-messenger observations. We highlight the ET synergies with ground-based and space-borne GW observatories, including multi-band investigations of the same sources, improved parameter estimation, and complementary information on astrophysical or cosmological mechanisms obtained combining observations from different frequency bands. We present advancements in waveform modeling dedicated to third-generation observatories, along with open tools developed within the ET Collaboration for assessing the scientific potentials of different detector configurations. We finally discuss the data analysis challenges posed by third-generation observatories, which will enable access to large populations of sources and provide unprecedented precision.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fluctuations and Bending of Light in Euler-Heisenberg Nonlinear Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work mainly focuses on the nonlinear Euler-Heisenberg theory and its applications from various aspects. Firstly, thermodynamic parameters such as the Hawking temperature, the heat capacity, enthalpy and Gibbs free energy are analytically determined via Smarr's formula for a four-dimensional Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black hole by taking the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy as the basis. The results are also demonstrated graphically for certain Euler-Heisenberg and electric charge parameters, which are in turn used for making further comments on the stability and possible critical points of the concerned black hole. The thermodynamic analyses are then repeated for two distinct cases in which entropy is subject to a $logarithmic$ and an $exponential$ correction, respectively. Our analyses have shown that if one desires to investigate possible phase transitions of the concerned black hole, there exists a unique upper limit for the value the nonlinear Euler-Heisenberg parameter can take for each electric charge parameter, whose value is determined to four significant figures, when possible. For both the classical Hawking-Bekenstein and the logarithmically corrected entropies, these upper limits are found as $\mu&lt;9.143$, $\mu&lt;36.57$, $\mu&lt;82.28$ and $\mu&lt;146.3$ for $q=2,4,6$ and $8$, respectively. For the exponentially corrected case, however, no upper limits could be determined for the NED parameter, as the plots consisted of vertical discrete lines in the positive domain rather than smooth functions with reversed trends. Finally, the one-sided bending angle and the gravitational redshift of light are determined in the vicinity of astronomical structures obeying the nonlinear Euler-Heisenberg model. The results obtained are applied to three electrically charged, compact stars: Vela X-1, SAXJ1808.4-3658 and 4U1820-30.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties and Joule-Thomson expansion of AdS black hole with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12363v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and Joule-Thomson expansion of anti-de Sitter black hole (AdS BH) with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry is systematically studied. The metric of Gaussian-distributed BH is obtained, showing a dS geometry at the core of BH. The research indicates that the BH characterized by a Gaussian distribution exhibit thermodynamic properties that are remarkably similar to those of BH with a Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. This similarity is specifically manifested in the small BH-large BH phase transition, the corrected first law of thermodynamics, the criticality, the heat capacity, the zeroth-order phase transition and the Joule-Thomson process. Notably, the critical ratio of Gaussian-distributed BH (0.46531) is significantly larger than those observed in Van der Waals fluids (0.375), and indeed, it is also substantially exceed those of Lorentzian-distributed BH (0.36671). Moreover, compared to the case of Lorentzian source, the zeroth-order phase transition effect in Gaussian-distributed BH is exceedingly subtle (accompanied by a relative increase in the Gibbs free energy on the order of $10^{-3}\!\sim\!\!10^{-2}$) and is difficult to detect distinctly.</description>

      <title>The Beltrami -- de Sitter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine the well -- known Beltrami -- Klein model of non -- Euclidean geometry on a two -- dimensional disk, where the geodesics are the chords of the disk, with the two -- dimensional de Sitter space. The geometry of the de Sitter space is defined on the complement of the Beltrami -- Klein disk in the plane, with the de Sitter metric being the unique Lorentzian Einstein metric whose light cones form cones tangent to the disk in this complement. This leads to a Beltrami -- de Sitter model on the plane ${\bf R}^2$, which is endowed with the Riemannian Beltrami metric on the disk and the Lorentzian de Sitter metric outside the disk in ${\bf R}^2$.
  We explore the relevance of this model for Penrose's Conformal Cyclic Cosmology, first in the two -- dimensional setting and subsequently in higher dimensions, including the physically significant case of four dimensions. In this context, we define a Radon-like transform between the de Sitter and Beltrami spaces, facilitating the purely geometric transformation of physical fields from the Lorentzian de Sitter space to the Riemannian Beltrami space.
  In the two -- dimensional case, we also uncover a hidden ${\bf G}_2$ symmetry associated with the two -- dimensional de Sitter space, which is related to a vector distribution naturally defined by the geometry of the model. We suggest the potential for discovering similar hidden symmetries in the $n$ -- dimensional Beltrami-de Sitter model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article gives an invariant representation of the curvature of a plane wave spacetime in terms of the Schwarzian of a curve in the Lagrangian Grassmannian. It develops a general theory of cross ratios and Schwarzians of curves in what it terms the middle Grassmannian. Most of the theory is developed in infinite dimensions, where the middle Grassmannian is defined via cocycles on the space of complemented subspaces of a topological vector space. In the case of Hilbert spaces, the middle Grassmannian coincides with the set of closed subspaces whose Hilbert dimension and codimension are the same cardinal. We show how to define the cross ratio of four mutually complementary subspaces, and give some applications to algebraic geometry. We then study differential calculus in the middle Grassmannian of a Banach space over a complete normed field, defining the tangent vector and covector to a curve, followed by the Schwarz invariant. We give a characterization of the vanishing of the Schwarz invariant in terms of hyperbolic structures. Then, we specialize to the case of (real) Hilbert spaces, and define a symplectic structure, which allows us to consider the Grassmannian of Lagrangian subspaces and the Lagrange--Schwarzian of positive curves in the Lagrangian Grassmannian, which we show represents the curvature of a plane wave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon propagators for power-law inflation are constructed in two one-parameter families of noncovariant gauges, in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions. In both gauges photon propagators take relatively simple forms expressed in terms of scalar propagators and their derivatives. These are considerably simpler compared to their general covariant gauge counterpart. This makes feasible performing dimensionally regulated loop computations involving massless vector fields in inflation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the shadow and energy emission rate of a charged AdS black hole in massive gravity. We develop a new prescription based on maximum frequencies of emission spectrum to probe the thermodynamics of black holes and get an accurate insight into its phase transition criticality. We establish a link between the thermodynamic behavior and the maximum emission frequency of the black hole for both the photons and massive bosonic modes. We show that the frequency maximizing the spectrum combined to the shadow radius can serve as a powerful physical tool to delve into the thermodynamics and phase structure of RN-AdS black holes in massive gravity.</description>

      <title>Active and Passive Conformal Transformations in Scalar-Tensor Gravitational Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through considering the conformal transformations as coordinate transformations in some abstract space of fields, where the different fields are assumed as ``generalized coordinates,'' we introduce the notion of active and passive conformal transformations. We then apply both complementary approaches to the conformal frames issue, arising in the context of scalar-tensor gravity theories, in order to get better understanding of the problem. Special focus is on the coupling of matter fields to gravity. The recent result that the Lagrangian density of fundamental matter fields and perfect fluids is not only conformal invariant but also conformal form-invariant is discussed within the context of the conformal frames issue.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Spinning Particles in Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole exterior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the orbits of a spinning particle in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole exterior through the spin-curvature coupling to leading order in its spin. The dynamics is governed by the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations in the pole-dipole approximation. The equations of motion can be derived and show in particular that in the polar coordinate, the orbits can be restricted to the plane for an aligned spin with the orbital motion, but there is an induced motion out of the plane for a misaligned spin. The radial potential can be defined from the equation of motion along the radial direction, where the roots are studied to construct the parameter space diagram for different types of orbits. We then consider the so-called innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) due to the triple root to see the effects of the particle spin and the black hole charge. These non-geodesic equations can be solved analytically in terms of the Mino time with the solutions involving Jacobi elliptic functions. One of the bound motions considered is an oscillating orbit between two turning points in the radial direction. The usefulness of the solutions is to obtain the periods of the oscillation along the radial direction as well as the induced motion in the polar coordinate for a misaligned spin in both the Mino time and the coordinate time. Another interesting motions include the inspiral orbit from near ISCO and the homoclinic orbit with the solutions expressed as elementary functions, giving the radial 4-velocity of the inspiral orbit and the Lyapunov exponent associated with the homoclinic orbit. The implications for gravitational wave emission from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and black hole accretion are discussed.</description>

      <title>Initial acquisition requirements for optical cavities in the space gravitational wave antennae DECIGO and B-DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DECIGO (DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) is a space-based gravitational wave antenna concept targeting the 0.1-10 Hz band. It consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with 1,000 km sides, forming Fabry-P\'erot cavities between them. A precursor mission, B-DECIGO, is also planned, featuring a smaller 100 km triangle. Operating these cavities requires ultra-precise formation flying, where inter-mirror distance and alignment must be precisely controlled. Achieving this necessitates a sequential improvement in precision using various sensors and actuators, from the deployment of the spacecraft to laser link acquisition and ultimately to the control of the Fabry-P\'erot cavities to maintain resonance. In this paper, we derive the precision requirements at each stage and discuss the feasibility of achieving them. We show that the relative speed between cavity mirrors must be controlled at the sub-micrometer-per-second level and that relative alignment must be maintained at the sub-microradian level to obtain control signals from the Fabry-P\'erot cavities of DECIGO and B-DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Time-domain phenomenological multipolar waveforms for aligned-spin binary black holes in elliptical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce IMRPhenomTEHM, a new phenomenological time-domain model for eccentric aligned-spin binary black holes. Building upon the accurate quasi-circular IMRPhenomTHM model, IMRPhenomTEHM integrates the eccentric post-Newtonian (PN) dynamics and introduces eccentric corrections into the waveform multipoles up to 3PN, including spin effects. The model incorporates the dominant (2, $\pm$2) spherical harmonic mode, as well as the subdominant modes (2, $\pm$1), (3, $\pm$3), (4, $\pm$4), and (5, $\pm$5), assuming the binary has circularized by the time of merger. This approach ensures a smooth transition to the non-eccentric limit, providing an accurate quasi-circular limit against the IMRPhenomTHM model. When comparing against 28 public eccentric numerical relativity simulations from the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog, IMRPhenomTEHM achieves lower than 2% unfaithfulness, confirming its accurate description without calibration to numerical relativity eccentric datasets. IMRPhenomTEHM provides a reliable description of the evolution of eccentric black hole binaries with aligned spins and eccentricities lower than $e=0.4$ at a frequency of 10 Hz, making it suitable for upcoming gravitational-wave observing runs. We validate the model's accuracy through parameter estimation studies, recovering injected parameters within 90% credible intervals for three numerical relativity eccentric simulations and reanalyzing GW150914 and GW190521, obtaining results consistent with the literature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Effects on Radio Spectral Lines of Atomic Hydrogen: Hyperfine Splitting and Broadening Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of gravitational waves (GWs) on hydrogen's radio spectral lines, focusing on the ground-state hyperfine transition and radiative transitions in highly excited Rydberg states. To analyze GW impacts on hyperfine structure, we derive Maxwell's equations in a gravitational-wave background using linearized gravity and the $3+1$ formalism. Our findings reveal that GWs induce energy shifts in hyperfine magnetic substates, modifying the 21 cm line. However, these energy shifts fall well below the detection limits of current radio astronomical instruments. For transitions in highly excited states, which produce radio recombination lines (RRL), the influence of GW manifests itself as spectral broadening, with the fractional linewidth for $\mathrm{H}n\alpha$ scaling as $\Delta\nu/\nu_0 \sim n^7\omega^2_{\mathrm{gw}}h(t)$. This suggests that RRLs could serve as probes for ultra-high-frequency GWs, particularly given that Rydberg atoms in the interstellar medium can reach quantum numbers above $n=100$. As an example of possibly detectable high frequency GW source, We investigate GWs emitted during the inspiral of planetary-mass primordial black hole binaries, where GW-induced broadening in RRLs could exceed natural broadening effects. Additionally, we examine the influence of the recently detected stochastic gravitational-wave background on hydrogen spectral lines.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes and their singular families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes without curvature singularity can arise in Einstein gravity with appropriate matter energy-momentum tensor. We show that these regular solutions represent only a special case of a much broader family of black holes with a free mass parameter. The regularity is achieved only at a specific mass value, and any deviation from the fine-tuned parameter inevitably results in curvature singularity. As a concrete example, we consider nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) as matter sources. A new NLED theory is proposed that is a generalization of the Bardeen class and the Hayward class. New regular black holes and their singular counterparts are obtained. Significant distinctions between regular black holes and their singular counterparts are analyzed. These findings provide new insights into regular black holes.</description>

      <title>On black holes in teleparallel torsion theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first present an overview of the Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime within general relativity, with particular emphasis on the role of scalar polynomial invariants and the null frame approach (and the related Cartan invariants), that justifies the conventional interpretation of the Schwarzschild geometry as a black hole spacetime admitting a horizon (at $r=2M$ in Schwarzschild coordinates) shielding a singular point at the origin. We then consider static spherical symmetric vacuum teleparallel spacetimes in which the torsion characterizes the geometry, and the scalar invariants of interest are those constructed from the torsion and its (covariant) derivatives. We investigate the Schwarzschild-like spacetime in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and find that the torsion scalar invariants (and, in particular, the scalar $T$) diverge at the putative ``Schwarzschild'' horizon. In this sense the resulting spacetime is {\em not} a black hole spacetime. We then briefly consider the Kerr-like solution in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity and obtain a similar result. Finally, we investigate static spherically symmetric vacuum spacetimes within the more general $F(T)$ teleparallel gravity and show that if a such a geometry admits a horizon, then the torsion scalar $T$ necessarily diverges there; consequently in this sense such a geometry also does {\em not} represent a black hole.</description>

      <title>Distorted black holes: a characteristic view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction between a non-rotating black hole and incoming gravitational waves using the characteristic formulation of the Einstein field equations, framed as a Bondi problem. By adopting retarded time as the null coordinate and recognizing that the final state is invariably a black hole, we demonstrate that an apparent horizon forms once sufficient mass accretes onto the black hole. We derive the evolution of the Bondi mass and compute its final value, enabling us to quantify the fraction of the incident mass absorbed by the black hole. Additionally, we establish a scaling law for the absorbed mass as a function of initial parameters, such as the amplitude of the gravitational wave data. Furthermore, we explore the dynamics when a reflecting barrier surrounds the black hole. For low-amplitude initial waves, the barrier reflects the waves, leaving the original black hole as the end state. Conversely, high-amplitude waves lead to the formation of an apparent horizon that engulfs the barrier, producing a new, larger black hole.</description>

      <title>Rotating black holes in a class of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate rotating black hole solutions within a scalar Gauss Bonnet gravity framework that incorporates a quadratic Gauss Bonnet term. By employing a quadratic exponential coupling function between the scalar field and the Gauss Bonnet invariant, we derive both the standard General Relativity solutions and novel scalarized black hole configurations. Utilizing a pseudo spectral method to solve the coupled field equations, we examine how black hole spin and coupling constants influence the existence and properties of these solutions. Our findings reveal that both the rotation of the black hole and the quadratic coupling term effectively constrain the parameter space available for scalarization. Moreover, we demonstrate that, over a wide range of parameters, scalarized black holes exhibit higher entropy than Kerr black holes of equivalent mass and spin, indicating that they are thermodynamically favored. These results significantly expand the phase space of black holes in modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Extended mass and spheroidal deformation effects on epicyclic frequencies and periapsis shift in quasi-circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of extended mass and spheroidal deformation on the periapsis shift of quasi-circular orbits inside a gravitating mass distribution in the Newtonian framework. Focusing on the internal gravitational potential of a spheroidal body with both homogeneous and inhomogeneous density profiles, we elucidate how the ratio of local density to average density governs the extended mass effect on the periapsis shift. By analyzing the orbital angular frequency, along with the radial and vertical epicyclic frequencies, we demonstrate that in the uniform density case (i.e., the Maclaurin spheroid), where the potential takes the form of a harmonic oscillator, the periapsis exhibits a constant retrograde shift of $-\pi$. In contrast, in regions where density inhomogeneity and spheroidal deformation (in both prolate and oblate forms) are significant, the periapsis shift varies with the guiding orbital radius due to local density contrast and deformation effects. The resuls indicate that oblate deformation suppresses the extended mass effect associated with the ratio of local density to average density, whereas prolate deformation amplifies it. Furthermore, by varying the density distribution parameters, we establish the conditions for orbital stability and identify the emergence of marginally stable orbits.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Theories Through the Lens of Parametrized Post-Newtonian Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore scalarized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theories within the context of the Parameterized Post-Newtonian formalism, which serves as a robust framework for examining modifications to General Relativity that exhibit scalarization. This approach enables us to impose a variety of constraints on the parameter space, particularly focusing on the PPN parameters $\gamma$ and $\beta$. Our analysis reveals several significant bounds for each scalarized model, utilizing data from the Cassini mission, Lunar Laser Ranging, and the forthcoming BepiColombo mission, in conjunction with geodetic Very Long Baseline Interferometry measurements around the Sun. In particular, we conducted a combined analysis of the MESSENGER mission's precision measurements of Mercury's perihelion precession $\dot{\omega}$ alongside the Cassini constraints on $\gamma$, yielding intriguing limits for the Ricci-EGB model. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of the new post-Newtonian potential introduced by the Gauss-Bonnet term at fourth order, which necessitates an expanded formulation of the PPN parameters. This highlights that the parameter $\beta$ exhibits different effects when analyzing the Ricci-EGB model. Additional constraints are derived from this framework by estimating the $\gamma$ PPN parameter using data from strong-lensing galaxy systems.</description>

      <title>Black holes inside cosmic voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the gravitational and thermodynamic properties of static, spherically symmetric black holes within cosmic voids -- vast underdense regions of the universe. By deriving a novel solution based on a universal density profile for voids, we analyze its spacetime structure, which reveals two horizons: One of the black hole and the other related to the de Sitter-like behavior. As the void approaches a perfect vacuum, the black hole horizon diminishes, tending to that of the Schwarzschild solution, while the outer horizon increases. We also study the solution stability via sound speed of the fluid, as well as the thermodynamic properties, including Hawking temperature, evaporation time, entropy, and specific heat. Our results show that as the void empties, the Hawking temperature rises, shortening evaporation times. The entropy follows the area's law and specific heat exhibits a minimum for a given black hole size, indicating a thermal transition and highlighting the role of voids in the black hole evolution. These findings offer new insights into the relationship between local gravitational collapse and large-scale cosmic structure, enhancing our understanding of the black hole behavior in underdense environments. We also provide a glimpse of a potential thermodynamic interaction between the event horizon and the cosmological horizon.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Structure of Regular Accelerating Black Hole Pair in General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the one-parameter generalization of the C-metric derived by Ernst, which solves the vacuum Einstein equations. Resolving conflicting claims in the literature, we determine the correct value of the parameter that ensures the regularity of the metric on the axis. This "regularized C-metric" describes a pair of accelerating black holes without the line source present in the original C-metric. Additionally, this generalization changes the Petrov type from D to I. We use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem to analyze the nodal singularities, the line source, and their relation to the horizon topology. Both the black hole and acceleration horizons are found to be embeddable in $\mathrm{E}^3$. We examine various geometric and asymptotic properties in detail using several coordinate systems and construct the corresponding 2D and 3D conformal diagrams. This process is more involved than for the original C-metric due to the presence of the exponential factors. These exponential factors also introduce curvature singularities at infinity, which obstructs asymptotic flatness. Contrary to Bonnor's expectation, we demonstrate why Bondi's algorithm for obtaining the standard Bondi form fails for the C-metric, despite its asymptotic flatness. We also show that Ernst's solution-generating prescription in boost-rotation symmetric coordinates is a symmetry of the wave equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first numerical-relativity simulations of black-hole binaries that deviate from General Relativity due to quadratic-curvature corrections. Said theory of Quadratic Gravity propagates additional massive modes and admits both Kerr and non-Kerr black-hole solutions. We chose the respective masses "at threshold", i.e., such that (at least) one of the black holes dynamically transitions from the Kerr to the non-Kerr branch during the early inspiral. The subsequent waveforms differ from their General Relativity counterparts throughout inspiral, merger, and ringdown.</description>

      <title>Identifying intermediate mass binary black hole mergers in AGN disks using LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Laser Interferometer Space Antenna can uniquely identify the sites of intermediate-mass binary black hole (IMBBH) mergers if they occur in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disks with a gas density $\rho\geq10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$ via measurement of dynamical friction effect in the gravitational waveform. We find that even a single observation of a gravitational wave source with a total mass of $10^3 M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of 2 at a luminosity distance of 3 Gpc is sufficient to confidently associate the merger to be in an AGN disk with a density $\sim 10^{-12} \, {\rm g/cc}$, as it allows estimation of the density with an error bar ${\cal O}(100\%)$. This provides a new way of inferring AGN disk densities that complement traditional X-ray observations. Further, we find that neglecting the presence of environmental effects in the waveform models used for parameter estimation can bias the chirp mass, mass ratio and arrival time of a merger. If not corrected, this can significantly impact our ability to carry out multiband data analysis of IMBBHs that combines information from LISA and the ground-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone Higgs Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (pNG) Higgs Inflation is a novel approach to relate the Higgs boson and its interaction with Electroweak gauge bosons with cosmic inflation, with the potential of solving both the fine-tuning issues in the Higgs mass and inflationary potentials. In this work, we present a linear perturbation analysis of the minimal implementation of pNG Higgs inflation using the symmetry coset SU($5$)/SO($5$). Similar to Chromo-natural inflation, this model exhibits a period of instability in the tensor modes that exponentially enhance left-handed gravitational waves. Thus, large Chern-Simons couplings $\beta \gtrsim 6 \times 10^8$ and decay constants $f\gtrsim1\times10^{18}~\mathrm{GeV}$ are required to suppress the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ to be compatible with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurement. These large couplings also cause an overproduction of the scalar modes, making the minimal construction of pNG Higgs inflation disfavored by CMB observations. However, this tension could potentially be relieved by considering multi-field inflation. The pNG Higgs construction naturally contains multiple scalar fields via the interplay of spontaneously broken global and gauge symmetries. The rich structure enables a broad range of multi-field inflation, and we conclude by briefly discussing this possibility and future work.</description>

Abstract: We present the first numerical relativity simulations including neutrino flavor transformations that could result from flavor instabilities, quantum many-body effects, or potential beyond standard model physics in neutron star mergers. We find that neutrino flavor transformations impact the composition and structure of the remnant, potentially leaving an imprint on the post-merger gravitational-wave signal. They also have a significant impact on the composition and nucleosynthesis yields of the ejecta.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the E-model inflation with Gauss-Bonnet correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generation of gravitational waves in the E-model inflation with the scalar field non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term. Considering a wall-crossing behavior in the moduli space, we parameterize the coupling coefficient $\xi$ as a step-like function, then if $V_{,\phi}\xi_{,\phi}&gt;0$, the Gauss-Bonnet term dominate the inflation dynamics, causing a short rapid-decline phase of the inflaton, and for appropriate parameter spaces, the mode equation of tensor perturbations develops a transient growing solution. This process generates a peak in the tensor perturbation power spectrum, corresponding to a peak in the gravitational wave energy spectrum around the nanohertz frequency band. Further more, we investigate the feasibility of generating double peaks in the gravitational wave spectrum using a double-step coupling, For certain parameter choices, one peak lies near nanohertz frequencies, while the other is around millihertz frequencies. Consequently, these gravitational waves can be observed by the pulsar timing array and the space-based gravitational wave detectors such as LISA, simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Ordinary wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euclidean wormholes have played a key role in the recent ``disorder averaged" approaches to quantum gravity and holography, but are typically only considered in somewhat special theories of gravity, such as theories in low dimensions or theories with exotic matter content (such as axions). These exotic theories have advantage that both the matter and gravitational sectors can be treated completely classically. However, once this constraint is relaxed we find that Euclidean wormholes arise generically, with no special constraints on the matter content. The key point is that there is a self-consistent approximation where the metric is treated classically but matter is treated quantum mechanically. The resulting wormholes are {\it ordinary} in the sense that they rely on the usual approximations used in, for example, the construction of star or FRW solutions in general relativity. Indeed, these are the Euclidean continuations of ordinary FRW solutions with big bang/crunch singularities. We describe several examples of these ordinary wormholes and discuss the relation to existing constructions and the holographic interpretation in terms of a dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Hadamard states for decomposable Green-hyperbolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadamard states were originally introduced for quantised Klein-Gordon fields and occupy a central position in the theory of quantum fields on curved spacetimes. Subsequently they have been developed for other linear theories, such as the Dirac, Proca and Maxwell fields, but the particular features of each require slightly different treatments.
  The first aim of this paper is to give a generalised definition of Hadamard states for linear bosonic and fermionic theories encompassing a range of theories that are described by Green-hyperbolic operators with 'decomposable' Pauli-Jordan propagators, including theories whose bicharacteristic curves are not necessarily determined by the spacetime metric. The new definition reduces to previous definitions for normally hyperbolic and Dirac-type operators. We develop the theory of Hadamard states in detail, showing that our definition propagates under the equation of motion, and is also stable under pullbacks and suitable pushforwards. There is an equivalent formulation in terms of Hilbert space valued distributions, and the generalised Hadamard condition on 2-point functions constrains the singular behaviour of all $n$-point functions. For locally covariant theories, the Hadamard states form a covariant state space. It is also shown how Hadamard states may be combined through tensor products or reduced by partial tracing while preserving the Hadamard property. As a particular application it is shown that state updates resulting from nonselective measurements preserve the Hadamard condition.
  The treatment we give was partly inspired by a recent work of Moretti, Murro and Volpe (MMV) on the neutral Proca field. Among our other applications, we revisit the neutral Proca field and prove a complete equivalence between the MMV definition of Hadamard states and an older work of Fewster and Pfenning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local in time well-posedness of the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for the vacuum Einstein equations in general relativity with geometric boundary conditions. For conformal-mean curvature boundary conditions, consisting of the conformal class of the boundary metric and mean curvature of the boundary, well-posedness does not hold without imposing additional angle data at the corner. When the corner angle is included as corner data, we prove well-posedness of the linearized problem in $C^{\infty}$, where the linearization is taken at any smooth vacuum Einstein metric.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Decoherence in \texorpdfstring{\(\kappa\)}{kappa}-Minkowski Quantum Spacetime: An Open Quantum Systems Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate neutrino decoherence within the framework of quantum spacetime, focusing on the $\kappa$-Minkowski model. We show that stochastic fluctuations in quantum spacetime induce an energy-dependent decoherence effect, where the decoherence rate scales as $E^{-4}$. This result aligns with recent IceCube observations, indicating that quantum gravity does not induce significant decoherence for high-energy neutrinos. Additionally, we establish conditions under which quantum spacetime effects could influence relic neutrinos, such as those in the cosmic neutrino background ($C\nu B$). Our results shed light on how quantum spacetime fluctuations impact neutrino oscillation physics.</description>

      <title>Standard Model Symmetries and K(E_10)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify and extend our earlier work (K.A.Meissner and H.Nicolai, Phys. Rev. D91 (2015) 065029 and Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 (2018) 091601) where it was shown how to amend a scheme originally proposed by M. Gell-Mann to identify the three families of quarks and leptons of the Standard Model with the 48 spin 1/2 fermions of N=8 supergravity that remain after absorption of eight Goldstinos, a scheme that in its original form is dynamically realized at the SU(3)xU(1) stationary point of gauged N=8 supergravity. We explain how to deform and enlarge this symmetry at the kinematical level to the full Standard Model symmetry group SU(3)_c x SU(2)_w x U(1)_Y, with the correct charge and chiral assignments for all fermions. The framework also leaves room for an extra U(1)_(B-L) symmetry. This symmetry enhancement is achieved by embedding the Standard Model symmetries into (a quotient group of) K(E_10), the `maximal compact subgroup' of the maximal rank hyperbolic Kac-Moody symmetry E_10, and an infinite prolongation of the SU(8) R-symmetry of N=8 supergravity. This scheme, which is also supposed to encompass quantum gravity, cannot be realized within the framework of space-time based (quantum) field theory, but requires space-time and related geometrical concepts to be `emergent'. We critically review the main hypotheses underlying this construction.</description>

      <title>A non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics with local modulus symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.07749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have constructed a non-relativistic theory of quantum mechanics based on local modulus symmetry. The resulting connection in the covariant derivative is identified as the escape velocity of the gravitational field. A new real and positive function called the quantum metric function is attached to the complex conjugate of the wave function to satisfy the local modulus symmetry requirement. In an expanding universe, these theoretical features produce new effects that deviate from predictions of conventional quantum mechanics and Newtonian gravity. The quantum metric function yields negligible change for microscopic objects but produces quantum pointer states for macroscopic objects, thus providing a solution to the quantum measurement problem. The time-reversal symmetry is broken in the new quantum kinematics, which has implications for the second law of thermodynamics. The modification of Newtonian gravity is negligible in smaller bound systems but can become significant at the galactic scales. Its potential association with the mass discrepancy problem in the galactic systems is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, a static spherically symmetric black hole solution was found in gravity nonminimally coupled a background Kalb-Ramond field. The Lorentz symmetry is spontaneously broken when the Kalb-Ramond field has a nonvanishing vacuum expectation value. In this work, we focus on the quasinormal modes and greybody factor of this black hole. The master equations for the perturbed scalar field, electromagnetic field, and gravitational field can be written into a uniform form. We use three methods to solve the quasinormal frequencies in the frequency domain. The results agree well with each other. The time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet is studied. The quasinormal frequencies fitted from the time evolution data agree well with that of frequency domain. The greybody factor is calculated by Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method. The effect of the Lorentz-violating parameter on the quasinormal modes and greybody factor are also studied.</description>

      <title>On the integrability of extended test body dynamics around black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, the motion of an extended test body is influenced by its proper rotation, or spin. We present a covariant and physically self-consistent Hamiltonian framework to study this motion, up to quadratic order in the body's spin, including a spin-induced quadrupole, and in an arbitrary background spacetime. The choice of spin supplementary condition and degeneracies associated with local Lorentz invariance are treated rigorously with adapted tools from Hamiltonian mechanics. Applying the formalism to a background space-time described by the Kerr metric, we prove that the motion of any test compact object around a rotating black hole defines an integrable Hamiltonian system to linear order in the body's spin. Moreover, this integrability still holds at quadratic order in spin when the compact object has the deformability expected for an isolated black hole. Our analytical results shed light on longstanding numerical conjectures regarding spin-induced chaos in the motion of asymmetric compact binaries, and provides a powerful framework to improve current gravitational waveform modelling to account for spin-induced extended body effects.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing Using Werner's Method in Cartesian-like Coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gibbons-Werner method for calculating deflection angles using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and optical/Jacobi metric has become widely popular in recent years. Werner extended this method to stationary spacetimes, where the optical/Jacobi metric takes the form of a Finsler metric of Randers type, by adopting an osculating Riemannian metric. Werner's method is significant as it provides a concise expression for the deflection angle, retains applicability for gravitational lensing in Finsler geometry beyond the Randers type, and has the potential to stimulate widespread application of Finsler geometry across diverse fields. However, because of the cumbersome calculations required in Werner's method using conventional coordinates $(r,\phi)$, it has not been widely adopted. The aim of this paper is to alleviate the computational burden associated with Werner's method. To this end, we introduce Cartesian-like coordinates $(X,Y)$ to construct the osculating Riemannian metric and calculate the deflection angle using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. We illustrate the current method with examples of the deflection of massive particles in Kerr spacetime, rotating Bardeen (Hayward) regular spacetime, and Teo rotating wormhole spacetime, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of fermion localization within the framework of $f(T, B)$ gravity featuring non-minimal couplings. Starting from the Dirac action for a spin-$1/2$ fermion in a five-dimensional spacetime governed by torsional $f(T, B)$ gravity, we derive the Dirac equation and we explore its solutions under various non-minimal coupling functions. We examine two realistic forms of the torsional non-minimal coupling and reveal distinct behaviors that impact the localization of both massless and massive fermionic modes on the brane. Additionally, we employ probabilistic measurements, including Shannon entropy theory, Fisher information theory, and relative probability, to analyze the localization of these fermionic modes. The observed effects offer potential insights into probing torsional modifications.</description>

      <title>Obtaining the Radiated Gravitational Wave Energy via Relativistic Kinetic Theory: A Kinetic Gas Model of an Idealized Coalescing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13917v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The final pulse of gravitational wave emission is released in the chirp phase of binary coalescence. This proposes that the radiated energy of the GW is proportional to the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, with detection reports revealing the approximate scaling of $E_{\mathrm{GW}}\approx\mathcal{M}/10$. While this scaling is evident in numerical relativity, there lacks an analytical expression supporting the relation. This study utilizes a heuristic application of relativistic kinetic theory and massless Bose-Einstein statistics for a Brownian graviton gas to GW formation throughout binary coalescence. This approach to GW formation obtains an expression of an effective thermal energy as the radiated GW energy, which extracts the nearly one-tenth scaling of the chirp mass, namely at the chirp phase. Furthermore, it agrees well with the detected energies with 1:1 ratio values ranging from 0.932 for GW150914 to 0.998 for one of three waveform models of GW190521, with 0.851 as an outlier for GW170104. Establishing a quantum-classical correspondence in this regard enables discussion of equilibrium noise analysis on the graviton gas as well as its kinetic characteristics during and after coalescence. The latter topic includes, but is not limited to, GW/graviton wave-particle duality, a calculation of the high-energy graviton-graviton total cross section at peak wave emission as 1.16\% of the chirp mass surface area $A=16\pi G^2\mathcal{M}^2$, and humoring the thought experiment of black hole gravitons.</description>

Abstract: The geodesics of Kerr's metric are described by the four-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics integrable in the Arnold-Liouville sense. It can be reduced to two-dimensional one by the use of Fermat's principle. The resulting Hamiltonian is, however, rather complicated. We show how one can apply the coupling constant metamorphosis to simplify the Hamiltonian to the one quadratic in momenta and depending on the initial "energy" as parameter. It describes a simple dynamics of two non-linear oscillators and can be integrated directly or evaluated in the framework of perturbation theory by adopting the elegant Lindstedt--Poincar\'e algorithm.</description>

      <title>From formation to evaporation: Induced gravitational wave probes of the primordial black hole reheating scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Primordial Black Hole (PBH) reheating scenario, where PBHs originate in a general cosmological background. In this scenario, ultralight PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 10^8$g temporarily dominate the Universe and reheat it via Hawking radiation before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). We investigate whether the induced Gravitational Wave (GW) spectrum associated with PBH reheating contains information about the pre-PBH-dominated stage, namely the initial equation of state $w$ (after inflation). We first derive the transfer functions of curvature fluctuations for general $w$ with adiabatic and isocurvature initial conditions. We find that, in general, a stiffer equation of state enhances the induced GW amplitude as it allows for a longer PBH dominated phase compared to the radiation dominated case. We also find that the spectral slope of GWs induced by primordial curvature fluctuations is sensitive to $w$, while the spectral slope of GWs induced by PBH number density fluctuations is not. Lastly, we derive constraints of the initial PBH abundance as a function of $w$, using BBN and Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. A stiffer equation of state leads to stricter constraints on the initial energy density fraction, as induced GWs are enhanced. Interestingly, we find that such induced GW signals may enter the observational window of several future GW detectors, such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope. Our formulas, especially the curvature fluctuation transfer functions, are applicable to any early matter-dominated universe scenario.</description>

      <title>A new representation of vacuum Lovelock solutions in $d = 2N+1$ dimensions: Black holes with an integrable singularity and regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, black hole (BH) solutions with an integrable singularity have garnered significant attention as alternatives to regular black holes (RBH). In these models, similarly to RBHs, an object would not undergo spaghettification when approaching the radial origin. Instead of the potentially unstable de Sitter core present in RBHs, an integrable singularity emerges where the Ricci scalar diverges while its volume integral remains finite. However, the construction of both RBH solutions and BHs with an integrable singularity typically requires the inclusion of specific forms of matter in the energy-momentum tensor. We demonstrate that, from a geometric perspective in the absence of matter, vacuum solutions in Lovelock gravity in $d=2N+1$ dimensions can be represented as vacuum BHs with an integrable singularity in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory for $d=5$ and in cubic gravity for $d=7$. Meanwhile, the vacuum solution in quartic gravity in $d=9$ is described as a vacuum RBH with a nontrivial hyperboloidal cross-section. For all the aforementioned cases, we have determined the conditions that the parameters in the solutions must satisfy. Remarkably, in all discussed cases, there is no presence of an internal horizon near a potentially unstable de Sitter core.</description>

Abstract: We consider the linear response of a near-equilibrium charged relativistic gas in the presence of electromagnetic and gravitational field in a generic stationary spacetime up to the second order of relaxation time and calculate the tensorial kinetic coefficients introduced by the presence of the strong electromagnetic and/or gravitational field. Using the covariant transfer equations thus developed, a covariant heat equation governing the relativistic heat conduction is derived, which, in Minkowski spacetime, reduces into a form which is remarkably similar to the well-known Cattaneo equation but with a different sign in front of the second-order time derivative term. We also perform a comparative analysis on the different behaviors of our heat equation and the Cattaneo equation in Minkowski spacetime. Furthermore, the effect of gravity on the heat conduction predicted by our heat equation is illustrated around Schwarzschild black hole, which makes a sharp contrast to the Minkowski case.</description>

Abstract: We provide a detailed derivation of the spectral density of the stochastic background generated by the superposition of coalescing compact binaries. We show how the expression often used in the literature emerges from an average over the extrinsic parameters of the binaries (times of arrival, polarization angles, arrival directions and orbit inclinations) and how the Stokes parameters related to circular and linear polarization are set to zero by such averaging procedure. We then consider the effect of shot noise, i.e. the fact that for the superposition of a finite number of sources these averages are only approximate, and we show how it generates circular and linear polarizations (even for isotropic backgrounds) as well as spatial anisotropies, and we compute them explicitly for a realistic population of binary black holes and binary neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we linearize the field equations of $f(R)$ gravity using the Starobinsky model, $R+R^2/(6m^2)$, and examine the modifications to General Relativity. We derive an equation for the trace, $T$, of the energy-momentum tensor, which we then decompose using an auxiliary field. This field satisfies the wave equation with $T$ as its source, while simultaneously acting as an effective source for the classical deviation, $\bar h$, governed by the Klein-Gordon equation. The fields were expressed in terms of Green's functions, whose symmetry properties facilitated the solution of the trace equation. Then $\bar h_{\mu\nu}$ was determined in terms of a modified or effective matter-energy distribution. From this, the effective energy density was obtained as the usual energy density $T_{00}$, plus a perturbative correction proportional to $m^{-2}$, involving the Laplacian of the integral of $T$, weighted by the retarded propagator of the Klein-Gordon equation. Finally, we numerically computed the perturbative term in a binary star system, evaluating it as a function of $m$ and spatial position near the stars. In all cases, the results illustrate how the gravitational influence of the stars diminishes with distance. Additionally, the perturbation decreases as $m$ increases, consistently recovering the relativistic limit. These results highlight the role of modified gravity corrections in the vicinity of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Nonsingular black holes and spherically symmetric objects in nonlinear electrodynamics with a scalar field</title>

Abstract: In general relativity with vector and scalar fields given by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}(F,\phi,X)$, where $F$ is a Maxwell term and $X$ is a kinetic term of the scalar field $\phi$, we study the linear stability of static and spherically symmetric objects without curvature singularities at their centers. We show that the background solutions are generally described by either purely electrically or magnetically charged objects with a nontrivial scalar-field profile. In theories with the Lagrangian $\tilde{{\cal L}}(F)+K(\phi, X)$, which correspond to nonlinear electrodynamics with a k-essence scalar field, angular Laplacian instabilities induced by vector-field perturbations exclude all the regular spherically symmetric solutions including nonsingular black holes. In theories described by the Lagrangian ${\cal L}=X+\mu(\phi)F^n$, where $\mu$ is a function of $\phi$ and $n$ is a constant, the absence of angular Laplacian instabilities of spherically symmetric objects requires that $n&gt;1/2$, under which nonsingular black holes with apparent horizons are not present. However, for some particular ranges of $n$, there are horizonless compact objects with neither ghosts nor Laplacian instabilities in the small-scale limit. In theories given by ${\cal L}=X \kappa (F)$, where $\kappa$ is a function of $F$, regular spherically symmetric objects are prone to Laplacian instabilities either around the center or at spatial infinity. Thus, in our theoretical framework, we do not find any example of linearly stable nonsingular black holes.</description>

Abstract: Barrow holographic dark energy model is an extension of holographic dark energy that incorporates modifications to entropy due to quantum gravitational effects. In this work we study the cosmological properties of interacting Barrow holographic dark energy model in the case of non-zero curvature universe. We construct the differential equations governing the evolution of the Barrow holographic dark energy density parameter and the dark matter density parameter in coupled form for both closed and open spatial geometry. Considering three different forms of coupling, we obtain the corresponding analytical expressions for the equation of state parameter for the dark energy component. We confront the scenario using recent observational datasets like cosmic chronometer and Pantheon data. It has been found that the strength of interaction as well as the curvature contribution come out to be nonzero which indicates that a non-flat interacting scenario is preferred by observational data.</description>

Abstract: A cyclic flat universe with quintom behaviour and future big rip has been presented in the framework of Rastall gravity, which is an extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The Hubble parameter oscillates periodically between positive and negative values from one cycle to the next. Cosmic transit has been simulated through an oscillating time-dependent deceleration parameter, and is expected to occur at approximately $ 8.7~~ \text{Gyr}$. The causality is satisfied all the time except near the initial singularity and the future Big Rip singularity.The apparent horizon, entropy and other thermodynamical quantities associated to the current model have been analyzed. Energy conditions have been investigated.</description>

      <title>Universal thermodynamic topological classes of black holes in perfect fluid dark matter background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the universal thermodynamic topological classes of a family of black holes in a perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) background. Recent research on black hole thermodynamics suggests that all black holes can be classified into four universal thermodynamic classes, denoted by $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$. Our study reveals that the Schwarzschild black hole in PFDM belongs to the $W^{1-}$ class, and independence of black hole size thermodynamically unstable at both low- and high-temperature limits. The Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman black holes in the PFDM background belong to the same universal thermodynamic class, $W^{0+}$, which represents small, stable black holes and large, unstable black holes at low-temperature limits, whereas no black hole state exists at high temperatures. The AdS black holes behave differently compared to their counterparts in PFDM. The Schwarzschild-AdS black hole belongs to the $W^{0-}$ class, indicating no black hole state at low temperatures, but small, unstable and large, stable black hole states at high temperatures. Furthermore, the Kerr-AdS black hole belongs to the $W^{1+}$ class, characterized by small, stable black holes at low temperatures, large, stable black holes at high temperatures, and unstable, intermediate-sized black holes at both low and high temperatures. These findings uncover the universal topological classifications underlying black hole thermodynamics, offering profound insights into the fundamental principles of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Kiselev black strings: the charged rotating solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of a charged rotating black string immersed in a Kiselev anisotropic fluid in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The Einstein-Maxwell equations with an anisotropic stress-energy tensor and cosmological constant are analyzed and solved exactly. In this work, we calculate the Kretschmann scalar, obtaining a consistent result that agrees with the existing literature in the absence of charge and fluid. The rotating solution is obtained by applying a coordinate transformation on time and angular coordinates. The event horizon associated with specific values of the equation of state parameter $w_q$ is studied. The results show an important influence of the fluid parameters $N_{q}$ and $w_{q}$, the charge parameter $Q$, and the rotation parameter $a$ on the size of the black string horizon. In addition, we determine the conditions for the existence of closed timelike curves (CTCs) and compute the conserved charges, such as mass, angular momentum, and electric charge of the black string. Utilizing the Klein-Gordon equation, we employ the quantum particle tunneling approach to obtain the probability of charged scalar particles tunneling across the event horizon. We obtain the correspondent Hawking temperature as a consequence. Furthermore, we examine the thermodynamic properties, including entropy and heat capacity, to assess the effects of the quintessence field and charge on the black string. The results include particular cases such as the Lemos black string, providing a broader view of black string configurations in AdS spacetime.</description>

Abstract: A regular black hole, unconstrained by the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, can exceed its critical spin limit and transition into a superspinar. In this paper, we investigate the observational appearance of a rotating regular black hole, specifically the Ghosh black hole and its superspinar counterpart, when surrounded by a thin accretion disk. The resulting images reveal distinct features: the black hole closely resembles its Kerr counterpart with slight deviations, while the superspinar configuration exhibits an inner photon ring structure. Furthermore, we explore the image transition of the Ghosh black hole that has been recently destroyed by the capture of a test particle. The results show that the inner photon ring undergoes gradual transitions over time, which depend on the additional angular momentum gained by the black hole. Our findings also suggest that the transition timescale becomes relevant for supermassive black holes with masses approximately twice that of M87*, making these effects potentially observable with future high-resolution instruments.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, the background and perturbed cosmic dynamics have been investigated using an interacting dark-fluid model by assuming energy exchange between dark matter and dark energy through a diffusion mechanism. We solve the background expansion history for the late-time Universe and derive the full set of the evolution equations of the matter density contrast, $\delta(z)$ and redshift space distortion, $f\sigma_8(z)$ using the $1+3$-covariant formalism. We then seek to constrain the best-fit cosmological parameters: $h$, $\Omega_m$, $r_d$, $M$, $\sigma_8$ and the interaction term $Q_m$ through the MCMC simulations with cosmologica datasets. Using the joint datasets of the Hubble parameter measurements from cosmic chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), and SNIa distance moduli from Pantheon+ SH0ES, redshift space distortion (RSD) from large-scale galaxy surveys, a detailed statistical analysis of the work is made. To evaluate the dark fluid model's viability in describing late-time cosmic dynamics, the numerical results of background cosmological parameters are presented. The results show that the dark fluid behaves like Chaplygin gas (CG) that drives cosmic acceleration when $ Q_m $ is negative, while for positive $ Q_m $, it exhibits characteristics of a quintessence-like phase. From the perturbation evolution equations, the numerical results of $\delta(z)$ and $f\sigma_8(z)$ were used to explore structure growth. A comparison of the $ H_0 $ and $S_8 $ values has been made of the $\Lambda$CDM and diffusive models across recent cosmological surveys to show the possibility of alleviating the cosmological tensions, though the detailed analysis is beyond the scope of the current study.</description>

Abstract: We report unbiased AI measurements of the fine structure constant $\alpha$ in two proximate absorption regions in the spectrum of the quasar HE0515$-$4414. The data are high resolution, high signal to noise, and laser frequency comb calibrated, obtained using the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT. The high quality of the data and proximity of the regions motivate a differential comparison, exploring the possibility of spatial variations of fundamental constants, as predicted in some theories. We show that if the magnesium isotopic relative abundances are terrestrial, the fine structure constants in these two systems differ at the 7$\sigma$ level. A 3$\sigma$ discrepancy between the two measurements persists even for the extreme non-terrestrial case of 100\% $^{24}$Mg, if shared by both systems. However, if Mg isotopic abundances take independent values in these two proximate systems, one terrestrial, the other with no heavy isotopes, both can be reconciled with a terrestrial $\alpha$, and the discrepancy between the two measurements falls to 2$\sigma$. We cannot rule out other systematics that are unaccounted for in our study that could masquerade as a varying alpha signal. We discuss varying constant and varying isotope interpretations and resolutions to this conundrum for future high precision measurements.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the analytic structure of correlators in the field theory dual to the quantum Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (qBTZ) black hole, a braneworld model incorporating exact backreaction from quantum conformal matter. We first compute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectrum of operators with dimension $\Delta$ and spin $s=0,\pm 1/2$. The leading QNMs and their overtones display qualitatively different behavior depending on the branch of qBTZ solution, which corresponds to distinct CFT states: branch 1 is a conical singularity dressed with a horizon while branch 2 is a quantum-corrected BTZ black hole. Consequently, the relaxation of probe matter effectively differentiates the CFT states and identifies the corresponding bulk descriptions. We then turn to pole-skipping locations where Green's functions are not unique. At these points, frequency is proportional to temperature, but momentum exhibits complex temperature dependence due to quantum effects. Under the assumption that the pole-skipping point closest to the origin reflects quantum chaos, we infer the likely behavior of the quantum Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity in the dual theory. Finally, we examine pole collisions in complex momentum space, showing that quantum corrections imprint a unique signature on the analytic structure of the poles in retarded Green's functions, resulting in level-crossing phenomena that differ notably from the level-touching phenomena in the uncorrected BTZ geometry.</description>

      <title>Tight bound on neutron-star radius with quasiperiodic oscillations in short gamma-ray bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) have been recently discovered in the short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) 910711 and 931101B. Their frequencies are consistent with those of the quasiradial and quadrupolar oscillations of binary neutron star merger remnants, as obtained in numerical relativity simulations. These simulations reveal quasiuniversal relations between the remnant oscillation frequencies and the tidal coupling constant of the binaries. Under the assumption that the observed QPOs are due to these postmerger oscillations, we use the frequency-tide relations in a Bayesian framework to infer the source redshift, as well as the chirp mass and the binary tidal deformability of the binary neutron star progenitors for GRBs 910711 and 931101B. We further use this inference to estimate bounds on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars. By combining the estimates from the two GRBs, we find a 68\% credible range $R_{1.4}=12.48^{+0.41}_{-0.40}$~km for the radius of a neutron star with mass $M=1.4$~M$_\odot$, which is one of the tightest bounds to date.</description>

      <title>Low-Energy Test of Quantum Gravity via Angular Momentum Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Currently envisaged tests for probing the quantum nature of the gravitational interaction in the low-energy regime typically focus either on the quantized center-of-mass degrees of freedom of two spherically-symmetric test masses or on the rotational degrees of freedom of non-symmetric masses under a gravitational interaction in the Newtonian limit. In contrast, here we investigate the interaction between the angular momenta of spherically-symmetric test masses considering the general relativistic correction related to frame-dragging that leads to an effective dipolar interaction between the angular momenta. In this approach, the mass of the probes is not directly relevant; instead, their angular momentum plays the central role. We demonstrate that, while the optimal entangling rate is achieved with a maximally delocalized initial state, significant quantum correlations can still arise between two rotating systems even when each is initialized in an eigenstate of rotation. Additionally, we examine the robustness of the generated entanglement against typical sources of noise and observe that our combination of angular momentum and spherically-symmetric test-masses mitigates the impact of many common noise sources.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

Abstract: We propose simple quantitative criteria, based on counting statistics in resonant harmonic detectors, that probe the quantum mechanical character of radiation fields. They provide, in particular, practical means to test the null hypothesis that a given field is ``maximally classical'', i.e., accurately described by a coherent state. We suggest circumstances in which that hypothesis plausibly fails, notably including gravitational radiation involving non-linear or stochastic sourcing.</description>

      <title>Kalb-Ramond field, black holes and black strings in (2 + 1)D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New rotating dilaton black hole and black string solutions in three spacetime dimensions are obtained. The background spacetime interpolates between Anti-de Sitter and a (an asymptotically) flat spacetime. The new black strings are characterized by their masses, angular momenta and axion charges. The uncharged black string solutions have only a single horizon. They contain a curvature singularity enclosed inside their horizons. Thus, they are also black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity. On the other hand, the charged black string solutions have two horizons. They may or may not contain a curvature singularity depending on the ratio of their inner and outer horizons radii. When they contain a singularity, the singularity is either at or enclosed inside their inner horizons. We also obtain, in addition to the uncharged black strings, other new black hole solutions of Einstein-scalar gravity by applying duality transformation on the new charged black strings. The new black holes are described by their masses and angular momenta. We show that their angular momenta do not depend on their horizons radii. We also find that the masses of a class of the black holes can be made negative by adjusting, using the gauge ambiguity, the asymptotic value of the (independent component of the) Kalb-Ramond field in the dual black strings. We also discuss black hole and black string solutions with a curvature singularity at or beyond their outer or event horizons.</description>

      <title>Is there a dynamical tendency in H0 with late time measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discrepancy between the Hubble constant $H_0$ values derived from early-time and late-time measurements, reaching up to $4\sigma$, represents the most serious challenge in modern cosmology and astrophysics. In this work, we investigate if a similar tension exists between only late time measurements at different redshifts. We use the latest public datasets including Cosmic Chronometers, Megamasers, SNe Ia and DESI-BAO, that span from redshift $z \sim 0$ up to $z\sim 2.3$. By dividing the data into redshift bins, we derive $H_0$ values from each bin separately. Our analysis reveals a phenomenological dynamic evolution in $H_0$ across different redshift ranges, with a significance from $1.5\sigma$ and $2.3\sigma$, depending on the parameterization. Consistency of the model demands observational constancy of $H_0$ since it is an integration constant within the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. Thus, these findings suggest that the observed Hubble tension might not only exist between early and late-time measurements but also among late-time data themselves, providing new insights into the nature of the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Background ambiguity and the G\"odel double copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the assumptions regarding spacetime backgrounds underlying the classical double copy. We argue (contrary to the norm) that single-copy fields naturally constructed on the original curved background metric are only interpretable on a flat metric when such a well-defined limit exists, for which Kerr--Schild coordinates offer a natural choice. As an explicit example where such a distinction matters, we initiate an exploration of single-copies for the G\"odel universe. This metric lacks a (geodesic) Kerr--Schild representation yet is Petrov type-D, meaning the technology of the ``Weyl double copy" may be utilized. The Weyl derived single copy has many desirable features, including matching the defining properties of the spacetime, and being sourced by the mixed Ricci tensor just as Kerr--Schild single copies are. To compare, we propose a sourced flat-space single-copy interpretation for the G\"odel metric by leveraging its symmetries, and find that this proposal lacks the defining properties of the spacetime, and is not consistent with the flat limit of our curved-space single copy. Notably, this inconsistency does not occur in Kerr--Schild metrics. Our curved-space single copy also lead to the same electromagnetic analogue of the G\"odel universe found separately through tidal force analogies, opening a new avenue of exploration between the double copy and gravitoelectromagnetism programs.</description>

      <title>QG from SymQRG: AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ Correspondence as Topological Symmetry-Preserving Quantum RG Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By analyzing the non-perturbative RG flows that explicitly preserve given symmetries, we demonstrate that they can be expressed as quantum path integrals of the $\textit{SymTFT}$ in one higher dimension. When the symmetries involved include Virasoro defect lines, such as in the case of $T\bar{T}$ deformations, the RG flow corresponds to the 3D quantum gravitational path integral. For each 2D CFT, we identify a corresponding ground state of the SymTFT, from which the Wheeler-DeWitt equation naturally emerges as a non-perturbative constraint. These observations are summarized in the slogan: $\textbf{SymQRG = QG}$. The recently proposed exact discrete formulation of Liouville theory in [1] allows us to identify a universal SymQRG kernel, constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols associated with $U_q(SL(2,\mathbb{R}))$. This kernel is directly related to the quantum path integral of the Virasoro TQFT, and manifests itself as an exact and analytical 3D background-independent MERA-type holographic tensor network. Many aspects of the AdS/CFT correspondence, including the factorization puzzle, admit a natural interpretation within this framework. This provides the first evidence suggesting that there is a universal holographic principle encompassing AdS/CFT and topological holography. We propose that the non-perturbative AdS/CFT correspondence is a $\textit{maximal}$ form of topological holography.</description>

      <title>Cosmological stimulated emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the analogy between graviton emission and absorption in a thermal radiation environment and the laser mechanism, in which photons of the same momentum and polarization are amplified. Using interaction-picture perturbation theory, we analyze the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in a squeezed vacuum state, which characterizes the inflationary graviton state. First, we examine this effect in a thermal bath in a Minkowski background and find that emission or absorption occurs depending on the initial squeezing parameters. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors immersed in a radiation environment at temperatures of ${O}(0.1)$ GeV. In this scenario, graviton numbers at frequencies of ${O}(100)$ Hz could be enhanced, suggesting a possible mechanism for amplifying gravitational wave signals. While this setup is beyond current experimental capabilities, it highlights potential advancements in gravitational wave detection. The significant effect observed in a flat background implies a backreaction of the thermal bath on spacetime. Thus, understanding this effect in an expanding universe is essential. During the radiation-dominated era of the early universe, gravitons within the horizon at reheating undergo stimulated absorption. We find a secular logarithmic growth for the superhorizon mode, leading to the breakdown of perturbative analysis, which requires further investigation in future.</description>

      <title>Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking: A Novel Way to Discover Anisotropy in nano-Hz Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isotropic stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) generated by a population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) provides a unique window into their cosmic evolution. In addition to the isotropic power spectrum, the anisotropic component of the signal carries additional information about the supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and host galaxy connection. The measurement of this signal is usually carried out by angular power spectra, which is only a sufficient measure for a Gaussian and statistically isotropic distribution of SMBHBs, where the statistical properties of a field remain unchanged across the sky. In contrast, the contribution from SMBHBs in nano-hertz SGWB will be hosted by fewer massive galaxies, making the nano-hertz background anisotropic and non-Gaussian. As a result, the performance of angular power spectra in extracting the underlying physics is limited. In this work, we propose a novel technique called the \texttt{Multi-Tracer Correlated Stacking}, which enables the detection of anisotropies in the SGWB by stacking the signal from regions of the sky with tracers of BHs such as active galactic nucleus (AGNs), quasars, bright galaxies, etc., that can be mapped up to high redshift. We demonstrate this technique on a simulated supermassive BHBs distribution using an AGN catalog, which maps the underlying matter distribution approximately up to redshift $z=5$. This stacking technique uniquely distinguishes between isotropic and anisotropic distributions of SGWB source, surpassing the capabilities of angular power spectrum-based methods in detecting anisotropic signals. This highlights the effectiveness of this technique in detecting anisotropic SGWB signals and in the future, this technique can play a crucial role in its discovery.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjectured relation between the energy-momentum and the displacement norm of superconformal defects. The proof completes earlier results, and shows that supersymmetry identifies two natural notions of brane tension in Anti-de Sitter gravity. As a byproduct we show that a modification of the energy-momentum tensor that removes the stress of static superconformal defects, ensures also that the radiation these emit obeys the Null Energy Condition. This sheds new light on the radiation-reaction problem for moving charges.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Bonnet-induced symmetry breaking/restoration during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism of symmetry breaking or restoration that can occur in the middle of inflation due to the coupling of the Gauss-Bonnet term to a charged scalar. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling results in an inflaton-dependent effective squared mass of the charged scalar, which can change its sign (around the symmetric point) during inflation. This can lead to spontaneous breaking of the symmetry, or to its restoration, if it is initially broken. We show the conditions under which the backreaction of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling on the inflationary background is negligible, such that the predictions of a given inflationary model are unaffected by the symmetry breaking/restoration process.</description>

      <title>How to Create a Flat Ten or Eleven Dimensional Space-time in the Interior of an Asymptotically Flat Four Dimensional String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By taking large mass and charge limit of a black hole in string theory we can create arbitrarily large regions where the space-time is approximately flat, but the moduli fields take values different from their asymptotic values. In this paper we describe a special case of this where black hole solutions in a four dimensional string theory, in the large mass and charge limit, can have an arbitrarily large region outside the horizon where a local observer will experience type IIA string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time. The curvature and other field strengths remain small everywhere between the asymptotic four dimensional observer and the ten dimensional region. By going to a different region of space, we can also get a large region where a local observer experiences M-theory in flat eleven dimensional space-time. By taking another solution in the same theory, one can create an arbitrarily large region where a local observer will experience type IIB string theory in flat ten dimensional space-time.</description>

      <title>DeepGrav: Anomalous Gravitational-Wave Detection Through Deep Latent Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel deep learning-based approach for gravitational wave anomaly detection, aiming to overcome the limitations of traditional matched filtering techniques in identifying unknown waveform gravitational wave signals. We introduce a modified convolutional neural network architecture inspired by ResNet that leverages residual blocks to extract high-dimensional features, effectively capturing subtle differences between background noise and gravitational wave signals. This network architecture learns a high-dimensional projection while preserving discrepancies with the original input, facilitating precise identification of gravitational wave signals. In our experiments, we implement an innovative data augmentation strategy that generates new data by computing the arithmetic mean of multiple signal samples while retaining the key features of the original signals.
  In the NSF HDR A3D3: Detecting Anomalous Gravitational Wave Signals competition, it is honorable for us (group name: easonyan123) to get to the first place at the end with our model achieving a true negative rate (TNR) of 0.9708 during development/validation phase and 0.9832 on an unseen challenge dataset during final/testing phase, the highest among all competitors. These results demonstrate that our method not only achieves excellent generalization performance but also maintains robust adaptability in addressing the complex uncertainties inherent in gravitational wave anomaly detection.</description>
