Abstract: Objective: To assess the antioxidant, wound healing, anti-ulcer, and anti-inflammatory properties of Jatropha maheshwari. Methods: Jatropha maheshwari was collected from Kanyakumari district and authenticated. Ethanol was used for continuous hot percolation extraction of the plant. Antioxidant activity was evaluated using DPPH and ABTS assays. The wound healing potential was assessed through a wound scratch assay using 3T3-L1 murine fibroblast cell lines. Anti-ulcer activity was measured using the acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) and H+/K+-ATPase inhibitory activity methods. Anti-inflammatory effects were determined through dose-dependent studies of the ethanol extract. Results: Antioxidant Activity: The crude extract exhibited strong antioxidant capacity with percentage inhibition values of 88% (DPPH) and 75.7% (ABTS). Wound Healing Activity: The wound closure rate in treated 3T3-L1 cell lines reached 97.88%, indicating potent wound healing properties. Anti-Ulcer Activity: The extract demonstrated an 80.1% inhibition compared to the control when tested alongside omeprazole. ANC per gram of antacid was recorded at 20 and 26 for oral doses of 10 and 500 {\mu}g/ml, respectively. Anti-Inflammatory Activity: Dose-dependent inhibition percentages of 30.1% (10 {\mu}g/ml) and 96.5% (500 {\mu}g/ml) were observed (p&lt;0.001) relative to inflammation control. Additional percentages of 26.3% (10 {\mu}g/ml) and 42.6% (500 {\mu}g/ml) further confirmed the anti-inflammatory activity.
  Conclusion: Jatropha maheshwari demonstrates significant antioxidant, wound healing, anti-ulcer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Further research is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these pharmacological effects.</description>
