      <title>Demystifying flux eruptions: Magnetic flux transport in magnetically arrested disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetically arrested disks (MADs) are a compelling model for explaining variability in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN), including horizon-scale outbursts like those observed in Sagittarius A*. MADs experience powerful flux eruptions-episodic ejections of magnetic flux from the black hole horizon-that may drive the observed luminosity variations. In this work, we develop and validate a new formalism describing large-scale magnetic field transport in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of MADs with geometrical thicknesses of $h/R=0.1$ and $h/R=0.3$. We introduce a net flux transport velocity, $v_\Phi$, which accounts for both advective and diffusive processes. We show that MADs maintain a statistical quasi-steady state where advection and diffusion nearly balance. Flux eruptions appear as small deviations from this equilibrium, with $v_\Phi/V_k\ll1$, where $V_k$ is the local Keplerian velocity. Using this framework, we analytically derive a recurrence timescale for flux eruptions, $t_{\rm rec}\sim1500\, r_g/c$. This timescale closely matches simulation results. The smallness of $v_\Phi$ explains the long recurrence times of flux eruptions compared to other system timescales. We also take a closer look at the diffusion of the magnetic field by performing the first measurement of turbulent resistivity in MADs. We then estimate the turbulent magnetic Prandtl number, defined as the ratio of turbulent viscosity to turbulent resistivity. We find $\mathcal{P}_m\sim3$, consistent with shearing-box simulations of magneto rotational instability-driven turbulence. While flux eruptions excite large-scale non-axisymmetric modes and locally enhance turbulent resistivity, magnetic field diffusion is dominated by smaller-scale turbulent motions. These results provide new insight into the nature of AGN variability and the fundamental physics of magnetic field transport.</description>

      <title>25 Years of Groundbreaking Discoveries with Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chandra X-ray Observatory is a mainstay of modern observational astrophysics. With the highest angular resolution of any X-ray facility, its imaging and spectral capabilities in the 0.5-10 keV band have led to both unique and complementary breakthroughs in nearly all areas of the field. Now more than a quarter century into its mission, Chandra continues to provide unique information on the contributions of compact objects to the evolution of galaxies, the nature of supernova explosions, the impact of energetic jets from supermassive black holes on their host environments, and the fate of exoplanet atmospheres in systems rich with stellar flares. Here we provide a summary of Chandra results - one that is embarrassingly incomplete, but representative of both the exquisite past and promising future for Chandra's contributions to high energy astrophysics and all of mainstream astronomy.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Constraints on Neutron-Star Pressure Anisotropy via Universal Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars may exhibit pressure anisotropy arising from various physical mechanisms, such as elasticity, magnetic fields, viscosity, and superfluidity. We compute the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode oscillation frequency of anisotropic neutron stars using a phenomenological quasi-local model characterized by a single dimensionless anisotropy parameter. We find that while the relation between the tidal deformability and the $f$-mode frequency depends on the degree of anisotropy, it remains largely insensitive to variations in the equation of state (the relation between radial pressure and energy density) for a fixed anisotropy parameter, similar to the isotropic case. Leveraging this anisotropy-dependent universal relation within a statistical framework, we place constraints on the anisotropy parameter using both the gravitational wave observation of GW170817 and simulated data for a GW170817-like event observed by a future network of detectors. We find that the anisotropy parameter can be constrained to order unity with current data, and the bounds remain comparable with future detector sensitivities. Importantly, these constraints are only weakly affected by uncertainties in the neutron-star equation of state.</description>

      <title>Accretion rates of stellar-mass compact objects embedded in AGN discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar-mass compact objects (COs) embedded in active galactic nucleus (AGN) discs are commonly assumed to accrete via Bondi or Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) prescriptions, neglecting gas angular momentum. We show that differential rotation in AGN discs can impart non-negligible angular momentum, in which case accretion proceeds through a viscous disc rather than Bondi/BHL flow. Our model provides a new framework estimating the CO accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{CO} = \min\{\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}, \dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}\}$, where the viscous rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis}$ accounts for gas--CO relative motion decomposed into a local gradient term (due to differential rotation) and bulk motion (from differing orbital parameters). This rate can be expressed as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} = \alpha \xi (r_\mathrm{H}/r_\mathrm{BHL})^3\dot{M}_\mathrm{BHL}$, where $\xi$ is a coefficient of order unity. It can also be approximately scaled to the global AGN accretion rate as $\dot{M}_\mathrm{vis} \propto \dot{M}_1$, with the scaling coefficients in both forms determined by the specific dynamical configuration. The accretion is viscosity-limited when $q &gt; [\alpha \xi(1+\mathcal{M}^2)^{3}/3]^{1/2} h^3$, where $q$ is the mass ratio between the CO and the supermassive black hole, $\alpha$ the viscosity parameter, $\mathcal{M}$ the Mach number of the bulk relative motion, and $h$ the aspect ratio of the AGN disc. In thin AGN discs this condition is satisfied for most stellar-mass or more massive COs. Our framework also naturally allows for the inclusion of established outflow corrections, thereby enabling a more realistic treatment of super-Eddington flows. Our formulation thus improves upon Bondi/BHL prescriptions and offers a more physically motivated basis for studying CO evolution in AGN environments.</description>

      <title>Evidence of cosmic-ray acceleration up to sub-PeV energies in the supernova remnant IC 443</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have been considered as the primary contributors to cosmic rays (CRs) in our Galaxy. However, the maximum energy of particles that can be accelerated by shocks of SNRs is uncertain observationally and theoretically, and the role of contribution to CRs around PeV energies by SNRs is unclear. In this study, we present observations of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission from the SNR IC 443 using the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). The morphological analysis reveals a pointlike source whose location and spectrum are consistent with those of the Fermi-LAT-detected compact source with $\pi^0$-decay signature, and a more extended source which is consistent with a newly discovered source, previously unrecognized by Fermi-LAT. The spectrum of the point source can be described by a power-law function with an index of $\sim3.0$, extending beyond $\sim 30$ TeV without apparent cutoff. Assuming a hadronic origin of the $\gamma$-ray emission, the $95\%$ lower limit of accelerated protons reaches about 300 TeV. The extended source might be coincident with IC 443, SNR G189.6+3.3 or the putative pulsar wind nebula CXOU J061705.3+222127, and can be explained by either a hadronic or leptonic model. The LHAASO results provide compelling evidence that CR protons up to sub-PeV energies can be accelerated by the SNR.</description>

      <title>Direct Numerical Simulations of Oxygen-Flame-Driven Deflagration-to-Detonation Transition in Type Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present direct numerical simulations demonstrating deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT) driven by oxygen flames in Type Ia supernova progenitors. Using the Castro hydrodynamics code coupled with the ``aprox13'' 13-isotope nuclear network, we simulate combustion in isolated fuel regions where oxygen flames trail carbon flames. In a fiducial one-dimensional run at $\rho_{0}=3.5\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ we observe spontaneous DDT of the oxygen flame via the Zel'dovich gradient mechanism when the carbon-oxygen separation reaches $\sim 10\ \mathrm{km}$. The oxygen detonation then captures the carbon flame and triggers a stable carbon detonation. Systematic one-dimensional parameter scans show that successful carbon DDT requires upstream densities in the range $(3.1$--$3.6)\times10^{7}\ \mathrm{g\ cm^{-3}}$ and a minimum carbon-flame thickness of $\gtrsim 20\ \mathrm{m}$. Two-dimensional simulations confirm DDT and demonstrate that the multidimensional cellular structure of the oxygen detonation can promote carbon detonation at somewhat lower densities than in one dimension. These results provide direct numerical evidence that oxygen-flame-driven DDT is physically plausible in turbulent white-dwarf environments and underscore the importance of multidimensional effects for Type Ia supernova explosion modeling.</description>

      <title>Multi-Faceted Emission Properties of PSR J2129+4119 Observed with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed single-pulse study of the long-period pulsar PSR J2129+4119 using high-sensitivity FAST observations. Despite locating well below the traditional death line, the pulsar exhibits sustained and multi-modal emission behavior, including nulls, weak pulses, regular emission, and occasional bright pulses. The nulling fraction is measured to be $8.13\% \pm 0.51\%$, with null durations typically under four pulse periods. Fluctuation spectral analysis reveals both phase-modulated subpulse drifting and intermittent beat-like modulation. At the same time, polarization profiles show high linear polarization and stable polarization position angle (PPA) swings consistent with a near-tangential sightline geometry. Quasi-periodic microstructures are detected in 11.54\% of regular pulses, with a mean periodicity and width of 4.57 ms and 4.30 ms, respectively. A well-defined scintillation arc in the secondary spectrum confirms the presence of a localized scattering screen. These results indicate that PSR J2129+4119 remains magnetospherically active and coherently emitting despite its low energy loss rate, offering key insights into pulsar emission physics near the death line.</description>

      <title>Rotation Measure Analysis of Shocks and Sloshing Fronts in a Galaxy Cluster Merger Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the Fornax cluster show depolarization signatures on megaparsec scales, which may be associated with shocks and/or sloshing motions during cluster merger and/or in-fall. To investigate the possible reasons behind the depolarization, we carry out analytical and full polarized radiative transfer (PRT) calculations of radio point sources behind a merging galaxy cluster simulated using the FLASH code. With uniform background light, we analyzed the rotation measure (RM) morphology near the shock front and the cluster center, where sloshing cold fronts appear. For the shock scenario, we find a local RM enhancement by $\sim56\%$ behind the shock front on megaparsec scales, arising from the compression of hot gas and magnetic field lines. Behind the sloshing cold front, the cluster center shows decrement in RM magnitude by $\sim23.3\%$, as a result of the cancellation effect of randomly-oriented magnetic fields induced by sloshing-driven turbulence. We find that beam depolarization increases behind shock fronts and across sloshing cold fronts, indicating enhanced magnetic field fluctuations across the plane of the sky in both scenarios. By fully accounting for all radiative transfer coefficients in the PRT calculations, the uniform background light becomes more depolarized near the cluster center, with the effect growing more pronounced as background intensity decreases. This suggests that synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation of the intracluster medium can significantly influence the polarization of background sources.</description>

      <title>The $N_H$ Distribution of Hard X-ray Selected AGN in the NEP Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray surveys are one of the most unbiased methods for detecting Compton Thick (CT; $N_{{\mathrm{H}}} \geq 10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) AGN, which are thought to comprise up to $60\%$ of AGN within $z \lesssim 1.0$. These CT AGN are often difficult to detect with current instruments, but the X-ray data within the JWST-North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Time Domain Field (TDF) present a unique opportunity to study faint and obscured AGN. The NEP contains the deepest NuSTAR survey to date, and Zhao et al. (2024) detected 60 hard X-ray sources from the combined exposure of NuSTAR's Cycle 5 and 6 observations. In this work, we utilize the NuSTAR Cycle 5+6+8+9 data and simultaneous XMM-Newton observations in order to perform the first spectroscopic analysis of the 60-source catalog. We present this analysis and measure the $N_{{\mathrm{H}}}$ distribution of the sample. We measure an observed CT fraction of $0.13_{-0.04}^{+0.15}$ down to an observed $8-24$ keV flux of $6.0 \times 10^{-14}$ erg/s/cm$^{2}$, and we correct our analysis for absorption bias to estimate an underlying CT fraction of $0.32_{-0.08}^{+0.23}$. The derived obscuration distribution and CT fraction are consistent with population synthesis models and previous surveys.</description>

      <title>A Star's Death by a Thousand Cuts: The Runaway Periodic Eruptions of AT2023uqm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars on bound orbits around a supermassive black hole may undergo repeated partial tidal disruption events (rpTDEs), producing periodic flares. While several candidates have been suggested, definitive confirmation of these events remains elusive. We report the discovery of AT2023uqm, a nuclear transient that has exhibited at least five periodic optical flares, making it only the second confirmed case of periodicity after ASASSN-14ko. Uniquely, the flares from AT2023uqm show a nearly exponential increase in energy--a "runaway" phenomenon signaling the star's progressive destruction. This behavior is consistent with rpTDEs of low-mass, main-sequence stars or evolved giant stars. Multiwavelength observations and spectroscopic analysis of the two most recent flares reinforce its interpretation as an rpTDE. Intriguingly, each flare displays a similar double-peaked structure, potentially originating from a double-peaked mass fallback rate or two discrete collisions per orbit. The extreme ratio of peak separation to orbital period draws attention to the possibility of a giant star being disrupted, which could be distinguished from a low-mass main-sequence star by its future mass-loss evolution. Our analysis demonstrates the power of rpTDEs to probe the properties of disrupted stars and the physical processes of tidal disruption, though it is currently limited by our knowledge of these events. AT2023uqm emerges as the most compelling rpTDE thus far, serving as a crucial framework for modeling and understanding these phenomena.</description>

      <title>The second data release of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array: Investigating the Effect of Coronal Mass Ejection on PSR J1022+1001 and a Possible Mode Change of PSR J2145-0750</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) has recently published its second data release (DR2), comprising the timing analysis of seven years of data on 27 millisecond pulsars (MSPs), observed simultaneously in the 300-500 MHz (band 3) and 1260-1460 MHz (band 5), using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The low-frequency data, particularly in band 3, is highly sensitive to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations, which can be imprints of some astrophysical phenomena (scientific outliers). Here, we analyze the two outliers of possible astrophysical origin coming from the band 3 DM time series of two pulsars: PSR J1022+1001, with an ecliptic latitude of -0.06 degree , and PSR J2145-0750, one of the brightest MSPs, with multi-component profile morphology. Our study reveals compelling evidence for a coronal mass ejection (CME) event traced in the data of PSR J1022+1001, and reports evidence for a potential mode-changing event in PSR J2145-0750. Extending the analyses presented here to the full sample of InPTA-DR2 pulsars is expected to reveal additional CME events, and possible mode-changing events. Such detections will not only improve our understanding of solar and pulsar magnetospheric plasma interactions but will also enable more accurate modelling of DM variations, leading to improved pulsar timing solutions, which are crucial for high-precision Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) science.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption events with SPH-EXA: resolving the return of the stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a tidal disruption event (TDE), a star is disrupted by the tidal field of a massive black hole, creating a debris stream that returns to the black hole, forms an accretion flow, and powers a luminous flare. Over the last few decades, several numerical studies have concluded that shock-induced dissipation occurs as the stream returns to pericentre (i.e., pre-self-intersection), resulting in efficient circularisation of the debris. However, the efficacy of these shocks is the subject of intense debate. We present high-resolution simulations (up to 10^10 particles) of the disruption of a solar-like star by a 10^6M_sun black hole with the new, GPU-based, smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code SPH-EXA, including the relativistic apsidal precession of the stellar debris orbits; our simulations run from initial disruption to the moment of stream self-intersection. With 10^8 particles - corresponding to the highest-resolution SPH simulations of TDEs in the pre-existing literature - we find significant, in-plane spreading of the debris as the stream returns through pericenter, in line with previous works that suggested this is a significant source of dissipation and luminous emission. However, with increasing resolution this effect is dramatically diminished, and with 10^10 particles there is effectively no change between the incoming and the outgoing stream widths. Our results demonstrate that the paradigm of significant dissipation of kinetic energy during pericentre passage is incorrect, and instead it is likely that debris circularisation is mediated by the originally proposed, stream-stream collision scenario.</description>

      <title>The 2024 July 16 Solar Event: A Challenge To The Coronal Mass Ejection Origin Of Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-spacecraft analysis of the 2024 July 16 Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flare (LDGRF) detected by the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi satellite. The measured &gt;100 MeV $\gamma$-ray emission persisted for over seven hours after the flare impulsive phase, and was characterized by photon energies exceeding 1 GeV and a remarkably-hard parent-proton spectrum. In contrast, the phenomena related to the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock linked to this eruption were modest, suggesting an inefficient proton acceleration unlikely to achieve the energies well-above the 300 MeV pion-production threshold to account for the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Specifically, the CME was relatively slow (~600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary type-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically detected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not extend to kHz frequencies and disappeared ~5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end time. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very weak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically well-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME resulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into the solar surface. The alternative origin scenario based on local particle trapping and acceleration in large-scale coronal loops is instead favored by the observation of giant arch-like structures of hot plasma over the source region persisting for the entire duration of this LDGRF.</description>

      <title>Compact Accretion Disks in the Aftermath of Tidal Disruption Events: Parameter Inference from Joint X-ray Spectra and UV/Optical Photometry Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-wavelength analysis of 14 tidal disruption events (TDEs)-including an off-nuclear event associated with an ultra-compact dwarf galaxy-selected for having available thermal X-ray spectra during their late-time UV/optical plateau phase. We show that at these stages, the full spectral energy distribution - X-ray spectra and UV/optical photometry - is well described by a compact, yet standard accretion disk, the same disk which powers the X-rays at all times. By fitting up to three three epochs per source with a fully relativistic disk model, we show that many system properties can be reliably recovered, including importantly the black hole mass ($M_{\bullet}$). These accretion-based $M_{\bullet}$ values, which in this sample span nearly three orders of magnitude, are consistent with galactic scaling relations but are significantly more precise (68\% credible interval $ &lt; \pm 0.3$ dex) and physically motivated. Expected accretion scaling relations (e.g., $L_{Bol}^{ disk} / L_{Edd} \propto T_p^4 \propto M_{\bullet}^{-1}$), TDE-specific physics correlations ($L_{plat} \propto M_{\bullet}^{2/3}$ and $R_{out}/r_g \propto M_{\bullet}^{-2/3}$) and black hole-host galaxy correlations ($M_{\bullet}$-$M_{\star}$ and $M_{\bullet}$-$\sigma_{\star}$) naturally emerge from the data and, for the first time, are self-consistently extended into the intermediate-mass (IMBH, $M_{\bullet} &lt; 10^{5}$) regime. We discuss the implications of these results for TDE physics and modeling. We also review and discuss different methods for $M_{\bullet}$ inference in TDEs, and find that approaches based on physical models of the early-time UV/optical emission are not able to recover (at a statistically significant level) black hole-host galaxy scalings.</description>

      <title>Exploring the quasar disc-wind-jet connection with LoTSS and SDSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between disc winds, radio jets, accretion rates and black hole masses of a sample of $\sim$100k quasars at z $\approx$ 2. Combining spectra from the 17th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with radio fluxes from the 2nd data release of the Low Frequency ARray (LOFAR) Two-Meter Sky Survey (LoTSS), we statistically characterise a radio loud and radio quiet population using a two-component Gaussian Mixture model, and perform population matching in black hole mass and Eddington fraction. We determine how the fraction of radio loud sources changes across this parameter space, finding that jets are most efficiently produced in quasars with either a very massive central black hole ($M_{\textrm{BH}} &gt; 10^9 \textrm{M}_{\odot}$) or one that is rapidly accreting ($\lambda_{\textrm{Edd}}&gt;0.3$). We also show that there are differences in the blueshift of the CIV $\lambda$1549{\AA} line and the equivalent width of the HeII $\lambda$1640{\AA} line in radio loud and radio quiet quasars that persist even after accounting for differences in the mass and accretion rate of the central black hole. Generally, we find an anti-correlation between the inferred presence of disc winds and jets, which we suggest is mediated by differences in the quasars' spectral energy distributions. The latter result is shown through the close coupling between tracers of wind kinematics and the ionising flux-- which holds for both radio loud and radio quiet sources, despite differences between their emission line properties-- and is hinted at by a different Baldwin effect in the two populations.</description>

      <title>Beyond GRMHD: A Robust Numerical Scheme for Extended, Non-Ideal General Relativistic Multifluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) have become the standard mathematical framework for modeling high-energy plasmas in curved spacetimes. However, the fragility of the primitive variable reconstruction operation in GRMHD, as well as the difficulties in maintaining strong hyperbolicity of the equations, sharply limit the applicability of the GRMHD model in scenarios involving large Lorentz factors and high magnetizations, such as around neutron stars. Non-ideal effects, such as electron inertia and Hall terms, are also neglected, and the absence of an explicitly evolved electric field precludes the self-consistent modeling of the strong poloidal fields found around spinning black holes, which are known to be crucial for jet formation. Here, we present a general relativistic multifluid model which strictly generalizes the GRMHD equations, consisting of an arbitrary number of relativistic fluid species interacting with a shared electromagnetic field via an explicit coupling of their source terms, thus allowing for the incorporation of non-ideal effects. We sketch how our model may be derived from general relativistic kinetics (via moments of the relativistic Boltzmann-Vlasov equation), as well as how GRMHD may be recovered in the single-fluid limit as the mobility of charge carriers goes to infinity. We present a numerical scheme for solving the general relativistic multifluid equations, and validate it against the analogous scheme for the GRMHD equations. Since the primitive variable reconstruction operation for our multifluid model is purely hydrodynamic, and therefore independent of the magnetic field, the resulting solver is highly robust, and able to simulate significantly larger Lorentz factors and higher magnetizations (across both black hole and neutron star spacetimes) than GRMHD without loss of either accuracy or stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional seesaw mechanisms provide an elegant theoretical framework for explaining the small yet non-zero masses of neutrinos. Nevertheless, they face significant experimental challenges, primarily because the energy scale associated with the seesaw mechanism is too high to be directly probed in terrestrial experiments. In this paper, we explore the gravitational waves (GWs) generated via graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of seesaw particles in the early Universe. Specifically, we compute the GW spectrum resulting from the decay of the Higgs triplet within the type-II seesaw model. Our results demonstrate that the resulting GW spectrum depends sensitively on the mass of the Higgs triplet and its couplings to the Standard Model Higgs doublet and the left-handed lepton doublet. The detection of such a high-frequency GW background could offer a unique experimental window into the seesaw mechanism and provide indirect evidence for its validity.</description>

      <title>Generative Artificial Intelligence for Air Shower Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detailed simulation of extensive air showers, produced by primary cosmic rays interacting in the atmosphere, is a task that is traditionally undertaken by means of Monte Carlo methods. These processes are computationally intensive, accounting for a major fraction of the computational resources used in the large-scale simulations required by current and future experiments in the field of astroparticle physics. In this work, we present a novel approach based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to accelerate air shower simulations. We developed and trained a GAN on a dataset of high-energy proton-induced air showers generated with \texttt{CORSIKA}; our model reproduces key distributions of secondary particles, such as energy spectra and spatial distributions at ground level of muons. Once the model has been trained, which takes approximately 74 hours, the generation real time per shower is reduced by a factor of $10^4$ with respect to the full \texttt{CORSIKA} simulation, leading to a substantial decrease in both computational time and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Long-term Variability of AGN Light Curves. I. A Case Study with ZTF Observations in the EGS Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical variability is a key observational probe for studying the accretion dynamics and central engine physics of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). The quality and completeness of light curves have a direct impact on variability studies, particularly for faint AGNs and high-redshift AGNs. To improve the quality of long-term light curves for AGNs, we bin and stack multi-epoch images balancing the image depths and temporal resolution. As a case study, we apply this method to Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS) field, where the overlapping region covers an area of about 370 arcmin$^2$ and includes $g$-band and $r$-band data taken from March 2018 to December 2024. The co-added images are approximately 2.0 to 2.5 magnitudes deeper than the ZTF single-epoch images. With co-added images, we construct light curves for 73 AGNs in the EGS field. Compared to the traditional ZTF light curves, our light curves maintain consistent long-term variability trends but with higher photometric precision. Furthermore, this method can help detect AGNs with weak variability which are missed from the traditional ZTF data due to the noisy light curves or below the detection limit in ZTF's single-epoch exposure. Among the 73 AGNs, the majority exhibit a bluer-when-brighter (BWB) trend on long-term timescales, which is consistent with previous studies. This work offers insights for optimizing AGN light curves in both current and upcoming all-sky time-domain surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic properties of black holes have been extensively studied through analogies with classical systems, revealing fundamental connections between gravitation, entropy, and quantum mechanics. In this work, we extend the thermodynamic framework of black holes by incorporating charge and analyzing its role in entropy production. Using an analogy with charged rotating soap bubbles, we demonstrate that charge contributes to the total angular momentum and affects the entropy-event horizon relationship. By applying the Gouy-Stodola theorem, we establish a consistent thermodynamic formulation for charged black holes, showing that the first law of thermodynamics remains valid in this context. Furthermore, we explore the behavior of the partition function from the perspective of a distant observer, revealing that charge effects diminish with increasing distance. These findings reinforce the thermodynamic interpretation of black holes and provide insights into the interplay between charge, rotation, and entropy in gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Constraining binary mergers in AGN disks using the non-observation of lensed gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dense and dynamic environments within active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disks may serve as prolific birthplaces for binary black holes (BBHs) and one possible origin for some of the BBHs detected by gravitational-wave (GW) observatories. We show that a considerable fraction of the BBH in AGN disks will be strongly lensed by the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Thus, the non-observation of lensed GW signals can be used to constrain the fraction of BBH binaries residing in AGN disks. The non-detection of lensing with current ${\cal O}(100)$ detections will be sufficient to start placing constraints on the fraction of BBHs living within accretion disks near the SMBH. In the next-generation detectors era, with ${\cal O}(10^5)$ BBH observations and no lensed events, we will be able to rule out most migration traps as dominant birthplaces of BBH mergers; moreover, we will be able to constrain the minimum size of the accretion disk. On the other hand, should AGNs constitute a major formation channel, lensed events from AGNs will become prominent in the future.</description>

      <title>The role of equation of state on the spin-up of millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are recycled pulsars which have been spun-up due to mass accretion during the phase of mass exchange in binaries. Although the interactions with companion stars play important roles on the spin-up process, the global properties of pulsars determined by the equation of state (EoS), such as mass, radius and the moment of inertia, should also play a role. We investigate the spin-up of MSPs in neutron star (NS) and strangeon star (SS) models, both of which have passed the tests by the existence of high-mass pulsars and the tidal deformability of GW~170817. Combining the spin-up condition and the transferred angular momentum, and taking into account the evolution of magnetic field strength during accretion, we can constrain the spin-period and mass of an MSP. Our results show that the impeding effect of magnetic field on the spin-up of MSPs would be more significant for NSs than for SSs, especially for the ones with low masses. In the low-mass ($M$ below or around about $1.2 M_\odot$) case, an SS can spin faster than an NS of the same mass by accreting the same amount of mass. Finding more low-mass and fully recycled MSPs, with accurate mass-measurement and better constraints on the amount of accreted mass, could help to put more strict constraints on the EoS of pulsars.</description>

      <title>A Hyperactive FRB Pinpointed in an SMC-Like Satellite Host Galaxy</title>

Abstract: Precise localizations of fast radio bursts (FRBs) are essential for uncovering their host galaxies and immediate environments. We present the milliarcsecond-precision European VLBI Network localization of FRB 20240114A, a hyperactive repeating FRB, achieving &lt;90x30 mas (1-sigma) accuracy. This precision places the burst 0.5 kpc from the nucleus of its low-metallicity star-forming dwarf host at a spectroscopic redshift of z = 0.130287. Our Gran Telescopio CANARIAS spectroscopic follow-up reveals that the dwarf FRB host is gravitationally bound to a more massive, star-forming spiral galaxy. This establishes the first known instance of an FRB residing in a satellite galaxy within a larger galactic system. This configuration, analogous to the Small Magellanic Cloud orbiting the Milky Way (but at a lower overall mass scale), expands the known diversity of FRB host environments and offers important insights for interpreting seemingly "hostless" or highly offset FRBs. Furthermore, our detailed dispersion measure (DM) budget analysis indicates that the dominant contribution to FRB 20240114A's DM likely originates from the foreground galaxy halos. This finding addresses the anomalously high DM observed for this FRB and underscores the significant role of intervening foreground structures in shaping observed FRB DMs, which is important for accurate FRB-based cosmological measurements. Our results highlight the importance of deep, high-resolution optical/infrared observations (e.g., with the Hubble or James Webb Space Telescopes) to fully leverage our precise radio localization and probe the immediate astrophysical birthplaces of FRB progenitors within these complex galactic systems.</description>

      <title>Hubble constant measurement from QPEs as electromagnetic counterparts to extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered nuclear transient, quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme/intermediate mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as LISA. Here, we study the secular orbital evolution of QPE systems under different theoretical frameworks based on timing observation,including the stripping scenario and the orbiter-disk scenario, and assess their GW detectability by LISA. Here, we model the secular orbital evolution of known QPE systems using two frameworks: a stripping scenario in which periodic mass transfer at periapsis drives the evolution; and an orbiter-disk collision scenario in which the companion interacts with a misaligned accretion disk, modulated by coupled orbiter-disk precession. For each framework, we assess detectability by LISA, together with the resulting constraints on $H_0$. Our principal findings are: (i) in the stripping scenario, no currently known QPE reaches detectability within a four-year LISA mission. (ii) in the orbiter-disk scenario, two sources-eRO-QPE2 and eRO-QPE4-are detectable with signal-to-noise ratios $\simeq 8.5-28.8$ and constrain $H_0$ with frictional uncertainty of 6.7-14.9\%. QPE systems remain uncertain on the decade-long secular evolution. Therefore, they motivate continued time-domain monitoring of QPE candidates.</description>

      <title>A Late-time Radio Survey of Type Ia-CSM Supernovae with the Very Large Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type Ia-CSM supernovae (SNe) are a rare and peculiar subclass of thermonuclear SNe characterized by emission lines of hydrogen or helium, indicative of a high-density circumstellar medium (CSM). Their implied mass-loss rates of $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (assuming $\mathrm{ \sim 100 \ km\ s^{-1}}$ winds) from optical observations are generally in excess of values observed in realistic SN Ia progenitors. In this paper, we present an independent study of CSM densities around a sample of 29 archival Ia-CSM SNe using radio observations with the Very Large Array at 6 GHz. Motivated by the late ($\sim$2 yr) radio detection of the Ia-CSM SN 2020eyj, we observed old ($&gt;$1 yr) SNe where we are more likely to see the emergent synchrotron emission that may have been suppressed earlier by free-free absorption by the CSM. We do not detect radio emission down to 3$\sigma$ limits of $\sim$35 $\mu$Jy in our sample. The only radio-detected candidate in our sample, SN 2022esa, was likely mis-classified as a Ia-CSM with early spectra, and appears more consistent with a peculiar Ic based on later-epochs. Assuming a wind-like CSM with temperatures between $2 \times 10^4$ K and $10^5$ K, and magnetic field-to-shock energy fraction ($\epsilon_B$) = $0.01-0.1$, the radio upper limits rule out mass-loss rates between $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (100 km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. This is somewhat in tension with the estimates from optical observations, and may indicate that more complex CSM geometries and/or lower values of $\epsilon_B$ may be present.</description>

      <title>Application of interpretable data-driven methods for the reconstruction of supernova neutrino energy spectra following fast neutrino flavor conversions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos can experience fast flavor conversions (FFCs) in highly dense astrophysical environments, such as core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers, potentially affecting energy transport and other processes. The simulation of fast flavor conversions under realistic astrophysical conditions requires substantial computational resources and involves significant analytical challenges. While machine learning methods like Multilayer Perceptrons have been used to accurately predict the asymptotic outcomes of FFCs, their 'black-box' nature limits the extraction of direct physical insight. To address this limitation, we employ two distinct interpretable machine learning frameworks-Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy)-to derive physically insightful models from a FFC simulation dataset. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off between predictive accuracy and model simplicity. The KANs demonstrates high fidelity in reconstructing post-conversion neutrino energy spectra, achieving accuracies of up to $90\%$. In contrast, SINDy uncovers a remarkably concise, low-rank set of governing equations, offering maximum interpretability but with lower predictive accuracy. Critically, by analyzing the interpretable model, we identify the number density of heavy-lepton neutrinos as the most dominant factor in the system's evolution. Ultimately, this work provides a methodological framework for interpretable machine learning that supports genuine data-driven physical discovery in astronomy and astrophysics, going beyond prediction alone.</description>

      <title>SN 2024gy: Multi-epoch Spectroscopic Features Suggestive of Delayed Detonation in a Type Ia Supernova</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024gy, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting high-velocity features (HVFs) in its early-time spectra. This SN reaches a peak $B$-band magnitude of $-19.25 \pm 0.29$ mag and subsequently declines by $\Delta m_{15}(B) \approx 1.12$ mag, consistent with the luminosity-width relation characteristic of normal SNe Ia. Based on the peak thermal luminosity of $(1.2 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we estimate that $0.57 \pm 0.14~\rm M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized during the explosion. Our dense early spectral monitoring revealed significant velocity disparities within the ejecta. Notably, absorption features from the Ca II near-infrared triplet were observed at velocities exceeding 25,000 km s$^{-1}$, while the Si II $\lambda$6355 line velocity at the same epoch was significantly lower at $\sim$ 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. This velocity disparity likely reflects distinct ionization states of intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers. The prominent Ca II HVFs may originate from ionization suppression within the highest-velocity ejecta, potentially indicative of minimal hydrogen mixing in a delayed-detonation explosion scenario. Additionally, the Ni/Fe ratio derived from the nebular spectrum of SN 2024gy provides further support for this model.</description>

      <title>The role of migration traps in the formation of binary black holes in AGN disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03637v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are often assumed to form at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We map where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that, for SMBH masses below $10^8 M_\odot$, the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps ($\gtrsim 80\%$). In contrast, for higher SMBH masses, differential migration dominates and off-trap pair-ups can prevail. Certain disk configurations (e.g., $\alpha = 0.01$, $M_\bullet &lt; 10^6 M_\odot$) present a significant overdensity of pair-ups even in the absence of traps due to traffic-jam accumulations where the gamma profile changes slope sharply. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups cluster more tightly around trap or traffic-jam radii. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of Heavy Ions at Non-Relativistic Collisionless Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the process of Diffusive Shock Acceleration (DSA) of particles with mass number to charge number ratios $A/Q &gt; 1$, e.g., partially-ionized heavy ions. To this end, we introduce helium- and carbon-like ions at solar abundances into two-dimensional hybrid (kinetic ions--fluid electrons) simulations of non-relativistic collisionless shocks. This study yields three main results: 1) Heavy ions are preferentially accelerated compared to hydrogen. For typical solar abundances, the energy transferred to accelerated helium ions is comparable to, or even exceeds, that of hydrogen, thereby enhancing the overall shock acceleration efficiency. 2) Accelerated helium ions contribute to magnetic field amplification, which increases the maximum attainable particle energy and steepen the spectra of accelerated particles. 3) The efficient acceleration of helium significantly enhances the production of hadronic gamma rays and neutrinos, likely dominating the one due to hydrogen. These effects should be taken into account, especially when modeling strong space and astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>Evolution of accretion disc-corona in the TDE Candidate AT 2019avd</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate AT 2019avd show drastic variabilities in flux and spectral shape over hundreds of days, providing clues on the accretion disc-corona evolution. We utilize a disc-corona model, in which a fraction of the gravitational energy released in the disc is transported into the hot corona above/below. Some soft photons emitted from the disc are upscattered to X-ray photons by the hot electrons in the optically thin corona. By fitting the NICER observations of AT 2019avd during epochs when the spectra exhibit significant hardening, we derive the evolution of the mass accretion rate, $\dot{m}$, and the coronal energy fraction, $f$. Our results show that $f$ decreases with increasing $\dot{m}$, which is qualitatively consistent with that observed in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), while the slope of this source, $f\propto \dot{m}^{-0.30}$, is much shallower than that of AGNs. We also find that the non-thermal X-ray spectrum in this source is significantly softer than those typically seen in AGNs and black-hole X-ray binaries. We argue that these quantitative differences can be a powerful diagnostic of the underlying magnetic turbulence, which may imply a stronger magnetic field within the TDE accretion disc than that in typical AGNs. It is also found that the evolution of the fitted neutral hydrogen column density follows a similar pattern to that of the accretion rate evolution, which may reflect the accumulation of absorbing material originating from the inflowing streams of stellar debris and/or other related sources.</description>

      <title>Population of Binary Black Holes Inferred from One Hundred and Fifty Gravitational Wave Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations have reported gravitational wave signals from more than 150 binary black holes in the fourth catalog (GWTC-4). Here, we investigate the population properties of these binary black holes using the mixture-model framework Vamana. We present one-dimensional distributions of masses and spins, explore their correlations, and examine their evolution with redshift. These features may reflect astrophysical processes associated with binary black hole formation channels, although most remain poorly constrained. A notable feature is a peak near $10M_\odot$ in the primary mass and $8M_\odot$ in the chirp mass. Additionally, the primary and secondary masses correlate uniquely, producing pronounced peaks in the chirp mass around $14M_\odot$ and $27M_\odot$. The three peaks are roughly separated by a factor of two. A simple explanation for such well-placed peaks is a hierarchical merger scenario, in which the first peak arises from mergers of black holes of stellar origin, and higher-mass peaks arise from repeated mergers of black holes from lower-mass peaks. Although most binaries do not exhibit the high spins and characteristic mass ratios expected from hierarchical mergers, those that do are associated with the peaks observed in the chirp mass distribution.</description>

      <title>Timescales of Quasar Accretion Discs from Low to High Black Hole Masses and a Turnover at the High Mass End</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characteristic time scales in the stochastic UV-optical variability of quasars may depend on the mass of their black holes, $M_{\rm BH}$, as much as physical timescales in their accretion discs do. We calculate emission-weighted mean radii, $R_{\rm mean}$, and orbital timescales, $t_{\rm mean}$, of standard thin disc models for emission wavelengths $\lambda$ from 1000 to 10000 AA, $M_{\rm BH}$ from $10^6$ to $10^{11}$ solar masses, and Eddington ratios from 0.01 to 1. At low $M_{\rm BH}$, we find the textbook behaviour of $t_{\rm mean}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-1/2}$ alongside $R_{\rm mean} \approx \mathrm{const}$, but toward higher masses the growing event horizon imposes $R_{\rm mean} \propto M_{\rm BH}$ and thus a turnover into $t_{\rm mean}\propto M_{\rm BH}$. For quasars of $\log L_{\rm bol}=47$, the turnover mass, where $t_{\rm mean}$ starts rising is $M_{\rm BH}\approx 9.5$, which means that the turnover in $t_{\rm mean}$ is well within the range of high-luminosity quasar samples, whose variability time scales might thus show little mass dependence. We fit smoothly broken power laws to the results and provide analytic convenience functions for $R_{\rm mean}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$ and $t_{\rm mean}(\lambda,M_{\rm BH},L_{3000})$.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic baryon distribution and the impact of AGN feedback with FRBs in CROCODILE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12741v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Missing Baryon problem using Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) to trace cosmic baryons. Our CROCODILE simulations, performed with the GADGET3/4-OSAKA smoothed particle hydrodynamics code, include star formation, supernova (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. We generate light cones from large-scale structure simulations to compute gas density profiles and dispersion measures (DMs) measurable by FRBs. Our results show that AGN feedback reduces central gas densities in halos, reshaping the boundary between the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM). Zoom-in simulations reveal that AGN feedback significantly modulates the DM contributions from foreground halos along different sightlines. Using the DM-redshift (DM-z) relation up to z=1, we constrain the diffuse baryon mass fraction at z = 1 to f_diff = 0.865 (+0.101, -0.165) (fiducial) and f_diff = 0.856 (+0.101, -0.162) (NoBH), which include contributions from both IGM (f_IGM) and halos (f_Halos), serving as upper limits. We further separate and quantify the redshift evolution of f_CGM, f_IGM, and f_diff using both phase-based and structure-based definitions. From an observational perspective, we also distinguish the line-of-sight averaged quantity &lt; f_{diff,obs} &gt; from the intrinsic redshift-evolving f_diff(z), reflecting the statistical nature of FRB-based measurements. Our study provides a framework for understanding baryon distribution across cosmic structures, FRB host galaxies, and the role of AGN in shaping foreground DM contributions.</description>

      <title>Constraints to Lorentz violation and ultrahigh-energy electrons in D-foamy space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present stationary and axially-symmetric black hole solutions to the Einstein field equations sourced by an anisotropic fluid, describing rotating black holes embedded in astrophysical environments. We compute their physical properties, including quantities associated with the circular geodesics of massless and massive particles, analyze their shadows and image features, and energy conditions. Overall, we find that deviations from the Kerr metric grow with spin.</description>

      <title>Numerical computation of electromagnetically sourced nonlinear tails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Amazingly, recent studies indicate that nonlinear effects are of great significance for modelling black hole ringdown. Transient electromagnetic events in the astrophysical environment are typically high energetic, potentially responsible for some nonlinearities in ringdown. Motivated by the desire to understand these nonlinearities, we solve the inhomogeneous Bardeen-Press-Teukolsky equation numerically, and find second-order gravitational tails induced by an electromagnetic source. Our results suggest that the second-order tails of curvature perturbations with multipole numbers $l\geq4$ decay as $t^{-2l-2}$ at fixed spatial position and $u^{-l-3}$ in retarded-time $u$ at null infinity, slower than their linear counterparts, which can play a role in multi-messenger observations.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</description>

      <title>Observable spins in gravitational waves from compact binary mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17449v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.</description>
