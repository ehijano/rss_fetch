      <title>Bicriteria Polygon Aggregation with Arbitrary Shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11212v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of aggregating polygons by covering them with disjoint representative regions, thereby inducing a clustering of the polygons. Our objective is to minimize a weighted sum of the total area and the total perimeter of the regions. This problem has applications in cartographic map generalization and urban analytics. Here, the polygons represent building footprints and the clusters may represent urban areas. Previous approaches forced the boundaries of the regions to come from a fixed subdivision of the plane, which allows the optimal solution (restricted in this way) to be found from a minimum cut in a dual graph. It is natural to ask whether the problem can still be solved efficiently if this restriction is removed, allowing output regions to be bounded by arbitrary curves. We provide a positive answer in the form of a polynomial-time algorithm. Additionally, we fully characterize the optimal solutions by showing that their boundaries are composed of input polygon edges and circular arcs of constant radius. Since some applications favor straight edges, we also study two problem variants in which the output regions must be polygons, but are not restricted to have boundaries from a fixed subdivision. In the first variant, region vertices must lie on the boundaries of the input polygons. The second variant requires them to be vertices of the input polygons. We show that both variants can be approximated up to a constant factor in polynomial time by altering an optimal solution for the unrestricted problem. Our experimental evaluation on real-world building footprints demonstrates that these approximate solutions are visually similar to the optimal unrestricted ones and achieve near-optimal objective values.</description>

      <title>Compressed data structures for Heegaard splittings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heegaard splittings provide a natural representation of closed 3-manifolds by gluing handlebodies along a common surface. These splittings can be equivalently given by two finite sets of meridians lying in the surface, which define a Heegaard diagram. We present a data structure to effectively represent Heegaard diagrams as normal curves with respect to triangulations of a surface of complexity measured by the space required to express the normal coordinates' vectors in binary. This structure can be significantly more compressed than triangulations of 3-manifolds, given exponential gains for some families. Even with this succinct definition of complexity, we establish polynomial time algorithms for comparing and manipulating diagrams, performing stabilizations, detecting trivial stabilizations and reductions, and computing topological invariants of the underlying manifolds, such as their fundamental and first homology groups. We also contrast early implementations of our techniques with standard software programs for 3-manifolds, achieving better precision and faster algorithms for the average cases and exponential gains in speed for some particular presentations of the inputs.</description>

      <title>On Tight Robust Coresets for $k$-Medians Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers coresets for the robust $k$-medians problem with $m$ outliers, and new constructions in various metric spaces are obtained. Specifically, for metric spaces with a bounded VC or doubling dimension $d$, the coreset size is $O(m) + \tilde{O}(kd\varepsilon^{-2})$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. For Euclidean spaces, the coreset size is $O(m\varepsilon^{-1}) + \tilde{O}(\min\{k^{4/3}\varepsilon^{-2},k\varepsilon^{-3}\})$, improving upon a recent result by Jiang and Lou (ICALP 2025). These results also extend to robust $(k,z)$-clustering, yielding, for VC and doubling dimension, a coreset size of $O(m) + \tilde{O}(kd\varepsilon^{-2z})$ with the optimal linear dependence on $m$. This extended result improves upon the earlier work of Huang et al. (SODA 2025). The techniques introduce novel dataset decompositions, enabling chaining arguments to be applied jointly across multiple components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a class of $C^k$-regular surfaces, $k \geq 1$, \emph{tileable surfaces}, that admit geometric tilings by a finite number of congruence classes of tiles. We show how to construct many examples, and examine the relationship with the well known tilings of the plane and sphere, as well as monohedral polyhedral surfaces.</description>

      <title>Multipacking in Euclidean Metric Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we study the multipacking problems for geometric point sets with respect to their Euclidean distances. We consider a set of $n$ points $P$ and define $N_s[v]$ as the subset of $P$ that includes the $s$ nearest points of $v \in P$ and the point $v$ itself. We assume that the \emph{$s$-th neighbor} of each point is unique, for every $s \in \{0, 1, 2, \dots , n-1\}$. For a natural number $r \leq n-1$, an $r$-multipacking is a set $ M \subseteq P $ such that for each point $ v \in P $ and for every integer $ 1\leq s \leq r $, $|N_s[v]\cap M|\leq (s+1)/2$. The $r$-multipacking number of $ P $ is the maximum cardinality of an $r$-multipacking of $ P $ and is denoted by $ \MP_{r}(P) $. For $r=n-1$, an $r$-multipacking is called a multipacking and $r$-multipacking number is called as multipacking number. For $r=1 \text{ and } 2$, we study the problem of computing a maximum $r$-multipacking of the point sets in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that a maximum $1$-multipacking can be computed in polynomial time but computing a maximum $2$-multipacking is \textsc{NP-hard}. Further, we provide approximation and parameterized solutions to the $2$-multipacking problem.</description>
