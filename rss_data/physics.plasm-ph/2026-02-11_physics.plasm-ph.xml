      <title>Development of a Reduced Multi-Fluid Equilibrium Model and Its Application to Proton-Boron Spherical Tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-Boron fusion requires extreme ion temperatures and robust confinement, making Spherical Tokamaks (ST) with high-power neutral beam injection primary candidates. In these devices, strong toroidal rotation and the large mass disparity between protons and boron ions drive complex multi-fluid effects - specifically centrifugal species separation and electrostatic polarization - that standard single-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models fail to capture. While comprehensive multi-fluid models are often numerically stiff, we develop a reduced model balancing physical fidelity with computational robustness. By retaining dominant toroidal rotation and self-consistent potential while neglecting poloidal inertia and pressure anisotropy, the model couples a generalized Grad-Shafranov equation with species-specific Bernoulli relations and a quasi-neutrality constraint. The model is applied to two representative p-B ST configurations: the experimental EHL-2 and reactor-scale EHL-3B. Simulation results demonstrate that equilibrium modifications are governed by the ion Mach number ($M$). In the low-rotation regime ($M &lt; 0.5$), multi-fluid effects are weak and solutions approach the single-fluid limit. However, at $M &gt; 2$, strong centrifugal forces drive significant boron accumulation at the low-field side (LFS) and generate an internal electrostatic potential on the order of 10 kV. These findings confirm the necessity of multi-fluid modeling for accurate p-$^{11}$B reactor design and establish a theoretical foundation for future investigations into stability, transport, and free-boundary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Space-Charge-Limited Current Density for Time-Variant Pulsed Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-charge-limited (SCL) current density for time-invariant injection (under long-pulse condition) via the diode cathode is the maximum transportable density, while it can be leveraged higher when the injection pulselength becomes shorter than the transmit time for electrons (i.e., under short-pulse condition). However, both limits mentioned above apply for the time-invariant injection condition and the role of time-varying current density for injection remains elusive. In this paper, we numerically investigate the SCL electron flow with time-variant injection. Using particle-in-cell simulation, four different time-variant profiles for electron injection are enforced, and the maximum current densities are determined resulting from the space charge effect for various pulse lengths. We speculate that the time-variant density of injection via the diode cathode will contribute to transport enhancement in the short-pulse condition.</description>

      <title>Scaling laws for the cutoff wavenumber of the short-wavelength ion-temperature-gradient mode in a Z-pinch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a heuristic fluid model to predict the dependence of the cutoff wave number for the short-wavelength ion temperature gradient (SWITG) mode on ion density gradient, ion temperature gradient (ITG) and ion-electron temperature ratio. In particular, we predict that the cutoff wave number increases linearly with increasing ITG for sufficiently large values of the ITG. Direct numerical solutions of the gyrokinetic dispersion relation using a purpose-built solver confirm the predicted scalings at large ITG values and find a weaker power-law scaling for intermediate ITG values. Combining these wave number scalings with a simple diffusive estimate for turbulent fluxes produces a scaling prediction for the ITG heat flux in SWITG-driven turbulence. Applying the critical balance conjecture additionally provides scalings for the aspect ratio of the SWITG turbulent eddies.</description>

      <title>Deflation Techniques for Stellarator Equilibrium and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellarator optimization is a multi-objective, non-convex problem characterized by a complex objective landscape containing many local minima. The solution resulting from a single optimization is highly sensitive to factors such as the initial guess, objective weights, and the optimization method employed. However, merely varying these factors does not guarantee that a physically distinct minimum will be found; optimizations often fail to converge to good minima or simply return to the same or very similar local minima despite large-scale parameter scans. This paper presents a novel application of deflation methods to effectively explore this landscape. By modifying the objective function to penalize and "deflate" away already-found solutions, this technique encourages the optimizer towards attractive, distinct new minima while using a single initial guess and optimization setup. We provide a primer on deflation for nonlinear systems and non-convex optimization before applying it to non-axisymmetric equilibrium and stellarator optimization problems. Key results include the discovery of families of global equilibria with similar core characteristics and the convergence to helical core equilibria without prescient initial guesses. Furthermore, we demonstrate that augmenting stage-one stellarator and stage-two coil optimization with deflation constraints readily produces multiple high-quality, distinct solutions, establishing the method's efficacy and ease of use.</description>

      <title>Design of experiments characterising heat conduction in magnetised, weakly collisional plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat conduction in weakly collisional, magnetised plasma is challenging to model accurately due to multifaceted physics governing heat-carrying electrons, including microinstabilities that scatter electrons and modify heat transport. Capturing these effects requires multidimensional kinetic theory simulations, which are computationally expensive. Experimental constraints overcome this issue, resulting in improved understanding of thermal transport in systems such as the intra-cluster medium of galaxy clusters, and the hot-spot in inertial confinement fusion. In this paper, we present a new experimental platform that produces a weakly collisional high-\b{eta} plasma expected to be susceptible to the whistler heat-flux instability. This platform, to be fielded on the Orion laser, enables characterisation of whistler-regulated thermal conductivity. The platform design is assessed using radiation-magnetohydrodynamics simulations with the code FLASH. Simulations using three thermal conduction models predict conductivity suppression by over an order of magnitude relative to the Spitzer value at whistler saturation, demonstrating the efficacy of the platform.</description>

      <title>Optical Signatures of a Schwarzschild Black Hole in a Dehnen-Type Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the optical effects that occur near a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) with a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter (DM) halo are explored. We first derive the photon sphere radius and obtain an analytical expression for the deflection angle in the weak-field regime by applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). For the strong-field regime, we perform ray-tracing calculations to examine the behavior of light trajectories and determine the corresponding number of orbits. We further compute the BH shadow and gravitational lensing in a plasma medium and provide constraints arising from the DM halo parameters. We also extend our analysis to weak gravitational lensing within plasma environments, considering both uniform and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) distributions. We find the analytical expressions for the deflection angle in the presence of plasma and examine the resulting effects on image magnification. The overall results highlight how DM halo properties and plasma characteristics jointly alter observable lensing signatures.</description>

      <title>Ions-electrons-states for the two-component Vlasov-Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish both local and global bifurcation results for traveling periodic solutions of the one-dimensional two-species Vlasov-Poisson equation. These solutions consist of strip-like regions of ions and electrons in phase space that propagate coherently and emerge from spatially homogeneous, velocity-dependent equilibrium layers. Depending on the geometry of the underlying equilibrium and on the selected Fourier mode, the bifurcation diagram exhibits either two or four solution branches. In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis. Finally, by means of an affine change of variables, we reveal a connection with the one-dimensional two-component Euler-Poisson system, which in turn enables the construction of traveling periodic waves of both small and large amplitude for that model as well.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Mid-/High-Z Impurity Transport by Continuous Li-granule Dropping in a Stellarator Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An enhancement of core impurity transport is observed in high-density plasmas of the stellarator LHD heated by neutral beam injection when continuous lithium (Li) granule dropping is performed. In the experiments reported here, in which the TESPEL is employed to inject trace amounts of titanium (Ti) and molybdenum (Mo) into the plasma core, confinement times for these impurities are seen to reduce significantly when Li dropping is applied, this reduction being more notable for Mo. In order to gain some initial insight into these observations, simulations are performed using the drift-kinetic transport code SFINCS for the Mo case. These simulations indicate that, while neoclassical transport prevails for the main plasma components (electrons, majority ions and low Z impurities), the classical contribution seems to be dominant for transporting Mo impurities. In summary, this work reports the first experimental observation of the degradation of mid-Z and high-Z impurity confinement induced by the continuous dropping of Li granules into a high-density stellarator plasma. In the case of the Mo impurity, simulations suggest that classical transport is the key mechanism underlying the enhanced impurity transport.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving long-time simulations of turbulence in magnetized ideal fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address three two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics models: reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD), Hazeltine's model, and the Charney--Hasegawa--Mima (CHM) equation. These models are derived to capture the basic features of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and plasma behaviour. They all possess non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations in terms of Lie--Poisson brackets, which imply an infinite number of conservation laws along with symplecticity of the phase flow. This geometric structure in phase space affects the statistical long-time behaviour. Therefore, to capture the qualitative features in long-time numerical simulations, it is critical to use a discretization that preserves the rich phase space geometry. Here, we use the matrix hydrodynamics approach to achieve structure-preserving discretizations for each model. We furthermore carry out long-time simulations with randomized initial data and a comparison between the models. The study shows consistent behaviour for the magnetic potential: both RMHD and Hazeltine's model produce magnetic dipoles (in CHM, the magnetic potential is prescribed). These results suggest an inverse cascade of magnetic energy and of the mean-square magnetic potential, which is empirically verified via spectral scaling diagrams. On the other hand, the vorticity field dynamics differs between the models: RMHD forms sharp vortex filaments with rapidly growing vorticity values, whereas Hazeltine's model and CHM show only small variation in the vorticity values. Related to this observation, both Hazeltine's model and CHM give spectral scaling diagrams indicating an inverse cascade of kinetic energy not present in RMHD.</description>

      <title>Influence of Cathode Boundary and Initial Electron Swarm Width on Electron Swarm Parameter Determination with the Pulsed Townsend Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pulsed Townsend experiment enables the extraction of relevant electron transport properties in different gases such as the electron drift velocity $W$ (or equivalently the mobility $\mu$), the longitudinal diffusion coefficient $D_{\mathrm{L}}$, and the effective ionization rate $R_{\mathrm{net}}$ (or equivalently the effective ionization coefficient $\alpha_{\mathrm{eff}}$). Existing analysis techniques lack an accurate representation of the experimental initial and boundary conditions. This work aims to provide an improved evaluation approach by appropriately considering both initial and boundary conditions in order to extract more accurate swarm parameters from measurement data. Simulative and experimental measurement results verify an increased evaluation accuracy. Furthermore, the longitudinal diffusion coefficient $D_{\mathrm{L}}$ can now be accurately extracted from Pulsed Townsend measurements. The developed curve fitting code is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Self ordering to imposed ordering of dust -- a continuous spatial phase transition experiment in MDPX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00312v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous experiments conducted in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX) revealed an intriguing phenomenon first referred to as imposed ordering. This occurs when micron-sized dust particles become aligned with the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above the dust (at a distance much larger than the plasma Debye length or the ion-neutral or electron-neutral mean free paths) in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the mesh. In this work, results of a transition experiment are presented wherein starting from a classical two-dimensional Coulomb crystal with hexagonal symmetry in an unmagnetized plasma $(B = 0\,T)$, dust transitions to a state in which it flows along the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above it, mapping out the 4-fold symmetry of the boundary condition. It is hypothesized that beyond a certain magnetization, elongated electric potential structures emanating from the mesh drive the dust motion to reflect the mesh morphology, transitioning from a 6-fold self ordering to 4-fold imposed ordering. The various dust phases are quantified and a critical value of magnetic field is identified in the transition experiment indicating the onset of imposed ordering.</description>
