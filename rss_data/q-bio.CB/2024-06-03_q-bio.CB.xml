      <title>Modal Analysis of Cellular Dynamics in the Morphospace in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), epithelial cells change their morphology, disperse, and gain mesenchymal-like characteristics. Usually, cells are categorized into discrete cell types or states based on gene expression and other cellular features. Subsequently, EMT is investigated as a dynamical process where cells jump from one discrete state to another. In the current work, we moved away from this idea of discrete state transition and investigated EMT dynamics in a continuous phenotypic space. We used morphology to define the phenotype of a cell. We used the data from quantitative image analysis of MDA-MB-468 cells undergoing EGF-induced EMT. We defined the morphological state space or 'morphospace' using the morphological features extracted through image analysis. During EMT, as the morphology changed, the distribution of cells in the morphospace also changed. However, this morphospace had a very high dimension. We reduced it to a 2-dimensional "reduced morphospace" and investigated the temporal change in the spatial distribution of cells in this reduced space. We used proper orthogonal decomposition to find dominant dynamical features of this spatio-temporal data. The modal analysis detected key features of EMT in this experimental system - reversible transition, distinct paths of phenotypic transition during induction and reversal of EMT, and enhanced diversity of cells during reversal of EMT. We also provide some intuitive physical meaning of the spatial modes and connect them to the key molecular event during EMT.</description>

      <title>Quantifying T cell morphodynamics and migration in 3D collagen matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T cells undergo large shape changes (morphodynamics) when migrating. While progress has been made elucidating the molecular basis of cell migration, statistical characterization of morphodynamics and migration has been limited, particularly in physiologically realistic 3D environments. A previous study (H. Cavanagh et al., J. R. Soc. Interface 19: 20220081) found discrete states of dynamics as well as periodic oscillations of shape. However, we show that these results are due to artifacts of the analysis methods. Here, we present a revised analysis of the data, applying a method based on an underdamped Langevin equation. We find that different shape modes have different correlation times. We also find novel non-Gaussian effects. This study provides a framework in which quantitative comparisons of cell morphodynamics and migration can be made, e.g. between different biological conditions or mechanistic models.</description>
