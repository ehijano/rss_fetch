      <title>Noise-augmented Chaotic Ising Machines for Combinatorial Optimization and Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of domain-specific computing has led to great interest in Ising machines, dedicated hardware accelerators tailored to solve combinatorial optimization and probabilistic sampling problems. A key element of Ising machines is stochasticity, which enables a wide exploration of configurations, thereby helping avoid local minima. Here, we evaluate and improve the previously proposed concept of coupled chaotic bits (c-bits) that operate without any explicit stochasticity. We show that augmenting chaotic bits with stochasticity leads to better algorithmic scaling in combinatorial optimization problems, comparable to the performance of probabilistic bits (p-bits) which have explicit randomness in their update rules. We first demonstrate that c-bits surprisingly follow the quantum Boltzmann law in a 1D transverse field Ising model, despite the lack of explicit randomness. We then show that c-bits exhibit critical dynamics similar to those of stochastic p-bits in 2D Ising and 3D spin glass models, with promising potential to solve challenging optimization problems. Finally, we propose a noise-augmented version of coupled c-bits via the powerful adaptive parallel tempering algorithm (APT). The noise-augmented c-bit algorithm outperforms fully deterministic c-bits running versions of the simulated annealing algorithm. Chaotic Ising machines closely resemble coupled oscillator-based Ising machines, as both schemes exploit nonlinear dynamics for computation. Oscillator-based Ising machines may greatly benefit from our proposed algorithm, which runs replicas at constant temperature, eliminating the need to globally modulate coupling strengths. Mixing stochasticity with deterministic c-bits creates a powerful hybrid computing scheme that can bring benefits in scaled, asynchronous, and massively parallel hardware implementations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order localization landscape theory of Anderson localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Hamiltonian ${\hat H}$ containing a position-dependent (disordered) potential, we introduce a sequence of landscape functions $u_n(\mathbf{r})$ obeying ${\hat H} u_n(\mathbf{r}) = u_{n-1}(\mathbf{r})$ with $u_0(\mathbf{r}) = 1$. For $n \to \infty$, $1/v_n(\mathbf{r}) = u_{n-1}(\mathbf{r})/u_{n}(\mathbf{r})$ converges to the lowest eigenenergy $E_1$ of ${\hat H}$ whereas $u_{\infty}(\mathbf{r})$ yields the corresponding wave function $\psi_1(\mathbf{r})$. For large but finite $n$, $v_n(\mathbf{r})$ can be approximated by a piecewise constant function $v_n(\mathbf{r}) \simeq v_n^{(m)}$ for $\mathbf{r} \in \Omega_m$ and yields progressively improving estimations of eigenenergies $E_m = 1/v_n^{(m)}$ of locally fundamental eigenstates $\psi_m(\mathbf{r}) \propto u_{n}(\mathbf{r})$ in spatial domains $\Omega_m$. These general results are illustrated by a number of examples in one dimension: box potential, sequence of randomly placed infinite potential barriers, smooth and spatially uncorrelated random potentials, quasiperodic potential.</description>

      <title>Uncontrolled learning: co-design of neuromorphic hardware topology for neuromorphic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware-based neuromorphic computing remains an elusive goal with the potential to profoundly impact future technologies and deepen our understanding of emergent intelligence. The learning-from-mistakes algorithm is one of the few training algorithms inspired by the brain's simple learning rules, utilizing inhibition and pruning to demonstrate self-organized learning. Here we implement this algorithm in purely neuromorphic memristive hardware through a co-design process. This implementation requires evaluating hardware trade-offs and constraints. It has been shown that learning-from-mistakes successfully trains small networks to function as binary classifiers and perceptrons. However, without tailoring the hardware to the algorithm, performance decreases exponentially as the network size increases. When implementing neuromorphic algorithms on neuromorphic hardware, we investigate the trade-offs between depth, controllability, and capacity, the latter being the number of learnable patterns. We emphasize the significance of topology and the use of governing equations, demonstrating theoretical tools to aid in the co-design of neuromorphic hardware and algorithms. We provide quantitative techniques to evaluate the computational capacity of a neuromorphic device based on the measurements performed and the underlying circuit structure. This approach shows that breaking the symmetry of a neural network can increase both the controllability and average network capacity. By pruning the circuit, neuromorphic algorithms in all-memristive device circuits leverage stochastic resources to drive local contrast in network weights. Our combined experimental and simulation efforts explore the parameters that make a network suited for displaying emergent intelligence from simple rules.</description>

      <title>Anderson transition for light in three dimensions</title>

Abstract: We study Anderson transition for light in three dimensions by performing large-scale ab-initio simulations of electromagnetic wave transport in disordered ensembles of conducting spheres. A mobility edge that separates diffusive transport and Anderson localization is identified, revealing a sharp transition from diffusion to localization for light. Critical behavior in the vicinity of the mobility edge is well described by a single-parameter scaling law. The critical exponent is found to be consistent with the value known for the Anderson transition of the orthogonal universality class. Statistical distribution of total transmission at the mobility edge is described without any fit parameter by the diagrammatic perturbation theory originally developed for scalar wave diffusion, but notable deviation from the theory is found when Anderson localization sets in.</description>

      <title>Nanoroughness induced anti-reflection and haze effects in opaque systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How to make a material anti-reflective without changing its high refraction index? Achieving anti-reflection in high-refractive-index materials poses challenges due to their high reflectivity (Fresnel equations). Based on theory with new boundary conditions, we propose modifying surface properties on a nanoscale to tackle this. Our study on weakly rough opaque surfaces reveals significant changes in specular and diffuse scattering, predicting anti-reflection where roughness matches light penetration depth for the first time. Experimental validation on nano-roughened Si films (at wavelengths 300-400 nm) supports our findings. We also analyze angular and polarization dependences of nanoroughness-induced haze, showing predominant p-polarization and minimal haze at nanoscale, yet impactful specular reflection reduction.</description>

      <title>Effects of colored disorder on the heat conductivity of SiGe alloys from first principles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting alloys, in particular SiGe, have been employed for several decades as high-temperature thermoelectric materials. Devising strategies to reduce their thermal conductivity may provide a substantial improvement in their thermoelectric performance also at lower temperatures. We have carried out an ab initio investigation of the thermal conductivity of SiGe alloys with random and spatially correlated mass disorder employing the Quasi-Harmonic Green-Kubo (QHGK) theory with force constants computed by density functional theory. Leveraging QHGK and the hydrodynamic extrapolation to achieve size convergence, we obtained a detailed understanding of lattice heat conduction in SiGe and demonstrated that colored disorder suppresses thermal transport across the acoustic vibrational spectrum, leading to up to a 4-fold enhancement in the intrinsic thermoelectric figure of merit.</description>

      <title>Two-level systems and harmonic excitations in a mean-field anharmonic quantum glass</title>

Abstract: Structural glasses display at low temperature a set of anomalies in thermodynamic observables. A prominent example is the linear-in-temperature scaling of the specific heat, at odds with the Debye cubic scaling found in crystals, due to acoustic phonons. Such an excess of specific heat in amorphous solids is thought of arising from phenomenological soft excitations dubbed tunneling two-level systems (TTLS). Their nature as well as their statistical properties remain elusive from a first-principle viewpoint. In this work we investigate the canonically quantized version of the KHGPS model, a mean-field glass model of coupled anharmonic oscillators, across its phase diagram, with an emphasis on the specific heat. The thermodynamics is solved in a semiclassical expansion. We show that in the replica-symmetric region of the model, up to the marginal glass transition line where replica symmetry gets continuously broken, a disordered version of the Debye approximation holds: the specific heat is dominated by harmonic vibrational excitations inducing a power-law scaling at the transition, ruled by random matrix theory. This mechanism generalizes a previous semiclassical argument in the literature. We then study the marginal glass phase where the semiclassical expansion becomes non-perturbative due to the emergence of instantons that overcome disordered Debye behavior. Inside the glass phase, a variational solution to the instanton approach provides the prevailing excitations as TTLS, which generate a linear specific heat. This phase thus hosts a mix of TTLS and harmonic excitations generated by interactions. We finally suggest to go beyond the variational approximation through an analogy with the spin-boson model.</description>

      <title>Engineering many-body quantum Hamiltonians with non-ergodic properties using quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.08587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a computational framework to identify Hamiltonians of interacting quantum many-body systems that host non-ergodic excited states. We combine quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the recently proposed eigenstate-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps the ground state of a specified parent Hamiltonian to a single non-ergodic excited state of a new derived Hamiltonian. This engineered Hamiltonian contains non-trivial, systematically-obtained, and emergent features that are responsible for its non-ergodic properties. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to quantum many-body scar states where we discover a previously unreported family of Hamiltonians with spatially oscillating spin exchange couplings that host scar-like properties, including revivals in the quantum dynamics, and towers in the inverse participation ratio; and to many-body localization, where we find a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with correlated disorder that exhibits non-ergodic scaling of the participation entropy and inverse participation ratios of order unity. The method can be applied to other known ground states to discover new quantum many-body systems with non-ergodic excited states.</description>

      <title>Envisioning Future Deep Learning Theories: Some Basic Concepts and Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.09741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To advance deep learning methodologies in the next decade, a theoretical framework for reasoning about modern neural networks is needed. While efforts are increasing toward demystifying why deep learning is so effective, a comprehensive picture remains lacking, suggesting that a better theory is possible. We argue that a future deep learning theory should inherit three characteristics: a \textit{hierarchically} structured network architecture, parameters \textit{iteratively} optimized using stochastic gradient-based methods, and information from the data that evolves \textit{compressively}. As an instantiation, we integrate these characteristics into a graphical model called \textit{neurashed}. This model effectively explains some common empirical patterns in deep learning. In particular, neurashed enables insights into implicit regularization, information bottleneck, and local elasticity. Finally, we discuss how neurashed can guide the development of deep learning theories.</description>

      <title>Mean-field theory of first-order quantum superconductor-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental studies on strongly disordered indium oxide films have revealed an unusual first-order quantum phase transition between the superconducting and insulating states (SIT). This transition is characterized by a discontinuous jump from non-zero to zero values of superfluid stiffness at the critical point, contradicting the conventional "scaling scenario" typically associated with SIT. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for understanding this first-order transition. Our approach is based on the concept of competition between two fundamentally distinct ground states that arise from electron pairs initially localized by strong disorder: the superconducting state and the Coulomb glass insulator. These ground states are distinguished by two crucially different order parameters, suggesting a natural expectation of a discontinuous transition between them at $T=0$. This transition occurs when the magnitudes of the superconducting gap $\Delta$ and the Coulomb gap $E_C$ become comparable. Additionally, we extend our analysis to low non-zero temperatures and provide a mean-field "phase diagram" in the plane of $(T/\Delta,E_C/\Delta)$. Our results reveal the existence of a natural upper bound for the kinetic inductance of strongly disordered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box: predicting the trainability of deep neural networks with reconstruction entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks, based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. For both the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, we show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network, thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. Moreover, our approach illustrates the network's decision making process by displaying the changes performed on the input data at each layer. Our results provide a concrete link between the flow of information and the trainability of deep neural networks, further explaining the role of criticality in these systems.</description>
