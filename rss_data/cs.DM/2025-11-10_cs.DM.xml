      <title>The Rainbow Arborescence Problem on Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rainbow arborescence conjecture posits that if the arcs of a directed graph with $n$ vertices are colored by $n-1$ colors such that each color class forms a spanning arborescence, then there is a spanning arborescence that contains exactly one arc of every color. We prove that the conjecture is true if the underlying undirected graph is a cycle.</description>

      <title>Zoo of Centralities: Encyclopedia of Node Metrics in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social, transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a vast array of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for discovering, comparing and implementing centrality measures.</description>

      <title>Awesome graph parameters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, we denote by $\alpha(G)$ the size of a maximum independent set and by $\omega(G)$ the size of a maximum clique in $G$. Our paper lies on the edge of two lines of research, related to $\alpha$ and $\omega$, respectively. One of them studies $\alpha$-variants of graph parameters, such as $\alpha$-treewidth or $\alpha$-degeneracy. The second line deals with graph classes where some parameters are bounded by a function of $\omega(G)$. A famous example of this type is the family of $\chi$-bounded classes, where the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is bounded by a function of $\omega(G)$.
  A Ramsey-type argument implies that if the $\alpha$-variant of a graph parameter $\rho$ is bounded by a constant in a class $\mathcal{G}$, then $\rho$ is bounded by a function of $\omega$ in $\mathcal{G}$. If the reverse implication also holds, we say that $\rho$ is awesome. Otherwise, we say that $\rho$ is awful. In the present paper, we identify a number of awesome and awful graph parameters, derive some algorithmic applications of awesomeness, and propose a number of open problems related to these notions.</description>

      <title>Language Generation and Identification From Partial Enumeration: Tight Density Bounds and Topological Characterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) has motivated formal theories of language generation and learning. We study the framework of \emph{language generation in the limit}, where an adversary enumerates strings from an unknown language $K$ drawn from a countable class, and an algorithm must generate unseen strings from $K$. Prior work showed that generation is always possible, and that some algorithms achieve positive lower density, revealing a \emph{validity--breadth} trade-off between correctness and coverage. We resolve a main open question in this line, proving a tight bound of $1/2$ on the best achievable lower density. We then strengthen the model to allow \emph{partial enumeration}, where the adversary reveals only an infinite subset $C \subseteq K$. We show that generation in the limit remains achievable, and if $C$ has lower density $\alpha$ in $K$, the algorithm's output achieves density at least $\alpha/2$, matching the upper bound. This generalizes the $1/2$ bound to the partial-information setting, where the generator must recover within a factor $1/2$ of the revealed subset's density. We further revisit the classical Gold--Angluin model of \emph{language identification} under partial enumeration. We characterize when identification in the limit is possible -- when hypotheses $M_t$ eventually satisfy $C \subseteq M \subseteq K$ -- and in the process give a new topological formulation of Angluin's characterization, showing that her condition is precisely equivalent to an appropriate topological space having the $T_D$ separation property.</description>

      <title>Measuring Ransomware Lateral Movement Susceptibility via Privilege-Weighted Adjacency Matrix Exponentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ransomware impact hinges on how easily an intruder can move laterally and spread to the maximum number of assets. We present a graph-theoretic formulation that casts lateral movement as a path-closure problem over a probability semiring to measure lateral-movement susceptibility and estimate blast radius. We build a directed multigraph where vertices represent assets and edges represent reachable services (e.g., RDP/SSH) between them. We model lateral movement as a probabilistic process using a pivot potential factor $\pi(s)$ for each service, with step successes composed via a probabilistic path operator \( \otimes \) and alternative paths aggregated via a probabilistic union \( \oplus \) (noisy-OR). This yields a monotone fixed-point (iterative) computation of a $K$-hop compromise probability matrix that captures how compromise propagates through the network. Metrics derived from this model include: (1) Lateral-Movement Susceptibility (LMS$_K$): the average probability of a successful lateral movement between any two assets (0-1 scale); and (2) Blast-Radius Estimate (BRE$_K$): the expected percentage of assets compromised in an average attack scenario. Interactive services (SSH 22, RDP 3389) receive higher $\pi(s)$ than app-only ports (MySQL 3306, MSSQL 1433), which seldom enable pivoting without an RCE. Across anonymized enterprise snapshots, pruning high-$\pi(s)$ edges yields the largest LMS$_K$/BRE$_K$ drop, aligning with CISA guidance, MITRE ATT\&amp;CK (TA0008: Lateral Movement), and NIST SP~800-207. The framework evaluates (micro)segmentation and helps prioritize controls that reduce lateral-movement susceptibility and shrink blast radius.</description>

      <title>$\theta$-free matching covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nontrivial connected graph is matching covered if each edge belongs to some perfect matching. For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs; thus, there is extensive literature on them. A cornerstone of this theory is an ear decomposition result due to Lov\'asz and Plummer. Their theorem is a fundamental problem-solving tool, and also yields interesting open problems; we discuss two such problems below, and we solve one of them.
  A subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(H)$ has a perfect matching. This notion is intrinsically related to the aforementioned ear decomposition theorem -- which implies that each matching covered graph (apart from $K_2$ and even cycles) contains a conformal bisubdivision of $\theta$, or a conformal bisubdivision of $K_4$, possibly both. (Here, $\theta$ refers to the graph with two vertices joined by three edges.) This immediately leads to two problems: characterize $\theta$-free (likewise, $K_4$-free) matching covered graphs. A characterization of planar $K_4$-free matching covered graphs was obtained by Kothari and Murty [J. Graph Theory, 82 (1), 2016]; the nonplanar case is open.
  We provide a characterization of $\theta$-free matching covered graphs that immediately implies a poly-time algorithm for the corresponding decision problem. Our characterization relies heavily on a seminal result due to Edmonds, Lov\'asz and Pulleyblank [Combinatorica, 2, 1982] pertaining to the tight cut decomposition theory of matching covered graphs. As corollaries, we provide two upper bounds on the size of a $\theta$-free graph, namely, $m\leq 2n-1$ and $m\leq \frac{3n}{2}+b-1$, where $b$ denotes the number of bricks obtained in any tight cut decomposition of the graph; for each bound, we provide a characterization of the tight examples. The Petersen graph and $K_4$ play key roles in our results.</description>

      <title>Better Neural Network Expressivity: Subdividing the Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the expressivity of ReLU neural networks with a focus on their depth. A sequence of previous works showed that $\lceil \log_2(n+1) \rceil$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all continuous piecewise linear (CPWL) functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella (NeurIPS'21 / SIDMA'23) conjectured that this result is optimal in the sense that there are CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, like the maximum function, that require this depth. We disprove the conjecture and show that $\lceil\log_3(n-1)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute all CPWL functions on $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  A key step in the proof is that ReLU neural networks with two hidden layers can exactly represent the maximum function of five inputs. More generally, we show that $\lceil\log_3(n-2)\rceil+1$ hidden layers are sufficient to compute the maximum of $n\geq 4$ numbers. Our constructions almost match the $\lceil\log_3(n)\rceil$ lower bound of Averkov, Hojny, and Merkert (ICLR'25) in the special case of ReLU networks with weights that are decimal fractions. The constructions have a geometric interpretation via polyhedral subdivisions of the simplex into ``easier'' polytopes.</description>

      <title>Linear codes arising from the point-hyperplane geometry-Part I: the Segre embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ elements and $\Lambda$ be the image of the Segre geometry $\mathrm{PG}(V)\otimes\mathrm{PG}(V^*)$ in $\mathrm{PG}(V\otimes V^*)$. Consider the subvariety $\Lambda_{1}$ of $\Lambda$ represented by the pure tensors $x\otimes \xi$ with $x\in V$ and $\xi\in V^*$ such that $\xi(x)=0$. Regarding $\Lambda_1$ as a projective system of $\mathrm{PG}(V\otimes V^*)$, we study the linear code $\mathcal{C}(\Lambda_1)$ arising from it. The code $\mathcal{C}(\Lambda_1)$ is minimal code and we determine its basic parameters, itsfull weight list and its linear automorphism group. We also give a geometrical characterization of its minimum and second lowest weight codewords as well as of some of the words of maximum weight.</description>

      <title>Boolean function monotonicity testing requires (almost) $n^{1/2}$ queries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that for any constant $c&gt;0$, any (two-sided error) adaptive algorithm for testing monotonicity of Boolean functions must have query complexity $\Omega(n^{1/2-c})$. This improves the $\tilde\Omega(n^{1/3})$ lower bound of [CWX17] and almost matches the $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$ upper bound of [KMS18].</description>
