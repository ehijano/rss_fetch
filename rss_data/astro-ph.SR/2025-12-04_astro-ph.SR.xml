      <title>Enhanced magnetostrophic waves with magnetic field orthogonal to the rotation axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03120v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an isolated Gaussian velocity vortex perturbation in an otherwise quiescent, electrically conducting, and rotating fluid permeated by a uniform magnetic field $\bf{B}$. Studies suggest a presence of strong azimuthal wave motions on the timescale of centuries within the Earth's liquid outer core at higher latitudes. To understand these long-period oscillations, we focus on magnetostrophic waves, a slow component of magnetic-Coriolis waves with $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned with the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, which replicate the field lines in the azimuthal direction. We present an analytical solution to the magnetic-Coriolis wave equation in Cartesian coordinates. Later, with numerical solution, we validate our analytical estimates and show that magnetostrophic waves travel relatively faster along the magnetic field when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$ compared with the case when both are aligned. The study confirms that with a magnetic field $\bf{B}$ orthogonally aligned to the rotation vector $\bf{\Omega}$, wave vectors satisfying the condition $\bf{\Omega}\cdot\bf{k} \approx 0$, travel with Alfv\'en velocities along the magnetic field lines as a component of inertial-Alfv\'en waves. The timescales on which Alfv\'en waves travel are relatively short, and it is also less likely that inertial-Alfv\'en waves will be sustained inside the core at higher latitudes \citep{Davidson2017}. This study shows that, excluding the inertial-Alfv\'en waves contribution ($k_z\neq 0$), there exists intensified magnetostrophic wave propagation when $\bf{B} \perp \bf{\Omega}$, which can explain the strong periodic oscillations on the time scales of centuries along the azimuthal field at higher latitudes. Results show persistence of the magnetostrophic waves despite the lower Lehnert number $Le$, suggesting the plausible existence of a low-intensity azimuthal magnetic field in the Earth's core.</description>

      <title>High-angular-resolution ALMA imaging of the inhomogeneous dynamical atmosphere of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-angular-resolution imaging of the asymptotic giant branch star W Hya with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to probe the dynamics and chemistry in the atmosphere and inner wind. W Hya was observed with the longest baselines of ALMA at 250-268 GHz with an angular resolution of ~17x20 mas. ALMA's high angular resolution allowed us to resolve the stellar disk of W Hya, along with clumpy, irregularly shaped emission extending to ~100 mas: plume in the north-northwest, a tail in the south-southwest, and the extended atmosphere elongated in the east-northeast--west-southwest direction, with semimajor and semiminor axes of ~70 and 40 mas (~3.4 and 1.9 Rstar), respectively. We identified 57 lines, which include SiO, H2O, SO2, SO, HCN, AlO, AlOH, TiO, TiO2, OH, and some of their isotopologues. The molecular line images show spatially inhomogeneous molecular formation. Our ALMA data taken at phase 0.53 (minimum light) indicate global, accelerating infall within ~75 mas (3.6 Rstar) but also outflow at up to ~10 km/s in deeper layers. While 38 of the detected lines appear in absorption against the continuum stellar disk as expected, we detect nonthermal emission on top of the continuum over the stellar disk in 19 lines of SiO, H2O, SO2, and AlO. The emission of SiO, AlO, TiO, TiO2, SO, and SO2 coincides well with the clumpy dust cloud distribution obtained from contemporaneous visible polarimetric imaging in addition to H2O reported in our previous work. This lends support to the idea that SiO, H2O, and AlO are directly involved in grain nucleation. The overlap of SO/SO2 (possibly also TiO/TiO2) with the dust clouds suggests the formation of these molecules and dust behind shocks induced by pulsation and/or convection. We detect HCN emission close to the star, down to ~30 mas (~1.4 Rstar), which is consistent with shock-induced chemistry.</description>

      <title>Fine-Scale Features of the Sun's Atmosphere: Spicules and Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an overview of fine-scale features in the Sun's atmosphere, with a focus on spicules and jets. We consider older and newer observations and theories for chromospheric spicules and coronal jets. We also consider the connection between these features and some other solar atmospheric phenomena. We then discuss the possibility that there is a continuum of jet-like features ranging from spicules to large-scale CME-producing eruptions, all driven by similar magnetic processes operating on differing corresponding size scales. Future observational and theoretical studies will help clarify further the nature of these solar events, and elucidate possible connections between them.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Ne-22 core and shell distilled WD detonations in AREPO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations of detonations in $1.0 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ white dwarfs that have undergone $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$ distillation during crystallisation. These simulations, conducted with the moving-mesh code AREPO, aim to investigate the effects of chemical separation on the ejecta and spectra of such WDs undergoing thermonuclear explosions. The distillation process alters the internal chemical stratification of the star, concentrating neutron-rich material either in a central core or in an interior shell. We model both configurations as well as a homogeneous equivalent for each case with the same $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$ content distributed evenly at all radii. Despite similar $^{56} \mathrm{Ni}$ yields between the core and shell models ($0.40$ and $0.45 \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ respectively), the two models yield markedly different iron-group abundances. Both distilled models showed significantly enhanced production of $^{15} \mathrm{N}$ via the decay of $^{15} \mathrm{O}$. The $^{22} \mathrm{Ne}$-core model produces enhanced amounts of stable neutron-rich iron-group isotopes such as $^{58} \mathrm{Ni}$ and $^{54} \mathrm{Fe}$. We highlight observational signatures associated with these differences, including potentially enhanced [$\mathrm{Ni}_{\rm II}$] lines in nebular spectra. Synthetic TARDIS spectra at early times show only moderate differences. Our results suggest that white dwarf distillation, a process linked to delayed cooling in the Gaia Q branch population, may leave detectable nucleosynthetic fingerprints in a subset of Type Ia supernovae. These findings open additional pathways to probe progenitor evolution and the role of crystallisation in shaping the diversity of thermonuclear transients.</description>

      <title>Surprisingly Large Doppler Shifts in Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) Solar Spectra, Resulting from an Inconspicuous Small-scale Jet in EUV Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong EUV lineshifts in solar spectra are generally indicative of highly dynamic and explosive events that are easily detected in comparable-wavelength EUV images, with the strongest such line shifts (several 100 km/s) occurring in solar flares. Here we present observations of exceptionally strong lineshifts detected in Hinode/EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) spectra outside the time of a flare-like brightening, with 195 Ang blueshifts of ~200 km/s. Although the likely culprit is too weak to register in GOES Soft X-ray fluxes, EIS pinpoints the source at the edge of an active region. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)/Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) images and Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetograms show a nondescript small-scale eruptive event at this location. We find this event likely to be an inconspicuous coronal jet, apparently triggered by converging/canceling magnetic flux patches, with plane-of-sky velocity ~159+-29 km/s. AIA and HMI observations of this faint transient feature, together with observations of a slightly brighter jetting event near the same location an hour earlier, suggest that the strong EIS Doppler shifts are indeed due to a coronal jet that is hard to detect in AIA images. These observations, together with other recent studies, show that EUV Doppler maps are a much more sensitive tool for detecting small-scale eruptions than are EUV images, and those eruptions are frequently triggered by magnetic flux cancelation episodes. Such-detected small-scale eruptions, that often produce small-scale coronal-jet-like features, might propagate into and help drive the solar wind.</description>

      <title>The BAGLE Python Package for Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the open-source Python package, BAGLE (Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events), which enables modeling and joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. We describe the model parameterizations and present the equations for microlensing events containing either a point-source, point-lens or a finite-source, point-lens geometry both with and without microlensing parallax due to the motion of the Earth or a satellite around the Sun. Conversions between different coordinate reference frames are also derived. We compare our model light curves to those from other papers and microlens modeling software, finding good agreement, although with some differences in finite-source models at a ~1% level detectable with upcoming observations from space-based facilities. We also use BAGLE to demonstrate the impact of changing lens mass, lens distance, and blended source flux fraction on photometric lightcurves and astrometric trajectories in preparation for upcoming Gaia data releases and the launch of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and its Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS). In particular, we show that Roman GBTDS will detect significant microlensing parallax signals for events that are 2x shorter in duration than from ground-based surveys. Additionally, long-duration events with durations of $\t_{E,\odot} &gt;$ 100 days will yield microlensing parallax uncertainties of ${\sigma}_{\pi_E} &lt;$ 0.01 with Roman, enabling confident identification of isolated stellar-mass black holes that can be modeled both astrometrically and photometrically with BAGLE for precise mass determinations. BAGLE is an open-source code and community development is encouraged.</description>

      <title>Modeling Binary Lenses and Sources with the BAGLE Python Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool that can be used to find and measure the mass of isolated and dark compact objects. In many microlensing events, the lens, the source, or both may be a binary system. Therefore, in this study we present lensing equations for binary source and lens models in the Bayesian Analysis of Gravitational Lensing Events (BAGLE) Python microlensing package. The new binary source and lens models in BAGLE account for the complete Keplerian orbit. BAGLE also includes binary models that approximate the orbital motion as linear or accelerating motion of the secondary companion; these are useful when the orbit has a very low eccentricity or the orbital period is much longer than the microlensing timescale. The model parameterizations based on these binary lensing equations will enable joint fitting of photometric and astrometric data sets. Consequently, binary microlensing events with complex astrometric trajectories can be used to break several microlensing degeneracies that plague photometry-only microlensing modeling. These binary models will be used to fit microlensing event data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope, and other surveys.</description>

      <title>Improving Accretion Diagnostics for Young Stellar Objects with Mid-infrared Hydrogen lines from JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of mid-infrared neutral hydrogen (H~\textsc{i}) emission lines in 79 nearby (d $&lt;$ 200 $pc$) young stars using JWST/MIRI. We aim to identify mid-infrared H~\textsc{i} transitions that can serve as reliable accretion diagnostics in young stars, and evaluate their utility in deriving physical conditions of the accreting gas. We identify and measure 22 H~\textsc{i} transitions in the MIRI wavelength regime (5-28 $\mu m$) and perform LTE slab modelling to remove the H\textsubscript{2}O contribution from selected H~\textsc{i} transitions. We find that mid-IR H~\textsc{i} line emission is spatially compact, even for sources with spatially extended [Ne~\textsc{ii}] and [Fe~\textsc{ii}] jets, suggesting minimal contamination from extended jet. Although Pfund~$\alpha$ (H~\textsc{i}~6--5) and Humphreys~$\alpha$ (H~\textsc{i}~7--6) are the strongest lines, they are blended with H$_2$O transitions. This blending necessitates additional processing to remove molecular contamination, thereby limiting their use as accretion diagnostics. Instead, we identify the H~\textsc{i}~(8--6) at 7.502 $\mu m$ and H~\textsc{i}~(10--7) at 8.760 $\mu m$ transitions as better alternatives, as they are largely unaffected by molecular contamination and offer a more reliable means of measuring accretion rates from MIRI spectra. We provide updated empirical relations for converting mid-IR H~\textsc{i} line luminosities into accretion luminosity for 6 different H~\textsc{i} lines in the MIRI wavelength range. Moreover, comparison of observed line ratios with theoretical models shows that MIR H~\textsc{i} lines offer robust constraints on the hydrogen gas density in accretion columns, $n_\mathrm{H} = $10$^{10.6}$ to 10$^{11.2}$ cm$^{-3}$ in most stars, with some stars exhibiting lower densities ($&lt;10^{10}$~cm$^{-3}$), approaching the optically thin regime.</description>

      <title>Quasi-linear theory of perpendicular ion heating by critically balanced turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In collisionless astrophysical plasmas, turbulence mediates the partitioning of free energy among cascade channels and its dissipation into ion and electron heat. The resulting ion heating is often anisotropic, with ions observed to be preferentially heated perpendicular to the local magnetic field; understanding the mechanisms responsible for this heating is a key step in understanding the evolution of such plasmas. In this paper, we use the framework of quasi-linear theory to compute analytically the heating rates of ions interacting with turbulent, large-scale Alfv\'enic fluctuations. We show how the imbalance of the turbulence (the difference in energies between Alfv\'enic fluctuations travelling parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field) modifies the spatiotemporal spectrum of these fluctuations, allowing the heating mechanism to transition between two commonly-studied mechanisms: stochastic heating in balanced turbulence to resonant-cyclotron heating in imbalanced turbulence. The resultant heating rate is found to have a general form regardless of the level of imbalance, exhibiting a suppression related to the conservation of the ions' magnetic moment at small turbulent amplitudes and recovering previous empirical results in a formal calculation. The results of this work help to consolidate our qualitative understanding of ion heating within astrophysical plasmas, as well as yielding specific quantitative predictions to analyse simulations and observations.</description>

      <title>A 7 Day Multiwavelength Flare Campaign on AU Mic. IV: Quiescent Gyrosynchrotron and Gyroresonance Radiation from 12 to 25 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the radio quiescent data from a multiwavelength campaign of the active M-dwarf flare star AU Mic (dM1e) that occurred in October 2018. Using Ku-band data (12 to 18 GHz) from the Very Large Array and K-band data (17 to 25 GHz) from the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we find that the quiescent spectrum can be decomposed into two components: one falling with frequency and one that remains flat. The flat component has a relatively steady flux density of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.14 mJy. The falling component varies in strength, but exhibits a spectral index of $\alpha$ = $-0.88 \pm 0.10$. The falling component is thus consistent with nonthermal, optically thin gyrosynchrotron radiation with a corresponding power-law index similar to flares from AU Mic. While a flat component may arise from thermal, optically thin free-free emission, the observed flux density and inferred mass-loss rate are both too large compared to previous stellar wind and X-ray emission theory and models, necessitating an alternative explanation. This flat component instead matches well with an optically thick gyroresonance component integrated over multiple source regions such that the composite spectra are reasonably flat. The persistence of these components across the rotational period suggests multiple source regions, which may help explain changes in flux density and persistent high-energy electrons.</description>

      <title>Genetic Algorithm for Inferring Model Parameters for Flux Transport Dynamo Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun exhibits an 11-year cyclic variation, maintained by dynamo action in the solar interior. Mean-field flux transport dynamo models have successfully reproduced most of the features observed in solar cycles, while the model includes many free parameters, such as the speed of the meridional flow and the amplitude of the poloidal field generation. Inferring these free parameters is on demand because they correspond to the solar interior condition. We suggest a novel method for inferring the free parameters using a genetic algorithm. At each generation, we evaluate the fitness of our simulation against the observational data and optimize the parameters. We apply our method to the observed solar cycle data from 1723 to 2024 and successfully reproduce the observations from both qualitative and quantitative perspectives. We expect our method to be applicable to sunspot numbers, even those obtained from isotope data and historical documents, in the future, to better understand past solar interior dynamics.</description>

      <title>The first out-of-ecliptic observations of the polar magnetic field of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct remote-sensing observations of the solar poles have been hindered by the restricted view obtained from the ecliptic plane. For the first time ever, Solar Orbiter with its remote-sensing instruments observed the poles of the Sun from out of the ecliptic in the Spring of 2025. Here we report the first measurements of the magnetic field of the solar poles taken when Solar Orbiter was at heliographic latitudes ranging between 14.9$^\circ$ and 16.7$^\circ$. The data-sets were collected by the High Resolution Telescope of the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (SO/PHI-HRT) on board Solar Orbiter. Two sets of observations, approximately one month apart, for the south and north pole are considered in this work. The magnetic flux and flux density measured during these campaigns are reported as a function of the heliographic latitude observed by SO/PHI-HRT. The net fluxes show a different latitudinal distribution for the two polar caps. We also discuss the observed dependence of the measured fluxes on the viewing angle. These first results highlight the importance of high-resolution direct measurements of the polar field, paving the way to the high-latitude observations planned for SO/PHI-HRT in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Magnetic activity on the young Sun: a case study of EK Draconis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Young, solar analogue stars provide key insights into the early stages of stellar evolution, particularly in terms of magnetic activity and rotation. Their rapid rotation, high flaring rate, and enhanced surface activity make them ideal laboratories for testing stellar models or even the solar dynamo. Aims. Using long-term photometric data, we investigated the cyclic behaviour of EK Dra over the last century. We analyze its short- term activity based on 13 Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) sectors. Applying Doppler imaging on high-resolution spectral data we investigate short and long-term spot evolution and surface differential rotation. Methods. We use Short-term Fourier-transform on a 120 years long archival photometric data in order to search for activity cycles. The short-term space photometry data is fitted with an analytic three-spot model, and we hand-select flares from it to analyze their phase and frequency distribution. Spectral synthesis is used to determine the astrophysical parameters of EK Dra. Using the iMap multi-line Doppler imaging code, we reconstruct 13 Doppler images. Differential rotation is derived by cross-correlating consecutive Doppler maps. Results. Long-term photometric data reveal a 10.7-12.1 year cycle that was persistently present for 120 years. In the more recent half of the light curve a 7.3-8.2 years-long signal is also visible. The distribution of the 142 flares in the TESS data shows no correlation with the rotational phase or with the spotted longitudes. The reconstructed Doppler images show a surface that varies from rotation to rotation, putting the lower limit of the spot lifetime between 10-15 days. Based on the cross-correlation of the Doppler maps, EK Dra has a solar-type differential rotation with a surface shear parameter of $\alpha_{DR} = 0.030 \pm 0.008$.</description>

      <title>X TrA through the eyes of MATISSE: More evidence of clumpy molecular layers around C-type asymptotic giant branch stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. The goal of this study is to further the understanding of the wind formation mechanism in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars through the analysis of the close environment (within a few stellar radii) of the carbon star X TrA.
  Methods. X TrA was observed for the first time with the Mid-Infrared SpectroScopic Experiment instrument (MATISSE) in the L and N bands in low spectral resolution mode (R=30), and its close surroundings were mapped in specific wavelength ranges corresponding to specific molecules ($C_2H_2$ and HCN, at 3.1 and 3.8 $\mu$m) and dust (amorphous carbon and, for example, Sic at 11.3 $\mu$m), via image reconstruction techniques.
  Results. The angular diameter of the star ranges from 10 mas in the L band pseudo-continuum (3.5 $\mu$m) to 20 mas at 3.1 and 11.3 $\mu$m. The reconstructed images show some mild elongated features (along the east-west direction) and asymmetric protrusions, which are most evident around 3.1 $\mu$m. Imaging results highlight the clumpy nature of the circumstellar environment, starting from the photospheric region up to more distant layers.
  Conclusions. The angular diameters found for X TrA in the image data are in agreement with previous photospheric diameter estimates (following VLTI/MIDI 8-13 $\mu$m observations), and their wavelength dependence is similar to values found for other carbon stars observed with MATISSE (R Scl and V Hya). The 3.1 $\mu$m images presented here show highly asymmetric features, another case of a C-rich star with irregular morphologies close to the stellar disk; this supports the notion that the $C_2H_2+HCN$ abundance distribution usually originates from a clumpy layer around carbon stars.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Rayleigh Scattering and Interstellar Polarization for Evolved Late-Type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolved late-type stars are frequently identified as photometric and spectroscopic variables, such as Mira-type or semi-regular variable objects. These stars can also be polarimetrically variable, an indicator of non-spherical geometry for spatially unresolved sources. Departures from symmetry can arise in a number of ways, such as the presence of a binary companion (e.g., multiple illumination sources for scattered light), brightness variations in the stellar atmosphere (e.g., large convective cells), or aspherical circumstellar envelopes (e.g., disks or aspherical stellar winds). Common polarigenic opacities for cool stars include Rayleigh scattering and dust scattering. The classic wavelength dependence of lambda^-4 for Rayleigh single scattering is generally straightforward; however, that signature can be confounded by interstellar polarization (ISP). We explore strategies for interpreting polarimetric observations when the interstellar polarization (ISP) cannot be removed. We introduce a "hybrid" spectrum that includes both Rayleigh polarization for a stellar contribution and the Serkowski Law for an interstellar contribution. We find the polarization spectral slope can be more shallow than expected from Rayleigh scattering alone. For stellar variability, shorter wavelengths give higher amplitude changes when Rayleigh scattering dominates the interstellar signal. Quite anomalous slopes can occur over limited wavelength intervals if the stellar and interstellar position angles differ by 90 deg. Results of the models are discussed in the context of photopolarimetry methods, and an application is considered in terms of variable polarization from the carbon star, R Scl.</description>

      <title>TT Arietis: New approach to the analysis of quasi-periodic oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. TT Arietis (TT Ari) is a nova-like cataclysmic variable of the VY Scl subtype with light-curve variations on multiple timescales. In addition to the superhump modulation, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been found. Aims. Our aim is to determine the occurrence, strength, and variability of QPOs in TT Ari based on more complete data than in previous works. Methods. The data were obtained during the high state of TT Ari in October 2012 by the MOST space telescope, covering a total of 361.2 hours of continuous observation. We searched for frequencies over subsets of time using a Fourier-like power spectrum and then added the frequencies together, forming groups. Results. Our method has revealed QPOs that occur in "frequency groups", which are events with a continuous oscillation of similar, constant or slowly variable frequency. We report a total of 160 frequency groups in the period range between 14 and 53 minutes (27 and 98 days-1), with two peaks in the power spectrum at 18.5 and 33.8 minutes (42.5 and 77.5 days-1). The duration of these frequency groups varies between 0.72 and 7.5 hours (average 2.8 hours) revealing between 3 and 18 complete cycles in the light curve. Most of them show significant frequency variations over the course of their duration. Sometimes two frequency groups occur simultaneously. An analysis with randomised data confirms that stochastic processes can only explain a fraction of the QPOs found. The occurrence of QPOs appears not to be related to the superhump phase.</description>

      <title>The Extent of Solar Energetic Particle Irradiation in the Sun's Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares emit X rays and high-energy (MeV-GeV) ions (Solar Energetic Particles, or SEPs). Astronomical observations show solar mass-protostellar fluxes are a factor $\Phi \approx 3 \times 10^2 - 3 \times 10^3$ times higher than the present-day Sun. Constraining $\Phi$ in the early solar system is important for modeling ionization in the Sun's protoplanetary disk, the extent of magnetorotational instability or magnetocentrifugal outflows, or even production of short-lived radionuclides. Recent interpretations of meteoritic data -- cosmogenic Ne in hibonite grains, initial $({}^{10}{\rm Be}/{}^{9}{\rm Be})_0$ ratios in Ca-rich, Al-rich inclusions (CAIs), or even inferences of live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs -- have suggested values $\Phi &gt; 10^5$, even as large as $\Phi \approx 6 \times 10^6$, which would make the young Sun extraordinarily active, even for a protostar. We constrain $\Phi$ by re-examining these data. We conclude: cosmogenic Ne was produced in hibonite grains as they resided in the disk; ${}^{36}{\rm Cl}$ was created in Cl-poor grains after the disk dissipated; ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ was inherited from the molecular cloud, with almost no ($&lt; 1\%$) ${}^{10}{\rm Be}$ created in the disk; and there is no evidence whatsoever for any live ${}^{7}{\rm Be}$ in CAIs. We show these data are consistent with a value $\Phi \approx 3 \times 10^3$ for the first $&gt; 5$ Myr of the solar nebula. The early Sun evidently emitted a flux of X rays and SEPs not atypical for a protostar.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical Reaction Rates for Charged-Particle Induced Reactions on Proton-Rich Nuclides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical reaction rates for reactions with proton-rich nuclides from stability to the proton dripline were calculated with an updated version of the SMARAGD statistical model (Hauser-Feshbach) code. Here, the focus was on reactions with protons or $\alpha$ particles as required for nucleosynthesis in proton-rich matter. For completeness, also neutron-induced reactions are provided for the same set of targets. Some comments on dependencies of rates on various nuclear properties and on the appropriate way to compare to experiments are given. The new rate set for charged-particle induced reactions provides a better description of experimental data than previously widely used rates, especially for reactions involving $\alpha$ particles.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Detection and Orbit Modeling of the Subcomponent in the Hot-dust System $\kappa$ Tuc A: A Low-mass Star on an Eccentric Orbit in a Hierarchical-quintuple System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The system $\kappa$ Tuc A is part of a hierarchical-quintuple system and is a prime target for studies of hot-exozodiacal dust, because a time-variable near-infrared excess has been detected. We observed the system with the Multi Aperture mid-Infrared Spectroscopic Experiment (MATISSE) and GRAVITY at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, and detected the stellar companion to the primary $\kappa$ Tuc Aa that was previously inferred by astrometry, $\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its $L$-band flux ratio to the primary is 1.32% and its signature in the MATISSE closure phases is mostly smaller than +/- 2{\deg}, which makes $\kappa$ Tuc Ab the highest-contrast companion ever detected with MATISSE closure phases. We verified with GRAVITY that relative astrometry with milliarcsecond precision can be retrieved from MATISSE closure phases. Using multiple epochs of observations, we obtain a full orbital solution for $\kappa$ Tuc Ab. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.94 and a semi-major axis of 4.8au. The orbit of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab and the orbit of the wider separation companion $\kappa$ Tuc B are mutually inclined. Based on the measured flux ratio of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab to Aa and their dynamical mass, we estimate the spectral type of $\kappa$ Tuc Ab to be M3.5V to M4.5V. While the then unknown star $\kappa$ Tuc Ab might have caused the putative detection of hot-exozodiacal dust around $\kappa$ Tuc Aa in 2012 and 2014, this cannot be for the detection in 2019, giving rise to an intriguing system architecture. This motivates studies investigating the interplay of the low-mass star on an eccentric orbit, the hot-exozodiacal dust, and a possible planetesimal reservoir.</description>

      <title>The helium common-envelope wind scenario for SN 2020eyj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SN 2020eyj is the first type Ia supernova (SN Ia) showing the signature of a compact helium-rich circumstellar material (CSM). Such a large CSM is difficult to explain in a single-degenerate scenario where the donor star is a helium star. Here we show that, under certain conditions, it is possible that the transfer of helium leads to a common envelope (CE) engulfing the system, similar to the common-envelope wind model proposed by Meng \&amp; Podsiadlowski (2017). If in such a helium common-envelope wind (HeCEW) model the initial white dwarf (WD) mass is larger than 1.1 $M_{\rm \odot}$ and the helium star more massive than 1.8 $M_{\rm \odot}$, the mass of a helium CE can be larger than 0.3 $M_{\rm \odot}$ prior to supernova explosion. The CE mass heavily depends on the initial parameters of the binary system. A dynamical CE ejection event could occur shortly before the supernova, and then our model may naturally explain the properties of SN 2020eyj, specifically the massive He-rich CSM, its dim peak brightness, low ejecta velocity and low birth rate.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and Photometric Analysis of NGC 146 and King 14: Evidence for a Co-Moving, Unbound Cluster Pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the nature of the NGC 146-King 14 cluster pair, we conducted a detailed photometric, astrometric, and dynamical study using multiwavelength data from Gaia DR3, Pan-STARRS1, WISE, and TESS. Using a probabilistic approach, we identified 770 and 690 high-probability members of NGC 146 and King 14, respectively. Both clusters exhibit well-defined radial density profiles consistent with King models. We estimate the cluster ages as 20 $\pm$ 5 Myr and 50 $\pm$ 10 Myr from isochrone fitting, and distances of 2.98 $\pm$ 0.33 kpc and 2.51 $\pm$ 0.23 kpc from parallaxes after applying the Bailer-Jones criteria. The clusters show consistent mean proper motions. The mass function slopes (1.51 $\pm$ 0.18 and 1.50 $\pm$ 0.15) are close to the Salpeter value, and the extinction follows a normal Galactic reddening law (RV ~ 3.1). Three-dimensional mapping gives a projected separation of ~ 9 pc. Orbit integration using the galpy MWPotential2014 model shows that NGC 146 and King 14 move in nearly circular, disk-like orbits with similar mean orbital radii (Rm ~ 9 kpc) and orbital periods of roughly 255 Myr. A dynamical separation of ~ 32 pc indicates that both clusters share a common spatial and kinematic association, consistent with a co-moving pair. However, their relative velocity exceeds the escape velocity set by their combined mass, indicating they are not gravitationally bound. TESS light curves reveal seven variable stars, including $\gamma$ Doradus, SPB stars, and eclipsing binaries, though only one is a likely member. Overall, the clusters likely formed within the same giant molecular cloud and now exist as an unbound co-moving pair.</description>

      <title>Line Polarization of Si II $\lambda$6355 \AA\ in Type Ia Supernovae: A New Statistical Approach to Probe the Explosion Physics and Diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetry provides a unique probe of ejecta asphericities, offering direct insights into the underlying explosion physics of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). We analyze the statistical properties of pre-maximum spectropolarimetric data for 24 SNe Ia observed with VLT/FORS, focusing on the Si II $\lambda$6355 \AA line. Previous studies have revealed a correlation between the peak Si II polarization degree and the expansion velocity. Here, we combine these observations with multi-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer simulations. We consider two asphericity classes: (i) lopsided abundance distributions produced by off-center delayed-detonation transitions in near-$M_{Ch}$ white dwarfs or, for example, WD collisions (Class I), and (ii) global, axisymmetric density asphericities such as those arising from explosions of rapidly rotating WDs or mergers (Class II). Our model grid spans normal to subluminous SNe Ia and successfully reproduces the observed Si II velocity-polarization trend, with higher velocities associated with stronger asphericities. Consistent with observations, transitional SNe Ia and the faint end of the normal SNe Ia population show the highest Si II polarization and are best explained by Class I scenarios. In contrast, subluminous SNe Ia are dominated by Class II asphericities, characterized by lower Si II polarization but significant continuum polarization. The observed distribution of Si II polarization depends on both the observer's viewing angle $\theta$ and the intrinsic asphericity. Statistical analysis of these spectropolarimetric snapshots enables the separation of Class I and Class II contributions and highlights the intrinsic diversity among SNe Ia. Our results imply viewing-angle-dependent luminosities in our local sample, which may have implications when using high-redshift SNe Ia as evidence for the need of non-standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>FIP Bias Evolution in an Emerging Active Region as observed in SPICE Synoptic Observations</title>

Abstract: We investigate the time evolution of relative elemental abundances in the context of the first ionization potential effect focusing on an active region. Our aim is to characterize this evolution in different types of solar active region structures as well as in different atmospheric layers. We wish to assert how the measured changes relate to different magnetic topologies by computing abundance enhancement in different conditions using the ponderomotive force model.
  Leveraging spectroscopic observations from the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment instrument on board Solar Orbiter, we use extreme ultraviolet lines from ions formed across a broad temperature range--from the upper chromosphere to the low corona--and we perform relative abundance ratios following differential emission measure analysis. This methodology yields relative abundance maps from low, intermediate, and high first ionization potential elements. We obtain the temporal evolution of a number of abundance ratios for different structures on the Sun. We compare these results with the outcomes of the ponderomotive force model.
  We find good correlation between the model and our results, suggesting an Alfv\'en-wave driven fractionation of the plasma. Fan loops, loop footpoints and active region boundaries exhibit coronal abundances, while the active region core shows more photospheric-like composition. A slow and steady increase in the magnesium to neon relative first ionization potential bias values is observed, starting around 1.5 and increasing by about 50\% after two days. The sulfur to oxygen evolution coupled with the model brings evidence of resonant waves fractionating the plasma in transition region structures.</description>

      <title>Exploring Young Stellar Variability with Gaia DR3 light curves</title>

Abstract: Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young stellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical processes taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early evolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&amp;M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&amp;M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&amp;M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\alpha_\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&amp;M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The SPHINX M dwarf Spectral Grid. II. New Model Atmospheres and Spectra to Derive Fundamental Properties of mid-to-late type M-dwarfs</title>

Abstract: M-dwarfs are the most dominant stars in the Galaxy. Their interiors and atmospheres exhibit complex processes including dust condensation, convective feedback, and magnetic activity-driven heterogeneity. Standard stellar characterization methods often struggle to capture these coupled effects. Part I of this series introduced SPHINX I, a validated grid of self-consistent radiative-convective model atmospheres and spectra for M-dwarfs with up-to-date molecular opacities suitable for early-to-mid M-dwarfs. Here, we present SPHINX II, which extends the model grid to cover mid-to-late type M-dwarfs, including both gray and physically motivated condensate cloud treatments and shorter convective mixing lengths. We validate SPHINX II using 39 benchmark FGK+M binary systems observed with SpeX IRTF (Mann et al. 2014) and apply it to 32 mid-to-late-type M-dwarfs from the SpeX Prism Library. SPHINX II yields improved fits that are statistically consistent with empirical benchmarks, achieving precisions of 0.078 dex in metallicity and 0.13 dex in C/O. Across the model grid, condensate cloud mass peaks between 2100-2400 K, decreasing sharply toward both cooler and hotter temperatures. We find the onset of the cloud-free regime around 2900 K, and below 2100 K, we see formation of deep/buried clouds. As a case study, we also model Trappist-1 and show that even mass-limited silicate grains subtly modify its emergent spectrum, suppressing near-infrared flux and reddening the mid-infrared slope via shallow cloud formation near 1e-2 bar. In sum, SPHINX II provides an improved framework for constraining the fundamental properties of mid-to-late M-dwarfs.</description>
