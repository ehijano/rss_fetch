      <title>Markov Walk Exploration of Model Spaces: Bayesian Selection of Dark Energy Models with Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to model selection is a trade-off between performing a good fit and low model complexity: A model of higher complexity should only be favoured over a simpler model if it provides significantly better fits. In Bayesian terms, this can be achieved by considering the evidence ratio, enabling choices between two competing models. We generalise this concept by constructing Markovian random walks for exploring the entire model spaces governed by the logarithmic evidence ratio, in analogy to the logarithmic likelihood ratio in parameter estimation problems. The theory of Markovian model exploration has an analytical description with partition functions, which we derive for both the canonical and macrocanonical case. We apply our methodology to selecting a polynomial for the dark energy equation of state function $w(a)$ fulfilling sensible physical priors, on the basis of data for the supernova distance-redshift relation. We conclude by commenting on the Jeffrey scale for Bayesian evidence ratios, choices of model priors and derived quantities like Shannon entropies for posterior model probabilities.</description>

      <title>Detecting Relativistic Doppler by Multi-Tracing a Single Galaxy Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New data from ongoing galaxy surveys, such as the $Euclid$ satellite and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), are expected to unveil physics on the largest scales of our universe. Dramatically affected by cosmic variance, these scales are of interest to large-scale structure studies as they exhibit relevant corrections due to general relativity (GR) in the $n$-point statistics of cosmological random fields. We focus on the relativistic, sample-dependent Doppler contribution to the observed clustering of galaxies, whose detection will further confirm the validity of GR in cosmological regimes. Sample- and scale-dependent, the Doppler term is more likely to be detected via cross-correlation measurements, where it acts as an imaginary correction to the power spectrum of fluctuations in galaxy number counts. We present a method allowing us to exploit multi-tracer benefits from a single data set, by subdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples, according to galaxies' luminosity/magnitude. To overcome cosmic variance we rely on a multi-tracer approach, and to maximise the detectability of the relativistic Doppler contribution in the data, we optimise sample selection. As a result, we find the optimal split and forecast the relativistic Doppler detection significance for both a DESI-like Bright Galaxy Sample and a $Euclid$-like H$\alpha$ galaxy population.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Local Primordial non-Gaussianity from Relativistic Effects in the Galaxy Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming galaxy surveys aim to map the Universe with unprecedented precision, depth and sky coverage. The galaxy bispectrum is a prime source of information as it allows us to probe primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), a key factor in differentiating various models of inflation. On the scales where local PNG is strongest, Doppler and other relativistic effects become important and need to be included. We investigate the detectability of relativistic and local PNG contributions in the galaxy bispectrum. We compute the signal-to-noise ratio for the detection of the bispectrum including such effects. Furthermore, we perform information matrix forecasts on the local PNG parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and on the parametrised amplitudes of the relativistic corrections. Finally, we quantify the bias on the measurement of $f_{\rm NL}$ that arises from neglecting relativistic effects. Our results show that detections of both first- and second-order relativistic effects are promising with forthcoming spectroscopic survey specifications -- and are largely unaffected by the uncertainty in $f_{\rm NL}$. Conversely, we show for the first time that neglecting relativistic corrections in the galaxy bispectrum can lead to $&gt;\!1.5\sigma(f_{\rm NL})$ shift on the detected value of $f_{\rm NL}$, highlighting the importance of including relativistic effects in our modelling.</description>

      <title>Comments on the prior dependence of the DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short contribution, we explore the prior dependence of the recent DESI results, according to which a Bayesian comparison of $\Lambda$CDM with $w_0w_a$CDM cosmologies favors dynamical dark energy. It is a simple exercise to show that extending the prior lower bound of the dark energy parameters tilts the preference in favor of $\Lambda$CDM. Adopting the PantheonPlus supernovae catalog, for instance, a shift of the lower bound for $w_0,w_a$ from $-3$ to beyond $-4.6$ and $-5$, respectively, is sufficient to favor $\Lambda$CDM. This calls for caution when interpreting DESI results in the Bayesian context.</description>

      <title>Impact of lensing bias on the cosmological dispersion measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmological dispersion measure (DM) as a function of redshift, derived from localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), has been used as a tool for constraining the cosmic ionized fraction and cosmological parameters. For these purposes, the DM in a homogeneous cosmological model has typically been used, neglecting the inhomogeneity of matter distribution. In this study, we derive a bias in the ensemble average of the DM over many FRBs owing to gravitational lensing by the inhomogeneous matter distribution based on cosmological perturbation theory. We demonstrate that the ensemble average is $0.4 \, \%$--$1\,\%$ smaller than the DM in the corresponding homogeneous model for a source redshift of $z_{\rm s}=1$, according to recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of IllustrisTNG and BAHAMAS. This reduction occurs because light rays from FRBs tend to avoid high-density regions owing to lensing deflection. We also discuss another selection effect, magnification bias, where demagnified FRBs with low DMs, fainter than the detection threshold, are excluded from the observed sample, leading to a selective observation of magnified FRBs with high DMs. Lensing bias, including magnification bias, must be considered to achieve percent level accuracy in the DM--redshift relation.</description>

      <title>Cosmological simulations of scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a set of cosmological N-body simulations with standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology but characterized by a scale-dependent primordial non-Gaussianity of the local type featuring a power-law dependence of the $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}(k)$ at large scales followed by a saturation to a constant value at smaller scales where non-linear growth leads to the formation of collapsed cosmic structures. Such models are built to ensure consistency with current Cosmic Microwave Background bounds on primordial non-Gaussianity yet allowing for large effects of the non-Gaussian statistics on the properties of non-linear structure formation. We show the impact of such scale-dependent non-Gaussian scenarios on a wide range of properties of the resulting cosmic structures, such as the non-linear matter power spectrum, the halo and sub-halo mass functions, the concentration-mass relation, the halo and void density profiles, and we highlight for the first time that some of these models might mimic the effects of Warm Dark Matter for several of such observables</description>

      <title>The Simons Observatory: component separation pipelines for B-modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Simons Observatory (SO) Small Aperture Telescopes aim at observing the degree-scale anisotropies of the polarized CMB to constrain the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ at the level of $\sigma(r=0)\lesssim0.003$ to probe models of the very early Universe. We present three complementary $r$ inference pipelines and compare their results on a set of sky simulations that allow us to explore a number of Galactic foreground and instrumental noise models, relevant for SO. In most scenarios, the pipelines retrieve consistent and unbiased results. However, several complex foreground scenarios lead to a $&gt;2\sigma$ bias on $r$ if analyzed with the default versions of these pipelines, highlighting the need for more sophisticated pipeline components that marginalize over foreground residuals. We present two such extensions, using power-spectrum-based and map-based methods, and show that they fully reduce the bias on $r$ to sub-sigma level in all scenarios, and at a moderate cost in terms of $\sigma(r)$.</description>

Abstract: We present a model independent analysis of the Pantheon+ supernova sample and study the dependence of the recovered values of $H_0$, $q_0$ and $j_0$ on the redshift cut and on the modeling of peculiar velocities. In addition to the bulk velocity discussed previously, we also find a significant infall that we attribute to the presence of an overdensity out to a radius of $R\simeq 120h^{-1}$Mpc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider cosmological models with an arbitrary number of scalar fields nonminimally coupled to gravity and construct new integrable cosmological models. In the constructed models, the Ricci scalar is an integral of motion irrespectively of the type of metric. The general solutions of evolution equations in the spatially flat FLRW metric have been found for models the quartic potentials.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-ALPAKA survey II. Evolution of turbulence in galaxy disks across cosmic time: difference between cold and warm gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas in the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies is supersonically turbulent. Measurements of turbulence typically rely on cold gas emission lines for low-z galaxies and warm ionized gas observations for z&gt;0 galaxies. Studies of warm gas kinematics at z&gt;0 conclude that the turbulence strongly evolves as a function of redshift, due to the increasing impact of gas accretion and mergers in the early Universe. However, recent findings suggest potential biases in turbulence measurements derived from ionized gas at high-z, impacting our understanding of turbulence origin, ISM physics and disk formation. We investigate the evolution of turbulence using velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) measurements from cold gas tracers (i.e., CO, [CI], [CII]) derived from a sample of 57 galaxy disks spanning the redshift range z=0-5. This sample consists of main-sequence and starburst galaxies with stellar masses $\gtrsim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. The comparison with current H$\alpha$ kinematic observations and existing models demonstrates that the velocity dispersion inferred from cold gas tracers differ by a factor of $\approx 3$ from those obtained using emission lines tracing warm gas. We show that stellar feedback is the main driver of turbulence measured from cold gas tracers. This is fundamentally different from the conclusions of studies based on warm gas, which had to consider additional turbulence drivers to explain the high values of $\sigma$. We present a model predicting the redshift evolution of turbulence in galaxy disks, attributing the increase of $\sigma$ with redshift to the higher energy injected by supernovae due to the elevated star-formation rate in high-z galaxies. This supernova-driven model suggests that turbulence is lower in galaxies with lower stellar mass compared to those with higher stellar mass. Additionally, it forecasts the evolution of $\sigma$ in Milky-Way like progenitors.</description>

      <title>Indirect Searches for Ultraheavy Dark Matter in the Time Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may exist today in the form of ultraheavy composite bound states. Collisions between such dark matter states can release intense bursts of radiation that includes gamma-rays among the final products. Thus, indirect-detection signals of dark matter may include unconventional gamma-ray bursts. Such bursts may have been missed not necessarily because of their low arriving gamma-ray fluxes, but rather their briefness and rareness. We point out that intense bursts whose non-detection thus far are due to the latter can be detected in the near future with existing and planned facilities. In particular, we propose that, with slight experimental adjustments and suitable data analyses, imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) and Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared and Optical Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (PANOSETI) are promising tools for detecting such rare, brief, but intense bursts. We also show that if we assume these bursts originate from collisions of dark matter states, IACTs and PANOSETI can probe a large dark matter parameter space beyond existing limits. Additionally, we present a concrete model of dark matter that produces bursts potentially detectable in these instruments.</description>

      <title>Thermal False Vacuum Decay Is Not What It Seems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decay of a thermally excited metastable vacuum in classical field theory using real-time numerical simulations. We find a lower decay rate than predicted by standard thermal theory. The discrepancy is due to the violation of thermal equilibrium during the critical bubble nucleation. It is reduced by introducing dissipation and noise. We propose a criterion for the system to remain in equilibrium during the nucleation process and show that it is violated in the Hamiltonian evolution of a single field. In the case of many fields, the fulfillment of the criterion is model-dependent.</description>

      <title>SHARP -- A near-IR multi-mode spectrograph conceived for MORFEO@ELT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs), thanks to their large apertures and cutting-edge Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems, promise to deliver sharper and deeper data even than the JWST. SHARP is a concept study for a near-IR (0.95-2.45 $\mu$m) spectrograph conceived to fully exploit the collecting area and the angular resolution of the upcoming generation of ELTs. In particular, SHARP is designed for the 2nd port of MORFEO@ELT. Composed of a Multi-Object Spectrograph, NEXUS, and a multi-Integral Field Unit, VESPER, MORFEO-SHARP will deliver high angular ($\sim$30 mas) and spectral (R$\simeq$300, 2000, 6000, 17000) resolution, outperforming NIRSpec@JWST (100 mas). SHARP will enable studies of the nearby Universe and the early Universe in unprecedented detail. NEXUS is fed by a configurable slit system deploying up to 30 slits with $\sim$2.4 arcsec length and adjustable width, over a field of about 1.2"$\times$1.2" (35 mas/pix). Each slit is fed by an inversion prism able to rotate by an arbitrary angle the field that can be seen by the slit. VESPER is composed of 12 probes of 1.7"$\times$1.5" each (spaxel 31 mas) probing a field 24"$\times$70". SHARP is conceived to exploit the ELTs apertures reaching the faintest flux and the sharpest angular resolution by joining the sensitivity of NEXUS and the high spatial sampling of VESPER to MORFEO capabilities. This article provides an overview of the scientific design drivers, their solutions, and the resulting optical design of the instrument achieving the required optical performance.</description>

      <title>New Synoptic Observations of the Cosmic Optical Background with New Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06273v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtained New Horizons LORRI images to measure the cosmic optical background (COB) intensity integrated over $0.4\lesssim\lambda\lesssim0.9{~\rm\mu m}.$ The survey comprises 16 high Galactic-latitude fields selected to minimize scattered diffuse Galactic light (DGL) from the Milky Way galaxy, as well as scattered light from bright stars. This work supersedes an earlier analysis based on observations of one of the present fields. Isolating the COB contribution to the raw total sky levels measured in the fields requires subtracting the remaining scattered light from bright stars and galaxies, intensity from faint stars within the fields fainter than the photometric detection-limit, and the DGL foreground. DGL is estimated from Planck HFI $350 {~\rm\mu m}$ and $550 {~\rm\mu m}$ intensities, using a new self-calibrated indicator based on the 16 fields augmented with eight additional DGL calibration fields obtained as part of the survey. The survey yields a highly significant detection ($6.8\sigma$) of the COB at ${\rm 11.16\pm 1.65~(1.47~sys,~0.75~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}}$ at the LORRI pivot wavelength of 0.608 $\mu$m. The estimated integrated intensity from background galaxies, ${\rm 8.17\pm 1.18 ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ can account for the great majority of this signal. The rest of the COB signal, ${\rm 2.99\pm2.03~ (1.75~sys,~1.03~ran) ~nW ~m^{-2} ~sr^{-1}},$ is formally classified as anomalous intensity but is not significantly different from zero. The simplest interpretation is that the COB is completely due to galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive, gravitationally-bound structures in the Universe, emerging through hierarchical structure formation of large-scale dark matter and baryon overdensities. Early galaxy ``proto-clusters'' are believed to be important physical drivers of the overall cosmic star-formation rate density and serve as ``hotspots'' for the reionization of the intergalactic medium. Our understanding of the formation of these structures at the earliest cosmic epochs is, however, limited to sparse observations of their galaxy members, or based on phenomenological models and cosmological simulations. Here we report the detection of a massive neutral, atomic hydrogen (HI) gas reservoir permeating a galaxy proto-cluster at redshift $z=5.4$, observed one billion years after the Big Bang. The presence of this cold gas is revealed by strong damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption features observed in several background galaxy spectra taken with JWST/NIRSpec in close on-sky projection. While overall the sightlines probe a large range in HI column densities, $N_{\rm HI} = 10^{21.7}-10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, they are similar across nearby sightlines, demonstrating that they probe the same dense, neutral gas. This observation of a massive, large-scale overdensity of cold neutral gas challenges current large-scale cosmological simulations and has strong implications for the reionization topology of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>

Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>

      <title>Origin of effective graviton mass from spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity and quantum field theory govern all fundamental physical processes, from nuclear and subatomic scales to the solar system, galactic, and cosmology. Both theories work remarkably well in their tested domains. However, there is minimal overlap between the two domains. Our work demonstrates that the non-overlapping of domains \emph{no longer} holds when non-perturbative effects are considered. We introduce a novel mechanism in which the gravitons acquire \emph{effective mass} due to the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of global or local symmetry of complex scalar field minimally coupled to gravity. In the flat space-time limit, we demonstrate that the resulting action for the graviton is identical to the extended Fierz-Pauli (FP) action, corresponding to the mass deformation parameter $\alpha = 1/2$. The extended FP action has 6 Degrees of freedom and no ghost. For local $U(1)$ SSB, we establish that the effective graviton mass is related to the mass of the gauge boson and the electric charge of the complex scalar field. Interestingly, our results indicate that the millicharged dark matter scalar fields, generating dark photons, can produce graviton mass of the same order as the Hubble constant $(H_0)$. Hence, we argue that the dark sector offers a natural explanation for the acceleration of the current Universe.</description>

Abstract: We present the cosmological implications from final measurements of clustering using galaxies, quasars, and Ly$\alpha$ forests from the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) lineage of experiments in large-scale structure. These experiments, composed of data from SDSS, SDSS-II, BOSS, and eBOSS, offer independent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements of angular-diameter distances and Hubble distances relative to the sound horizon, $r_d$, from eight different samples and six measurements of the growth rate parameter, $f\sigma_8$, from redshift-space distortions (RSD). This composite sample is the most constraining of its kind and allows us to perform a comprehensive assessment of the cosmological model after two decades of dedicated spectroscopic observation. We show that the BAO data alone are able to rule out dark-energy-free models at more than eight standard deviations in an extension to the flat, $\Lambda$CDM model that allows for curvature. When combined with Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements of temperature and polarization the BAO data provide nearly an order of magnitude improvement on curvature constraints. The RSD measurements indicate a growth rate that is consistent with predictions from Planck primary data and with General Relativity. When combining the results of SDSS BAO and RSD with external data, all multiple-parameter extensions remain consistent with a $\Lambda$CDM model. Regardless of cosmological model, the precision on $\Omega_\Lambda$, $H_0$, and $\sigma_8$, remains at roughly 1\%, showing changes of less than 0.6\% in the central values between models. The inverse distance ladder measurement under a o$w_0w_a$CDM yields $H_0= 68.20 \pm 0.81 \, \rm km\, s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$, remaining in tension with several direct determination methods.

      <title>Inference of the optical depth to reionization $\tau$ from $\textit{Planck}$ CMB maps with convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical depth to reionization, $\tau$, is the least constrained parameter of the cosmological $\Lambda$CDM model. To date, its most precise value is inferred from large-scale polarized CMB power spectra from the ${\it Planck}$ High-Frequency Instrument (HFI). These maps are known to contain significant contamination by residual non-Gaussian systematic effects, which are hard to model analytically. Therefore, robust constraints on $\tau$ are currently obtained through an empirical cross-spectrum likelihood built from simulations. In this paper, we present a likelihood-free inference of $\tau$ from polarized ${\it Planck}$ HFI maps which, for the first time, is fully based on neural networks (NNs). NNs have the advantage of not requiring an analytical description of the data and can be trained on state-of-the-art simulations, combining information from multiple channels. By using Gaussian sky simulations and ${\it Planck}$ ${\tt SRoll2}$ simulations, including CMB, noise, and residual instrumental systematic effects, we train, test and validate NN models considering different setups. We infer the value of $\tau$ directly from $Q$ and $U$ maps at $\sim 4^\circ$ pixel resolution, without computing power spectra. On ${\it Planck}$ data, we obtain $\tau_{NN}=0.058 \pm 0.008$, compatible with current EE cross-spectrum results but with a $\sim30\%$ larger uncertainty, which can be assigned to the inherent non-optimality of our estimator and to the retraining procedure applied to avoid biases. While this paper does not improve on current cosmological constraints, our analysis represents a first robust application of NN-based inference on real data and highlights its potential as a promising tool for complementary analysis of near-future CMB experiments, also in view of the ongoing challenge to achieve a detection of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

Abstract: The upcoming Simons Observatory Small Aperture Telescopes aim at achieving a constraint on the primordial tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ at the level of $\sigma(r=0)\lesssim0.003$, observing the polarized CMB in the presence of partial sky coverage, cosmic variance, inhomogeneous non-white noise, and Galactic foregrounds. We present three different analysis pipelines able to constrain $r$ given the latest available instrument performance, and compare their predictions on a set of sky simulations that allow us to explore a number of Galactic foreground models and elements of instrumental noise, relevant for the Simons Observatory. The three pipelines employ different combinations of parametric and non-parametric component separation at the map and power spectrum levels, and use B-mode purification to estimate the CMB B-mode power spectrum. We applied them to a common set of simulated realistic frequency maps, and compared and validated them with focus on their ability to extract robust constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$. We evaluated their performance in terms of bias and statistical uncertainty on this parameter. In most of the scenarios the three methodologies achieve similar performance. Nevertheless, several simulations with complex foreground signals lead to a $&gt;2\sigma$ bias on $r$ if analyzed with the default versions of these pipelines, highlighting the need for more sophisticated pipeline components that marginalize over foreground residuals. We show two such extensions, using power-spectrum-based and map-based methods, that are able to fully reduce the bias on $r$ below the statistical uncertainties in all foreground models explored, at a moderate cost in terms of $\sigma(r)$.</description>

Abstract: Dark sirens are a powerful way to infer cosmological and astrophysical parameters from the combination of gravitational wave sirens and galaxy catalogues. Importantly, the method relies on the completeness of the galaxy catalogues being well modelled. A magnitude-limited catalogue will always be incomplete to some extent, requiring a completion scheme to avoid biasing the parameter inference. Standard methods include homogeneous and multiplicative completion, which have the advantage of simplicity but underestimate or overestimate the amplitude of structure at low completeness, respectively. In this work, we propose a new method to complete galaxy catalogues which uses clustering information to incorporate knowledge of the large scale structure into the dark sirens method. We find that if the structure of the true number of galaxies is sufficiently well preserved in the catalogue, our estimator can perform drastically better than both homogeneous and multiplicative completion. We lay the foundations for a maximally informative dark sirens analysis and discuss its limitations.</description>

      <title>A representation learning approach to probe for dynamical dark energy in matter power spectra</title>

Abstract: We present DE-VAE, a variational autoencoder (VAE) architecture to search for a compressed representation of dynamical dark energy (DE) models in observational studies of the cosmic large-scale structure. DE-VAE is trained on matter power spectra boosts generated at wavenumbers $k\in(0.01-2.5) \ h/\rm{Mpc}$ and at four redshift values $z\in(0.1,0.48,0.78,1.5)$ for the most typical dynamical DE parametrization with two extra parameters describing an evolving DE equation of state. The boosts are compressed to a lower-dimensional representation, which is concatenated with standard cold dark matter (CDM) parameters and then mapped back to reconstructed boosts; both the compression and the reconstruction components are parametrized as neural networks. Remarkably, we find that a single latent parameter is sufficient to predict 95% (99%) of DE power spectra generated over a broad range of cosmological parameters within $1\sigma$ ($2\sigma$) of a Gaussian error which includes cosmic variance, shot noise and systematic effects for a Stage IV-like survey. This single parameter shows a high mutual information with the two DE parameters, and these three variables can be linked together with an explicit equation through symbolic regression. Considering a model with two latent variables only marginally improves the accuracy of the predictions, and adding a third latent variable has no significant impact on the model's performance. We discuss how the DE-VAE architecture can be extended from a proof of concept to a general framework to be employed in the search for a common lower-dimensional parametrization of a wide range of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models and for different cosmological datasets. Such a framework could then both inform the development of cosmological surveys by targeting optimal probes, and provide theoretical insight into the common phenomenological aspects of beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models.</description>

Abstract: We present the Einstein-Boltzmann module of the DISCO-DJ (DIfferentiable Simulations for COsmology - Done with JAX) software package. This module implements a fully differentiable solver for the linearised cosmological Einstein-Boltzmann equations in the JAX framework, and allows computing Jacobian matrices of all solver output with respect to all input parameters using automatic differentiation. This implies that along with the solution for a given set of parameters, the tangent hyperplane in parameter space is known as well, which is a key ingredient for cosmological inference and forecasting problems as well as for many other applications. We discuss our implementation and demonstrate that our solver agrees at the per-mille level with the existing non-differentiable solvers CAMB and CLASS, including massive neutrinos and a dark energy fluid with parameterised equation of state. We illustrate the dependence of various summary statistics in large-scale structure cosmology on model parameters using the differentiable solver, and finally demonstrate how it can be easily used for Fisher forecasting, with a forecast for Euclid as an example. Since the implementation is significantly shorter and more modular than existing solvers, we believe it will be more straightforward to extend our solver to include additional physics, such as additional dark energy and dark matter models, modified gravity, or other non-standard physics in the future.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration can be explained by mergers of binary primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation dominated epoch. However, in early structures induced by the Poisson distribution of PBHs, a significant fraction of binaries are perturbed and avoid mergers. In addition, the internal dynamics of early halos lead to the formation of dense primordial black hole clusters within a few Hubble times from the moment of halo formation. In such clusters PBH binaries are effectively formed and their mergers potentially dominate in the modern era. We obtained that the PBH merger rate changes with redshift as $\mathcal{R} \propto (1 + z)^\beta$, where $\beta = 1.4 - 2.2$ reflects the influence of PBH clustering and depends on both $z$ and $f_{\rm PBH}$. The observed merger rate constraints the fraction of PBHs of tens solar masses in the composition of dark matter $f_{\rm PBH} \lesssim 0.001 - 0.1$ in dependence of the clustering efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Large scale structures provide valuable information of the primordial perturbations that encode the secrets of the origin of the Universe. It is an essential step to map between observables and their initial coordinates, called Lagrangian space, from which primordial perturbations transfer their information to structures via linear theory. By using numerical simulations and state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques, we report the accuracy of estimating the Lagrangian coordinates of galaxies and galaxy clusters, represented by dark matter halos in various ranges of mass, and study the accuracy of this remapping on the angular momentum (spin) reconstruction. Our work shows that galaxy groups and clusters, represented by halos with mass $\gtrsim 10^{13}M_\odot$, can be accurately remapped to Lagrangian space, and their spin reconstruction errors are dominated by the reconstructed initial gravitational potential. For all mass ranges, the errors of Lagrangian remapping, as well as redshift space distortions, play subdominant roles in estimating their angular momenta. This study explains the low correlation level between observed galaxy spins and reconstructed cosmic initial conditions and illustrates the potential of using angular momenta of cosmic structures to improve the reconstruction of primordial perturbations.</description>

Abstract: The abundance of dark matter haloes is a key cosmological probe in forthcoming galaxy surveys. The theoretical understanding of the halo mass function (HMF) is limited by our incomplete knowledge of the origin of non-universality and its cosmological parameter dependence. We present a deep learning model which compresses the linear matter power spectrum into three independent factors which are necessary and sufficient to describe the $z=0$ HMF from the state-of-the-art AEMULUS emulator to sub-per cent accuracy in a $w$CDM$+N_\mathrm{eff}$ parameter space. Additional information about growth history does not improve the accuracy of HMF predictions if the matter power spectrum is already provided as input, because required aspects of the former can be inferred from the latter. The three factors carry information about the universal and non-universal aspects of the HMF, which we interrogate via the information-theoretic measure of mutual information. We find that non-universality is captured by recent growth history after matter-dark-energy equality and $N_\mathrm{eff}$ for $M\sim 10^{13} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}\, h^{-1}$ haloes, and by $\Omega_{\rm m}$ for $M\sim 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}\, h^{-1}$. The compact representation learnt by our model can inform the design of emulator training sets to achieve high emulator accuracy with fewer simulations.</description>

Abstract: Magnification serves as an independent and complementary gravitational lensing measurement to shear. We develop a novel method to achieve an accurate and robust magnification measurement around BOSS CMASS galaxies across physical scales of $0.016h^{-1}{\rm Mpc} &lt; r_{\rm p} &lt; 10h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We first measure the excess total flux density $\delta M$ of the source galaxies in deep DECaLS photometric catalog that are lensed by CMASS galaxies. We convert $\delta M$ to magnification $\mu$ by establishing the $\delta \mu-\delta M$ relation using a deeper photometric sample. By comparing magnification measurements in three optical bands ($grz$), we constrain the dust attenuation curve and its radial distribution, discovering a steep attenuation curve in the circumgalactic medium of CMASS galaxies. We further compare dust-corrected magnification measurements to model predictions from high-resolution dark matter-only (DMO) simulations in WMAP and Planck cosmologies, as well as the hydrodynamic simulation \texttt{TNG300-1}, using precise galaxy-halo connections from the Photometric objects Around Cosmic webs method and the accurate ray-tracing algorithm \texttt{P3MLens}. For $r_{\rm p} &gt; 70h^{-1}$ kpc, our magnification measurements are in good agreement with both WMAP and Planck cosmologies. However, at $r_{\rm p} &lt; 70h^{-1}$ kpc, we observe an excess magnification signal, which is higher than the DMO model in Planck cosmology at $2.8\sigma$ and would be exacerbated if significant baryon feedback is included. Implications of the potential small scale discrepancy for the nature of dark matter and for the processes governing galaxy formation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Consistent Theories for the DESI dark energy fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We search for physically consistent realizations of evolving dark energy suggested by the cosmological fit of DESI, Planck and Supernovae data. First we note that any lagrangian description of the standard Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization for the dark energy equation of state $w_{\rm eff}$, allows for the addition of a cosmological constant. We perform the cosmological fit finding new regions of parameter space that however continue to favour dark energy with $w_{\rm eff}&lt;-1$ at early times, that is challenging to realize in consistent theories. Next, in the spirit of effective field theories, we consider the effect of higher order terms in the Taylor expansion of the equation of state of dark energy around the present epoch. We find that non-linear corrections of the equation of state are weakly constrained, thus opening the way to scenarios that differ from CPL at early times, possibly with $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ at all times. We present indeed scenarios where evolving dark energy can be realized through quintessence models. We introduce in particular the ramp model where dark energy coincides with CPL at late times and approximates to a cosmological constant at early times. The latter model provides a much better fit than $\Lambda$CDM, and only slightly worse than $w_0w_a$CDM, but with the notable advantage of being described by a simple and theoretically consistent lagrangian of a canonical quintessence model.</description>

      <title>Quantum initial conditions for curved inflating universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.17248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the challenges of motivating, constructing, and quantizing a canonically normalized inflationary perturbation in spatially curved universes. We show that this has historically proved challenging due to the interaction of nonadiabaticity with spatial curvature. We construct a novel curvature perturbation that is canonically normalized in the sense of its equation of motion and is unique up to a single scalar parameter. With this construction it becomes possible to set initial conditions invariant under canonical transformations, overcoming known ambiguities in the literature. This corrected quantization has potentially observational consequences via modifications to the primordial power spectrum at large angular scales, as well as theoretical implications for quantization procedures in curved cosmologies filled with a scalar field.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from null energy condition violation during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) and the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) have significant implications for our understanding of the very early universe. We present a novel approach to generate PBHs via the NEC violation in a single-field inflationary scenario. In our scenario, the universe transitions from a first slow-roll inflation stage with a Hubble parameter $H = H_{\text{inf}1}$ to a second slow-roll inflation stage with $H = H_{\text{inf}2}\gg H_{\text{inf}1}$, passing through an intermediate stage of NEC violation. The NEC violation naturally enhances the primordial scalar power spectrum at a certain wavelength, leading to the production of PBHs with masses and abundances of observational interest. We also investigate the phenomenological signatures of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) resulting from the enhanced density perturbations. Our work highlights the potential of utilizing a combination of PBHs, SIGWs, and primordial gravitational waves as a valuable probe for studying NEC violation during inflation, opening up new avenues for exploring the early universe.</description>

      <title>Dark matter from mediator decay in early matter domination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study dark matter production from mediator decays in scenarios with an epoch of early matter domination. Particles that mediate interactions between dark matter and the standard model particles are kinematically accessible to the thermal bath as long as their mass is below the reheating temperature of the Universe after inflation. Decay of on-shell mediators can then lead to copious production of dark matter during early matter domination or a preceding radiation-dominated phase. In particular, for mediators that are charged under the standard model, it can exceed the standard freeze-in channel due to inverse annihilations at much lower temperatures (often by many orders of magnitude). The requirement to obtain the correct relic abundance severely constrains the parameter space for dark matter masses above a few TeV.</description>
