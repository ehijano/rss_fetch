      <title>Towards a Robust Machine-Learning Pipeline for 21-cm Cosmology Data Analysis I: A Roadmap for Development and Demonstration of Robustness Against PSF Modeling Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21-cm signal from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is a powerful probe of the evolution of the Universe. However, accurate measurements of the EoR signal from radio interferometric observations are sensitive to efficient foreground removal, mitigating radio-frequency interference and accounting for instrumental systematics. This work represents the first in a series of papers, where we will be introducing a novel ML based pipeline, step-by-step, to directly infer reionization parameters from 21-cm radio-interferometric images. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the variations in the point spread function (PSF) on parameter estimation by simulating visibilities corresponding to input 21-cm maps as observed by the 128-antenna configuration of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II. These visibilities are imaged to obtain dirty images, which are then used to train a 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict $\rm x_{HI}$. To systematically assess the effect of PSF mis-modelling, we generate multiple test sets by varying the MWA's antenna layout, thereby introducing controlled variations in the PSF; we then feed these alternative PSF dirty images to our CNN trained using only dirty images with the PSF of the true antenna layout. Our results demonstrate that PSF variations introduce biases in the CNN's predictions of $\rm x_{HI}$, with errors depending on the extent of PSF distortion. We quantify these biases and discuss their implications for the reliability of machine-learning-based parameter inference in 21-cm cosmology and how they can be utilized to improve the robustness of estimation against PSF-related systematics in future 21-cm surveys. In concluding, we also discuss how this approach to incorporating realistic instrument error into an ML analysis pipeline can be expanded to include multiple other effects.</description>

      <title>Recovering unbiased CMB polarization maps using modern ground-based experiments with minimal assumptions about atmospheric emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of unbiased reconstruction of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization maps from data collected by modern ground-based observatories. Atmospheric emission is a major source of correlated noise in such experiments, complicating the recovery of faint cosmological signals. We consider estimators that require minimal assumptions about unpolarized atmospheric emission properties, instead exploiting hardware solutions commonly implemented in modern instruments, such as pairs of orthogonal antennas in each focal plane pixel, and polarization signal modulation via a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP). We focus on two techniques: (i) statistical down-weighting of low-frequency atmospheric signals, and (ii) pair-differencing (PD), which involves differencing signals collected by two detectors in the same focal plane pixel. We compare their performance against the idealized case where the atmospheric signal is perfectly known and cleanly subtracted. We show that PD can be derived from maximum likelihood principles under general assumptions about the atmospheric signal, optimizing map sensitivity. In the absence of instrumental systematics but with reasonable detector noise variations, PD yields polarized sky maps with noise levels only slightly worse than the ideal case. While down-weighting could match this performance, it requires highly accurate atmospheric models that are not readily available. PD performance is affected by instrumental systematics, particularly those leaking atmospheric signal to the difference time stream. However, effects like gain mismatch are efficiently mitigated by a rotating HWP, making PD a competitive, robust, and efficient solution for CMB polarization mapmaking without atmospheric modeling.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Gamma Ray Bursts with the Zir\`e instrument onboard the NUSES space mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zir\`e experiment onboard NUSES space mission has several science goals, including the measurements of charged particles and light nuclei from few up to hundreds of MeVs, for the study of low-energy cosmic rays, space weather phenomena, and possible magnetosphere-lithosphere-ionosphere coupling signals. Furthermore, the experiment intends to test new tools for the detection of photons in the energy range of about 0.03-50 MeV, allowing the investigation of transient phenomena like gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). A high-density segmented calorimeter exploiting novel scintillator crystals and silicon photomultiplier technology for the readout system will serve this purpose along its main task of calorimetric energy measurement of the cosmic-ray charged particles. In this work, we discuss the functionality of the calorimeter as a GRB monitor through the calculation of its performance in terms of effective area, sensitivity, and timing response for the transient outbursts.</description>

      <title>Identifying rocky planets and water worlds among sub-Neptune-sized exoplanets with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomers are debating whether the plentiful "sub-Neptune" exoplanets -- worlds a bit larger than Earth but smaller than Neptune -- are predominantly rocky planets, water-rich "ocean worlds," or gas-enshrouded mini-Neptunes. This question is crucial because such sub-Neptune-sized planets are among the most common in our galaxy, yet we have no analog in our own solar system, making them a key to understanding planet formation and diversity. It also directly impacts the search for habitable worlds: larger-than-Earth planets with solid surfaces or oceans could support life, whereas gas-rich mini-Neptunes likely cannot. However, distinguishing these types using only a planet's mass and radius is very challenging, because different compositions can produce similar densities, leaving a world's nature ambiguous with current data. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), a future NASA flagship telescope, offers a solution. HWO could directly image and spectroscopically analyze starlight reflected from 50~100 sub-Neptunes around nearby stars, aiming to reveal their atmospheric compositions and potential surfaces. Using visible and near-infrared spectroscopy along with sensitive polarimetry, HWO would detect atmospheric gases (such as water vapor, methane, and carbon dioxide) and search for telltale surface signatures, including rock absorption features and the characteristic reflectivity patterns of oceans. By analyzing these signals, we could determine whether sub-Neptunes are large rocky planets or water worlds rather than gas-dominated mini-Neptunes. Crucially, expanding the search beyond Earth-sized planets to include these abundant sub-Neptunes may uncover entirely new classes of potentially habitable worlds, directly advancing HWO's mission to identify and characterize planets that could support life.</description>

      <title>0.3-to-1.5-GHz LNA with Wideband Noise and Power Matching for Radio Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a low-noise amplifier (LNA) that was developed for a new radio telescope comprised of 512 parabolic dish antennas. The LNA closely interfaces to a custom-made antenna feed with an impedance co-designed to provide noise matching over a 5:1 bandwidth. Additionally, a method of broadband noise and power matching that allows the input impedance to be controlled independently from the optimum signal-source impedance to achieve minimum noise is also discussed. When measured in a 50-\Omega system, the LNA exhibits a return loss (RL) of &gt; 8 dB between 0.32 to 1.5 GHz, S21 of 32 dB \pm 1.2 dB, IP1dB &gt; -37 dBm, and IIP3 &gt; -20 dBm. Noise parameter measurements show Tmin \approx 13 \pm 4K and noise temperatures T50{\Omega} \approx 18 \pm 6K between 0.5 to 1.4 GHz.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Dispersion Measurement at Hanle Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric dispersion introduces wavelength-dependent effects that significantly impact ground-based observations, particularly in slit- and fibre-fed spectroscopic studies. These effects reduce the signal entering the spectrograph and introduce systematic errors in radial velocity measurements. To address this challenge, atmospheric dispersion correctors are utilised. However, many existing designs of these correctors, which are based on theoretical models, often lack practical validation and consistency. The forthcoming National Large Optical Telescope (NLOT) will be installed at Hanle, a site known for its favourable astronomical sky conditions. Thus, the design of an effective dispersion corrector for the instruments on the NLOT, specifically one that compensates for the measured dispersion, is crucial. For the first time, we have directly measured atmospheric dispersion at the Hanle site using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph mounted on the Himalayan Chandra Telescope. In this study, we present our methodology, the dispersion measurements obtained within the 400 to 700 nm wavelength range, and a comparison with modelled dispersion values.</description>

      <title>Volume Density Mapper: 3D Density Reconstruction Algorithm for Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) exhibits complex, multi-scale structures that are challenging to study due to their projection into two-dimensional (2D) column density maps. We present the Volume Density Mapper, a novel algorithm based on constrained diffusion to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) density distributions of molecular clouds from 2D observations. This method decomposes the column density into multi-scale components, reconstructing a 3D density field that preserves key physical properties such as mean density, maximum density, and standard deviation along the line of sight. Validated against numerical simulations (FLASH and ENZO), the algorithm achieves high accuracy, with mean density estimates within 0.1 dex and dispersions of 0.2 to 0.3 dex across varied cloud structures. The reconstructed 3D density fields enable the derivation of critical parameters, including volume density, cloud thickness, and density probability distribution functions, offering insights into star formation and ISM evolution. The versatility of the method is demonstrated by applying diverse systems from galaxies (NGC 628) to protostellar disks. The code is available at https://github.com/gxli/volume-density-mapper.</description>

      <title>Expect the unexpected: augmented mixture models for black hole population studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole population studies are currently performed either using astrophysically motivated models (informed but rigid in their functional forms) or via non-parametric methods (flexible but not directly interpretable). In this paper, we present a statistical framework to complement the predictive power of astrophysically motivated models with the flexibility of non-parametric methods. Our method makes use of the Dirichlet distribution to robustly infer the relative weights of different models as well as of the Gibbs sampling approach to efficiently explore the parameter space. After having validated our approach using simulated data, we apply this method to the BBH mergers observed during the first three Observing Runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration using both phenomenological and astrophysical models as parametric models, finding results in agreement with the currently available literature.</description>

      <title>The Terzina Payload on NUSES: Silicon Photomultipliers Performance and Radiation Damage Mitigation in Low Earth Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) are increasingly favored for detecting near-UV, visible, and infrared light in space due to their high sensitivity to single photons and compact design. While SiPMs offer several advantages over traditional photomultiplier tubes, their susceptibility to radiation and noise remains an issue. Our study intended to determine the optimal SiPM design for the Terzina Cherenkov satellite in sun-synchronous low Earth orbit (LEO) at an altitude of 550 km. To this end, we characterised several NUV-HD-MT SiPM variants, developed by Fondazione Bruno Kessler, and studied their responses to irradiation by exposing them to a 50 MeV proton beam and to electrons from the $\beta$-emitting source strontium-90. Experimental results were cross-validated with SPENVIS and Geant4 simulations. Based on our findings, we also propose an annealing strategy to mitigate radiation damage and ensure reliable performance in space-based applications.</description>

      <title>Experiences of Commercial Supercomputing in Radio Astronomy Data Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing exponential growth of computational power, and the growth of the commercial High Performance Computing (HPC) industry, has led to a point where ten commercial systems currently exceed the performance of the highest-used HPC system in radio astronomy in Australia, and one of these exceeds the expected requirements of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Science Data Processors.
  In order to explore implications of this emerging change in the HPC landscape for radio astronomy, we report results from a survey conducted via semi-structured interviews with 14 Australian scientists and providers with experience of commercial HPC in astronomy and similar data intensive fields. We supplement these data with learnings from two earlier studies in which we investigated the application of commercial HPC to radio astronomy data processing, using cases with very different data and processing considerations.
  We use the established qualitative research approach of thematic analysis to extract key messages from our interviews. We find that commercial HPC can provide major advantages in accessibility and availability, and may contribute to increasing researchers' career productivity. Significant barriers exist, however, including the need for access to increased expertise in systems programming and parallelisation, and a need for recognition in research funding. We comment on potential solutions to these issues.</description>

      <title>First Array-Wide Search for Diffuse UHE Neutrinos with the Askaryan Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrino detector at the South Pole, designed to search for radio pulses emitted by neutrino-initiated particle showers in ice. ARA consists of an array of five autonomous stations with 2 km spacing. Each station consists of 16 radio antennas embedded ${\sim}200$ m deep in the ice that are sensitive to either vertically- or horizontally-polarized signals. Radio arrays like ARA represent a cost-efficient means of achieving the enormous detection $O(10~\text{km}^3)$ volumes necessary for UHE neutrino detection. This contribution presents the current status of the first-ever array-wide search for UHE neutrinos, leveraging ARA's unprecedented ${\sim}28$ station-years of livetime. This search will have the best sensitivity of any neutrino detector above $3$ EeV, sufficient to probe the $220$ PeV flux inferred from KM3NeT's observation of KM3-230213A. Importantly, this study demonstrates the feasibility of array-wide neutrino searches, which are necessary for next-generation detectors, like RNO-G (35 stations planned) and IceCube-Gen2 Radio (361 stations proposed), to achieve their design sensitivity. We discuss the progress towards a fully analyzed sample and improvements to ARA's detector characterization and analysis sensitivity.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Simulations of the Full Askaryan Radio Array and its Sensitivity to Ultra-High Energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is a five-station, in-ice radio detector located at the South Pole searching for particle cascades from cosmogenic and astrophysical neutrinos with $\geq10^{17}$ eV of energy. Cascades in this energy regime emit radio-wavelength Askaryan radiation that can be observed by one or more ARA stations. With the recent KM3Net observation of an approximately $220$ PeV neutrino, there is renewed, urgent interest in further unlocking the ultra-high energy neutrino sky. We present updated calculations of ARA's array-wide effective volume, sensitivity, and expected event rates for ultra-high energy neutrino-induced cascades. Notably, results now account for the contributions of secondary particles from neutrino interactions (such as muon tracks) and multi-station detections within a detailed detector simulation framework. Previous work has shown these secondary interactions and multi-station coincidences compose 25\% and 8\% of the detector's effective area, respectively. We intend to extend these results towards a novel analysis that estimates the degree to which secondary cascades and multi-station observations are detectable in a real neutrino search. This will inform future UHE neutrino searches as it will characterize the feasibility of detecting such events.</description>

      <title>Measuring the locations and properties of VHF sources emitted from an aircraft flying through high clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to locate the few places on the body of an airplane, while it is flying through high clouds, from which broad-band, pulsed, radiation is emitted at Very High Frequency (VHF) radio frequencies. This serendipitous discovery was made whilst imaging a lightning flash using the Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR). This observation provides insights into the way the airplane sheds the electrical charge it acquires when flying through clouds. Furthermore, this observation allowed us to test and improve the precision and accuracy for our lightning observation techniques.
  Our new results indicate that with the improved procedure the location precision for strong pulses is better than 50~cm, with the orientation of linear polarization being accurate to within 25$^\circ$. For the present case of a Boeing 777-300ER, VHF emissions were observed exclusively associated with the two engines, as well as a specific spot on the tail. Despite the aircraft flying through clouds at an altitude of 8~km, we did not detect any emissions from electrostatic wicks.</description>

      <title>Direct Imaging for the Debris Disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the inner debris disk around $\epsilon$ Eridani using simulated observations with the Cool-Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C). Using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, we generate synthetic scattered-light images and spectral energy distributions for three disk models that differ in inclination and radial extent, and compare these results with the anticipated performance of CPI-C. CPI-C can resolve disk structures down to $\sim$3 au, offering substantially finer spatial resolution than existing HST/STIS and Spitzer/IRS observations. Recovered inclinations and radial extents closely match the input models, constraining the disk geometry and informing potential planet-disk interactions in the $\epsilon$ Eri system. Although the cold Jupiter-like planet $\epsilon$ Eri b is not detected in our simulations, polarimetric methods may enable detection of its reflected light. These results highlight the capability of next-generation coronagraphs to probe cold dust in nearby planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Artificial Satellite Trails Detection Using U-Net Deep Neural Network and Line Segment Detector Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid increase in the number of artificial satellites, astronomical imaging is experiencing growing interference. When these satellites reflect sunlight, they produce streak-like artifacts in photometry images. Such satellite trails can introduce false sources and cause significant photometric errors. As a result, accurately identifying the positions of satellite trails in observational data has become essential. In this work, we propose a satellite trail detection model that combines the U-Net deep neural network for image segmentation with the Line Segment Detector (LSD) algorithm. The model is trained on 375 simulated images of satellite trails, generated using data from the Mini-SiTian Array. Experimental results show that for trails with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3, the detection rate exceeds 99. Additionally, when applied to real observational data from the Mini-SiTian Array, the model achieves a recall of 79.57 and a precision of 74.56.</description>

      <title>Zonal winds in Titan's middle atmosphere from a stellar occultation observed with Keck adaptive optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved Keck/NIRC2 images of a stellar occultation by Titan on September 5, 2022 and compare them to predictions from concurrent ALMA observations and a suite of General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations. ALMA data and GCM simulations can predict middle atmosphere zonal wind distributions, which in turn produce diagnostic occultation image sequences. We construct an occultation forward model using the temperature profile measured by the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument, which is then distorted using latitudinal zonal wind profiles from the ALMA data or GCM simulations. The occultation forward model yields simulated light distributions around Titan's limb, which we compare directly to the light distributions observed during the occultation. The GCM zonal wind profile corresponding to slightly before the time of the stellar occultation provides the best overall match to the data. The ALMA wind profile provides the best match to the occultation data when only the ingress data were considered, but is not the best match when data from ingress and egress are combined. Our data support the presence of stronger winds in the southern hemisphere during late northern summer.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Solar-Terrestrial Plasma and Magnetic Field on the Detection of Space-borne Gravitational Wave Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detections raise new questions for heliophysics: how the Sun-Terrestrial space environment affect gravitational wave detection, and to what extent? Space-borne gravitational wave detectors use laser interferometry to measure displacement variations between two free test masses caused by gravitational waves. Space-borne gravitational wave detectors require extremely high measurement accuracy, making it necessary to take into account the effects of space plasma and magnetic field. On one hand, laser propagation through space plasma can induce optical path difference noise, affecting distance measurement accuracy. On the other hand, interactions between space magnetic field and the test masses can generate acceleration noise. This review introduces studies on laser propagation noise and space magnetic acceleration noise in space gravitational wave detection. And this review presents a method, time-delay interferometry, to suppress laser propagation noise.</description>

      <title>An Initial Assessment of the Hanle Echelle Spectrograph for Exoplanet Atmosphere Studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is an effective technique for probing exoplanetary atmospheres. While most observations have relied on space facilities such as HST and JWST, ground-based high-resolution transmission spectroscopy (HRTS) has also provided valuable insights by resolving individual atomic features. In this work, we present an initial performance assessment and feasibility test of the Hanle Echelle Spectrograph (HESP) on the 2 m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) for HRTS. As a benchmark, we observed the hot Jupiter HD 209458b during a single transit at a resolution of R = 30,000. We developed a Python-based, semi-automated data reduction and analysis pipeline that includes corrections for telluric contamination and stellar radial velocity shifts. The final achieved signal-to-noise ratio and spectral stability allow us to probe for features at the 0.1% level. This work establishes a methodology and demonstrates the operational capability of the HESP-HCT for obtaining high-resolution transmission spectra.</description>

      <title>Role of sunspot latitude versus tilt in determining the polar field and amplitude of the next cycle: Cause of the weak Solar Cycle 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One prominent feature of solar cycle is its irregular variation in its cycle strength, making it challenging to predict the amplitude of the next cycle. Studies show that fluctuations and nonlinearity in generating poloidal field throughout the decay and dispersal of tilted sunspots produce variation in the solar cycle. The flux, latitudinal position, and tilt angle of sunspots are the primary parameters that determine the polar field and, thus, the next solar cycle strength. By analysing the observed sunspots and polar field proxy, we show that the nonlinearity in the poloidal field generation becomes important for strong cycles. Except for strong cycles, we can reasonably predict the polar field at the end of the cycle (and thus the next cycle strength) using the total sunspot area alone. Combining the mean tilt angle and latitude positions with the sunspot area, we can predict the polar field of Cycles 15 -- 24 (or the amplitude of sunspot Cycles 16-25) with reasonable accuracy except for Cycle 23 for which the average tilt angle cannot predict the polar field. For Cycles 15--22, we show that the average tilt angle variation dominates over the latitude variation in determining the polar field of a cycle. In particular, the reduction of tilt in Cycle 19 was the primary cause of the following weak cycle (Cycle 20). Thus, we conclude that tilt quenching is essential in regulating the solar cycle strength in the solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Backtracking Bipolar Magnetic Regions to their emergence: Two groups and their implication in the tilt measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipolar Magnetic Regions (BMRs) that appear on the solar photosphere are surface manifestations of the solar internal magnetic field. With modern observations and continuous data streams, the study of BMRs has moved from manual sunspot catalogs to automated detection and tracking methods. In this work, we present an additional module to the existing BMR tracking algorithm, AutoTAB, that focuses on identifying emerging signatures of BMRs. Specifically, for regions newly detected on the solar disk, this module backtracks the BMRs to their point of emergence. From a total of about 12000 BMRs identified by AutoTAB, we successfully backtracked 3080 cases. Within this backtracked sample, we find two distinct populations. One group shows the expected behaviour of emerging regions, in which the magnetic flux increases significantly during the emerging phase. The other group consists of BMRs whose flux, however, does not exhibit substantial growth during their evolution. We classify these as non-emerging BMRs and examine their statistical properties separately. Our analysis shows that these non-emerging BMRs do not display any preferred tilt angle distribution nor show systematic latitudinal tilt dependence, in contrast to the trends typically associated with emerging BMRs. This indicates that including such regions in statistical studies of BMR properties can distort or mask the underlying physical characteristics. We therefore emphasise the importance of excluding the non-emerging population from the whole dataset when analysing the statistical behaviour of BMRs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Noise Reduction in the Space-based Gravitational Wave Antenna DECIGO Using Optical Springs and Homodyne Detection scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO) is a planned space-based, next-generation gravitational wave detector aimed at observing primordial gravitational waves originating form cosmic inflation. This work focuses on reducing the quantum noise, in the instrument's observation band of 0.1 to 10 Hz, by employing optical springs and a homodyne detection scheme. Although detuning 1000\,km long arm cavities was previously considered ineffective due to quantum state degradation from diffraction losses, we revisit this problem by formulating a new, rigorous model for quantum state of light by accounting for the vacuum state mixing as a result of diffraction losses. This work shows that high sensitivities can be achieved by employing optimal configurations of optical springs and homodyne detection schemes even with diffraction losses. These improvements alone are still not sufficient to achieve sensitivities to detect primordial gravitational waves as other technical noises limit further improvement.</description>

      <title>Methods for statistical detection of GRBs in the context of the LST-CTAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) afterglows are rapidly decaying signals that pose significant detection challenges, requiring improved methods to track their temporal evolution. In this study, we systematically compare various techniques for detecting GRB-like transient emissions at very high energies (VHE, &gt;100 GeV). Our analysis includes time-dependent extension of the standard method (i.e., Li &amp; Ma 1983) and other previously developed methods in the literature, alongside a novel likelihood-based approach, which directly fits spectral and temporal decay features to IACT data. Through dedicated observation simulations, we evaluate the performance of these methods for the Large-Sized Telescope prototype (LST-1) of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We characterised the enhanced sensitivity found in some of these methods compared to the standard significance estimation. For GRBs simulated with very fast afterglow decay, an improvement of more than a factor of two is seen in detections for some of the methods presented here, compared to the standard Li&amp;Ma approach.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy neutrino detection with radio antennas in the ground-based observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy (UHE) neutrinos are unique cosmic messengers that can traverse cosmological distances unattenuated, offering direct insight into the most energetic processes in the universe. Radio detection promises significant advantages for detecting highly inclined air showers induced by UHE neutrinos, including a larger exposure range compared to particle detectors, which is due to minimal atmospheric attenuation of radio signals combined with good reconstruction precision. Furthermore, this technique improves the air shower longitudinal reconstruction, which can be used to identify neutrinos with their first interaction far below the top of the atmosphere. In this work, we present a method for identifying UHE neutrinos using radio antennas deployed in ground-based observatories. We introduce a reconstruction algorithm based on the radio emission maximum ($X^{\text{radio}}_{\text{max}}$) and demonstrate its power in distinguishing deeply developing neutrino-induced showers from background cosmic rays. Using the Pierre Auger Observatory as a case study, we use the simulations of $\nu_e$-CC-induced air showers and evaluate the trigger efficiency, reconstruction performance, and resulting effective area. Our results show that radio detection significantly enhances the sensitivity to very inclined showers above 1~EeV, complementing traditional surface detectors. This technique is highly scalable and applicable to future radio observatories such as GRAND. The proposed reconstruction and identification strategy provides a pathway toward achieving the sensitivity needed to detect UHE neutrinos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RAVEN, a newly developed vetting and validation pipeline for TESS exoplanet candidates. The pipeline employs a Bayesian framework to derive the posterior probability of a candidate being a planet against a set of False Positive (FP) scenarios, through the use of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree and a Gaussian Process classifier, trained on comprehensive synthetic training sets of simulated planets and 8 astrophysical FP scenarios injected into TESS lightcurves. These training sets allow large scale candidate vetting and performance verification against individual FP scenarios. A Non-Simulated FP training set consisting of real TESS candidates caused primarily by stellar variability and systematic noise is also included. The machine learning derived probabilities are combined with scenario specific prior probabilities, including the candidates' positional probabilities, to compute the final posterior probabilities. Candidates with a planetary posterior probability greater than 99% against each FP scenario and whose implied planetary radius is less than 8$R_{\oplus}$ are considered to be statistically validated by the pipeline. In this first version, the pipeline has been developed for candidates with a lightcurve released from the TESS Science Processing Operations Centre, an orbital period between 0.5 and 16 days and a transit depth greater than 300ppm. The pipeline obtained area-under-curve (AUC) scores &gt; 97% on all FP scenarios and &gt; 99% on all but one. Testing on an independent external sample of 1361 pre-classified TOIs, the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 91%, demonstrating its effectiveness for automated ranking of TESS candidates. For a probability threshold of 0.9 the pipeline reached a precision of 97% with a recall score of 66% on these TOIs. The RAVEN pipeline is publicly released as a cloud-hosted app, making it easily accessible to the community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a conceptual design for a fiber positioning system for multi-object high-resolution spectroscopy, designed to be compatible with the upcoming large telescopes with a wide field of view. The design incorporates multiple Atmospheric Dispersion Correctors (ADCs) and tip-tilt mirrors that receive non-telecentric input from individual targets and direct it to the ADCs. Here, we introduce a mechanical design for the fiber positioner that accommodates the optics and operates in a curved focal plane with a Radius of Curvature (R) of 3m. This mechanical design provides four degrees of freedom to access the focal volume, enhancing targeting efficiency. The proposed design and an efficient target allocation algorithm ensure a targeting efficiency of approximately 80-100% for a primary observation session. We also present a methodology for target assignment, positioning, and quantification based on sequential and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms. This method has been tested on realistic fields with varying target densities to validate its performance.</description>

      <title>Combined Annual Modulation Dark Matter Search with COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The annual modulation signal, claimed to be consistent with dark matter as observed by DAMA/LIBRA in a sodium-iodide based detector, has persisted for over two decades. COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112 were designed to test the claim directly using the same target material. COSINE-100, located at Yangyang Underground Laboratory in South Korea, and ANAIS-112, located at Canfranc Underground Laboratory in Spain, have been taking data since 2016 and 2017, respectively. Each experiment published its respective results independently. In this paper, we present the results of an annual modulation search as a test of the signal observed by DAMA/LIBRA with the first three respective years of data from COSINE-100 and ANAIS-112. Using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we find best fit values for modulation amplitude of $-0.0002 {\pm} 0.0026$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0021 {\pm} 0.0028$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions. These results are not compatible with DAMA/LIBRA's assertion for their observation of annual modulation at $3.7{\sigma}$ and $2.6{\sigma}$, respectively. Performing a simple combination of the newly released 6-years datasets from both experiments find values consistent with no modulation at $0.0005 {\pm} 0.0019$ cpd/kg/keV in the 1-6 keV and $0.0027 {\pm} 0.0021$ cpd/kg/keV in the 2-6 keV energy regions with $4.68{\sigma}$ and $3.53{\sigma}$ respective exclusions of the DAMA/LIBRA signal.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04618v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) is an upcoming Stage-IV sky survey telescope, distinguished by its large field of view (FoV), high image quality, and multi-band observation capabilities. It can simultaneously conduct precise measurements of the Universe by performing multi-color photometric imaging and slitless spectroscopic surveys. The CSST is equipped with five scientific instruments, i.e. Multi-band Imaging and Slitless Spectroscopy Survey Camera (SC), Multi-Channel Imager (MCI), Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS), Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C), and THz Spectrometer (TS). Using these instruments, CSST is expected to make significant contributions and discoveries across various astronomical fields, including cosmology, galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN), the Milky Way and nearby galaxies, stars, exoplanets, Solar System objects, astrometry, and transients and variable sources. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the CSST instruments, observational capabilities, data products, and scientific potential.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-driven conservative-to-primitive conversion in hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel machine learning (ML) method to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding techniques are computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale relativistic hydrodynamics simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss. The NNC2PS model achieves $ L_1 $ and $ L_\infty $ errors of $ 4.54 \times 10^{-7} $ and $ 3.44 \times 10^{-6} $, respectively, while the NNC2PL model exhibits even lower error values. TensorRT optimization with mixed-precision deployment substantially accelerates performance compared to traditional root-finding methods. Specifically, the mixed-precision TensorRT engine for NNC2PS achieves inference speeds approximately 400 times faster than a traditional single-threaded CPU implementation for a dataset size of 1,000,000 points. Ideal parallelization across an entire compute node in the Delta supercomputer (Dual AMD 64 core 2.45 GHz Milan processors; and 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB HBM2 RAM and NVLink) predicts a 25-fold speedup for TensorRT over an optimally-parallelized numerical method when processing 8 million data points. Moreover, the ML method exhibits sub-linear scaling with increasing dataset sizes. We release the scientific software developed, enabling further validation and extension of our findings. This work underscores the potential of ML, combined with GPU optimization and model quantization, to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Metallicities from High-Resolution TRES Spectra with uberMS: Performance Benchmarks and Literature Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the field of exoplanetary astronomy has matured, demand has grown for precise stellar abundances to probe subtle correlations between stellar compositions and planetary demographics. However, drawing population-level conclusions from the disparate measurements in the literature is challenging, with various groups measuring metallicities using bespoke codes with differing line lists, radiative transfer models, and other assumptions. Homogeneous analyses are thus critical. Here we use the neural-net framework uberMS to measure iron abundances and alpha enrichments from high-resolution optical spectra observed by the Tillinghast Reflector Echelle Spectrograph (TRES), a key resource used for the follow-up of candidate exoplanet hosts. To contextualize these measurements and benchmark our method's performance, we compare to external constraints on metallicity using the Hyades cluster, wide binaries, and asteroids, to external constraints on $T_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ using stars with interferometric radii, and to the results of other abundance measurement methods using overlap samples with the APOGEE and SPOCS catalogs, as well as by applying the SPC method directly to TRES spectra. We find that TRES-uberMS provides reliable parameter estimates with errors of roughly 100 K in $T_{\rm eff}$, 0.09 dex in $\log g$, and 0.04 dex in [Fe/H] for many nearby dwarf stars, although [Fe/H] performance is poorer for mid-to-late K dwarfs, with the bias worsening with decreasing $T_{\rm eff}$. Performance is also worse for evolved stars. For [$\alpha$/Fe], our error may be as good as 0.03 dex for dwarfs based on external benchmarks, despite sizable and variable systematic differences when comparing with specific alpha-element abundances from other catalogs.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Relativistic Time Scales for Cislunar Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified post-Newtonian framework for relativistic timing and coordinate transformations covering six time scales (TCB, TCG, TT, TDB, TCL, TL) and three reference systems (BCRS, GCRS, LCRS). Extending the IAU conventions, we define a Lunicentric Celestial Reference System (LCRS) metric that retains all contributions above a fractional threshold of 5 x 10^{-18} and timing terms above 0.1 ps by expanding the lunar gravity field to spherical-harmonic degree l=9 with Love number variations and including external tidal and inertial multipoles to the octupole. We derive closed-form mappings among TCB, TCG, TT, TCL and TL, yielding proper-to-coordinate time transformations and two-way time-transfer corrections at sub-picosecond accuracy. We evaluate secular rate constants and periodic perturbations arising from kinematic dilation, lunar monopole and multipoles, Earth tides and gravitomagnetic effects for clocks on the lunar surface, in very low and low lunar orbits (vLLO/LLO), in elliptical lunar frozen orbits (ELFOs), at the Earth-Moon L1 point, and in near-rectilinear halo orbits (NRHOs). Our analysis demonstrates that harmonics through l=9 and tides through l=8 are sufficient to achieve 5 x 10^{-18} fractional stability for deep cislunar regimes (e.g., NRHO, Earth-Moon L1), supporting sub-picosecond clock synchronization and centimeter-level navigation; near-surface and vLLO realizations generally require a much higher spherical-harmonic degree, l_max &gt;= 300, to meet the same stability goal. This framework underpins high-precision time and frequency transfer, relativistic geodesy, quantum communication links and fundamental physics experiments beyond low Earth orbit.</description>
