      <title>Probing Tensor Monopoles and Gerbe Invariants in Three-Dimensional Topological Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that momentum-space tensor monopoles corresponding to nontrivial vector bundle generalizations, known as bundle gerbes, can be realized in bands of three-dimensional topological matter with nontrivial Hopf invariants. We provide a universal construction of tensor Berry connections in these topological phases, demonstrating how obstructions therein lead to $\mathbb{Z}$-quantized bulk magnetoelectric and nonlinear optical phenomena. We then pinpoint that these quantum effects are supported by intraband and interband torsion leading to nontrivial Dixmier-Douady classes in most known Hopf phases and in more general topological insulators realizing gerbe invariants falling beyond the tenfold classification of topological phases of matter. We furthermore provide an interacting generalization upon introducing many-body gerbe invariants by employing twisted boundary conditions. This opens an avenue to study gerbe invariants realized through higher-dimensional charge fractionalizations that can be electromagnetically probed.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Faraday Rotation Probe of Chiral Phonon-Polaritons in LiNbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time reversal symmetry breaking motion of chiral phonon-polaritons in LiNbO3 is probed via the ultrafast Faraday effect. By combining a pair of perpendicularly polarized THz pulses with the right relative delay, we create a chiral THz driving field to excite chiral phonon-polaritons. The chiral atomic motion combines with the inverse Faraday effect from the circularly polarized THz pump to induce a magnetic moment field in the nonmagnetic material, LiNbO3. We attempt to quantify the strength of the magnetic field with Faraday rotation probe measurements. The direction of the Faraday signal flips when the input THz pulse is changed from left- to right-circular polarization, and we estimate a strong induced magnetic field strength of ~11 Tesla based on the Faraday rotation.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Magnetism in Gd$_2$B$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis of single crystals of Gd$_2$B$_5$ through a ruthenium-gadolinium flux method. The Gd$_2$B$_5$ system is a member of the monoclinic $P21/c$ (No. 14) space group and realizes lattices of gadolinium atoms in the $(1\,0\,0)$ plane. We characterized the sample through orientation-dependent electrical transport, magnetization, magnetic torque, and heat capacity measurements to probe the magnetic anisotropy of the system and map out its phase diagram. Gd$_2$B$_5$ realizes two zero-field ordered phases M$_1$ and M$_2$, as well as a third field-induced ordered phase M$_\perp$ arising when the magnetic field is applied in the $(1\,0\,0)$ plane.</description>

      <title>Universal Magnetic Phases in Twisted Bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) has emerged as a robust platform for exploring correlated topological phases, notably supporting fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states at zero magnetic field across a wide range of twist angles. The evolution of magnetism and topology with twist angle remains an open question. Here, we systematically map the magnetic phase diagram of tMoTe$_2$ using local optical spectroscopy and scanning nanoSQUID-on-tip (nSOT) magnetometry. We identify spontaneous ferromagnetism at moir\'e filling factors $\nu = -1$ and $-3$ over a twist angle range from 2.1$^\circ$ to 3.7$^\circ$, revealing a universal, twist-angle-insensitive ferromagnetic phase. At 2.1$^\circ$, we further observe robust ferromagnetism at $\nu = -5$, absent in the devices with larger twist angle -- a signature of the flattening of higher bands in this twist angle range. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal a contrasting twist-angle dependence of the Curie temperatures between $\nu = -1$ and $\nu = -3$, indicating distinct interplay between exchange interaction and bandwidth for the two Chern bands. Despite spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking, we find no evidence of a topological gap at $\nu = -3$; however, fragile correlated topological phases could be obscured by the device disorder evident in our spatially resolved measurements. Our results establish a global framework for understanding and controlling magnetic order in tMoTe$_2$ and highlight its potential for accessing correlated topological phases in higher energy Chern band.</description>

      <title>Thermal Hall effect induced by phonon skew-scattering via orbital magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transport acts as a powerful tool for studying the excitations and physical properties of insulators, where a charge gap suppresses electronic conduction. Recently, the thermal Hall effect has been observed across various materials, including insulators and semiconductors, but its fundamental origin remains unclear. Here, I propose a promising mechanism to explain the emergence of the thermal Hall effect in these systems: axial chiral phonon skew scattering mediated by orbital magnetization. Starting from basic principles, I derive the form and magnitude of the orbital magnetization-phonon coupling using the well-established Haldane model. Using this coupling, I calculate the thermal Hall conductivity and Hall angle as functions of temperature, achieving semi-quantitative agreement with experimental findings. This work enhances our understanding of the role of electron-phonon coupling in thermal transport and provides a pathway to tailor thermal properties in a broad range of materials.</description>

      <title>Collective Fluorescence of Graphene Quantum Dots on a Halide Perovskite Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamical collective fluorescence of $C_{96}tBu_8$ graphene quantum dots when deposited on the surface of monocrystalline halide perovskite. Despite the tendency of the graphene quantum dots to avoid aggregation in solution and polymer matrices, our findings reveal distinct collective behaviors when deposited on the perovskite surface, here $CH_3NH_3PbBr_3$. We observed small clusters of graphene quantum dots rather than isolated single molecules through confocal fluorescence microscopy. Spectral analysis under continuous illumination shows a back-and-forth dynamical transition between an uncoupled, monomer-like state and a coupled state with a redshifted emission. In some cases, this dynamical process is followed by a drastic one-way increase in fluorescence intensity combined with a shortening of the excited state lifetime, which could characterize the emission of ordered graphene quantum dots within aggregates.</description>

      <title>Strain-Controlled Topological Phase Transitions and Chern Number Reversal in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical and first-principles study of a two-dimensional altermagnet exhibiting spin-valley locking and strain-tunable topological phases. By constructing a minimal tight-binding model constrained by altermagnetic symmetry, we show that biaxial strain can drive a transition from a trivial insulator to a type-II quantum spin Hall (QSH) phase. Furthermore, we derive an analytical strain-induced perturbation theory that identifies two critical curves, dividing the phase space into four regions corresponding to a trivial insulator, a type-II QSH phase, and two quantum anomalous Hall phases with opposite Chern numbers. Remarkably, the Chern number can be reversed purely by changing the strain direction --without modifying magnetization or applying magnetic fields. The model reveals a universal phase diagram for materials with the same symmetry and valley structure. First-principles calculations on monolayer CrO confirm the predicted topological transitions, establishing strain engineering as an effective route for topological control in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Lattice tuning of charge and spin transport in $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice vibrations critically shape charge and spin transport by governing carrier scattering, spin-charge interactions and spectral redistribution in nanostructures. In this study, we investigate how electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and structural configurations intertwine in magnetic and nonmagnetic $\beta_{12}$-borophene nanoribbons (BNRs). Using a tight-binding framework with site-dependent hopping parameters extracted from ab initio calculations and incorporating phonons within the Holstein model, we compute phonon-renormalized Green's functions and transport currents via the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism. We find that spin-dependent EPC enhances spin-dependent current in magnetic zigzag (ZZ) nanoribbons, driven by phonon-induced inelastic scattering and spin-selective band renormalization. Additionally, we observe an enhancement of charge transport current in the nonmagnetic configurations of $\beta_{12}$-BNRs. Structural variations further induce anisotropic EPC effects, significantly reshaping charge and spin transport. These insights establish EPC as a powerful design lever for optimizing borophene-based logic devices through tailored edge engineering.</description>

      <title>Quantum siphoning of finely spaced interlayer excitons in reconstructed MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic reconstruction in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterostructures leads to mesoscopic domains with uniform atomic registry, profoundly altering the local potential landscape. While interlayer excitons in these domains exhibit strong many-body interactions, extent and impact of quantum confinement on their dynamics remains unclear. Here, we reveal that quantum confinement persists in these flat, reconstructed regions. Time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy uncovers multiple, finely-spaced interlayer exciton states (~ 1 meV separation), and correlated emission lifetimes spanning sub-nanosecond to over 100 nanoseconds across a 10 meV energy window. Cascade-like transitions confirm that these states originate from a single potential well, further supported by calculations. Remarkably, at high excitation rates, we observe transient suppression of emission followed by gradual recovery, a process we term "quantum siphoning". Our results demonstrate that quantum confinement and competing nonlinear dynamics persist beyond the ideal moire paradigm, potentially enabling applications in quantum sensing and modifying exciton dynamics via strain engineering.</description>

      <title>Random matrix theory of charge distribution in disordered quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a bare-bone random matrix quantum impurity model, by hybridizing a localized spinless electronic level with a bath of random fermions in the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). While stripped out of correlations effects, this model reproduces some salient features of the impurity charge distribution obtained in previous works on interacting disordered impurity models. Computing by numerical sampling the impurity charge distribution in our model, we find a crossover from a Gaussian distribution (centered on half a charge unit) at large hybridization, to a bimodal distribution (centered both on zero and full occupations of the charge) at small hybridization. In the bimodal regime, a universal $(-3/2)$ power-law is also observed. All these findings are very well accounted for by an analytic surmise computed with a single random electron level in the bath. We also derive an exact functional integral for the general probability distribution function of eigenvalues and eigenstates, that formally captures the statistical behavior of our model for any number $N$ of fermionic orbitals in the bath. In the Gaussian regime and in the limit $N\to\infty$, we are able to solve exactly the random matrix theory (RMT) for the charge distribution, obtaining perfect agreement with the numerics. Our results could be tested experimentally in mesoscopic devices, for instance by coupling a small quantum dot to a chaotic electronic reservoir, and using a quantum point contact as local charge sensor for the quantum dot occupation.</description>

Abstract: We report the tip-induced generation and scanning probe characterization of a singlet diradicaloid, consisting of two phenalenyl units connected by an sp-hybridized C$_{4}$ chain, on an ultrathin insulating NaCl surface. The bond-order contrast along the C$_{4}$ chain measured by atomic force microscopy and mapping of charge-state transitions by scanning tunneling microscopy, in conjunction with multiconfigurational calculations, reveal that the molecule exhibits a many-body ground state. Our study experimentally demonstrates the manifestation of strong electronic correlations in the geometric and electronic structures of a single molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in circuit quantum electrodynamics have enabled the generation of arbitrary nonclassical microwave states and paved the way for addressing novel physics questions. Here, we present a theoretical study of the electrical current in a Josephson tunnel junction interacting with a nonclassical electromagnetic environment. This allows us to generalize classical transport phenomena like photon-assisted tunneling and Shapiro steps to the quantum regime. We predict that the analysis of the supercurrent in such a setup enables the complete reconstruction of quantum states of the electromagnetic environment, something that is not possible with normal tunnel junctions.</description>

      <title>Unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring topological matters with exotic quantum states can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single $d$-dimensional ($d$D) system. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Remarkably, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and firstly discover a $3$D unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both second-order (helical) and third-order (corner) topological states in one band gap and exhibits a novel bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Particularly, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Floquet Spin Splitting and Spin Generation in Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In antiferromagnetic spintronics, accessing the spin degree of freedom is essential for generating spin currents and manipulating magnetic order, which generally requires lifting spin degeneracy. This is typically achieved through relativistic spin-orbit coupling or non-relativistic spin splitting in altermagnets. Here, we propose an alternative approach: a dynamical spin splitting induced by an optical field in antiferromagnets. By coupling the driven system to a thermal bath, we demonstrate the emergence of steady-state pure spin currents, as well as linear-response longitudinal and transverse spin currents. Crucially, thermal bath engineering allows the generation of a net spin accumulation without relying on spin-orbit coupling. Our results provide a broadly applicable and experimentally tunable route to control spins in antiferromagnets, offering new opportunities for spin generation and manipulation in antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Chiral Wigner crystal phases induced by Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the impact of Berry phase on the Wigner crystal (WC) state of a two-dimensional electron system. We consider first a model of Bernal bilayer graphene with a perpendicular displacement field, and we show that Berry curvature leads to a new kind of WC state in which the electrons acquire a spontaneous orbital angular momentum when the displacement field exceeds a critical value. We determine the phase boundary of the WC state in terms of electron density and displacement field at low temperature. We then derive the general effective Hamiltonian that governs the ordering of the physical electron spin. We show that this Hamiltonian includes a chiral term that can drive the system into chiral spin-density wave or spin liquid phases. The phenomena we discuss are relevant for the valley-polarized Wigner crystal phases observed in multilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>calcQPI: A versatile tool to simulate quasiparticle interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</description>

      <title>Fragmented exceptional points and their bulk and edge realizations in lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are spectral defects displayed by non-Hermitian systems in which multiple degenerate eigenvalues share a single eigenvector. This distinctive feature makes systems exhibiting EPs more sensitive to external perturbations than their Hermitian counterparts, where degeneracies are nondefective diabolic points. In contrast to these widely studied cases, more complex non-Hermitian degeneracies in which the eigenvectors are only partially degenerate are poorly understood. Here, we characterize these fragmented exceptional points (FEPs) systematically from a physical perspective, and demonstrate how they can be induced into the bulk and edge spectrum of two-dimensional and three-dimensional lattice models, exemplified by non-Hermitian versions of a Lieb lattice and a higher-order topological Dirac semimetal. The design of the systems is facilitated by an efficient algebraic approach within which we provide precise conditions for FEPs that can be evaluated directly from a given model Hamiltonian. The free design of FEPs significantly opens up a new frontier for non-Hermitian physics and expands the scope for designing systems with unconventional response characteristics.</description>

      <title>Strain effects on the fluctuation properties in noncollinear antiferromagnets: a first-principles and macrospin-based study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of epitaxial strain effects on the magnetic fluctuation properties of Mn$_3$Sn noncollinear antiferromagnets. Employing density functional theory (DFT), we uncover significant strain-induced modifications to key magnetic parameters, including magnetic anisotropy and both bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions. Our findings reveal that the biquadratic exchange, often neglected, plays a crucial role in defining the magnetic energy landscape and its response to strain. These microscopic changes directly impact the energy barriers governing magnetic switching, thereby influencing thermal stability and fluctuation rates. Using macrospin-based simulations based on DFT-derived parameters, we provide a quantitative analysis of the macroscopic magnetic fluctuations influenced by these microscopic interactions. These insights are particularly relevant for applications requiring precisely controlled magnetic behavior, such as hardware for probabilistic computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a refraction law for superconducting vortices at superconductor/normal metal interfaces. Simulations of the proximity effect under tilted geometries confirm this law and reveal vortex trapping for low effective mass. Under transport currents, we find core displacements due to differing vortex viscosities in the superconductor and normal metal. These results clarify vortex dynamics in proximity-coupled systems and offer design principles for high-current coated superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional spin texture driven by higher-order spin-orbit interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin splitting and the resulting spin texture are central to emerging spintronic applications. In non-centrosymmetric non-magnetic materials containing heavy elements, spin textures are typically governed by low-order, momentum-dependent spin-orbit interactions, such as Rashba spin-orbit interaction with linear or cubic order in crystal momentum. In this work, we use \textit{ab initio} calculations to reveal a previously unidentified spin texture in the conduction bands of a prototypical ferroelectric nitride LaWN$_3$. In addition to the usual $\Gamma$-centered vortex, we find six new vortices and anti-vortices located at non-high-symmetry points near the Brillouin zone center. Furthermore, by combining group-theoretical analysis and $\textbf{k}\cdot\textbf{p}$ perturbation modeling, we show that, constrained by the $C_{3v}$ point group to which ferroelectric LaWN$_3$ belongs, a 7th-order Weyl spin-orbit interaction is essential to reproduce the unconventional spin structure observed in first-principles calculations. We also find that weak electron doping of LaWN$_3$ leads to a Fermi surface whose spin-arrow contour exhibits an unusual epicycloid pattern--a distinctive signature that is experimentally accessible. Our work demonstrates that higher-order spin-orbit interactions are more than perturbative corrections. They can play a dominant role in shaping the spin texture of non-centrosymmetric materials. Our results open up new avenues for designing spintronic devices that exploit multi-chiral spin textures beyond the conventional spin-orbit paradigm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to its superconducting properties, Niobium (Nb) is an excellent candidate material for superconducting electronics and applications in quantum technology. Here we perform scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy experiments on Nb films covered by a thin gold (Au) film. We investigate the minigap structure of the proximitized region and provide evidence for a highly transparent interface between Nb and Au, beneficial for device applications. Imaging of Abrikosov vortices in presence of a perpendicular magnetic field is reported. The data show vortex pinning by the granular structure of the polycrystalline Au film. Our results show robust and homogeneous superconducting properties of thin Nb film in the presence of a gold capping layer. The Au film not only protects the Nb from surface oxidation but also preserves its excellent superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Optically Actuated Transitions in Multimodal, Bistable Micromechanical Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a new class of optomechanical nonlinearities in weakly damped micromechanical resonators, arising from the interplay between the Duffing nonlinearity, intermodal coupling, and thermal fluctuations. Within the bistable regime of a single Duffing mode driven by radiation pressure forces, we observe stochastically generated sidebands, originating from thermal fluctuations around equilibrium trajectories in phase space, and exploit these sidebands to induce probabilistic transitions between bistable states using weak secondary acoustic excitation. Extending this framework to multimodal interactions, we show that nonlinear modes coupling within the same resonator leads to similar transitions due to parametric modulation around the noise-excited sidebands as a result of frequency mixing. Simultaneously, abrupt changes in displacements of modes cause their instantaneous energy exchange rates to span five orders of magnitude. These findings open new avenues for reconfigurable optomechanical networks, nonreciprocal energy transport, and precision sensing based on dynamically tunable mechanical nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Cation Engineering of Cu-Doped CsPbI3: Lead Substitution and Dimensional Reduction for Improved Scintillation Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystals show promising contributions in emerging luminescent materials due to their high tolerance to defects. In particular, the development of cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) has shown its efficiency for light-harvesting properties. However, further implementation is hindered due to the toxicity of the lead content. Therefore, in this study, we introduced Cu atoms to partially substitute Pb atoms (5% Cu) in the CsPbI3 lattice as a solution to reduce Pb toxicity. A partial lead material is substituted using Cu displays a larger Stokes shift (-67 nm) compared to the pristine, and resulted doped CsPbI3 not undergo the undesired self absorption. An outcome is focused on the champion of fast-component (tau_1) decay time ~0.6 ns. Temperature-dependent radioluminescence outlines an incremental change in the emission intensity is marginally centered at 713 +- 16 nm, which indicates Cu-doped CsPbI3 is not greatly affected by temperature. In addition, we report that the light yield (LY) pristine CsPbI3 after doping is increased to 3.0 +- 0.8 photons/keV. Our work provides physical insights into a tunable scintillation property using transition metal doping toward lead-free based scintillating perovskites.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Benchmarking of Remote Excitation in Plasmonic Sensing with Enhanced Signal-to-Noise Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote excitation using guided optical modes -- such as waveguides, fibers, or surface waves -- offers a promising alternative to direct optical excitation for surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), particularly in applications requiring reduced heating, minimal invasiveness, and on-chip integration. However, despite its widespread use, systematic comparisons between remote and direct excitation remain limited. Here, we quantitatively benchmark both schemes by measuring power-dependent SERS responses from individual plasmonic nanogaps. We statistically analyze the maximum achievable SERS intensity before structural degradation, extract local temperatures, and evaluate signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Our findings reveal that both remote and direct SERS share a common electric-field limit, despite exhibiting different levels of heating. This suggests that spectral evolution is primarily governed by the local electric field, which drives nanoscale atomic migration rather than excessive heating. Nonetheless, the lower heating associated with remote excitation enhances the Raman SNR by approximately 30%, improving measurement quality without compromising signal strength. This study establishes a quantitative framework for evaluating excitation strategies in plasmonic sensing, and challenges common assumptions about the role of heating in nanostructural stability under strong optical excitation.</description>

Abstract: We show that Yb(trensal) molecular nanomagnet, embedding an electronic spin qubit coupled to a nuclear spin qudit, provides an ideal platform to probe entanglement in a qubit-qudit system.This is demonstrated by developing an optimized pulse sequence to show violation of generalized Bell inequalities and by performing realistic numerical simulations including experimentally measured decoherence. We find that the inequalities are safely violated in a wide range of parameters, proving the robustness of entanglement in the investigated system. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to study qudit-qudit entanglement on a molecular spin trimer, in which two spins 3/2 are linked via an interposed switch to turn on and off their mutual interaction.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Biaxial Compressive Strain Tuning of 2D semiconductors via Hot Dry Transfer on Polymer Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain engineering is an effective tool for tailoring the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials, especially for tuning quantum phenomena. Among the limited methods available for strain engineering under cryogenic conditions, thermal mismatch with polymeric substrates provides a simple and affordable strategy to induce biaxial compressive strain upon cooling. In this work, we demonstrate the transfer of unprecedentedly large levels of uniform biaxial compressive strain to single-layer WS$_2$ by employing a pre-straining approach prior to cryogenic cooling. Using a hot-dry-transfer method, single-layer WS$_2$ samples were deposited onto thermally expanded polymeric substrates at 100 $^\circ$C. As the substrate cools to room temperature, it contracts, inducing biaxial compressive strain (up to ~0.5%) in the WS$_2$ layer. This pre-strain results in a measurable blueshift in excitonic energies compared to samples transferred at room temperature, which serve as control (not pre-strained) samples. Subsequent cooling of the pre-strained samples from room temperature down to 5 K leads to a remarkable total blueshift of ~200 meV in the exciton energies of single-layer WS$_2$. This energy shift surpasses previously reported values, indicating superior levels of biaxial compressive strain induced by the accumulated substrate contraction of ~1.7%. Moreover, our findings reveal a pronounced temperature dependence in strain transfer efficiency, with gauge factors approaching theoretical limits for ideal strain transfer at 5 K. We attribute this enhanced efficiency to the increased Young's modulus of the polymeric substrate at cryogenic temperatures.</description>

      <title>Non-periodic Boundary Conditions for Euler Class and Dynamical Signatures of Obstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions. Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant, highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap topology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Alloying as a new route to generating interlayer excitons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterobilayers formed by stacking two-dimensional atomic crystals are particularly promising for low-dimensional semiconductor optics, as they host interlayer excitons, bound states of electrons and holes residing in different layers. They inherit the valley-contrasting physics of the individual monolayers, leading to a range of unique properties that distinguish them from other solid-state nanostructures. Here, we propose a novel route for the generation of interlayer excitons based on the synthesis of a transition metal dichalcogenide bilayer alloy material, WS$_{2x}$Se$_{2(1-x)}$. Using piezoelectric force microscopy, we demonstrate the existence of an internal electric field oriented in the out-of-plane direction. Interlayer excitons have so far been mostly observed in heterostructures with a type-II band alignment. In the presence of an internal electric field, a similar alignment occurs in the alloy bilayer resulting in an efficient generation of interlayer excitons. Photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements involving circularly polarised light come up with key observations like a negative degree of circular polarization of the interlayer excitons which increases as a function of temperature. A simple theoretical model provides a physical understanding of the major experimentally observed features. With experimentally fitted parameter values, the dominant contribution to the degree of circular polarization is shown to arise from spin polarization and not from valley polarization, a consequence of the spin-valley-layer coupling characteristic of a TMDC bilayer. The room-temperature interlayer excitonic transition in bilayer TMDCs has key implications for fundamental physics, including Bose-Einstein condensation and high-temperature superfluidity, while enabling advanced valleytronic and quantum information functionalities.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of exchange cross-talk in dense quantum dot arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled spins in semiconductor quantum dots are a versatile platform for quantum computing and simulations of complex many-body phenomena. However, on the path of scale-up, cross-talk from densely packed electrodes poses a severe challenge. While cross-talk onto the dot potentials is nowadays routinely compensated for, cross-talk on the exchange interaction is much more difficult to tackle because it is not always directly measurable. Here we propose and implement a way of characterizing and compensating cross-talk on adjacent exchange interactions by following the singlet-triplet avoided crossing in Ge. We show that we can easily identify the barrier-to-barrier cross-talk element without knowledge of the particular exchange value in a 2x4 quantum dot array. We uncover striking differences among these cross-talk elements which can be linked to the geometry of the device and the barrier gate fan-out. We validate the methodology by tuning up four-spin Heisenberg chains. The same methodology should be applicable to longer chains of spins and to other semiconductor platforms in which mixing of the singlet and the lowest-energy triplet is present or can be engineered. Additionally, this procedure is well suited for automated tuning routines as we obtain a stand-out feature that can be easily tracked and directly returns the magnitude of the cross-talk.</description>

      <title>Mechanical stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals under arbitrary load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper gathers and unifies mechanical stability conditions for all symmetry classes of 3D and 2D materials under arbitrary load. The methodology is based on the spectral decomposition of the fourth-order stiffness tensors mapped to second-order tensors using orthonormal (Mandel) notation, and the verification of the positivity of the so-called Kelvin moduli. An explicit set of stability conditions for 3D and 2D crystals of higher symmetry is also included, as well as a Mathematica notebook that allows mechanical stability analysis for crystals, stress-free and stressed, of arbitrary symmetry under arbitrary loads.</description>

      <title>Spin-phonon coupling and thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev model, which involves bond-direction-dependent spin interactions on a honeycomb lattice, has attracted significant interest due to its exact solvability and potential uses in quantum computing. A key feature of this model is the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity (HQTHC) under a magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice; however, HQTHC only appears at low temperatures. Here, in the higher temperature range beyond the HQTHC regime, we theoretically suggest an extrinsic phonon contribution to the thermal Hall effect in the Kitaev model through skew-scattering of chiral phonons by scalar spin chirality, previously examined in Mott insulators. We demonstrate the emergence of scalar spin chirality from fluctuating spins, estimate the resulting field strength and its symmetric form applied to chiral phonons, and obtain the associated thermal Hall conductivity in semi-quantitative agreement with existing experiments. This work offers a fundamental understanding of how spin-phonon interactions influence strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Superconducting integrated on-demand quantum memory with microwave pulse preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave quantum memory represents a critical component for quantum radars and resource-efficient approaches to quantum error correction. Superconducting microwave resonators provide highly efficient storage, long coherence times, on-demand reading and even in memory pulse engineering, but it is still challenging to overcome design and materials induced loss channels for on-chip realization. In this work, we present a novel architecture of integrated superconducting quantum memory with a dynamically controlled RF-SQUID coupling element in pulse regime, thus ensuring high efficiency storage and cycling storage time. It demonstrates a memory cycle time of 1.51 $\mu s$ and 57.5% storage fidelity with preservation of the stored pulse shape during the retrieval at single-photon level excitations. We establish that while the proposed active coupler realization introduces no measurable fidelity degradation, the primary limitation arises from impedance matching and materials imperfections. The proposed architecture highlights a disruptive potential for on-chip qubit and memory integration for scalable quantum error correction, while identifying specific avenues for near-unity storage fidelity.</description>
