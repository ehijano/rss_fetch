      <title>NFDIcore 2.0: A BFO-Compliant Ontology for Multi-Domain Research Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents NFDIcore 2.0, an ontology compliant with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) designed to represent the diverse research communities of the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) in Germany. NFDIcore ensures the interoperability across various research disciplines, thereby facilitating cross-domain research. Each domain's individual requirements are addressed through specific ontology modules. This paper discusses lessons learned during the ontology development and mapping process, supported by practical validation through use cases in diverse research domains. The originality of NFDIcore lies in its adherence to BFO, the use of SWRL rules for efficient knowledge discovery, and its modular, extensible design tailored to meet the needs of heterogeneous research domains.</description>

      <title>Impact of a reclassification on Web of Science articles on bibliometric indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to avoid the ambiguous classification of articles in multiple categories in the Web of Science and the resulting complication of bibliometric indicators, a reclassification of articles in the Web of Sciences categories was carried out according to the method of S. Milojevi\'c (2020). The higher hierarchical level from the OST classification into 11 scientific disciplines is also revised. Though in most cases articles are assigned to a subject category close to the original category, the reclassification changes the subject category of about 50% of the documents of the database. Therefore, the world distribution of disciplines and disciplinary profiles of scientific actors are modified. A sample of twenty five countries highlights the impact of the reclassification on country specialization indexes. Field-normalized indicators are also impacted. The level of changes is explored in the case of the Mean Normalized Citation Indicator (MNCS). A more in-depth analysis of the MNCS in Mathematics is carried out and reveals different strategies of countries to publish works with a mathematical background.</description>

      <title>What we should learn from pandemic publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Authors of COVID-19 papers produced during the pandemic were overwhelmingly not subject matter experts. Such a massive inflow of scholars from different expertise areas is both an asset and a potential problem. Domain-informed scientific collaboration is the key to preparing for future crises.</description>

      <title>Public interest in science or bots? Selective amplification of scientific articles on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the remarkable capability to reach the public instantly, social media has become integral in sharing scholarly articles to measure public response. Since spamming by bots on social media can steer the conversation and present a false public interest in given research, affecting policies impacting the public's lives in the real world, this topic warrants critical study and attention. We used the Altmetric dataset in combination with data collected through the Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) and the Botometer API. We combined the data into an extensive dataset with academic articles, several features from the article and a label indicating whether the article had excessive bot activity on Twitter or not. We analyzed the data to see the possibility of bot activity based on different characteristics of the article. We also trained machine-learning models using this dataset to identify possible bot activity in any given article. Our machine-learning models were capable of identifying possible bot activity in any academic article with an accuracy of 0.70. We also found that articles related to "Health and Human Science" are more prone to bot activity compared to other research areas. Without arguing the maliciousness of the bot activity, our work presents a tool to identify the presence of bot activity in the dissemination of an academic article and creates a baseline for future research in this direction.</description>
