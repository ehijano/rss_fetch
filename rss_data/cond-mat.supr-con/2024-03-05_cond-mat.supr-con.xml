      <title>Probing $p$-wave superconductivity in UTe$_2$ via point-contact junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we perform a spectroscopic study of the ambient pressure superconducting phase of UTe$_2$, measuring conductance through point-contact junctions formed by metallic contacts on different crystalline facets down to 250 mK and up to 18 T. Fitting a range of qualitatively varying spectra with a Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) model for $p$-wave pairing, we can extract gap amplitude and interface barrier strength for each junction, and best model the data with a purely $p_y$-wave gap function with amplitude in the range 0.2 - 0.35 meV. Our work provides a spectroscopic confirmation of the spin-triplet superconducting gap in UTe$_2$, and confirms that a topologically non-trivial superconducting order parameter is likely.</description>

      <title>On the origin of topotactic reduction effect for superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topotactic reduction utilizing metal hydrides as reagents emerges as an effective approach to achieve exceptionally low oxidization states of metal ions and unconventional coordination networks. This method opens avenues to the development of entirely new functional materials, with one notable example being the infinite-layer nickelate superconductors. However, the reduction effect on the atomic reconstruction and electronic structures -crucial for superconductivity- remains largely unresolved. We design two sets of control Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films and implement secondary ion mass spectroscopy to highlight the absence of reduction-induced hydrogen intercalation. X-ray absorption spectroscopy shows a significant linear dichroism with dominant Ni 3dx2-y2 orbitals on superconducting samples, indicating a Ni single-band nature of infinite-layer nickelates. Consistent with the superconducting Tc, the Ni 3d orbitals asymmetry manifests a dome-like reduction duration dependence. Our results unveil the critical role of reduction in modulating the Ni-3d orbital polarization and its impact on the superconducting properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Origin of Superconducting Diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonreciprocal critical supercurrent endows the superconducting diode effect (SDE) in noncentrosymmetric superconductors with time-reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, it was reported that the SDE has been observed in flat-band superconductors such as twisted trilayer graphene with zero magnetic field. In this Letter, we unveil the SDE in superconductors that host flat bands, where the supercurrent has a significant contribution from the wave-function quantum geometry. By establishing the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory and addressing a mean-field numerical study, we show that besides the conventional band dispersion effect arising from the Fermi surface asymmetry, the microscopic origin of SDE from quantum geometry is the quantum metric dipole. Importantly, in the flat-band limit when the attractive interaction strength is much larger than the bandwidth, the supercurrent and diode effect contributed from quantum geometry becomes the leading order. The interaction-driven valley polarization which lifts the valley degeneracy is also necessary. Our theory applies to the flat-band superconductors especially the moir\'{e} materials in the recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Driven charge density modulation by spin density wave and their coexistence interplay in SmFeAsO: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use density functional theory to investigate effects of spin-orbit coupling and single- stripe-type antiferromagnetic (sAFM) ordering on the crystal structure and electronic properties of SmFeAsO. The results indicate that AFM ordering causes the crystal structure transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic, along with increase in the height of As atoms from Fe layer due to magnetostriction. It also leads to the opening of partial band gaps, the emergence of a prominent peak near Fermi energy (EF) in the density of states (DOS) and a reduction in Fermi surface nesting. The study finds a correlation between the calculated area under the DOS curve, spanning from EF to the first peak above it, and the optimal electron- doped concentration required for inducing superconductivity in SmFeAsO. The findings suggest that spin and charge density waves can play important roles in the superconducting mechanism of Fe-based superconductors. Our calculations demonstrate that spin-orbit coupling reduces electronic correlation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stabilization and Flat Hydrogen-based Bands of Nitrogen-doped Lutetium Hydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plausible candidate for near-ambient superconductivity in the Lu-H-N system, Fm$\overline{3}$m Lu$_8$H$_{23}$N, is found to be harmonically unstable up to 20 GPa, but is anharmonically stabilized at near-ambient pressures when including quantum corrections. The presence of flat bands near E$_F$ is understood to come from quantum interference caused by the nitrogen, creating a nearly flat hydrogen band at E$_F$ with huge effective mass, meaning non-adiabatic corrections are expected to be anomalously large. The superconducting T$_c$ of Fm$\overline{3}$m Lu$_8$H$_{23}$N is estimated to be high by comparison to related compounds and flat band models. The resiliency to defects and pressure dependence of the flat bands is examined. The results here imply this structure is metastable yet flexible enough to synthesize and has electronic properties that can explain the reported near-ambient superconductivity in Lu-H-N.</description>

      <title>Anomalous impurity effect in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of contradictory impurity effect in the heavy-fermion superconductor CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ at ambient pressure have hindered the identification of its pairing symmetry. Here we perform theoretical analyses with both intraband and interband impurity scatterings for the nodeless $s^\pm$-wave pairing, and report an anomalous nonmonotonic variation of its $T_c$ suppression with the scattering strength. Our results reproduce the prominent reduction of $T_c$ in good agreement with earlier experiments by atomic substitution and explains as well its robustness against electron irradiation. We ascribe the latter to the screening of the interband impurity potential in the strong scattering or unitary region. This resolves the seeming contradiction in different experimental probes and provides an important support to the nodeless $s^\pm$-wave scenario in CeCu$_2$Si$_2$ at ambient pressure. Our theory may be extended to other narrow band systems such as twisted bilayer graphene and the recently discovered bilayer or trilayer nickelate superconductors, and provide a useful way to distinguish different paring candidates thereof.</description>

      <title>Oscillating-charged Andreev Bound States and Their Appearance in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a superconductor with a sublattice degree of freedom, we find unconventional Andreev bound states whose charge density oscillates in sign between the two sublattices. The appearance of these oscillating-charged Andreev bound states is characterized by a Zak phase, rather than a conventional topological invariant. In contrast to conventional Andreev bound states, for oscillating-charged Andreev bound states the proportionality between the electron-like spectral function, the local density of states and the tunneling conductance is broken. We examine the possible appearance of these novel Andreev bound states in UTe$_2$ and locally noncentrosymmetric superconductors.</description>

      <title>Chirped amplitude mode in photo-excited superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the amplitude mode in superconductors exhibits chirped oscillations under resonant excitation and that the chirping velocity increases as we approach the critical excitation strength. The chirped amplitude mode enables us to determine the local modification of the effective potential even when the system is in a long-lived pre-thermal state. We then show that this chirped amplitude mode is an experimentally observable quantity since the photo-induced (super)-current in pump-probe experiments serves as an efficient proxy for the dynamics of the order parameter, including the chirped dynamics. Our result is based on the attractive Hubbard model using dynamical mean-field theory within the symmetry-broken state after a resonant excitation across the superconducting gap. Since the collective response takes place on emergently long timescales, we extend the hierarchical low-rank compression method for nonequilibrium Green's functions to symmetry-broken states and show that it serves as an efficient representation despite long-lived memory kernels.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Behavior of Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum technologies and advanced detection experiments have underscored the pressing need for the detection of exceedingly weak signals within the microwave frequency spectrum. Addressing this challenge, the Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) has been proposed as a cryogenic front-end amplifier capable of approaching the quantum noise limit while providing a relevant bandwidth. This research is centered on a comprehensive numerical investigation of the JTWPA, without resorting to simplifications regarding the nonlinearity of the essential components. Specifically, this study focuses on a thorough examination of the system, characterized by coupled nonlinear differential equations representing all components of the device. Proper input and output signals at the device's boundaries are considered. The analysis of the output signals undergoing the parametric amplification process involves a detailed exploration of phase-space dynamics and Fourier spectral analysis of the output voltage. This study is conducted while considering the parameters ruling the response of the device under pump and signal excitations. In addition to the expected signal amplification, the findings reveal that the nonlinear nature of the system can give rise to unforeseen phenomena, depending on the system's operational conditions, which include: the generation of pump tone harmonics, modulation of the signal gain, and incommensurate frequency generation-effects that are not easily accommodated by simplistic linearized approaches</description>

      <title>Designing Quaternary Hydrides with Potential High T$_c$ Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose three parent structures for designing quaternary hydrides of increasing complexity to optimize parameters correlated with high T$_c$ superconductivity. The first is a simple Pm$\overline{3}$m cell inspired by the FCC RH$_3$ structures (R = trivalent rare earths), which we show has moderately promising potential for high T$_c$ compounds. The second is an Fm$\overline{3}$m heterostructure inspired by our work on Lu$_8$H$_{23}$N that consistently produces metallic hydrogen sublattices, whose quantum interference with Lewis bases is designed to high DOS$_H$(E$_F$). Several examples are put forward that first-principles calculations confirm have hydrogen-dominant metal character, as well as strong network connectivity as measured with the Electron Localization Function (ELF). The third quaternary model structure allows for a more precise description of doping as well as symmetry breaking of octahedral hydrogen which improves the hydrogen network connectivity. These model structures/formulae predict compounds with high predicted T$_c$ and have enough flexibility to optimize for both T$_c$ and stability at low pressures.</description>

      <title>Vortex formation in pure-Sn islands in field-cooled Sn-Pb solders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formation of vortices is a typical phenomenon in type-II superconductors under a magnetic field (H). In contrast, type-I superconductors do not host the vortices because of their Meissner state, and the vortices have rarely observed in the intermediate states of type-I superconductors and Pb at extremely low temperature (T) under H. Here, we show the thermodynamic evidences of vortex formation in pure-Sn islands in the field-cooled Sn-Pb solders, where Sn and Pb are well phase-separated. Noticeably, the vortex states appear even after demagnetization (H = 0 Oe). We analyze specific heat data of the Sn10-Pb90, Sn20-Pb80, Sn70-Pb30, and Sn90-Pb10 solder samples after field cooling at H greater than the critical filed, and the measurements are performed at various H. Although the Pb regions exhibit conventional H-T phase diagrams for all the samples, the Sn regions of the most samples exhibit the robustness of superconductivity to H, which is similar to the anomalous H-T trend recently observed in Sn45-Pb55. We show that the specific heat jump at the superconducting transition of the Sn regions is clearly enhanced with decreasing the Sn amount, and the increase in the jump magnitude correlates with the amount of the magnetic fields trapped after field cooling but not with the Sn amount. Furthermore, the jump magnitude is several times larger than the value expected from a conventional superconducting transition (electron entropy change). The large specific heat jump and the enhancement of the jump magnitude by the increase in trapped magnetic field indicate that the Sn regions exhibit bulk vortex states with an obvious entropy change (emergence of new degree of freedom) when the solders are initially field-cooled.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen is not necessary for superconductivity in topotactically reduced nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key open question in the study of layered superconducting nickelate films is the role that hydrogen incorporation into the lattice plays in the appearance of the superconducting state. Due to the challenges of stabilizing highly crystalline square planar nickelate films, films are prepared by the deposition of a more stable parent compound which is then transformed into the target phase via a topotactic reaction with a strongly reducing agent such as CaH$_2$. Recent studies, both experimental and theoretical, have introduced the possibility that the incorporation of hydrogen from the reducing agent into the nickelate lattice may be critical for the superconductivity. In this work, we use secondary ion mass spectrometry to examine superconducting La$_{1-x}$X$_x$NiO$_2$ / SrTiO$_3$ (X = Ca and Sr) and Nd$_6$Ni$_5$O$_{12}$ / NdGaO$_3$ films, along with non-superconducting NdNiO$_2$ / SrTiO$_3$ and (Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ / SrTiO$_3$. We find no evidence for extensive hydrogen incorporation across a broad range of samples, including both superconducting and non-superconducting films. Theoretical calculations indicate that hydrogen incorporation is broadly energetically unfavorable in these systems, supporting our conclusion that hydrogen incorporation is not generally required to achieve a superconducting state in layered square-planar nickelates.</description>

      <title>Anodization-free fabrication process for high-quality cross-type Josephson tunnel junctions based on a Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb trilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson tunnel junctions form the basis for various superconducting electronic devices. For this reason, enormous efforts are routinely taken to establish and later on maintain a scalable and reproducible wafer-scale manufacturing process for high-quality Josephson junctions. Here, we present an anodization-free fabrication process for Nb/Al-AlO$_x$/Nb cross-type Josephson junctions that requires only a small number of process steps and that is intrinsically compatible with wafer-scale fabrication. We show that the fabricated junctions are of very high-quality and, compared to other junction types, exhibit not only a significantly reduced capacitance but also an almost rectangular critical current density profile. Our process hence enables the usage of low capacitance Josephson junctions for superconducting electronic devices such as ultra-low noise dc-SQUIDs, microwave SQUID multiplexers based on non-hysteretic rf-SQUIDs and RFSQ circuits.</description>

      <title>Spatially dispersing in-gap states induced by Andreev tunneling through single electronic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS), we observe superconducting in-gap states induced by Andreev tunneling through single impurity state in a low-carrier-density superconductor (NaAlSi). The energy-symmetric in-gap states appear when the impurity state is located within the superconducting gap. Superconducting in-gap states can cross the Fermi level, and show X-shaped spatial dispersion. We interpret the in-gap states as a consequence of the Andreev tunneling through the impurity state, which involves the formation or breakup of a Cooper pair. Due to the low carrier density in NaAlSi, the in-gap state is tunable by controlling the STM tip-sample distance. Under strong external magnetic fields, the impurity state shows Zeeman splitting when it is located near the Fermi level. Our findings not only demonstrate the Andreev tunneling involving single electronic state, but also provide new insights for understanding the spatially dispersing in-gap states in low-carrier-density superconductors.</description>

      <title>Spin Signature of Majorana Fermions in Topological Nodal-Point Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02036</link>

Abstract: We highlight a situation having attracted little attention previously that in two-dimensional topological nodal superconductors, the Majorana edge states with breaking chiral symmetry but preserving nearly flat bands can have unexpected spin-singlet component of pairing correlations compared with the counterparts of exactly flat bands. Moreover, it is detectable by means of spin-selective Andreev reflection in a realistic topological nodal superconductor with antiferromagnetism, as the conductance peaks become the most outstanding when the spin polarization of incident electrons is (approximately) antiparallel to that of Majorana edge excitations. Therefore, our findings uncover another previously unexpected spin-dependent scenario for the Andreev reflection resonant peaks, and the related features constitute an important step forward in the quest for experimental detection of Majorana fermions in a system with the same kind of topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations in a 2D Electron System with Strong Spin-Orbit Scatterings: Phase Separation and Large Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) in a 2D electron system with strong spin-orbit scatterings is presented to account for the observation, at low temperatures, of large magnetoresistance (MR) above a crossover field to superconductivity in electron-doped SrTiO$_{3}$/LaAlO$% _{3} $ interfaces. It is found that, while the conventional (diagrammatic) microscopic theory of superconducting fluctuations fails to account for the pronounced MR, an extension of the theory, which introduces a proper definition of the CPFs density, reveals an operative mechanism of this intriguing effect. Phase separation due to Coulomb repulsion, from the rarefying unpaired normal-state electron gas, following field-induced condensation of CPFs in real-space mesoscopic puddles, are in the core of this mechanism. These findings enable us to amend the state-of-the-art microscopic theory, in a consistent manner with the time dependent GL functional approach used previously in an extensive account of the experimentally reported effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a Josephson junction consisting of two superconducting layers sandwiching an insulating layer is explored, which is subject to the effects of thermal fluctuations. The precise expressions for the evolution of Josephson phase and the supercurrent through the junction are derived. A clockwise hysteresis cycle in the current-voltage characteristic curve is demonstrated mathematically. Additionally, the bifurcation of a planar limit cycle is established. The numerous stochastic thermodynamic properties of the resistively shunted superconducting tunnel junction system are described, considering the influence of three specific parameters: the conductance, the current bias and the noise intensity. Moreover, the probability density is characterized using the Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

Abstract: Majorana fermions, exotic particles with potential applications in quantum computing, have garnered significant interest in condensed matter physics. The Kitaev model serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the emergence of Majorana fermions in one-dimensional systems. We explore the intriguing question of whether Majorana fermions can arise in a NM side-coupled to a Kitaev chain (KC) in the topologically trivial phase. Our findings reveal affirmative evidence, further demonstrating that the KC, when in the topological phase, can induce additional Majorana fermions in the neighboring NM region. Through extensive parameter analysis, we uncover the potential for zero, one, or two pairs of Majorana fermions in a KC side-coupled to an NM. Additionally, we investigate the impact of magnetic flux on the system and calculate the winding number -a topological invariant - to characterize the phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted graphene based moir\'e heterostructures host a flat band at the magic angles where the kinetic energy of the charge carriers is quenched and interaction effects dominate. This results in emergent phases such as superconductors and correlated insulators that are electrostatically tunable. We investigate superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) by integrating it as the weak link in a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). The measured current phase relation (CPR) yields a large and tunable kinetic inductance, up to 150 nH per square, of the electron and hole type intrinsic superconductors. We further show that the specific kinetic inductance and the critical current density are universally related via the superconducting coherence length, and extract an upper bound of 200 nm for the coherence length. Our work opens avenues for using graphene-based superconductors as tunable elements in superconducting circuits.</description>

Abstract: The group of moir\'e graphene superconductors keeps growing, and by now it contains twisted graphene multilayers and twisted double bilayers. We analyze the contribution of long range charge fluctuations in the superconductivity of twisted double graphene bilayers and helical trilayers, and compare the results to twisted bilayer graphene. We apply a diagrammatic approach which depends on a few, well known parameters. We find that the critical temperature and the order parameter differ significantly between twisted double bilayers and helical trilayers on one hand, and twisted bilayer graphene on the other. We show that this trend, consistent with experiments, can be associated to the role played by moir\'e Umklapp processes in the different systems.</description>

      <title>Magnonic $\varphi$ Josephson Junctions and Synchronized Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a growing interest in non-Hermitian physics. One of its main goals is to engineer dissipation and to explore ensuing functionality. In magnonics, the effect of dissipation due to local damping on magnon transport has been explored. However, the effects of non-local damping on the magnonic analog of the Josephson effect remain missing, despite that non-local damping is inevitable and has been playing a central role in magnonics. Here, we uncover theoretically that a surprisingly rich dynamics can emerge in magnetic junctions due to intrinsic non-local damping, using analytical and numerical methods. In particular, under microwave pumping, we show that coherent spin precession in the right and left insulating ferromagnet (FM) of the junction becomes synchronized by non-local damping and thereby a magnonic analog of the $\varphi$ Josephson junction emerges, where $\varphi$ stands here for the relative precession phase of right and left FM in the stationary limit. Remarkably, $\varphi$ decreases monotonically from $ \pi$ to $\pi/2$ as the magnon-magnon interaction, arising from spin anisotropies, increases. Moreover, we also find a magnonic diode effect giving rise to rectification of magnon currents. Our predictions are readily testable with current device and measurement technologies at room temperatures.</description>

      <title>Time reversal invariant topological 1D and 2D superconductors: doubling the Sau-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Oppen proposals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a doubled version of the Sam-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Oreg-Refael-von Open proposals thereby obtaining time reversal invariant p-wave superconductivity in both 1D and 2D. This construction is much like the Kane-Mele spin Hall model which is a time reversal invariant doubling of the Haldane model. We show that the low energy effective action for these doubled versions of the Say-Luchtin-Tewari-Sarma and Greg-Refael-von Open models corresponds to a single band p-wave time reversal invariant superconductors with pseudo spin degree of freedom instead of spin degree of freedom. There are Majorana fermions at the ends of wires or in vortex cores of these superconductors. Furthermore these are shown to be stable to small perturbations. In the supplement we present physical realization of the system with cold atoms and show a related "no-go" theorem given in Haim et. al. (2019) has too restrictive assumptions to apply to this proposal.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low carrier density superconducting bolometers with single photon sensitivity based on magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting (SC) state of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) shows exceptional properties, as it consists of an unprecedentedly small electron (hole) ensemble of only ~ 10 power 11 carriers per square centimeter, which is five orders of magnitude lower than in traditional superconductors. This results in an ultra-low electronic heat capacity and kinetic inductance of this truly two-dimensional SC, and provides record-breaking key parameters for a variety of quantum sensing applications, in particular in thermal sensing and single photon detection (SPD), which traditionally exploit thermal effects in nanostructured superconducting thin films. In this work, we systematically study the interaction of the superconducting state of MATBG with individual light quanta. We discover full destruction of the SC state upon absorption of a single infrared photon even in a 16 square micrometer sized device, which showcases its exceptional bolometric sensitivity. Upon voltage biasing close to its critical current, we further show that this non-optimized device can be used as a SPD, whose click-rate is proportional to the number of absorbed photons, following Poissonian statistics. Our work offers insights into the MATBG-photon interaction and shows up pathways to use low-carrier density graphene-based superconductors as a new platform for developing revolutionary new quantum devices and sensors.</description>

      <title>Variational Monte Carlo study of stripes as a function of doping in the $t-t'$ Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform variational Monte Carlo simulations of the single-band Hubbard model on the square lattice with both nearest ($t$) and next-nearest ($t'$) neighbor hoppings. Our work investigates the consequences of increasing hole doping on the instauration of stripes and the behavior of the superconducting order parameter, with a discussion on how the two phenomena affect each other. We consider two different values of the next-nearest neighbor hopping parameter, that are appropriate for describing cuprate superconductors. We observe that stripes are the optimal state in a wide doping range; the stripe wavelength reduces at increasing doping, until stripes melt into a uniform state for large values of doping. Superconducting pair-pair correlations, indicating the presence of superconductivity, are always suppressed in the presence of stripes. Our results suggest that the phase diagram for the single-band Hubbard model is dominated by stripes, with superconductivity being possible only in a narrow doping range between striped states and a nonsuperconducting metal.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in two-dimensional metals at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the undisputed signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Cuprate universal electronic spin response and the pseudogap from NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity, in particular in the cuprates, is central to condensed matter physics, and telltale experimental laws for guiding theory are desirable. Here we report on such a universal property from the linear response of the electronic matter to a homogeneous static magnetic field. From it, two different types of carriers are identified. The universal behavior concerns the carriers from hybridized copper and oxygen orbitals that span the defining element, the CuO$_2$ plane, of the superconducting cuprates. Their spin response is similar to that of a material independent metallic density of states which carries a temperature independent, but doping dependent pseudogap that closes beyond optimal doping. The second electronic spin component has a strong family and doping dependent density of states, and it involves only Cu (isotropic orbitals, except for \lsco). The condensation of both types of carriers is interconnected and sets the critical temperature of superconductivity ($T_\mathrm{c}$). The inter-planar component can condense at the same or lower temperatures compared to that of the planar component, and a certain match in density of states seems to be required for the highest $T_\mathrm{c}$. The second component reminds one of the proposed involvement of another Cu axial orbital that relates to the distance or presence of the apical oxygen \cite{Ohta1991,Pavarini2001,Mahony2022} and the charge distribution in the CuO$_2$ plane \cite{Kowalski2021,Jurkutat2023}, which correlates with the maximum $T_\mathrm{c}$, as well.</description>

      <title>Near-power-law temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness in strongly disordered superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In BCS superconductors, the superfluid stiffness is virtually constant at low temperature and only slightly affected by the exponentially low density of thermal quasiparticles. Here, we present an experimental and theoretical study on the temperature dependence of superfluid stiffness $\Theta\left(T\right)$ in a strongly disordered pseudo-gaped superconductor, amorphous $\text{InO}_{x}$, which exhibits non-BCS behavior. Experimentally, we report an unusual power-law suppression of the superfluid stiffness $\delta\Theta\left(T\right)\propto T^{b}$ at $T\ll T_{c}$, with $b\sim1.6$, which we measured via the frequency shift of microwave resonators. Theoretically, by combining analytical and numerical methods to a model of a disordered superconductor with pseudogap and spatial inhomogeneities of the superconducting order parameter, we found a qualitatively similar low-temperature power-law behavior with exponent $b\sim1.6-3$ being disorder-dependent. This power-law suppression of the superfluid density occurs mainly due to the broad distribution of the superconducting order parameter that is known to exist in such superconductors [arXiv:1012.3630], even moderately far from the superconductor-insulator transition. The presence of the power-law dependence $\delta\Theta\left(T\right)\propto T^{b}$ at low $T\ll T_{c}$ demonstrates the existence of low-energy collective excitations; in turn, it implies the presence of a new channel of dissipation in inhomogeneous superconductors caused by sub-gap excitations that are not quasiparticles. Our findings have implications for the use of strongly disordered superconductors as superinductance in quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>High-frequency suppression of inductive coupling between flux qubit and transmission line resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform theoretical calculations to investigate the naturally occurring high-frequency cutoff in a circuit comprising a flux qubit coupled inductively to a transmission line resonator (TLR). Specifically, a decoupling occurs between the qubit and the high-frequency modes. The coupling strength between the qubit and resonator modes increases with mode frequency $\omega$ as $\sqrt{\omega}$ at low frequencies and decreases as $1/\sqrt{\omega}$ at high frequencies. This result is similar to those of past studies that considered somewhat similar circuit designs. By avoiding the approximation of ignoring the qubit-TLR coupling in certain steps in the analysis, we obtain effects not captured in previous studies. In particular, we obtain a resonance effect that shifts the TLR mode frequencies close to qubit oscillation frequencies. We derive expressions for the TLR mode frequencies, qubit-TLR coupling strengths and qubit Lamb shift. We identify features in the spectrum of the system that can be used in future experiments to test and validate the theoretical model.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the large Kondo coupling limit of the Kondo-Heisenberg model on one- and two-dimensional lattices. Focusing on the possible superconducting states when slightly doping the Kondo insulator state, we identify different pairing modes to be most stable in different parameter regimes. Possibilities include uniform $s$-wave, pair-density-wave with momentum $\pi$ (in both one and two dimensions) and uniform $s\pm \mathrm{i}d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (in two dimensions). We attribute these exotic pairing states to the presence of various pair-hopping terms with a ``wrong'' sign in the effective model, a mechanism that is likely universal for inducing pairing states with spatially modulated pair wavefunctions.</description>

In this work, we performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict the critical temperature ($T_c$) of over 900 hydride materials under a pressure range of (0 to 500) GPa, where we found 125 dynamically stable structures with a $T_c$ above MgB$_2$ (39 K). To accelerate screening, we trained a graph neural network (GNN) model to predict $T_c$ and demonstrated that a universal machine learned force-field can be used to relax hydride structures under arbitrary pressures, with significantly reduced cost. By combining DFT and GNNs, we can establish a more complete map of hydrides under pressure.</description>
