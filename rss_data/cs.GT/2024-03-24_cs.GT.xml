      <title>On the Weighted Top-Difference Distance: Axioms, Aggregation, and Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of distance functions on rankings that allow for asymmetric treatments of alternatives and consider the distinct relevance of the top and bottom positions for ordered lists. We provide a full axiomatic characterization of our distance. In doing so, we retrieve new characterizations of existing axioms and show how to effectively weaken them for our purposes. This analysis highlights the generality of our distance as it embeds many (semi)metrics previously proposed in the literature. Subsequently, we show that, notwithstanding its level of generality, our distance is still readily applicable. We apply it to preference aggregation, studying the features of the associated median voting rule. It is shown how the derived preference function satisfies many desirable features in the context of voting rules, ranging from fairness to majority and Pareto-related properties. We show how to compute consensus rankings exactly, and provide generalized Diaconis-Graham inequalities that can be leveraged to obtain approximation algorithms. Finally, we propose some truncation ideas for our distances inspired by Lu and Boutilier (2010). These can be leveraged to devise a Polynomial-Time-Approximation Scheme for the corresponding rank aggregation problem.</description>

      <title>Strategic Network Creation for Enabling Greedy Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first game-theoretic network creation model that incorporates greedy routing, i.e., the agents in our model are embedded in some metric space and strive for creating a network where all-pairs greedy routing is enabled. In contrast to graph-theoretic shortest paths, our agents route their traffic along greedy paths, which are sequences of nodes where the distance in the metric space to the respective target node gets strictly smaller by each hop. Besides enabling greedy routing, the agents also optimize their connection quality within the created network by constructing greedy paths with low stretch. This ensures that greedy routing is always possible in equilibrium networks, while realistically modeling the agents' incentives for local structural changes to the network. With this we augment the elegant network creation model by Moscibroda, Schmidt, and Wattenhofer (PODC'06) with the feature of greedy routing.
  For our model, we analyze the existence of (approximate)-equilibria and the computational hardness in different underlying metric spaces. E.g., we characterize the set of equilibria in 1-2-metrics and tree metrics, we show that in both metrics Nash equilibria always exist, and we prove that the well-known $\Theta$-graph construction yields constant-approximate Nash equilibria in Euclidean space. The latter justifies distributed network construction via $\Theta$-graphs from a new point-of-view, since it shows that this powerful technique not only guarantees networks having a low stretch but also networks that are almost stable.</description>

      <title>Human behaviour through a LENS: How Linguistic content triggers Emotions and Norms and determines Strategy choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, a growing body of experimental research has provided evidence that linguistic frames influence human behaviour in economic games, beyond the economic consequences of the available actions. This article proposes a novel framework that transcends the traditional confines of outcome-based preference models. According to the LENS model, the Linguistic description of the decision problem triggers Emotional responses and suggests potential Norms of behaviour, which then interact to shape an individual's Strategic choice. The article reviews experimental evidence that supports each path of the LENS model. Furthermore, it identifies and discusses several critical research questions that arise from this model, pointing towards avenues for future inquiry.</description>

      <title>Multi-Player Zero-Sum Markov Games with Networked Separable Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new class of Markov games, \emph(multi-player) zero-sum Markov Games} with \emph{Networked separable interactions} (zero-sum NMGs), to model the local interaction structure in non-cooperative multi-agent sequential decision-making. We define a zero-sum NMG as a model where {the payoffs of the auxiliary games associated with each state are zero-sum and} have some separable (i.e., polymatrix) structure across the neighbors over some interaction network. We first identify the necessary and sufficient conditions under which an MG can be presented as a zero-sum NMG, and show that the set of Markov coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) collapses to the set of Markov Nash equilibrium (NE) in these games, in that the product of per-state marginalization of the former for all players yields the latter. Furthermore, we show that finding approximate Markov \emph{stationary} CCE in infinite-horizon discounted zero-sum NMGs is \texttt{PPAD}-hard, unless the underlying network has a ``star topology''. Then, we propose fictitious-play-type dynamics, the classical learning dynamics in normal-form games, for zero-sum NMGs, and establish convergence guarantees to Markov stationary NE under a star-shaped network structure. Finally, in light of the hardness result, we focus on computing a Markov \emph{non-stationary} NE and provide finite-iteration guarantees for a series of value-iteration-based algorithms. We also provide numerical experiments to corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A-PSRO: A Unified Strategy Learning Method with Advantage Function for Normal-form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solving Nash equilibrium is the key challenge in normal-form games with large strategy spaces, where open-ended learning frameworks offer an efficient approach. In this work, we propose an innovative unified open-ended learning framework A-PSRO, i.e., Advantage Policy Space Response Oracle, as a comprehensive framework for both zero-sum and general-sum games. In particular, we introduce the advantage function as an enhanced evaluation metric for strategies, enabling a unified learning objective for agents engaged in normal-form games. We prove that the advantage function exhibits favorable properties and is connected with the Nash equilibrium, which can be used as an objective to guide agents to learn strategies efficiently. Our experiments reveal that A-PSRO achieves a considerable decrease in exploitability in zero-sum games and an escalation in rewards in general-sum games, significantly outperforming previous PSRO algorithms.</description>
