      <title>Fourier Transform and the minimal representation of $E_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the minimal representation of the adjoint split group $E_7$ over a p-adic field. The representation has a model in a space of functions on a 17 dimensional cone $\Omega$, and elements of the unique parabolic subgroup Q with abelian radical act by simple geometric formulas. We write a formula for the action of an involutive element $s$, conjugating $Q$ to the opposite parabolic $\bar Q$. The resulting integral operator, called a Fourier transform on $\Omega$, is related to generalized Fourier transform, defined by Braverman and Kazhdan.</description>

      <title>On the functor relating Harish-Chandra bimodules and Soergel bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 90's Soergel constructed a functor that relates Harish-Chandra bimodules to Soergel bimodules. We revisit this functor and relate it to the restriction functor constructed by Losev between Harish-Chandra bimodules and bimodules over $W$-algebra associated to the regular nilpotent element. We compute the images of certain Harish-Chandra bimodules under the restriction functor and provide alternative proofs for many properties of the functor constructed by Soergel. Blocks of Harish-Chandra bimodules with integral central characters were studied in the works of Soergel and Stroppel. We will generalize results of Soergel and Stroppel in the case of integral blocks to general blocks.</description>

      <title>Lie superalgebras in characteristic 2 and mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of a Lie superalgebra over a field $k$ of characteristic $2$ which unifies the two pre-existing ones - $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded Lie algebras with a squaring map and Lie algebras in the Verlinde category ${\rm Ver}_4^+(k)$, and prove the PBW theorem for this notion. We also do the same for the restricted version. Finally, discuss mixed characteristic deformation theory of such Lie superalgebras (for perfect $k$), introducing and studying a natural lift of our notion of Lie superalgebra to characteristic zero - the notion of a mixed Lie superalgebra over a ramified quadratic extension $R$ of the ring of Witt vectors $W(k)$.</description>

      <title>On local rings of finite syzygy representation type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let R be a commutative Noetherian local ring. We give a characterization of when the completion of R has an isolated singularity. This result simultaneously improves a theorem of Dao and Takahashi and a theorem of Bahlekeh, Hakimian, Salarian, and Takahashi. As an application, we strengthen the Auslander-Huneke-Leuschke-Wiegand theorem in the form refined by Dao and Takahashi. We further investigate the ascent and descent of finite and countable syzygy representation type along the canonical map from R to its completion. As a consequence, we obtain a complete affirmative answer to Schreyer's conjecture. We also explore analogues of Chen's questions in the context of finite Cohen-Macaulay representation type over Cohen-Macaulay rings. The main result in this direction shows that if R is Cohen-Macaulay and there are only finitely many non-isomorphic indecomposable maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules that are locally free on the punctured spectrum, then either R is a hypersurface or every Gorenstein projective module is projective, and every Gorenstein projective module over the completion of R is a direct sum of finitely generated ones. Finally, we study dominant local rings, introduced by Takahashi, under certain finite representation type conditions, and identify a new class of virtually Gorenstein rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes are based on the three lectures that one of the authors gave at Tsinghua University in the summer of 2023 as part of the workshop on Geometric Representation Theory and Applications. They contain an introduction to the evaluation of $\mathsf{SL}(3)$ foams and the associated topological theory of trivalent planar graphs and foam cobordisms between them. A categorification of the Kuperberg quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ web and link invariant and the Robert-Wagner $\mathsf{SL}(N)$ foam evaluation are reviewed as well.</description>

      <title>Cochain valued TQFTs from nonsemisimple modular tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a vector space valued TQFT constructed in work of De Renzi et al. [DGGPR23] extends naturally to a topological field theory which takes values in the symmetric monoidal category of linear cochains. Specifically, we consider a bordism category whose objects are surfaces with markings from the category of cochains Ch(A) over a given modular tensor category (such as the category of small quantum group representations), and whose morphisms are 3-dimensional bordisms with embedded ribbon graphs traveling between such marked surfaces. We construct a symmetric monoidal functor from the aforementioned ribbon bordism category to the category of linear cochains. The values of this theory on surfaces are identified with Hom complexes for Ch(A), and the 3-manifold invariants are alternating sums of the renormalized Lyubashenko invariant from [DGGPR23].
  We show that our cochain valued TQFT furthermore preserves homotopies, and hence localizes to a theory which takes values in the derived $\infty$-category of dg vector spaces. The domain for this $\infty$-categorical theory is, up to some approximation, an $\infty$-category of ribbon bordism with labels in the homotopy $\infty$-category K(A). We suggest our localized theory as a starting point for the construction of a "derived TQFT" for the $\infty$-category of derived quantum group representations.</description>

      <title>Domain of Discontinuity of Anosov Subgroups Acting on Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\rho: \Gamma \to G$ be an Anosov representation, with $\Gamma$ a word hyperbolic group and $G$ a semisimple Lie group. Previous works (by Guichard--Wienhard, Kapovich--Leeb--Porti, and recently Carvajales--Stecker) constructed an open domain of discontinuity $\Omega_\rho \subset G/H$, where $H$ is a parabolic or symmetric subgroup. In this paper, we extend the properly discontinuous $\Gamma$-action (via $\rho$) to the space of connections on the pullback of the tangent bundle over $\Omega_\rho$.
  When $\Omega_\rho$ is a complex surface, we show that the $\Gamma$-action is properly discontinuous on the union of the Higgs bundle structures of the $(1,0)$ part of the complexification of these pullback bundles. We further construct a topological free group $F$ generated by these holomorphic line bundles and show that $\rho(\Gamma)$ acts properly discontinuously on $F \setminus \{\mathrm{id}\}$. This free group is shown to be well-defined up to isomorphism over the character variety of Zariski dense Anosov representations. Finally, we endow the space of Anosov representations with a categorical structure and construct a natural functor to the category of free groups.</description>

      <title>Horn's problem in PU$(n,1)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multiplicative Horn problem is the following question: given three conjugacy classes $\mathcal{C}_1, \mathcal{C}_2, \mathcal{C}_3$ in a Lie group $G$, do there exist elements $(A,B,C)\in\mathcal{C}_1\times\mathcal{C}_2\times\mathcal{C}_3$ such that $ABC=\operatorname{Id}$? In this paper, we study the multiplicative Horn problem restricted to the elliptic classes of the group $G={\rm PU}(n,1)$ for $n\geq 1$, which is the isometry group of the $n$-dimensional complex hyperbolic space. We show that the solution set of Horn's problem in PU$(n,1)$ is a finite union of convex polytopes in the space of elliptic conjugacy classes. We give a complete description of these polytopes when $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Obstruction theory for $A$-infinity bimodules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for the extension of truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over truncated minimal $A$-infinity algebras. Obstructions live in far-away pages of a (truncated) fringed spectral sequence of Bousfield--Kan type. The second page of this spectral sequence is mostly given by a new cohomology theory associated to a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it. This new cohomology theory fits in a long exact sequence involving the Hochschild cohomology of the algebra and the self-extensions of the bimodule. We show that the second differential of this spectral sequence is given by the Gerstenhaber bracket with a bimodule analogue of the universal Massey product of a minimal $A$-infinity algebra. We also develop a closely-related obstruction theory for truncated minimal $A$-infinity bimodule structures over (the truncation of) a fixed minimal $A$-infinity algebra; the second page of the corresponding spectral sequence is now mostly given by the vector spaces of self-extensions of the underlying graded bimodule and the second differential is described analogously to the previous one. We also establish variants of the above for graded algebras and graded bimodules that are $d$-sparse, that is they are concentrated in degrees that are multiples of a fixed integer $d\geq1$. These obstruction theories are used to establish intrinsic formality and almost formality theorems for differential graded bimodules over differential graded algebras. Our results hold, more generally, in the context of graded operads with multiplication equipped with an associative operadic ideal, examples of which are the endomorphism operad of a graded algebra and the linear endomorphism operad of a pair consisting of a graded algebra and a graded bimodule over it.</description>

      <title>Relative Calabi-Yau structures and ice quivers with potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16222v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2015, Van den Bergh showed that complete 3-Calabi-Yau algebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 are equivalent to Ginzburg dg algebras associated with quivers with potential. He also proved the natural generalisation to higher dimensions and non-algebraically closed ground fields. The relative version of the notion of Ginzburg dg algebra is that of Ginzburg morphism. For example, every ice quiver with potential gives rise to a Ginzburg morphism. We generalise Van den Bergh's theorem by showing that, under suitable assumptions, any morphism with a relative Calabi-Yau structure is equivalent to a Ginzburg(-Lazaroiu) morphism. In particular, in dimension 3 and over an algebraically closed ground field of characteristic 0, it is given by an ice quiver with potential. Thanks to the work of Bozec-Calaque-Scherotzke, this result can also be viewed as a non-commutative analogue of Joyce-Safronov's Lagrangian neighbourhood theorem in derived symplectic geometry.</description>

Abstract: Let $D$ be the quatenion division algebra over a non-Archimedean local field $F$ of characteristic zero and odd residual characterisitc. We show that an irreducible discrete series representation of $\mathrm{GL}_n(D)$ is $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished only if it is supercuspidal. Here, $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$ is the quaternionic symplectic group. Combined with the recent study on $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished supercuspidal representations by S\'echerre and Stevens, this completes the classification of $\mathrm{Sp}_n(D)$-distinguished discrete series representations, as predicted by Dipendra Prasad.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.09475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a construction of the Coulomb branch of a $3d\ {\mathcal N}=4$ gauge theory corresponding to a choice of a connected reductive group $G$ and a symplectic finite-dimensional reprsentation $\mathbf M$ of $G$, satisfying certain anomaly cancellation condition. This extends the construction of arXiv:1601.03586 (where it was assumed that ${\mathbf M}={\mathbf N}\oplus{\mathbf N}^*$ for some representation $\mathbf N$ of $G$). Our construction goes through certain "universal" ring object in the twisted derived Satake category of the symplectic group $Sp(2n)$. The construction of this object uses a categorical version of the Weil representation; we also compute the image of this object under the (twisted) derived Satake equivalence and show that it can be obtained from the theta-sheaf introduced by S.Lysenko on $\operatorname{Bun}_{Sp(2n)}({\mathbb P}^1)$ via certain Radon transform. We also discuss applications of our construction to a potential mathematical construction of $S$-duality for super-symmetric boundary conditions in 4-dimensional gauge theory and to (some extension of) the conjectures of D.Ben-Zvi, Y.Sakellaridis and A.Venkatesh.</description>

      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>
