      <title>A Unified Model of Congestion Games with Priorities: Two-Sided Markets with Ties, Finite and Non-Affine Delay Functions, and Pure Nash Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of equilibrium concepts in congestion games and two-sided markets with ties has been a primary topic in game theory, economics, and computer science. Ackermann, Goldberg, Mirrokni, R\"oglin, V\"ocking (2008) gave a common generalization of these two models, in which a player more prioritized by a resource produces an infinite delay on less prioritized players. While presenting several theorems on pure Nash equilibria in this model, Ackermann et al.\ posed an open problem of how to design a model in which more prioritized players produce a large but finite delay on less prioritized players. In this paper, we present a positive solution to this open problem by combining the model of Ackermann et al.\ with a generalized model of congestion games due to Bil\`o and Vinci (2023). In the model of Bil\`o and Vinci, the more prioritized players produce a finite delay on the less prioritized players, while the delay functions are of a specific kind of affine function, and all resources have the same priorities. By unifying these two models, we achieve a model in which the delay functions may be finite and non-affine, and the priorities of the resources may be distinct. We prove some positive results on the existence and computability of pure Nash equilibria in our model, which extend those for the previous models and support the validity of our model.</description>

      <title>Information Compression in Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the reasons why stochastic dynamic games with an underlying dynamic system are challenging is since strategic players have access to enormous amount of information which leads to the use of extremely complex strategies at equilibrium. One approach to resolve this challenge is to simplify players' strategies by identifying appropriate compression of information maps so that the players can make decisions solely based on the compressed version of information, called the information state. For finite dynamic games with asymmetric information, inspired by the notion of information state for single-agent control problems, we propose two notions of information states, namely mutually sufficient information (MSI) and unilaterally sufficient information (USI). Both these information states are obtained with information compression maps independent of the strategy profile. We show that Bayes-Nash Equilibria (BNE) and Sequential Equilibria (SE) exist when all players use MSI-based strategies. We prove that when all players employ USI-based strategies the resulting sets of BNE and SE payoff profiles are the same as the sets of BNE and SE payoff profiles resulting when all players use full information-based strategies. We prove that when all players use USI-based strategies the resulting set of weak Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (wPBE) payoff profiles can be a proper subset of all wPBE payoff profiles. We identify MSI and USI in specific models of dynamic games in the literature. We end by presenting an open problem: Do there exist strategy-dependent information compression maps that guarantee the existence of at least one equilibrium or maintain all equilibria that exist under perfect recall? We show, by a counterexample, that a well-known strategy-dependent information compression map used in the literature does not possess any of the properties of MSI or USI.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Fairness and Nash Welfare under Subadditive Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a compatibility between fairness and efficiency, captured via Nash Social Welfare (NSW), under the broad class of subadditive valuations. We prove that, for subadditive valuations, there always exists a partial allocation that is envy-free up to the removal of any good (EFx) and has NSW at least half of the optimal; here, optimality is considered across all allocations, fair or otherwise. We also prove, for subadditive valuations, the universal existence of complete allocations that are envy-free up to one good (EF1) and also achieve a factor $1/2$ approximation to the optimal NSW. Our EF1 result resolves an open question posed by Garg et al. (STOC 2023).
  In addition, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm which, given an arbitrary allocation \~A as input, returns an EF1 allocation with NSW at least $1/3$ times that of \~A. Therefore, our results imply that the EF1 criterion can be attained simultaneously with a constant-factor approximation to optimal NSW in polynomial time (with demand queries), for subadditive valuations. The previously best-known approximation factor for optimal NSW, under EF1 and among $n$ agents, was $O(n)$ - we improve this bound to $O(1)$.
  It is known that EF1 and exact Pareto efficiency (PO) are incompatible with subadditive valuations. Complementary to this negative result, the current work shows that we regain compatibility by just considering a factor $1/2$ approximation: EF1 can be achieved in conjunction with $\frac{1}{2}$-PO under subadditive valuations. As such, our results serve as a general tool that can be used as a black box to convert any efficient outcome into a fair one, with only a marginal decrease in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design via the Interim Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study revenue maximization for agents with additive preferences, subject to downward-closed constraints on the set of feasible allocations. In seminal work, Alaei~\cite{alaei2014bayesian} introduced a powerful multi-to-single agent reduction based on an ex-ante relaxation of the multi-agent problem. This reduction employs a rounding procedure which is an online contention resolution scheme (OCRS) in disguise, a now widely-used method for rounding fractional solutions in online Bayesian and stochastic optimization problems. In this paper, we leverage our vantage point, 10 years after the work of Alaei, with a rich OCRS toolkit and modern approaches to analyzing multi-agent mechanisms; we introduce a general framework for designing non-sequential and sequential multi-agent, revenue-maximizing mechanisms, capturing a wide variety of problems Alaei's framework could not address. Our framework uses an \emph{interim} relaxation, that is rounded to a feasible mechanism using what we call a two-level OCRS, which allows for some structured dependence between the activation of its input elements. For a wide family of constraints, we can construct such schemes using existing OCRSs as a black box; for other constraints, such as knapsack, we construct such schemes from scratch. We demonstrate numerous applications of our framework, including a sequential mechanism that guarantees a $\frac{2e}{e-1} \approx 3.16$ approximation to the optimal revenue for the case of additive agents subject to matroid feasibility constraints. We also show how our framework can be easily extended to multi-parameter procurement auctions, where we provide an OCRS for Stochastic Knapsack that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Diversity in Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03938v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics imposed by natural selection on the populations of two competing, sexually reproducing, haploid species. In this setting, the fitness of any genome varies over time due to the changing population mix of the competing species; crucially, this fitness variation arises naturally from the model itself, without the need for imposing it exogenously as is typically the case. Previous work on this model [14] showed that, in the special case where each of the two species exhibits just two phenotypes, genetic diversity is maintained at all times. This finding supported the tenet that sexual reproduction is advantageous because it promotes diversity, which increases the survivability of a species.
  In the present paper we consider the more realistic case where there are more than two phenotypes available to each species. The conclusions about diversity in general turn out to be very different from the two-phenotype case.
  Our first result is negative: namely, we show that sexual reproduction does not guarantee the maintenance of diversity at all times, i.e., the result of [14] does not generalize. Our counterexample consists of two competing species with just three phenotypes each. We show that, for any time~$t_0$ and any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, there is a time $t\ge t_0$ at which the combined diversity of both species is smaller than~$\varepsilon$. Our main result is a complementary positive statement, which says that in any non-degenerate example, diversity is maintained in a weaker, "infinitely often" sense.
  Thus, our results refute the supposition that sexual reproduction ensures diversity at all times, but affirm a weaker assertion that extended periods of high diversity are necessarily a recurrent event.</description>

      <title>How to Mitigate the Dependencies of ChatGPT-4o in Engineering Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of large multimodal models (LMMs) has significantly impacted modern teaching and learning, especially in computer engineering. While LMMs offer extensive opportunities for enhancing learning, they also risk undermining traditional teaching methods and fostering excessive reliance on automated solutions. To counter this, we have developed strategies within curriculum to reduce the dependencies on LMMs that represented by ChatGPT-4o. These include designing course topics that encourage hands-on problem-solving. The proposed strategies were demonstrated through an actual course implementation. Preliminary results show that the methods effectively enhance student engagement and understanding, balancing the benefits of technology with the preservation of traditional learning principles.</description>

      <title>Mode Connectivity in Auction Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal auction design is a fundamental problem in algorithmic game theory. This problem is notoriously difficult already in very simple settings. Recent work in differentiable economics showed that neural networks can efficiently learn known optimal auction mechanisms and discover interesting new ones. In an attempt to theoretically justify their empirical success, we focus on one of the first such networks, RochetNet, and a generalized version for affine maximizer auctions. We prove that they satisfy mode connectivity, i.e., locally optimal solutions are connected by a simple, piecewise linear path such that every solution on the path is almost as good as one of the two local optima. Mode connectivity has been recently investigated as an intriguing empirical and theoretically justifiable property of neural networks used for prediction problems. Our results give the first such analysis in the context of differentiable economics, where neural networks are used directly for solving non-convex optimization problems.</description>
