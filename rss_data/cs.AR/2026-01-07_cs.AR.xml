      <title>Sparsity-Aware Streaming SNN Accelerator with Output-Channel Dataflow for Automatic Modulation Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of wireless communication technologies, including 5G, emerging 6G networks, and the large-scale deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT), has intensified the need for efficient spectrum utilization. Automatic modulation classification (AMC) plays a vital role in cognitive radio systems by enabling real-time identification of modulation schemes for dynamic spectrum access and interference mitigation. While deep neural networks (DNNs) offer high classification accuracy, their computational and energy demands pose challenges for real-time edge deployment. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), with their event-driven nature, offer inherent energy efficiency, but achieving both high throughput and low power under constrained hardware resources remains challenging. This work proposes a sparsity-aware SNN streaming accelerator optimized for AMC tasks. Unlike traditional systolic arrays that exploit sparsity but suffer from low throughput, or streaming architectures that achieve high throughput but cannot fully utilize input and weight sparsity, our design integrates both advantages. By leveraging the fixed nature of kernels during inference, we apply the gated one-to-all product (GOAP) algorithm to compute only on non-zero input-weight intersections. Extra or empty iterations are precomputed and embedded into the inference dataflow, eliminating dynamic data fetches and enabling fully pipelined, control-free inter-layer execution. Implemented on an FPGA, our sparsity-aware output-channel dataflow streaming (SAOCDS) accelerator achieves 23.5 MS/s (approximately double the baseline throughput) on the RadioML 2016 dataset, while reducing dynamic power and maintaining comparable classification accuracy. These results demonstrate strong potential for real-time, low-power deployment in edge cognitive radio systems.</description>

      <title>Advancing Assistive Robotics: Multi-Modal Navigation and Biophysical Monitoring for Next-Generation Wheelchairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assistive electric-powered wheelchairs (EPWs) have become essential mobility aids for people with disabilities such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), post-stroke hemiplegia, and dementia-related mobility impairment. This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability.
  Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data. By integrating multi-modal mobility control with cloud-enabled health monitoring and reporting latency and energy budgets, the proposed prototype addresses key challenges in assistive robotics, contributes toward compliance with ISO 7176-31 and IEC 80601-2-78 safety standards, and establishes a foundation for future adaptive machine learning enhancements.</description>

      <title>SpANNS: Optimizing Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search for Sparse Vectors Using Near Memory Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) is a fundamental operation in vector databases, enabling efficient similarity search in high-dimensional spaces. While dense ANNS has been optimized using specialized hardware accelerators, sparse ANNS remains limited by CPU-based implementations, hindering scalability. This limitation is increasingly critical as hybrid retrieval systems, combining sparse and dense embeddings, become standard in Information Retrieval (IR) pipelines. We propose SpANNS, a near-memory processing architecture for sparse ANNS. SpANNS combines a hybrid inverted index with efficient query management and runtime optimizations. The architecture is built on a CXL Type-2 near-memory platform, where a specialized controller manages query parsing and cluster filtering, while compute-enabled DIMMs perform index traversal and distance computations close to the data. It achieves 15.2x to 21.6x faster execution over the state-of-the-art CPU baselines, offering scalable and efficient solutions for sparse vector search.</description>
