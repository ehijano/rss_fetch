      <title>Discovery of Fatigue Strength Models via Feature Engineering and automated eXplainable Machine Learning applied to the welded Transverse Stiffener</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research introduces a unified approach combining Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict fatigue strength in welded transverse stiffener details. It integrates expert-driven feature engineering with algorithmic feature creation to enhance accuracy and explainability.
  Based on the extensive fatigue test database regression models - gradient boosting, random forests, and neural networks - were trained using AutoML under three feature schemes: domain-informed, algorithmic, and combined. This allowed a systematic comparison of expert-based versus automated feature selection.
  Ensemble methods (e.g. CatBoost, LightGBM) delivered top performance. The domain-informed model $\mathcal M_2$ achieved the best balance: test RMSE $\approx$ 30.6 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.780% over the full $\Delta \sigma_{c,50\%}$ range, and RMSE $\approx$ 13.4 MPa and $R^2 \approx 0.527% within the engineering-relevant 0 - 150 MPa domain. The denser-feature model ($\mathcal M_3$) showed minor gains during training but poorer generalization, while the simpler base-feature model ($\mathcal M_1$) performed comparably, confirming the robustness of minimalist designs.
  XAI methods (SHAP and feature importance) identified stress ratio $R$, stress range $\Delta \sigma_i$, yield strength $R_{eH}$, and post-weld treatment (TIG dressing vs. as-welded) as dominant predictors. Secondary geometric factors - plate width, throat thickness, stiffener height - also significantly affected fatigue life.
  This framework demonstrates that integrating AutoML with XAI yields accurate, interpretable, and robust fatigue strength models for welded steel structures. It bridges data-driven modeling with engineering validation, enabling AI-assisted design and assessment. Future work will explore probabilistic fatigue life modeling and integration into digital twin environments.</description>

      <title>Time Resolution Independent Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately learning solution operators for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) from sparse and irregular data remains a challenging task. Recurrent DeepONet extensions inherit the discrete-time limitations of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) RNN architectures, while neural-ODE surrogates cannot incorporate new inputs after initialization. We introduce NCDE-DeepONet, a continuous-time operator network that embeds a Neural Controlled Differential Equation (NCDE) in the branch and augments the trunk with explicit space-time coordinates. The NCDE encodes an entire load history as the solution of a controlled ODE driven by a spline-interpolated input path, making the representation input-resolution-independent: it encodes different input signal discretizations of the observed samples. The trunk then probes this latent path at arbitrary spatial locations and times, rendering the overall map output-resolution independent: predictions can be queried on meshes and time steps unseen during training without retraining or interpolation. Benchmarks on transient Poisson, elastodynamic, and thermoelastic problems confirm the robustness and accuracy of the framework, achieving almost instant solution prediction. These findings suggest that controlled dynamics provide a principled and efficient foundation for high-fidelity operator learning in transient mechanics.</description>

      <title>Imitation and Heterogeneity Shape the Resilience of Community Currency Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community currency networks are made up of individuals and or companies that share some physical or social characteristics and engage in economic transactions using a virtual currency. This paper investigates the structural and dynamic properties of such mutual credit systems through a case study of Sardex, a community currency initiated and mainly operating in Sardinia, Italy. The transaction network is modeled as a directed weighted graph and analyzed through a graph theoretic framework focused on the analysis of strongly connected components, condensed representations, and behavioral connectivity patterns. Emphasis is placed on understanding the evolution of the network's core and peripheral structures over a three year period, with attention to temporal contraction, flow asymmetries, and structural fragmentation depending on different user types. Our findings reveal persistent deviations from degree based null models and suggest the presence of behavioral imitation, specifically, a user preference for more active peers. We further assess the impact of heterogeneous connections between different type of users, which strengthen the network topology and enhance its resilience.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Guided Symbolic Regression for Data-Efficient Kinetic Model Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The industrialization of catalytic processes hinges on the availability of reliable kinetic models for design, optimization, and control. Traditional mechanistic models demand extensive domain expertise, while many data-driven approaches often lack interpretability and fail to enforce physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Automated Discovery of Kinetics (PI-ADoK) framework. By integrating physical constraints directly into a symbolic regression approach, PI-ADoK narrows the search space and substantially reduces the number of experiments required for model convergence. Additionally, the framework incorporates a robust uncertainty quantification strategy via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which propagates parameter uncertainty to yield credible prediction intervals. Benchmarking our method against conventional approaches across several catalytic case studies demonstrates that PI-ADoK not only enhances model fidelity but also lowers the experimental burden, highlighting its potential for efficient and reliable kinetic model discovery in chemical reaction engineering.</description>

      <title>DeepSupp: Attention-Driven Correlation Pattern Analysis for Dynamic Time Series Support and Resistance Levels Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use, traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&amp;P 500 tickers demonstrate that DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.</description>

      <title>On the Design of Corrugated Boards: A New FEM Modeling and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a simplified FEM modeling approach suitable for large structures made of corrugated boards, such as customized packages, based on a homogenization method, which is combined with correction factors for internal mechanisms. The homogenization process reduces computational time by transforming flute geometries into equivalent elastic models. In large deformations and in the presence of contact for a given geometry, the effective elastic modulus in the thickness direction, as well as the effective thickness of the structure, are corrected by two statistical Weibull distributions representing the contact and buckling mechanisms in a corrugated board. The Weibull parameters are obtained via experimental analysis, and such a process is then validated. The results demonstrate that the statistical parameters ($\beta_1 = 0.14$, $\beta_2 = 1.31$) can be used for the simplistic representation of corrugated boards, being computationally efficient. This research contributes to the optimization of corrugated packaging design, specifically by simplifying FEM models for faster yet equally accurate simulations.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Finite Element Method for Investigating Fiber Remodeling in Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant hallmark of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is fiber disarray, which is associated with various cardiac events such as heart failure. Quantifying fiber disarray remains critical for understanding the disease s complex pathophysiology. This study investigates the role of heterogeneous HCM-induced cellular abnormalities in the development of fiber disarray and their subsequent impact on cardiac pumping function. Fiber disarray is predicted using a stress-based law to reorient myofibers and collagen within a multiscale finite element cardiac modeling framework, MyoFE. Specifically, the model is used to quantify the distinct impacts of heterogeneous distributions of hypercontractility, hypocontractility, and fibrosis on fiber disarray development and examines their effect on functional characteristics of the heart. Our results show that heterogenous cell level abnormalities highly disrupt the normal mechanics of myocardium and lead to significant fiber disarray. The pattern of disarray varies depending on the specific perturbation, offering valuable insights into the progression of HCM. Despite the random distribution of perturbed regions within the cardiac muscle, significantly higher fiber disarray is observed near the epicardium compared to the endocardium across all perturbed left ventricle (LV) models. This regional difference in fiber disarray, irrespective of perturbation severity, aligns with previous DT-MRI studies, highlighting the role of regional myocardial mechanics in the development of fiber disarray. Furthermore, cardiac performance declined in the remodeled LVs, particularly in those with fibrosis and hypocontractility. These findings provide important insights into the structural and functional consequences of HCM and offer a framework for future investigations into therapeutic interventions targeting cardiac remodeling.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Effective Elastic Modulus and Thickness of Corrugated Boards Using Gaussian Process Regression and Expected Hypervolume Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to model the hypersurface of the effective elastic modulus, \( E_{z, \text{eff}} \), and thickness, \( th_{\text{eff}} \), in corrugated boards. A Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is followed by Gaussian Process Regression (GP), enhanced by EHVI as a multi-objective acquisition function. Accurate modeling of \( E_{z, \text{eff}} \) and \( th_{\text{eff}} \) is critical for optimizing the mechanical properties of corrugated materials in engineering applications. LHS provides an efficient and straightforward approach for an initial sampling of the input space; GP is expected to be able to adapt to the complexity of the response surfaces by incorporating both prediction and uncertainty. Therefore, the next points being generated and evaluated are based on the complexity of the hypersurfaces, and some points, especially those with higher variance, are more exploited and carry more importance. The performance of GP with EHVI is measured by Mean Squared Error (MSE). Prediction of GP resulted in \( \text{MSE}(E_{z, \text{eff}}) = 5.24 \, \text{kPa}^2 \) and \( \text{MSE}(th_{\text{eff}}) = 1 \, \text{mm}^2 \). GP possesses then improved accuracy and adaptability for future applications in structural optimization.</description>

      <title>Advances in Particle Flow Filters with Taylor Expansion Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle Flow Filters perform the measurement update by moving particles to a different location rather than modifying the particles' weight based on the likelihood. Their movement (flow) is dictated by a drift term, which continuously pushes the particle toward the posterior distribution, and a diffusion term, which guarantees the spread of particles. This work presents a novel derivation of these terms based on high-order polynomial expansions, where the common techniques based on linearization reduce to a simpler version of the new methodology. Thanks to differential algebra, the high-order particle flow is derived directly onto the polynomials representation of the distribution, embedded with differentiation and evaluation. The resulting technique proposes two new particle flow filters, whose difference relies on the selection of the expansion center for the Taylor polynomial evaluation. Numerical applications show the improvement gained by the inclusion of high-order terms, especially when comparing performance with the Gromov flow and the "exact" flow.</description>
