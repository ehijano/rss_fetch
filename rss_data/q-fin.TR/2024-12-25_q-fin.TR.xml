      <title>Generalized Mean Absolute Directional Loss as a Solution to Overfitting and High Transaction Costs in Machine Learning Models Used in High-Frequency Algorithmic Investment Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regardless of the selected asset class and the level of model complexity (Transformer versus LSTM versus Perceptron/RNN), the GMADL loss function produces superior results than standard MSE-type loss functions and has better numerical properties in the context of optimization than MADL. Better results mean the possibility of achieving a higher risk-weighted return based on buy and sell signals built on forecasts generated by a given theoretical model estimated using the GMADL versus MSE or MADL function. In practice, GMADL solves the problem of selecting the most preferable feature in both classification and regression problems, improving the performance of each estimation. What is important is that, through additional parameterization, GMADL also solves the problem of optimizing investment systems on high-frequency data in such a way that they focus on strategy variants that contain fewer transactions so that transaction costs do not reduce the effectiveness of a given strategy to zero. Moreover, the implementation leverages state-of-the-art machine learning tools, including frameworks for hyperparameter tuning, architecture testing, and walk-forward optimization, ensuring robust and scalable solutions for real-world algorithmic trading.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework for modelling CLMM dynamics in continuous time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous mathematical framework for analyzing Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) within a continuous-time setting. We model the evolution of liquidity profiles as measure-valued processes and characterize their dynamics under continuous trading. Our analysis encompasses two critical aspects of CLMMs: the mechanics of concentrated liquidity provision and the strategic behavior of arbitrageurs. We examine three distinct arbitrage models -- myopic, finite-horizon, and infinite-horizon with discounted and ergodic controls -- and derive closed-form solutions for optimal arbitrage strategies under each scenario. Importantly, we demonstrate that the presence of trading fees fundamentally constrains the admissible price processes, as the inclusion of fees precludes the existence of diffusion terms in the price process to avoid infinite fee generation. This finding has significant implications for CLMM design and market efficiency.</description>
