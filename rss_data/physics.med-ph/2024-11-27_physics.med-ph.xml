      <title>Efficient Proton Transport Modelling for Proton Beam Therapy and Biological Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a fundamental mathematical model for proton transport, tailored to capture the key physical processes underpinning Proton Beam Therapy (PBT). The model provides a robust and computationally efficient framework for exploring various aspects of PBT, including dose delivery, linear energy transfer, treatment planning and the evaluation of relative biological effectiveness. Our findings highlight the potential of this model as a complementary tool to more complex and computationally intensive simulation techniques currently used in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Improving Deformable Image Registration Accuracy through a Hybrid Similarity Metric and CycleGAN Based Auto-Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Deformable image registration (DIR) is critical in adaptive radiation therapy (ART) to account for anatomical changes. Conventional intensity-based DIR methods often fail when image intensities differ. This study evaluates a hybrid similarity metric combining intensity and structural information, leveraging CycleGAN-based intensity correction and auto-segmentation across three DIR workflows. Methods: A hybrid similarity metric combining a point-to-distance (PD) score and intensity similarity was implemented. Synthetic CT (sCT) images were generated using a 2D CycleGAN model trained on unpaired CT and CBCT images to enhance soft-tissue contrast. DIR workflows compared included: (1) traditional intensity-based (No PD), (2) auto-segmented contours on sCT (CycleGAN PD), and (3) expert manual contours (Expert PD). A 3D U-Net model trained on 56 images and validated on 14 cases segmented the prostate, bladder, and rectum. DIR accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD), and fiducial separation. Results: The hybrid metric improved DIR accuracy. For the prostate, DSC increased from 0.61+/-0.18 (No PD) to 0.82+/-0.13 (CycleGAN PD) and 0.89+/-0.05 (Expert PD), with reductions in 95% HD from 11.75 mm to 4.86 mm and 3.27 mm, respectively. Fiducial separation decreased from 8.95 mm to 4.07 mm (CycleGAN PD) and 4.11 mm (Expert PD) (p &lt; 0.05). Improvements were also observed for the bladder and rectum. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that a hybrid similarity metric using CycleGAN-based auto-segmentation improves DIR accuracy, particularly for low-contrast CBCT images. These findings highlight the potential for integrating AI-based image correction and segmentation into ART workflows to enhance precision and streamline clinical processes.</description>

      <title>Multi-IMPT: a biologically equivalent approach to proton ARC therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Proton spot-scanning arc therapy (ARC) is an emerging modality that can improve the high-dose conformity to targets compared with standard intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT). However, the efficient treatment delivery of ARC is challenging due to the required frequent energy changes during the continuous gantry rotation. This work proposes a novel method that delivers a multiple IMPT (multi-IMPT) plan that is equivalent to ARC in terms of biologically effective dose (BED).
  Approach: The proposed multi-IMPT method utilizes a different subset of limited number of beam angles in each fraction for dose delivery. Due to the different dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR) in each fraction, we optimize biologically effective dose (BED) for OAR and the physical dose delivered for target in each fraction. The BED-based multi-IMPT inverse optimization problem is solved via the iterative convex relaxation method and the alternating direction method of multipliers. The effectiveness of the proposed multi-IMPT method is evaluated in terms of dose objectives in comparison with ARC.
  Main results: Multi-IMPT provided similar plan quality with ARC. For example, multi-IMPT provided better OAR sparing and slightly better target dose coverage for the prostate case; similar dose distribution for the lung case; slightly worse dose coverage for the brain case; better dose coverage but slightly higher BED in OAR for the head-and-neck case.
  Significance: We have proposed a multi-IMPT approach to deliver ARC-equivalent plan quality.

      <title>Noninvasive Extraction of Maternal and Fetal Electrocardiograms Using Progressive Periodic Source Peel-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01281</link>

Abstract: Abdominal electrocardiogram (AECG) gives a safe and non-invasive way to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy using surface electrodes. However, it is challenging to extract weak fetal ECG (fECG) from the AECG recordings with larger maternal ECG (mECG) and external noises. In this study, we introduce a novel progressive periodic source peel-off (PPSP) method for extracting periodic ECG sources from multi-channel AECG recordings, including three main modules: 1) A periodic constrained FastICA (PCFICA) module with ECG physiology-informed constraints for extracting precise ECG spike trains, 2) A singular value decomposition module for estimating ECG waveforms, and 3) A peel-off strategy that facilitates to discern weak fECG source by eliminating previously separated sources or noises. The performance of the PPSP method was examined on two public databases, synthetic data and our clinical data. For extracting fECG spike trains, our PPSP method achieved an F1-scores of 99.59% on public data, 99.50% on synthetic data at the highest noise level. It further yielded the lowest RMSE of fetal heart rate of 6.20% on clinical data. It significantly outperformed other state-of-the-art methods on any set of data (p &lt; 0.05). This study demonstrated effectiveness of the PPSP method for extracting and separating mECG and weak fECG signals, with high precision especially at high noise levels. Our study promotes noninvasive measurement and intelligent monitoring of both fetal and maternal heart activities towards advanced healthcare in perinatal medicine.</description>

      <title>A physical perspective on lithium therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lithium salts have strong medical properties in neurological disorders such as bipolar disorder and lithium-responsive headaches. They have recently gathered attention due to their potential preventive effect in viral infections. Though the therapeutic effect of lithium was documented by Cade in the late 1940s, its underlying mechanism of action is still disputed. Acute lithium exposure has an activating effect on excitable organic tissue and organisms, and is highly toxic. Lithium exposure is associated with a strong metabolic response in the organism, with large changes in phospholipid and cholesterol expression. Opposite to acute exposure, this metabolic response alleviates excessive cellular activity.
  The presence of lithium ions strongly affects lipid conformation and membrane phase unlike other alkali ions, with consequences for membrane permeability, buffer property and excitability. This review investigates how lithium ions affect lipid membrane composition and function, and how lithium response might in fact be the body's attempt to counteract the physical presence of lithium ions at cell level. Ideas for further research in microbiology and drug development are discussed.</description>
