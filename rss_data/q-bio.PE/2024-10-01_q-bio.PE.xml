      <title>AgentBasedModeling.jl: a tool for stochastic simulation of structured population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19294v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models capture heterogeneity among individuals in a population and are widely used in studies of multi-cellular systems, disease, epidemics and demography to name a few. However, existing frameworks consider discrete time-step simulation or assume that agents' states only change as a result of discrete events. In this note, we present $\text{AgentBasedModeling.jl}$, a Julia package for simulating stochastic agent-based population models in continuous time. The tool allows to easily specify and simulate agents evolving through generic continuous-time jump-diffusions and interacting via continuous-rate processes. $\text{AgentBasedModeling.jl}$ provides a powerful methodology for studying the effects of stochasticity on structured population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability of evolutionarily stable strategy in asymmetric games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quasi-cycles as a simple explanation for the time evolution of the Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine ecological reserve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dataset collected at the Cape Rodney-Okakari Point Marine (CR-OPM) reserve on the North Island of New Zealand is rather unique. It describes the cyclic time evolution of a rocky intertidal community, with the relative abundances of the various coastal species that have been meticulously monitored for more than 20 years. Past theoretical studies, anchored on a deterministic description, required invoking ad hoc mechanisms to reproduce the observed dynamical paths. Following a maximum likelihood approach to interpolate individual stochastic trajectories, we here propose quasi-cycles as an alternative and simpler mechanism to explain the oscillations observed in the population numbers of the ecosystem. From a general standpoint, we also show that it is possible to return conclusive evidence on the existence of stochastic quasi-cycles, without resorting to global fitting strategies which necessitate handling a large collection of independent replicas of the dynamics, a possibility that is often precluded in real life applications.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Behaviour of SIR Models with Cross-Diffusion and Vital Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary epidemiological models often involve spatial variation, providing an avenue to investigate the averaged dynamics of individual movements. In this work, we extend a recent model by Vaziry, Kolokolnikov, and Kevrekidis [Royal Society Open Science 9 (10), 2022] that included, in both infected and susceptible population dynamics equations, a cross-diffusion term with the second spatial derivative of the infected population density. Diffusion terms of this type occur, for example, in the Keller-Siegel chemotaxis model. The presented model corresponds to local orderly commute of susceptible and infected individuals, and is shown to arise in two dimensions as a limit of a discrete process. The present contribution identifies and studies specific features of the new model's dynamics, including various types of infection waves and buffer zones protected from the infection. The model with vital dynamics additionally exhibits complex spatiotemporal behaviour that involves the generation of quasiperiodic infection waves and emergence of transient strongly heterogeneous patterns.</description>

      <title>Probability Metrics for Tropical Spaces of Different Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of comparing probability distributions is at the heart of many tasks in statistics and machine learning. Established comparison methods treat the standard setting that the distributions are supported in the same space. Recently, a new geometric solution has been proposed to address the more challenging problem of comparing measures in Euclidean spaces of differing dimensions. Here, we study the same problem of comparing probability distributions of different dimensions in the tropical setting, which is becoming increasingly relevant in applications involving complex data structures such as phylogenetic trees. Specifically, we construct a Wasserstein distance between measures on different tropical projective tori -- the focal metric spaces in both theory and applications of tropical geometry -- via tropical mappings between probability measures. We prove equivalence of the directionality of the maps, whether mapping from a low dimensional space to a high dimensional space or vice versa. As an important practical implication, our work provides a framework for comparing probability distributions on the spaces of phylogenetic trees with different leaf sets. We demonstrate the computational feasibility of our approach using existing optimisation techniques on both simulated and real data.</description>
