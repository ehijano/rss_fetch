      <title>Hybrid Predictive Modeling of Malaria Incidence in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia: Integrating Multi-Output Regression and Time-Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in the Amhara Region, where seasonal and unpredictable transmission patterns make prevention and control challenging. Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations, whereas the hybrid framework captures both seasonal patterns and correlations among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable information to public health authorities. This study provides a valid and repeatable malaria incidence prediction framework that can support evidence-based decision-making, targeted interventions, and resource optimization in endemic areas.</description>

      <title>Charting dissipation across the microbial world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy dissipated by a living organism is commonly identified with heat generation. However, as cells exchange metabolites with their environment they also dissipate energy in the form of chemical entropy. How dissipation is distributed between exchanges of heat and chemical entropy is largely unexplored. Here, we analyze an extensive experimental database recently created [1] to investigate how microbes partition dissipation between thermal and chemical entropy during growth. We find that aerobic respiration exchanges little chemical entropy and dissipation is primarily due to heat production, as commonly assumed. However, we also find several types of anaerobic metabolism that produce as much chemical entropy as heat. Counterintuitively, instances of anaerobic metabolisms such as acetotrophic methanogenesis and sulfur respiration are endothermic. We conclude that, because of their metabolic versatility, microbes are able to exploit all combinations of heat and chemical entropy exchanges that result in a net production of entropy.</description>

      <title>Automated Genomic Interpretation via Concept Bottleneck Models for Medical Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an automated genomic interpretation module that transforms raw DNA sequences into actionable, interpretable decisions suitable for integration into medical automation and robotic systems. Our framework combines Chaos Game Representation (CGR) with a Concept Bottleneck Model (CBM), enforcing predictions to flow through biologically meaningful concepts such as GC content, CpG density, and k mer motifs. To enhance reliability, we incorporate concept fidelity supervision, prior consistency alignment, KL distribution matching, and uncertainty calibration. Beyond accurate classification of HIV subtypes across both in-house and LANL datasets, our module delivers interpretable evidence that can be directly validated against biological priors. A cost aware recommendation layer further translates predictive outputs into decision policies that balance accuracy, calibration, and clinical utility, reducing unnecessary retests and improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed system achieves state of the art classification performance, superior concept prediction fidelity, and more favorable cost benefit trade-offs compared to existing baselines. By bridging the gap between interpretable genomic modeling and automated decision-making, this work establishes a reliable foundation for robotic and clinical automation in genomic medicine.</description>
