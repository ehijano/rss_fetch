      <title>Limb-Brightened Jet in M87 from Anisotropic Nonthermal Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry observations reveal that relativistic jets like the one in M87 have a limb-brightened, double-edged structure. Analytic and numerical models struggle to reproduce this limb-brightening. We propose a model in which we invoke anisotropy in the distribution function of synchrotron-emitting nonthermal electrons such that electron velocities are preferentially directed parallel to magnetic field lines, as suggested by recent particle-in-cell simulations of electron acceleration and the effects of synchrotron cooling. We assume that the energy injected into nonthermal electrons is proportional to the jet Poynting flux, and we account for synchrotron cooling via a broken power-law energy distribution. We implement our emission model in both general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and axisymmetric force-free electrodynamic (GRFFE) jet models and produce simulated jet images at multiple scales and frequencies using polarized general relativistic radiative transfer. We find that the synchrotron emission is concentrated parallel to the local helical magnetic field and that this feature produces limb-brightened jet images on scales ranging from tens of microarcseconds to hundreds of milliarcseconds in M87. We present theoretical predictions for horizon-scale M87 jet images at 230 and 345 GHz that can be tested with next generation instruments. Due to the scale-invariance of the GRMHD and GRFFE models, our emission prescription can be applied to other targets and serve as a foundation for a unified description of limb-brightened synchrotron images of extragalactic jets.</description>

      <title>Super-Kamiokande Strongly Constrains Leptophilic Dark Matter Capture in the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun can efficiently capture leptophilic dark matter that scatters with free electrons. If this dark matter subsequently annihilates into leptonic states, it can produce a detectable neutrino flux. Using 10 years of Super-Kamiokande observations, we set constraints on the dark-matter/electron scattering cross-section that exceed terrestrial direct detection searches by more than an order of magnitude for dark matter masses below 100 GeV, and reach cross-sections as low as $\sim$4$\times$10$^{-41}$cm$^{-2}$.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Observations of Galaxy Clusters Strongly Constrain Dark Matter Annihilation in Prompt Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal dark matter models generically include the prompt creation of highly-concentrated dark matter cusps in the early Universe. Recent studies find that these cusps can survive to the present day, as long as they do not fall into extremely dense regions of baryonic structure. In this work, we build models of dark matter annihilation within the prompt cusps that reside in galaxy clusters, showing that they dominate the total $\gamma$-ray annihilation signal. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, we find no evidence for a $\gamma$-ray excess from these sources, and set strong constraints on annihilating dark matter. These constraints generically rule out the thermal annihilation cross-section to the $b\bar{b}$ channel for dark matter masses below $\sim$200~GeV.</description>

      <title>Tracking X-ray Variability in Next Generation EHT LLAGN Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 5 month NICER X-ray monitoring campaign for two low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs) -- NGC 4594 and IC 1459 -- with complementary Swift and NuSTAR observations. Utilizing an absorbed power law and thermal source model combined with NICER's SCORPEON background model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of joint source/background modeling for constraining emission from faint, background-dominated targets. Both sources are dominated by nuclear power law emission with photon indices $\Gamma \sim 1.5 - 2$, with NGC 4594 being slightly harder than IC 1459. The thermal contribution in both sources is fainter, but constant, with $kT \sim 0.5$ keV ($\sim 5 \times 10^6$ K). The power law flux and $\Gamma$ are strongly anti-correlated in both sources, as has been seen for other LLAGNs with radiatively inefficient accretion flows. NGC 4594 is the brighter source and exhibits significant aperiodic variability. Its variability timescale with an upper limit of $5 - 7$ days indicates emission originating from $&lt; 100 R_{g}$, at the scale of the inner accretion flow. A spectral break found at $\sim 6$ keV, while tentative, could arise from synchrotron/inverse compton emission. This high-cadence LLAGN X-ray monitoring campaign underlines the importance of multi-wavelength variability studies for a sample of LLAGNs to truly understand their accretion and outflow physics.</description>

      <title>Study of long-term spectral evolution and X-ray and Gamma-ray correlation of blazars seen by HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HAWC Observatory collected 6 years of extensive data, providing an ideal platform for long-term monitoring of blazars in the Very High Energy (VHE) band, without bias towards specific flux states. HAWC continuously monitors blazar activity at TeV energies, focusing on sources with a redshift of {z \lt 0.3}, based on the Third Fermi-LAT Catalog of High-Energy sources. We specifically focused our analysis on Mrk 421 and Mrk 501, as they are the brightest blazars observed by the HAWC Observatory. With a dataset of 2143 days, this work significantly extends the monitoring previously published, which was based on 511 days of observation. By utilizing HAWC data for the VHE {\gamma}-ray emission in the 300 GeV to 100 TeV energy range, in conjunction with Swift-XRT data for the 0.3 to 10 keV X-ray emission, we aim to explore potential correlations between these two bands. For Mrk 501, we found evidence of a long-term correlation. Additionally, we identified a period in the light curve where the flux was very low for more than two years. On the other hand, our analysis of Mrk 421 measured a strong linear correlation for quasi-simultaneous observations collected by HAWC and Swift-XRT. This result is consistent with a linear dependence and a multiple-zone synchrotron self-Compton model to explain the X-ray and the {\gamma}-ray emission. Finally, as suggested by previous findings, we confirm a harder-when-brighter behavior in the spectral evolution of the flux properties for Mrk 421. These findings contribute to the understanding of blazar emissions and their underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Black Hole Spin for the X-Ray Binary MAXI J1727-203 Based on Insight-HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the spin of the black hole (BH) candidate MAXI J1727-203 using Insight-HXMT data. Due to limited HXMT observations covering only part of the outburst, NICER data were used to analyze the full outburst's state transitions, we identified two of three HXMT observations in the high soft state and applied the continuum-fitting method to measure the spin. Based on previous estimates and continuum spectral fittings, we explored the parameter space and found that the best-fitting values were $(D, i, M) \approx (6\ \text{kpc}, 30^\circ, 12 M_{\odot})$. We also tested the variation of these parameters using Monte Carlo simulations, sampling over 3000 sets within the parameter ranges: $5.9 \text{kpc}&lt; D&lt;7 \text{kpc}$, $24^\circ&lt;i&lt; 35^\circ$, and $10 M_{\odot}&lt;M&lt;14 M_{\odot}$, yielding a spin measurement of $a=0.34_{-0.19}^{+0.15}$ (1$\sigma$). In addition, we analyzed NuSTAR data in low hard state and found a good fit with the {\tt tbabs*(diskbb+powerlaw)} model, with no significant iron line features observed in the residuals, then the previous reflection model results suggesting an extremely high spin would over-estimate the BH spin.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Magneto-gravitational Processes in Supermassive Black Hole Binary PG 1553+113</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PG1553+113 has drawn significant attention for its quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in gamma-ray variability, though the origin of its variability remains uncertain. In this study, we propose a physical mechanism to explain the observed gamma-ray variability within the framework of a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) system, supported by a newly identified component hidden in the light curve. A detailed analysis for its about 16-year light curve obtained from Fermi-LAT observations is performed by Gaussian process (GP). As anticipated, the QPO of 2.1 years is effectively captured by the stochastically-driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO) kernel within the under-damped regime, and the overall stochastic nature of the variability is described by the damped random walk (DRW) kernel albeit with an unconstrained damping timescale. Additionally, our results reveal a previously unrecognized component in active galactic nuclei variability, characterized by the Mat\'ern-3/2 kernel, which is typically associated with systems undergoing abrupt energy release. These findings can be consistently interpreted within the SMBHB framework. The QPO of about 2.1 years is likely attributed to the orbital motion in a SMBHB system. The Mat\'ern-3/2 component is interpreted as resulting from magnetic reconnection events triggered by gravitational perturbations of the magnetic field within the jet, occurring as one black hole approaches the other. Meanwhile, in this case, the damping timescale of the common DRW kernel remains unconstrained due to the influence of new perturbations within the system.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Separable Solutions of Force-Free Magnetic Fields in Plane-Parallel and Axial Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a systematic method for identifying analytical and semi-analytical solutions of force-free magnetic fields with plane-parallel and axial symmetry. The method of separation of variables is used, allowing the transformation of the non-linear partial differential equation, corresponding to force-free magnetic fields, to a system of decoupled ordinary differential equations, which nevertheless, are in general non-linear. It is then shown that such solutions are feasible for configurations where the electric current has a logarithmic dependence to the magnetic field flux. The properties of the magnetic fields are studied for a variety of physical parameters, through solution of the systems of the ordinary differential equations for various values of the parameters. It is demonstrated that this new logarithmic family of solutions has properties that are highly distinct from the known linear and non-linear equations, as it allows for bounded solutions of magnetic fields, for periodic solutions and for solutions that extend to infinity. Possible applications to astrophysical fields and plasmas are discussed as well as their use in numerical studies, and the overall enrichment of our understanding of force-free configurations.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional core-collapse supernova models with phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional supernova simulations with a phenomenological treatment of neutrino flavor conversions. We show that the explosion energy can increase to as high as ~10^51 erg depending on the critical density for the onset of flavor conversions, due to a significant enhancement of the mean energy of electron antineutrinos. Our results confirm previous studies showing such energetic explosions, but for the first time in three-dimensional configurations. In addition, we predict neutrino and gravitational wave (GW) signals from a nearby supernova explosion aided by flavor conversions. We find that the neutrino event number decreases because of the reduced flux of heavy-lepton neutrinos. In order to detect GWs, next-generation GW telescopes such as Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope are needed even if the supernova event is located at the Galactic center. These findings show that the neutrino flavor conversions can significantly change supernova dynamics and highlight the importance of further studies on the quantum kinetic equations to determine the conditions of the conversions and their asymptotic states.</description>

      <title>Observations of the X-ray Millihertz Quasiperiodic Oscillations in Hercules X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a systematic timing investigation of the persistent X-ray binary pulsar Her X-1 based on a large number of Insight-HXMT observations between 2017 to 2019, we confirm the presence of X-ray millihertz quasi-periodic oscillations (mHz QPOs) at $\sim 0.01$ Hz. By applying wavelet analysis in our data analysis procedures, we firstly identified $\sim 0.005-0.009$ Hz QPOs coexisting with the $\sim 0.01$ Hz QPOs. Wavelet analysis suggests that these QPO features show transient behaviors, frequencies of mHz QPOs evolved in short time scales. There exists a positive relation between QPO centroid frequency (from $\sim 0.005-0.009$ Hz) and the X-ray luminosity, while the 10 mHz QPO frequencies keep nearly constant for different luminosities, which suggests different physical mechanisms for two types of mHz QPOs. The 10 mHz QPOs in both X-ray and UV bands would have the same origin related to the beat frequency where the Alfv$\acute{e}$n radius is close to the corotation radius, and the 5 mHz QPOs may originate from magnetic disk precession.</description>

      <title>Constraining Disk-to-Corona Power Transfer Fraction, Soft X-ray Excess Origin, and Black Hole Spin Population of Type-1 AGN across Mass Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of the accretion disk, its interplay with the X-ray corona, and assessing black hole spin demographics are some open challenges in astrophysics. In this work, we examine the predictions of the standard $\alpha$-disk model, origin of the soft X-ray excess, and measure the black hole spin parameter by applying the updated high-density disk reflection model to the XMM-Newton/NuSTAR broadband (0.3$-$78 keV) X-ray spectra of a sample of Type-1 AGN. Our Bayesian analysis confirms that the high-density relativistic reflection model with a broken power-law emissivity profile can simultaneously fit the soft X-ray excess, broad iron K line, and Compton hump for $\sim$70% of the sample, while an additional warm Comptonization model is still required to describe the observed soft X-ray excess for the remaining sources. Our first-ever calculation of the disk-to-corona power transfer fraction reveals that the fraction of power released from the accretion disk into the hot corona can have diverse values, the sample median of which is $0.7_{-0.4}^{+0.2}$. We find that the transferred power from the accretion disk can potentially soften the X-ray spectrum of the hot corona. The median values of the hot coronal temperature and optical depth for the sample are estimated to be $63_{-11}^{+23}$ keV and $0.85_{-0.27}^{+0.12}$, respectively. Finally, through joint XMM-Newton+NuSTAR relativistic reflection spectroscopy, we systematically constrain the black hole spin parameter across the broad range of black hole masses, $\log(M_{\rm BH}/M_{\odot}) \sim 5.5-9.0$, and increase the available spin measurements in the AGN population by $\sim$20%.</description>

      <title>Detection of the cosmological evolution of the Doppler factor for blazars jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Doppler factor ($\delta$) is a fundamental quality for the relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGNs). It is also fundamental to assessing the number of the entire population of the jetted AGN at high redshift ($z$), and therefore is important for tracing the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) across cosmic time. Here we present the identification of the positive cosmic evolution of the Doppler factor in {\it Fermi}-detected bright $\gamma-$ray blazars. The redshift dependence of the Doppler factor, $\delta\propto(1+z)^{0.8}$, is measured from the observed characteristic energies in the gamma-ray spectra of 141 blazars. Moreover, the analysis of the characteristic timescales derived from modeling the long-term optical light curves of 89 blazars with Gaussian process regression gives $\delta\propto(1+z)^{1.1}$, but with a larger scatter. \textbf{Note that each index is derived from the entire sample, representing an average evolution. Interestingly, the index itself also appears to evolve, with low-luminosity sources showing stronger evolution, as indicated by a larger index.} This detection straightly suggests that relativistic jets from AGNs are much more common at high redshifts than what is previously estimated.</description>

      <title>The role of equation of state on the spin-up of millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are recycled pulsars which have been spun-up due to mass accretion during the phase of mass exchange in binaries. Although the interactions with companion stars play important roles on the spin-up process, the global properties of pulsars determined by the equation of state (EoS), such as mass, radius and the moment of inertia, should also play a role. We investigate the spin-up of MSPs in neutron star (NS) and strangeon star (SS) models, both of which have passed the tests by the existence of high-mass pulsars and the tidal deformability of GW170817. Combining the spin-up condition and the transferred angular momentum, we can constrain the accreted mass and the magnetic field strength. The results indicate that it is easier for an SS to form a fully recycled low-mass MPS, whose spin-period is below 10 ms and mass is below about $1.5 M_\odot$, than that for an NS. Finding more MSPs with low mass and and short spin-period could help to put more strict constraints on the EoS of pulsars.</description>

      <title>Constraints on fast radio burst population from the first CHIME/FRB catalog from Hierarchical Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as one of the most dynamic areas of research in astronomy and cosmology. Despite increasing number of FRBs have been reported, the exact origin of FRBs remains elusive. Investigating the intrinsic distributions of FRBs could provide valuable insights into their possible origins and enhance the power of FRBs a cosmological probe. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach combining with several viable models to investigate the population information of FRBs released in the CHIME catalog 1. By utilizing this method, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and characteristics of the FRB population. Taking into account the uncertainties and complex relationships within the data. We find that the distribution of FRBs does not trace the history of star formation, and there is evidence that the FRB population has time delay with respect to the history of star formation.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a new phase-transient cyclotron line in A0535+26: Constraints on the accretion geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In November 2020, A0535+26 underwent one of its brightest outbursts, reaching nearly 12 Crab in X-ray flux. Observed by \textit{Insight-HXMT}, \textit{NuSTAR}, \textit{NICER}, and \textit{AstroSat}, this event provided valuable insights into Be/X-ray binaries. The pulse profiles evolved significantly with luminosity, transitioning from pencil-beam to fan-beam geometries. A0535+26, known for its fundamental cyclotron line at $\sim$44 keV, became only the second source to exhibit a negative correlation between cyclotron line energy and flux at high luminosities, with a plateau phase preceding the transition from positive to negative correlation. We report the discovery of a phase-transient low-energy cyclotron line, detected in a narrow phase range ($\sim$16\%) across all seven \textit{NuSTAR} observations during the rising, peak, and declining phases of the outburst. The new line exhibited dramatic variations with pulse phase and luminosity. We explain this behavior using an accretion geometry where the accretion column sweeps across the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Repeated pattern of $\gamma$-ray flares in the blazar PKS 1502+106 coincident with the IC190730A neutrino event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that at least 10 percent of the brightest blazars in the fourth Fermi-LAT catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources exhibit repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares. These events may be associated with the presence of a non-uniform sheath surrounding a fast jet spine in some blazars. Theoretical models suggest that such a sheath could facilitate neutrino production in these structured jets. We aim to test the previously reported marginal statistical evidence for a connection between repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares in blazars and high-energy neutrino events that are positionally consistent with these sources. We identified a repeating pattern of flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve of the blazar PKS 1502+106, which lies within the 50\% uncertainty region of the IC190730A neutrino candidate event. This occurrence is combined with two other high-energy ($\ge 200$ TeV) neutrino events from ICECAT-1 that arrived in both positional and temporal coincidence with two blazars exhibiting ongoing repeating flare patterns. A Monte-Carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the likelihood of accidental coincidences between the repeating flare patterns and neutrino events, accounting for potential unrecognized systematic uncertainties in the arrival directions of the ICECAT-1 events. Our findings indicate that the probability of a random coincidence in both time and arrival direction for three high-energy neutrino candidates and three blazars with ongoing recurring patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares is $1.56\times 10^{-3}$ ($3.2\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Studying the Power Sources Behind Type Ic Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical transients can be powered by a broad range of energy sources including shock-heating (internal and external shocks), decay of radioactive isotopes, and long-lived central engines (magnetar and fallback). The dominant energy source for astrophysical transients depends on the nature of the explosive engine and its progenitor. To model all transients, light-curve codes must include all of these energy sources. Here we present a supernova light-curve code implementing analytic source models to compare the role of different energy sources in these transients. To demonstrate the utility of this code, we conduct an extensive study of type Ic broad-line supernovae. A diverse set of energy sources have been linked to Ic broad-line supernovae making them an excellent candidate for this light-curve code. In this paper, we explore which features of the explosion (mass, velocity, etc.) affect the type Ic supernovae light-curves, focusing on shock-interaction and radioactive decay energy sources. Although the explosion properties under both energy sources can be tuned to match the peak emission, matching the light-curve evolution in many Ic broad-line supernovae requires fine-tuned conditions. We find that shock interactions in the stellar wind are likely to be the dominant energy source at peak for these supernovae.</description>

      <title>Precession for the mode change in a gamma-ray pulsar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR J2021+4026 is a gamma-ray pulsar having variations in its spin-down rate and gamma-ray flux. Its variations in timing and emission are correlated, e.g., a larger spin-down rate for a low gamma-ray flux. We show that the mode change in PSR J2021+4026 can be understood in the precession scenario. In the precession model, the inclination angle is modulated due to precession. At the same time, the wobble angle may decay with time. This results in damping of the precession. Combined with magnetospheric torque model and the outer gap model, the damped precession can explain: (1) when the inclination angle is larger, the spin-down rate will be larger, accompanied by a lower gamma-ray flux. (2) The variation amplitude of the gamma-ray flux and spin-down rate is smaller than previous results due to the damping of the precession. The modulation period is becoming shorter due to a smaller wobble angle. In the end, we propose that there are two kinds of modulations in pulsars. Long-term modulations in pulsars may be due to precession. Short-term modulations may be of magnetospheric origin.</description>

      <title>Evolution of neutron stars in wide eccentric low-mass binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise astrometric measurement with Gaia satellite resulted in the discovery of tens of wide binary systems consisting of a Sun-like star and an invisible component. The latter can be a white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole. In this paper, we model magneto-rotational evolution of neutron stars in wide low-mass binaries accounting for the orbital eccentricity. We aim to calculate when neutron stars in such systems can start to accrete matter from the stellar wind of the companion. We show that the transition from the ejector to the propeller stage occurs earlier in more eccentric systems, thus increasing the time that neutron stars can spend accreting matter. Our calculations show that in the case of efficient spin-down at the propeller stage, a neutron star in an eccentric orbit with $e\gtrsim0.6$ and a standard magnetic field $B=10^{12}$ G can start accreting within a few Gyr. For neutron stars with $B=10^{13}$ G the onset of accretion occurs earlier regardless of the orbital eccentricity. Otherwise, with a lower spin-down rate, such a neutron star will remain at the propeller stage for most of its life.</description>

      <title>The Extraordinary Long-lasting Infrared Echo of PS16dtm Reveals an Extremely Energetic Nuclear Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PS16dtm is one of the earliest reported candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and displays a remarkably bright and long-lived infrared (IR) echo revealed by multi-epoch photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). After a rapid rise in the first year, the echo remains persistently at a high state from July 2017 to July 2024, the latest epoch, and keeps an almost constant color. We have fitted the extraordinary IR emission with a refined dust echo model by taking into account the dust sublimation process. The fitting suggests that an extremely giant dust structure with a new inner radius of $\sim1.6$ pc and an ultra-high peak bolometric luminosity, i.e., $\sim6\times10^{46} \rm erg~s^{-1}$ for typical 0.1$\mu$m-sized silicate grain, is required to account for the IR echo. This work highlights the distinctive value of IR echoes in measuring the accurate intrinsic bolometric luminosity, and thus the total radiated energy of TDEs, which could be severely underestimated by traditional methods, i.e. probably by more than an order of magnitude in PS16dtm. Such large energetic output compared to normal TDEs could be boosted by the pre-existing accretion disk and gas clouds around the black hole. Our model can be validated in the near future by IR time-domain surveys such as Near-Earth Object (NEO) Surveyor, given the recent retirement of WISE. In addition, the potential for spatially resolving a receding dusty torus after a TDE could also be an exciting subject in the era of advanced IR interferometry.</description>

      <title>The Observed Luminosity Correlations of Gamma-Ray Bursts and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous electromagnetic transients in the universe, providing unique insights into extreme astrophysical processes and serving as promising probes for cosmology. Unlike Type Ia supernovae, which have a unified explosion mechanism, GRBs cannot directly act as standard candles for tracing cosmic evolution at high redshifts due to significant uncertainties in their underlying physical origins. Empirical correlations derived from statistical analyses involving various GRB parameters provide valuable information regarding their intrinsic properties. In this brief review, we describe various correlations among GRB parameters involving the prompt and afterglow phases, discussing possible theoretical interpretations behind them. The scarcity of low-redshift GRBs poses a major obstacle to the application of GRB empirical correlations in cosmology, referred to as the circularity problem. We present various efforts aiming at calibrating GRBs to address this challenge and leveraging established empirical correlations to constrain cosmological parameters. The pivotal role of GRB sample quality in advancing cosmological research is underscored. Some correlations that could potentially be utilized as redshift indicators are also introduced.</description>

      <title>Thermal instability of thin disk in the presence of wind and corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the thermal stability of thin accretion disks in high-energy astrophysical systems, incorporating the effects of magnetic fields, winds, and coronae. We analyze how these factors influence disk stability, focusing on conditions under which magnetic fields enhance stability and on scenarios where winds and coronae can either stabilize or destabilize the disk. Our results reveal that increasing corona parameters raises disk thickness and reduces temperature, thereby affecting gas, radiation, and magnetic pressures. These interactions underscore the complex dependencies that shape accretion disk dynamics, offering insights into their structural and thermal behavior under varying physical conditions. The findings contribute to advancing theoretical models and numerical simulations of accretion processes in environments such as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and X-ray binaries, where disk stability plays a critical role in observed emissions and variability patterns.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays from star clusters and implications for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Star clusters are often invoked as contributors to the flux of Galactic cosmic rays and as sources potentially able to accelerate particles to $\sim$PeV energies. The gamma radiation with $E\gtrsim$ TeV recently observed from selected star clusters has profound implications for the origin of Galactic cosmic rays.
  Aims. We show that if the gamma rays observed from the Cygnus cocoon and Westerlund 1 are of hadronic origin, then the cosmic rays escaping the cluster at energies $\gtrsim$ 10 TeV must cross a grammage inside the cluster that exceeds the Galactic grammage. At lower energies, depending on the model adopted to describe the production of gamma rays, such grammage may exceed or be comparable with the grammage inferred from propagation on Galactic scales.
  Methods. The flux of gamma rays is analytically computed for a few models of injection of cosmic rays in star clusters, and compared with the flux measured from selected clusters.
  Results. In all models considered here, comparing the inferred and observed gamma ray fluxes at $E\gtrsim$ TeV, we conclude that CRs must traverse a large grammage inside or around the cluster before escaping. Clearly these implications would not apply to a scenario in which gamma rays are produced due to radiative losses of leptons in the cluster. Leptonic models typically require weaker magnetic fields, which in turn result in maximum energies of accelerated particles much below $\sim$ PeV.
  Conclusions. We conclude that if gamma ray emission in SCs is a generic phenomenon and if this radiation is due to hadronic interactions, either star clusters cannot contribute but a small fraction of the total cosmic ray flux at the Earth, or their contribution to the grammage cannot be neglected and the paradigm of Galactic transport should be profoundly revisited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several observational lines of evidence imply that a fraction of the dark matter in the Galaxy may be comprised of small cold clouds of molecular hydrogen. Such objects are difficult to detect because of their small size and low temperature, but they can reveal themselves with gamma radiation arising in interactions between such clouds and cosmic rays or as dark shadows cast on the optical, UV and X-ray sky background. In our work we use the data of Fermi LAT 4FGL-DR4 catalogue of gamma-ray sources together with the data of GALEX UV All-Sky Survey to search for small dark clouds of molecular hydrogen in the Solar neighbourhood. This approach allows us to put an upper limit on the local concentration of such objects: $n &lt; 2.2 \times 10^{-11} {\mathrm{AU}^{-3}}$. Constraints (upper limits) on the total amount of matter in this form bound to the Sun strongly depend on the radial profile of the clouds' distribution and reside in $0.05-30~M_{\odot}$ mass range.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deflections of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in several widely used models of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF), including PT11 (Pshirkov et al. [1]), JF12 (Jansson and Farrar [2]), UF23 (Unger and Farrar [3]) and KST24 (Korochkin, Semikoz, and Tinyakov [4]). We propagate particles with rigidities of 5, 10, and 20 EV and analyze the differences in deflection predictions across these GMF models. We identify the GMF components responsible for deflections in various regions of the sky and discuss the uncertainties in modeling these components, as well as potential future improvements.</description>

      <title>Stability and convergence of nuclear detonations in white dwarf collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical stability of thermonuclear detonations in 1D accelerated reactive shocks and 2D binary collisions of equal mass, magnetized and unmagnetized white dwarf stars. To achieve high resolution at initiation sites, we devised geometric gridding and mesh velocity strategies specially adapted to the unique requirements of head-on collisional geometries, scenarios in which one expects maximum production of iron-group products. We study effects of grid resolution and the limiting of temperature, energy generation, and reactants for different stellar masses, separations, magnetic fields, initial compositions, detonation mechanisms, and limiter parameters across a range of cell sizes from 1 to 100 km. Our results set bounds on the parameter space of limiter amplitudes for which both temperature and energy limiting procedures yield consistent and monotonically convergent solutions. Within these bounds we find grid resolutions of 5 km or better are necessary for uncertainties in total released energy and iron-group products to drop below 10%. Intermediate mass products (e.g., calcium) exhibit similar convergence trends but with somewhat greater uncertainty. These conclusions apply equally to pure C/O WDs, multi-species compositions (including helium shells), magnetized and unmagnetized cores, and either single or multiple detonation scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Possible Mass Ratio and Spin-Orbit Misalignment Correlation for Mergers of Binary Black Holes in Nuclear Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16258</link>

Abstract: Despite a decade's worth of gravitational wave observation, the origin of the binary black hole (BBH) mergers detected by the LIGO-VIRGO-Kagra (LVK) collaboration remains an open question. Towards assessing the feasibility and prevalence of the many proposed BBH formation channels, the spin properties of the merging black holes (BHs) hold significant promise, particularly their orientations. The combined trends of a moderate preferential alignment of BH spins with their orbit normals and an apparent correlation of BBH effective spin parameters $\chi_{\rm eff}$ with their mass ratios seem to favor hydrodynamical BBH formation mechanisms over purely dynamical ones, as they introduce a preferred orientation to the system. However, such processes are filled with physical and modeling uncertainties. In this paper, we highlight a dynamical route to easily characterizable spin evolution that results in analytically-predictable spin distributions. We show that, when a stellar binary forms a BBH through two phases of stable mass transfer, and the BBH is subsequently driven to merger by the gravitational perturbation of a distant massive object (such as a supermassive black hole), the resulting spin-orbit misalignment angles are anti-correlated with the binary mass ratio. While the mechanism as proposed only operates in a somewhat narrow region of parameter space, it also predicts significantly tighter correlations than are seen in the LVK systems. We discuss avenues for future work that may significantly expand the parameter space of our mechanism while still remaining broadly consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>TiDES: The 4MOST Time Domain Extragalactic Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Time Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES) conducted on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) will perform spectroscopic follow-up of extragalactic transients discovered in the era of the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. TiDES will conduct a 5-year survey, covering ${&gt;}14\,000\,\mathrm{square\, degrees}$, and use around 250 000 fibre hours to address three main science goals: (i) spectroscopic observations of ${&gt;}30 000$ live transients, (ii) comprehensive follow-up of ${&gt;}200 000$ host galaxies to obtain redshift measurements, and (iii) repeat spectroscopic observations of Active Galactic Nuclei to enable reverberation mapping studies. The live spectra from TiDES will be used to reveal the diversity and astrophysics of both normal and exotic supernovae across the luminosity-timescale plane. The extensive host-galaxy redshift campaign will allow exploitation of the larger sample of supernovae and improve photometric classification, providing the largest-ever sample of spec-confirmed type Ia supernovae, capable of a sub-2 per cent measurement of the equation-of-state of dark energy. Finally, the TiDES reverberation mapping experiment of 700--1\,000 AGN will complement the SN Ia sample and extend the Hubble diagram to $z\sim2.5$</description>

      <title>Type I X-ray Bursts Reflected During the X-ray Eclipses of EXO 0748-676</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron star X-ray binary, EXO 0748--676, was observed regularly by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) and XMM-Newton during its first detected outburst (1985 - 2008). These observations captured hundreds of asymmetric, energy-dependent X-ray eclipses, influenced by the ongoing ablation of the companion star and numerous Type I thermonuclear X-ray bursts. Here, we present the light curves of 22 Type I X-ray bursts observed by RXTE that coincide, fully or partially, with an X-ray eclipse. We identify nine instances where the burst occurs entirely within totality, seven bursts split across an egress, and six cases interrupted by an ingress. All in-eclipse bursts and split bursts occurred while the source was in the hard spectral state. We establish that we are not observing direct burst emission during eclipses since the companion star and the ablated outflow entirely obscure our view of the X-ray emitting region. We determine that the reflected flux from the outer accretion disc, even if maximally flared, is insufficient to explain all observations of in-eclipse X-ray bursts and instead explore scenarios whereby the X-ray bursts are scattered, either by a burst-induced rise in $N_{\rm{H}}$ that provides extra material, an accretion disc wind or the ablated outflow into our line of sight. However, the rarity of a burst and eclipse overlap makes it challenging to determine their origin.</description>

      <title>Comparing strange and non-strange quark stars within resummed QCD at NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the renormalization group optimized perturbation theory (RGOPT) resummation method to evaluate the equation of state (EoS) for strange ($N_f=2+1$) and non-strange ($N_f=2$) cold quark matter at NLO. This allows us to obtain the mass-radius relation for pure quark stars and compare the results with the predictions from perturbative QCD (pQCD) at NNLO. Choosing the renormalization scale to generate maximum star masses of order $M=2 - 2.6 M_\odot$, we show that the RGOPT can produce mass-radius curves compatible with the masses and radii of some recently observed pulsars, regardless of their strangeness content. The scale values required to produce the desired maximum masses are higher in the strange scenario since the EoS is softer in this case. The possible reasons for such behavior are discussed. Our results also show that, as expected, the RGOPT predictions for the relevant observables are less sensitive to scale variations than those furnished by pQCD.</description>

      <title>Supercooled Phase Transitions: Why Thermal History of Hidden Sector Matters in Analysis of Pulsar Timing Array Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of a gravitational wave background in the nano-Hertz frequency range from Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations offers new insights into evolution of the early universe. In this work we analyze gravitational wave data from PPTA, EPTA, and NANOGrav, as arising from a supercooled first-order phase transition within a hidden sector, characterized by a broken $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. Several previous works have discussed challenges in producing observable {PTA signal} from supercooled phases transitions. We discuss these challenges and show how they are overcome by inclusion in part of the proper thermal history of the hidden and the visible sectors. The analysis of this work demonstrates that thermal histories of hidden and visible sectors profoundly influence the gravitational wave power spectrum, an aspect not previously explored in the literature. Further, the analysis of this work suggests that supercooled phase transitions not only align with the Pulsar Timing Array observations but also show promise for gravitational wave detection by future gravitational wave detectors. Our analysis shows that the dominant contribution to the gravitational wave power spectrum for PTA signals comes from bubble collision while the sound wave and turbulence contributions are highly suppressed. It is also found that all the PTA events are of detonation type while deflagration and hybrid events are absent. The analysis presented in this work provides a robust framework for further investigations on the origin of gravitational wave power spectrum in the early universe and for their experimental observation in the future.</description>

      <title>Explainable autoencoder for neutron star dense matter parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed autoencoder designed to encode the equation of state of neutron stars into an interpretable latent space. In particular the input will be encoded in the mass, radius, and tidal deformability values of a neutron star. Unlike traditional black-box models, our approach incorporates additional loss functions to enforce explainability in the encoded representations. This method enhances the transparency of machine learning models in physics, providing a robust proof-of-concept tool to study compact stars data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder not only accurately estimates the EoS parameters and central density/pressure but also offers insights into the physical connection between equation of state and observable physical quantities. This framework conceptualizes the physical differential equations themselves as the ``encoders", allowing interpretability of the latent space.</description>

      <title>Highly Variable Quasar Candidates Selected from 4XMM-DR13 with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a sample of 12 quasar candidates with highly variable soft X-ray emission from the 4th XMM-newton Serendipitous Source Catalog (4XMM-DR13) using random forest. We obtained optical to mid-IR photometric data for the 4XMM-DR13 sources by correlating the sample with the SDSS DR18 photometric database and the AllWISE database. By cross-matching this sample with known spectral catalogs from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, we obtained a training data set containing stars, galaxies, and quasars. The random forest algorithm was trained to classify the XMM-WISE-SDSS sample. We further filtered the classified quasar candidates with $\it{Gaia}$ proper motion to remove stellar contaminants. Finally, 53,992 quasar candidates have been classified, with 10,210 known quasars matched in SIMBAD. The quasar candidates have systematically lower X-ray fluxes than quasars in the training set, which indicates the classifier is helpful to single out fainter quasars. We constructed a sample of 12 sources from these quasars candidates which changed their soft X-ray fluxes by a factor of 10 over $\sim$ 20 years in the 4XMM-newton survey. Our selected highly variable quasar candidates extend the quasar sample, characterized by extreme soft X-ray variability, to the optically faint end with magnitudes around $r \sim 22$. None of the 12 sources were detected in ROSAT observations. Given the flux limit of ROSAT, the result suggests that quasars exhibiting variations of more than two orders of magnitudes are extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Gravity as emergent phenomena for spherically symmetric black hole accretion of multi-component flow with relativistic equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate analogue gravity phenomena arising as a result of the linear perturbation of the spherically symmetric accretion flows onto non rotating black holes, where the gravitational field is determined by a set of post Newtonian pseudo Schwarzschild black hole potentials and the infaling matter is described by a relativistic multi-species equation of state. The stationary transonic integral accretion solutions corresponding to the steady state of aforementioned type of accreting systems are constructed and the stability analysis of such solutions are performed through the time dependent linear perturbation of the accretion flow. Such linear stability analysis leads to the formation of a black hole like sonic metric embedded within the infalling matter. The acoustic horizons are then identified by constructing the causal structure, i.e., the Carter-Penrose diagrams. The variation of the analogue surface gravity corresponding to the aforementioned sonic metric has been studied as a function of various parameters governing the accretion flow.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of QCD first-order phase transition from neutron star measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential hadron-to-quark phase transition in neutron stars has not been fully understood as the property of cold, dense, and strongly interacting matter cannot be theoretically described by the first-principle perturbative calculations, nor have they been systematically measured through terrestrial low-to-intermediate energy heavy-ion experiments. Given the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations, the equation of state (EoS) of the neutron star (NS) matter can be constrained by the observations of NS mass, radius, and tidal deformability. However, large observational uncertainties and the limited number of observations currently make it challenging to strictly reconstruct the EoS, especially to identify interesting features such as a strong first-order phase transition. In this work, we study the dependency of reconstruction quality of the phase transition on the number of NS observations of mass and radius as well as their uncertainty, based on a fiducial EoS. We conquer this challenging problem by constructing a neural network, which allows one to parameterize the EoS with minimum model-dependency, and by devising an algorithm of parameter optimization based on the analytical linear response analysis of the TOV equations. This work may pave the way for the understanding of the phase transition features in NSs using future $X$-ray and gravitational wave measurements.</description>

      <title>PRINCESS: Prediction of compact binaries observations with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PRINCESS, a computational tool designed to predict gravitational wave observations from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in current and future detector networks. PRINCESS uniquely combines predictions of both individual gravitational wave events and the associated astrophysical background, leveraging user-provided CBC catalogs. With the anticipated improvements in detector sensitivity from second-generation (2G) to third-generation (3G) observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, the tool aims to constrain models of stellar formation and compact object evolution. PRINCESS calculates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual events and predicts the stochastic background arising from unresolved sources. We detail the code structure, installation, and usage, providing examples of predictions for different astrophysical models and detector configurations. Results include forecasts for binary black hole detections and background spectra, highlighting the potential of future networks to resolve nearly all CBC events. We also discuss ongoing developments to expand PRINCESS's capabilities, including accounting for additional sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and incorporating more advanced detector models.</description>

      <title>Location and energy of electrons producing the radio bursts from AD Leo observed by FAST in December 2021</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we presented circularly polarized radio bursts detected by the radio telescope FAST from the flare star AD Leo on December 2-3, 2021, which were attributed to the electron cyclotron maser instability. In that context we use here two independent and complementary approaches\pz{, inspired from the study of auroral radio emissions from solar system planets,} to constrain for the first time the source location (magnetic shell, height) and the energy of the emitting electrons. These two approaches consist of (i) modeling the overall occurrence of the emission with the ExPRES code, and (ii) fitting the drift-rate of the fine structures observed by FAST. We obtain consistent results pointing at 20-30 keV electrons on magnetic shells with apex at 2-10 stellar radii. Emission polarization observed by FAST and magnetic topology of AD Leo favour X-mode emission from the southern magnetic hemisphere, from which we draw constraints on the plasma density scale height in the star's atmosphere. We demonstrate that sensitive radio observations with high time-frequency resolutions, coupled to modelling tools such as ExPRES, analytical calculations and stellar magnetic field measurements, now allow us to remotely probe stellar radio environments.} We provide elements of comparison with solar system radio bursts (Jovian and Solar), emit hypotheses about the driver of AD Leo's radio bursts and discuss the perspectives of future observations, in particular at very low frequencies (&lt;100 MHz).</description>

      <title>Search for neutrino emission from the Cygnus Bubble based on LHAASO $\gamma$-ray observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cygnus region, which contains massive molecular and atomic clouds and young stars, is a promising Galactic neutrino source candidate. Cosmic rays transport in the region can produce neutrinos and $\gamma$-rays. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) detected an ultrahigh-energy $\gamma$-ray bubble (Cygnus Bubble) in this region. Using publicly available track events detected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory in 7 years of full detector operation, we conduct searches for correlated neutrino signals from the Cygnus Bubble with neutrino emission templates based on LHAASO $\gamma$-ray observations. No significant signals were found for any employed templates. With the 7 TeV $\gamma$-ray flux template, we set a flux upper limit of 90% confidence level (C.L.) for the neutrino emission from the Cygnus Bubble to be $5.7\times10^{-13}\, \mathrm{TeV}^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ at 5 TeV.</description>

      <title>Candidate strongly lensed type Ia supernovae in the Zwicky Transient Facility archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) are unique astronomical tools that can be used to study cosmological parameters, distributions of dark matter, the astrophysics of the supernovae, and the intervening lensing galaxies themselves. A small number of highly magnified glSNe Ia have been discovered by ground-based telescopes such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), but simulations predict that a fainter population may also exist. We present a systematic search for glSNe Ia in the ZTF archive of alerts distributed from June 1 2019 to September 1 2022. Using the AMPEL platform, we developed a pipeline that distinguishes candidate glSNe Ia from other variable sources. Initial cuts were applied to the ZTF alert photometry before forced photometry was obtained for the remaining candidates. Additional cuts were applied to refine the candidates based on their light curve colours, lens galaxy colours, and the resulting parameters from fits to the SALT2 SN Ia template. The candidates were also cross-matched with the DESI spectroscopic catalogue. Seven transients were identified that had an associated galaxy DESI redshift, which we present as glSN Ia candidates. Although superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) cannot be fully rejected as contaminants, two events, ZTF19abpjicm and ZTF22aahmovu, are significantly different from typical SLSNe and their light curves can be modelled as two-image glSN Ia systems. From this two-image modelling, we estimate time delays of 22 $\pm$ 3 and 34 $\pm$ 1 days for the two events, respectively, which suggests that we have uncovered a population of glSNe Ia with longer time delays. The pipeline is currently being applied to the live ZTF alert stream to identify and follow-up future candidates while active, and it could be the foundation for glSNe Ia searches in future surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Anti-correlation between Flux and Photon Index of Hard X-ray Emission from The Crab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using \textit{Swift} Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) event-mode data during Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) occurrences, we conducted spectral analysis for the Crab system. From 38 good observations, which spans over a period of 18 years from 2006 to 2023, we found that the Crab's X-ray flux does not only flicker, but also significantly anti-correlates to its spectral power-law photon index. Since emission contribution of the Crab pulsar in this energy range is small, this anti-correlation is mainly about the emission of the Crab nebula. We suggest that this anti-correlation is an observational supporting evidence for the long-standing notion that the nebula emission is due to synchrotron radiation of shocked pulsar winds in the nebula.</description>

      <title>Search for neutrino signals correlated with LHAASO diffuse Galactic emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray emission originates from the interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar medium or radiation fields within our Galaxy, where the production of neutrinos is also anticipated. Recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported measurements of diffuse $\gamma$-rays from the Galactic plane with energies ranging from sub-TeV to 1 PeV. Using publicly available 7 years of IceCube track data with the full detector, we conduct a template search using the $\gamma$-ray flux map observed by LHAASO-KM2A as the neutrino emission template and perform a scan search of the Galactic plane. In the template search, a mild excess of neutrinos is observed in the Galactic plane with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of $1.9\sigma$ ($1.1\sigma$). The measured muon neutrino intensity at 25 TeV is $4.73^{+2.53}_{-2.51}\times10^{-14}\,{\rm TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}}$, consistent with the expected neutrino flux assuming that all the diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-rays originate from hadronic interactions. In the Galactic plane scan search, the most significant location is found at $l=63.57^{\circ}$ and $b=0.93^{\circ}$ with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of $4.6\sigma$ ($1.8\sigma$).</description>

      <title>Two-temperature treatments in magnetically arrested disk GRMHD simulations more accurately predict light curves of Sagittarius A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC) observed the Galactic centre source Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) and used emission models primarily based on single ion temperature (1T) general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. This predicted emission is strongly dependent on a modelled prescription of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. The most promising models are magnetically arrested disk (MAD) states. However, nearly all MAD models exhibit larger temporal fluctuations in radiative submillimetre emission compared to observations. This limitation possibly stems from the fact that the actual temperature ratio depends on microphysical dissipation, radiative processes and other effects not captured in ideal fluid simulations. Therefore, we investigate the effects of two-temperature (2T) thermodynamics in MAD GRMHD simulations of Sgr A*, where the temperatures of both species are evolved. We find that the radiative submillimetre variability more closely matches historical observations when we include the 2T treatment compared to 1T simulations. For the low accretion rates of Sgr A*, a common assumption is to neglect radiative cooling. However, we find that the radiative cooling of electrons-via synchrotron, inverse Compton, and bremsstrahlung processes-reduces the electron temperature in the inner disk, where the EHT observes, by about 10%, which, in turn, decreases both the submillimetre synchrotron flux and its temporal fluctuations compared to uncooled simulations.</description>

      <title>New Insights with XRISM &amp; Cloudy: A novel Column Density Diagnostic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple, yet powerful column density diagnostic for plasmas enabled by X-ray microcalorimeter observations. With the recent developments of the spectral simulation code Cloudy, inspired by the high spectral resolution of the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) and the Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics (Athena), we make predictions for the intensity ratio of the resolved fine-structure lines Ly$\alpha_1$ and Ly$\alpha_2$ of H-like ions. We show that this ratio can be observationally constrained and used as a plasma column density indicator. We demonstrate this with a XRISM observation of the high-mass X-ray binary Centaurus X-3. This diagnostic is useful for a wide range of X-ray emitting plasmas, either collisionally or radiatively ionized.</description>

      <title>Bounding the photon mass with gravitationally lensed fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational time delays of macro-lenses can be used to constrain the rest mass of the photon with high accuracy. Assuming a point-mass $+$ external shear lens model, we prove that an upper limit of the photon mass can be derived directly from two observables--the time delay $\Delta t$ and the leading-to-trailing flux ratio $R$ of strongly lensed fast radio bursts (FRBs). Using the observed values of $\Delta t$ and $R$ of a lensed FRB candidate, i.e., FRB 20190308C, as a reference, we obtain a strict upper limit of the photon mass between $m_\gamma &lt; 5.3 \times {10}^{-42}\,\rm kg$, for a given external shear strength of $\gamma' = 0.01$, and $m_{\gamma} &lt; 2.1 \times 10^{-41}-2.4 \times 10^{-42}\,\text{kg}$, within the external shear range of $0&lt;\gamma'&lt;1$. This provides the most stringent limit to date on the photon mass through gravitational lensing time delays, improving by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude the previous results obtained from lensed active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Spectral Study of Intermittent-Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar Aql X-1 during Pulse-on and Pulse-off Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectral study of an intermittent-AMXP Aql X-1 during the pulse-on and pulse-off stages by using the archival RXTE data. We first perform temporal analysis by using Z$_n^2$ technique in three different energy bands, 3.0 -- 13.0 keV, 13.0 -- 23.0 keV and 23.0 -- 33.0 keV, for the last 128 s time segment of the RXTE data including pulse-on region. We show that the pulse is the most significant in the softest band. We, then, show that the spectrum is represented the best via combination of absorbed blackbody, disk blackbody and a gaussian line. We modeled the last four segments of the data 30188-03-05-00 to better compare pulse-on and pulse-off stages. We found a vague residual in the spectral fit of the pulse-on segment between $\sim$3.0 -- 13.0 keV which agrees with the result of temporal analysis. We show that the residual may be represented with an extra blackbody component with the temperature of 1.75 keV and the radius of 0.75$\pm$0.49 km. For deeper analysis, we performed phase-resolved spectroscopy to the last 128 s, pulse-on, segment. We obtain two separate spectra for the spin phase range of 0.75 -- 0.25, pulse-high and 0.25 -- 0.75, pulse-low and followed the same procedure. We display that the residual becomes more clear for pulse-high compared to the pulse-low. We report that the additional blackbody component, which models the residual, indicates a hotspot from the surface of the neutron star with the radius of 1.65$\pm$0.74 km whose temperature is 1.65 keV.</description>

      <title>QPEs as Lense-Thirring precession of super-Eddington flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a recently identified class of X-ray transient associated with tidal disruption events by supermassive black holes, and for which there are multiple possible explanations. In this paper we present a simple model which requires the black hole be spinning, be misaligned with the accretion flow (both conditions of which are almost certainly met) and that the accretion rate is a few times the Eddington limit. We speculate that the resulting Lense-Thirring torques force the disc and entrained outflows to precess, leading to increased X-ray flux when the wind-cone is oriented at lower inclinations to the observer. We test the range of parameters for which this model could explain the period and brightness of the QPE events discovered thus far, and make qualitative comparisons between the observed X-ray spectra and lightcurves to those extracted from GR-RMHD simulations. Overall, we find some areas of promising concordance, and identify challenges related to the details of current simulations.</description>

      <title>Approaching ballistic motion in 3D simulations of gamma-ray burst jets in realistic binary neutron star merger environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The concomitant observation of gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals from a binary neutron star (BNS) merger in 2017 confirmed that these events can produce relativistic jets responsible for short Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs). The complex interaction between the jet and the surrounding post-merger environment shapes the angular structure of the outflow, which is then imprinted in the prompt and afterglow sGRB emission. Aims. The outcome of relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations of jets piercing through post-merger environments is often used as input to compute afterglow signals to be compared with observations. However, for reliable comparisons, the jet propagation should be followed until nearly ballistic regimes, in which the jet acceleration is essentially over and the angular structure is no longer evolving. This condition is typically reached in 2D simulations, but not in 3D. Our goal is to extend a (specific) jet simulation in 3D up to a nearly ballistic phase, analysing the overall dynamical evolution from the jet breakout. Methods. Our work is based on a previous 3D magnetohydrodynamic jet simulation employing a realistic environment imported from a BNS merger simulation, extended here far beyond the evolution time originally covered. After approximately 3 seconds of the jet evolution on the original spherical grid, we remap the system into a uniform Cartesian grid and reach about 10 seconds without loss of resolution. Results. The specific jet considered here struggles to pierce the dense surroundings, resulting in a rather asymmetrical emerging outflow with relatively low Lorentz factor. The analysis of the energy conversion processes and corresponding acceleration shows that at the end of our simulation 98% of the energy is in kinetic form. Moreover, at that time the angular structure is frozen. We thus obtain suitable inputs for...</description>

Abstract: We apply the recently developed analysis of 16 years of INTEGRAL/SPI data including a dark matter spatial template to derive bounds on dark matter candidates lighter than WIMPs (like sterile neutrinos or axion-like particles) decaying into line or continuum electromagnetic final state channels. The bounds obtained are the strongest to date for dark matter masses between $\sim $60 keV and $\sim$16 MeV experiencing two-body decays producing photon lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Formation of cosmological solitons is generically accompanied by production of gravitational waves (GWs), with a universal GW background expected at frequency scales below that of non-linear dynamics. Beginning with a general phenomenological description of GWs associated with soliton formation, we demonstrate that universal GW background from axion-like particle (ALP) solitonic oscillons provides a viable interpretation to the recent NANOGrav 15 year pulsar timing array data, which does not suffer from the overproduction of primordial black holes. We show that pulsar timing array data displays preference for models where formed solitons do not strongly interact or cluster. Coincidence observations with Nancy Roman telescope will allow to discriminate between distinct scenarios of cosmological solitons.</description>

Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave instruments are expected to constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter by observing binaries involving neutron stars. We highlight a problematic systematic error in finite-temperature merger simulations, where shock heating associated with the neutron-star surface gives rise to elevated temperatures. We demonstrate the severe implications of this artificial heating by computing static and dynamical tidal parameters for neutron stars immersed in simulation temperature profiles. The induced systematic errors must be addressed if we want to build robust gravitational-wave signal models for neutron-star, or indeed neutron star-black hole, binaries.</description>

      <title>Disentangling transients and their host galaxies with Scarlet2: A framework to forward model multi-epoch imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many science cases for wide-field time-domain surveys rely on accurate identification and characterization of the galaxies hosting transient and variable objects. In the era of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory the number of known transient and variable sources will grow by orders of magnitude, and many of these sources will be blended with their host galaxies and neighboring galaxies. A diverse range of applications - including the classification of nuclear and non-nuclear sources, identification of potential host galaxies, extraction of host galaxy SEDs without requiring a transient-free reference image, and combined analysis of photometry from multiple surveys - will benefit from a flexible framework to model time-domain imaging of transients. We describe a time-domain extension of the Scarlet2 scene modeling code for multi-epoch, multi-band, and multi-resolution imaging data to extract simultaneous transient and host galaxy models. Scarlet2 leverages the benefits of data-driven priors on galaxy morphology, is fully GPU compatible, and can jointly model multi-resolution data from ground and space-based surveys. We demonstrate the method on simulated LSST-like supernova imaging, low-resolution Zwicky Transient Facility imaging of tidal disruption events, and Hyper Suprime Cam imaging of variable AGN out to z = 4 in the COSMOS fields. We show that Scarlet2 models provide accurate transient and host galaxy models as well as accurate measurement of host-transient spatial offsets, and demonstrate future applications to the search for 'wandering' massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the production of PBHs through well-tested physical processes is highly worthy of investigations. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations of energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formations in the primordial universe. We analyze the mass range and abundance of PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition. Remarkably, without invoking any new physics beyond the Standard Model, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the only allowed "asteroid mass" window, and within natural parameter regions their abundance can be sufficiently large. These findings strongly suggest that PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark matter.</description>
