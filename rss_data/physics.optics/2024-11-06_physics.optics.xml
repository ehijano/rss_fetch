      <title>Integrated lithium niobate photonic computing circuit based on efficient and high-speed electro-optic conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show a photonic computing accelerator utilizing a system-level thin-film lithium niobate circuit which overcomes this limitation. Leveraging the strong electro-optic (Pockels) effect and the scalability of this platform, we demonstrate photonic computation at speeds up to 1.36 TOPS while consuming 0.057 pJ/OP. Our system features more than 100 thin-film lithium niobate high-performance components working synergistically, surpassing state-of-the-art systems on this platform. We further demonstrate binary-classification, handwritten-digit classification, and image classification with remarkable accuracy, showcasing our system's capability of executing real algorithms. Finally, we investigate the opportunities offered by combining our system with a hybrid-integrated distributed feedback laser source and a heterogeneous-integrated modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode. Our results illustrate the promise of thin-film lithium niobate as a computational platform, addressing current bottlenecks in both electronic and photonic computation. Its unique properties of high-performance electro-optic weight encoding and conversion, wafer-scale scalability, and compatibility with integrated lasers and detectors, position thin-film lithium niobate photonics as a valuable complement to silicon photonics, with extensions to applications in ultrafast and power-efficient signal processing and ranging.</description>

      <title>A scalar product for radiating resonant modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the modes of optical resonators is beneficial for theoretical and practical endeavors. Here, we introduce a scalar product, originally devised for radiation fields, to such studies. This scalar product allows one to normalize and compare resonant modes using their corresponding radiation fields. Such fields are polychromatic fields free of divergences, which are determined for any given mode by its complex frequency and the modal field on the surface of the resonator. The scalar product is expressed as a surface integral involving the modal fields, multiplied by a closed-form factor incorporating the complex frequencies. In a practical application, we study the modes of disk-shaped whispering gallery resonators, and we show that the proposed scalar product accurately predicts the geometry-dependent coupling between modes.</description>

      <title>Generalization vs. Hallucination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With fast developments in computational power and algorithms, deep learning has made breakthroughs and been applied in many fields. However, generalization remains to be a critical challenge, and the limited generalization capability severely constrains its practical applications. Hallucination issue is another unresolved conundrum haunting deep learning and large models. By leveraging a physical model of imaging through scattering media, we studied the lack of generalization to system response functions in deep learning, identified its cause, and proposed a universal solution. The research also elucidates the creation process of a hallucination in image prediction and reveals its cause, and the common relationship between generalization and hallucination is discovered and clarified. Generally speaking, it enhances the interpretability of deep learning from a physics-based perspective, and builds a universal physical framework for deep learning in various fields. It may pave a way for direct interaction between deep learning and the real world, facilitating the transition of deep learning from a demo model to a practical tool in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering band selective absorption with epsilon-near-zero media in the infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band-selective absorption and emission of thermal radiation in the infrared are of interest due to applications in emissivity coatings, infrared sensing, thermo-photovoltaics and solar energy harvesting. The broadband nature of thermal radiation presents distinct challenges in achieving spectral and angular selectivity, which are difficult to address by prevalent optical strategies, often yielding restrictive responses. We explore a tri-layer coating employing a nanostructured grating of epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) material, indium tin oxide (ITO), atop a dielectric (silicon dioxide) and metal (gold) underlayer, which shows wide-angle (0-60 degrees) and band-selective (1800 - 2800 nm) high absorption (&gt; 0.8). Numerical simulations and experimental results reveal that the ENZ response of ITO combined with its localized plasmon resonances define the high absorption bandwidth, aided by the sandwiched dielectric's optical properties, elucidating the tunability of the absorption bandwidth. Thermal imaging in the mid-infrared highlights the relevance of the ENZ grating, emphasizing the potential of this coating design as a thermal emitter. This study offers valuable insights into light-matter interactions and opens avenues for practical applications in thermal management and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Sparse Reconstruction of Wavefronts using an Over-Complete Phase Dictionary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront reconstruction is a critical component in various optical systems, including adaptive optics, interferometry, and phase contrast imaging. Traditional reconstruction methods often employ either the Cartesian (pixel) basis or the Zernike polynomial basis. While the Cartesian basis is adept at capturing high-frequency features, it is susceptible to overfitting and inefficiencies due to the high number of degrees of freedom. The Zernike basis efficiently represents common optical aberrations but struggles with complex or non-standard wavefronts such as optical vortices, Bessel beams, or wavefronts with sharp discontinuities. This paper introduces a novel approach to wavefront reconstruction using an over-complete phase dictionary combined with sparse representation techniques. By constructing a dictionary that includes a diverse set of basis functions - ranging from Zernike polynomials to specialized functions representing optical vortices and other complex modes - we enable a more flexible and efficient representation of complex wavefronts. Furthermore, a trainable affine transform is implemented to account for misalignment. Utilizing principles from compressed sensing and sparse coding, we enforce sparsity in the coefficient space to avoid overfitting and enhance robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>Light Amplification by Active Meta-mirrors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a scheme of thin films, deposited on periodically modulated amplifying materials. We show that the reflection from such meta-interface can undergo substantial amplification, due to Fano resonances in the thin films. The amplification strongly increases when the Fano waveguiding modes approach the edge of the continuum and degenerate into the leaky surface modes. The study is based on simplified analytical models, as well as on Rigorous Coupled Wave Analysis.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Twistronics: Discovery of Plasmonic Skyrmion Bags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of van der Waals heterostructures with an interlayer twist, known as "twistronics", has been instrumental in advancing contemporary condensed matter research. Most importantly, it has underpinned the emergence of a multitude of strongly-correlated phases, many of which derive from the topology of the physical system. Here, we explore the application of the twistronics paradigm in plasmonic systems with nontrivial topology, by creating a moir\'e skyrmion superlattice using two superimposed plasmonic skyrmion lattices, twisted at a "magic" angle. The complex electric field distribution of the moir\'e skyrmion superlattice is measured using time-resolved vector microscopy, revealing that each super-cell possesses very large topological invariants and harbors a "skyrmion bag", the size of which is controllable by the twist angle and center of rotation. Our work shows how twistronics leads to a diversity of topological features in optical fields, providing a new route to locally manipulate electromagnetic field distributions, which is crucial for future structured light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion Bag Robustness in Plasmonic Bilayer and Trilayer Moir\'e Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twistronics is studied intensively in twisted 2D heterostructures and its extension to trilayer moir\'e structures has proven beneficial for the tunability of unconventional correlated states and superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene. Just recently, the concept of twistronics has been applied to plasmonic lattices with nontrivial topology, demonstrating that bilayer moir\'e skyrmion lattices harbor multi-skyrmion textures called skyrmion bags. Here, we explore the properties of plasmonic trilayer moir\'e superlattices that are created by the interference of three twisted skyrmion lattices. More specifically, we explore the properties of periodic superlattices and their topological invariants. We also demonstrate that twisted trilayer skyrmion lattices harbor the same skyrmion bags as twisted bilayer skyrmion lattices. We quantify the robustness of these skyrmion bags by the stability of their topological numbers against certain disturbance fields that leads to experimental designs for topological textures with maximum robustness.</description>

      <title>Single photon emitters in thin GaAsN nanowire tubes grown on Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: III-V nanowire heterostructures can act as sources of single and entangled photons and are enabling technologies for on-chip applications in future quantum photonic devices. The unique geometry of nanowires allows to integrate lattice-mismatched components beyond the limits of planar epilayers and to create radially and axially confined quantum structures. Here, we report the plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy growth of thin GaAs/GaAsN/GaAs core-multishell nanowires monolithically integrated on Si (111) substrates, overcoming the challenges caused by the low solubility of N and a high lattice mismatch. The nanowires have a GaAsN shell of 10 nm containing 2.7% N, which reduces the GaAs bandgap drastically by 400 meV. They have a symmetric core-shell structure with sharp boundaries and a defect-free zincblende phase. The high structural quality reflects in their excellent opto-electroinic properties, including remarkable single photon emission from quantum confined states in the thin GaAsN shell with a second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay as low as 0.056.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal topology of plasmonic spin meron pairs revealed by polarimetric photo-emission microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03262v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology is the study of geometrical properties and spatial relations unaffected by continuous changes, and has become an important tool for understanding complex physical systems. Although recent optical experiments have inferred the existence of vector fields with the topologies of merons, the inability to extract the full three dimensional vectors misses a richer set of topologies that have not yet been fully explored. In our work, we extend the study of the topology of electromagnetic fields on surfaces to a spin quasi-particle with the topology of a meron pair, formed by interfering surface plasmon polaritons, and show that the in-plane vectors are constrained by the embedding topology of the space as dictated by the Poincare-Hopf theorem. In addition we explore the time evolution of the three dimensional topology of the spin field formed by femtosecond laser pulses. These experiments are possible using our here developed method called polarimetric photoemission electron microscopy (polarimetric PEEM) that combines an optical pump-probe technique and polarimetry with photo-emission electron microscopy. This method allows for the accurate generation of surface plasmon polariton fields and their subsequent measurement, revealing both the spatial distribution of the full three-dimensional electromagnetic fields at deep sub-wavelength resolution and their time evolution.</description>

      <title>Combs, fast and slow: non-adiabatic mean field theory of active cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated frequency combs based on active cavities are of interest for a wide range of applications. An elegant description of these cavities is based on mean-field theory, which averages the effect of internal dynamics occurring within a round trip. Lasers based on media with slow gain dynamics can be described by solving the population over many round trips, while lasers based on fast gain media can be described by adiabatic elimination. However, most gain media actually have both fast and slow components, and effects often ascribed to fast gain media are known to arise even in slower gain media. Here, we develop an operator-based mean-field theory that non-adiabatically describes the dynamics of bidirectional active cavities, both fast and slow. It is based on first principles and semi-exactly replaces the Maxwell-Bloch equations, but is flexible enough to accomodate non-trivial lineshapes and population dynamics. As an example, we use this formalism to establish an additional constraint on the formation of frequency-modulated combs. Our results are general and apply to any bidirectional or unidirectional active cavity, and as a result, generalize to essentially any chip-scale laser.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterization of a 3-port photonic lantern for application to spectroastrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroastrometry, which measures wavelength-dependent shifts in the center of light, is well-suited for studying objects whose morphology changes with wavelength at very high angular resolutions. Photonic lantern (PL)-fed spectrometers have potential to enable measurement of spectroastrometric signals because the relative intensities between the PL output SMFs contain spatial information on the input scene. In order to use PL output spectra for spectroastrometric measurements, it is important to understand the wavelength-dependent behaviors of PL outputs and develop methods to calibrate the effects of time-varying wavefront errors in ground-based observations. We present experimental characterizations of the 3-port PL on the SCExAO testbed at the Subaru Telescope. We develop spectral response models of the PL and verify the behaviors with lab experiments. We find sinusoidal behavior of astrometric sensitivity of the 3-port PL as a function of wavelength, as expected from numerical simulations. Furthermore, we compare experimental and numerically simulated coupling maps and discuss their potential use for offsetting pointing errors. We then present a method of building PL spectral response models (solving for the transfer matrices as a function of wavelength) using coupling maps, which can be used for further calibration strategies.</description>

      <title>Transferable polychromatic optical encoder for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have fundamentally transformed the field of computer vision, providing unprecedented performance. However, these ANNs for image processing demand substantial computational resources, often hindering real-time operation. In this paper, we demonstrate an optical encoder that can perform convolution simultaneously in three color channels during the image capture, effectively implementing several initial convolutional layers of a ANN. Such an optical encoding results in ~24,000 times reduction in computational operations, with a state-of-the art classification accuracy (~73.2%) in free-space optical system. In addition, our analog optical encoder, trained for CIFAR-10 data, can be transferred to the ImageNet subset, High-10, without any modifications, and still exhibits moderate accuracy. Our results evidence the potential of hybrid optical/digital computer vision system in which the optical frontend can pre-process an ambient scene to reduce the energy and latency of the whole computer vision system.</description>

      <title>Attomicroscopy imaging and control of electron motion in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond science has leveraged the highly nonlinear interactions between intense few-cycle laser pulses and matter, allowing for unprecedented observation and control of electron motion with remarkable temporal resolution. However, most existing experiments focusing on laser-controlled attosecond dynamics have dealt with quasi-bound electrons released in the ionization continua of atoms, molecules, or conduction bands in solid-state systems. Here, we employed the recently developed attomicroscopy imaging tool to investigate, visualize, and manipulate the motion of bound electrons in graphene. By adjusting the carrier-envelope phase and the field strength of the driving electric field, we were able to control both the amplitude and direction of the field-induced electron current between carbon atoms in graphene. This research opens new avenues for understanding and controlling dynamic, on-demand electron motion processes, including chemical reactions, molecular bonding, and the electronic properties of materials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, a recently developed snapshot hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system based on Computed Tomography Imaging Spectroscopy (CTIS) is utilized to determine Brix and pH values in Sheegene 20 table grapes through Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) modeling. The performance of the CTIS system is compared with that of a state-of-the-art line scan HSI system by imaging 100 grapes across both platforms. Reference measurements of Brix and pH values are obtained directly using a refractometer and a pH meter, as these parameters are essential for assessing the quality of table and wine grapes. The findings indicate that the spectra captured by the CTIS camera correlate well with the reference measurements, despite the system's narrower spectral range. The CTIS camera's advantages, including its lower cost, portability, and reduced susceptibility to motion errors, highlight its potential for promising in-field applications in grape quality assessment.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulation of the European XFEL scintillating screens point spread function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The European XFEL is equipped with scintillating screens as a profile measurement monitor. The scintillating material used is Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce). At most of the stations, the screen is positioned perpendicular to the electron beam, with scintillation observed at a backward angle. The scintillator thickness is usually 200 um, making the resolution worse in the plane with the angle, as it allows for the entire particle track within the scintillator to be seen. Besides, aberrations are introduced by the objective used. This study outlines an accurate simulation of the point spread function (PSF) caused by all distortions of the optical system and, in addition, a method to improve the screens resolution by including the PSF into a fitting function, assuming a Gaussian beam shape.</description>

      <title>xSCYTE: Express Single-frame Cytometer through Tomographic Phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid, comprehensive, and accurate cell phenotyping without compromising viability, is crucial to many important biomedical applications, including stem-cell therapy, drug screening, and liquid biopsy. Typical image cytometry methods acquire two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence images, where the fluorescence labelling process may damage living cells, and the information from 2D images is not comprehensive enough for precise cell analysis. Although three-dimensional (3D) label-free image cytometry holds great promise, its high throughput development faces several technical challenges. Here, we report eXpress Single-frame CYtometer through Tomographic phasE (xSCYTE), which reconstructs 3D Refractive Index (RI) maps of cells with diffraction-limited resolution. With these high-speed and high-precision imaging capabilities empowered by artificial intelligence, we envision xSCYTE may open up many new avenues of biomedical investigations and industries, such as multi-omic assays and quality control during cellular therapeutic manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of femtosecond laser interaction with the central nervous system in zebrafish</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05453v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the photodamage mechanism underlying the highly nonlinear dynamic of femtosecond laser pulses at the second transparent window of tissue is crucial for label-free microscopy. Here, we report the identification of two cavitation regimes from 1030 nm pulses when interacting with the central nervous system in zebrafish. We show that at low repetition rates, the damage is confined due to plasma-based ablation and sudden local temperature rise. At high repetition rates, the damage becomes collateral due to plasma-mediated photochemistry. Furthermore, we investigate the role of fluorescence labels with linear and nonlinear absorption pathways in optical breakdown. To verify our findings, we examined cell death and cellular responses to tissue damage, including the recruitment of fibroblasts and immune cells after irradiation. These findings contribute to advancing the emerging nonlinear optical microscopy techniques and provide a strategy for inducing precise, and localized injuries using near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses.</description>

      <title>Recovery of topologically robust merging bound states in the continuum in photonic structures with broken symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical bound states in the continuum (BICs) provide a unique mechanism of light confinement that holds great potential for fundamental and applied research in optics and photonics. Of particular interest are merging BICs realized in planar periodic structures by merging accidental and symmetry-protected BICs. Topological nature of merging BICs renders their $Q$ factors exceptionally high and robust. However, the existence of accidental BICs relies on the up-down mirror symmetry of the structure. If this symmetry is broken, e.g., by a substrate, the $Q$ factor of the mode drops down. Consequently, ultrahigh-$Q$ merging BICs cannot be achieved in substrate-supported structures. Here, by studying the case of a one-dimensional periodic dielectric grating, we discover a simple method to fully compensate for the detrimental effect of breaking the up-down mirror symmetry. The method makes use of a thin layer of a high-refractive-index dielectric material on one side of the structure, allowing one to restore the diverging $Q$ factor of the accidental BIC and fully recover the merged BIC. By investigating the far-field polarization patterns of the modified gratings, we show that the integer-charge polarization vortices of the accidental BICs are restored by intersecting the momentum-space trajectories of circularly polarized half-vortices simultaneously in the upward and downward radiation directions. Our approach can enable flexible design, feasible realization, and extended applications of topologically robust BICs in various systems.</description>

      <title>Polarimetric compressed sensing with hollow, self-assembled diffractive films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensing light's polarization and wavefront direction enables surface curvature assessment, material identification, shadow differentiation, and improved image quality in turbid environments. Traditional polarization cameras utilize multiple sensor measurements per pixel and polarization-filtering optics, which result in reduced image resolution. We propose a nanophotonic pipeline that enables compressive sensing and reduces the sampling requirements with a low-refractive-index, self-assembled optical encoder. These nanostructures scatter light into lattice modes, which encode the wavefront direction and the polarization ellipticity in the linearly-polarized components of the diffracted, interference patterns. Combining optical encoders with a neural network, the system predicts pointing and polarization when the interference patterns are adequately sampled. A comparison of ``ordered'' and ``random'' optical encoders shows that the latter both blurs the interference patterns and achieves higher resolution. Our work centers on the unexpected modulation and spatial multiplexing of incident light polarization by self-assembled hollow nanocavity arrays as a class of materials distinct from traditional metasurfaces that will not only enable encoding for polarization and optical computing but also for compressed sensing and imaging.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional and Selective Displacement Sensing of a Levitated Nanoparticle via Spatial Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel detection method that significantly improves the precision of real-time measurement of the three-dimensional displacement of a levitated dipolar scatterer. Our technique relies on the spatial mode decomposition of the light scattered by the levitated object, allowing us to simultaneously and selectively extract the position information of all translational degrees of freedom with minimal losses. To this end, we collect all the light back-scattered from a levitated nanoparticle using a parabolic mirror and couple it into a spatial mode sorter. The sorter effectively demultiplexes the information content of the scattered electric field, resulting in each of the nanoparticle's translational degrees of freedom being selectively encoded in the amplitude of orthogonal optical modes. We report measurement efficiencies of ${(\eta_{^{\mathrm{tot}}}^{_{x}}, \eta_{^{\mathrm{tot}}}^{_{y}}, \eta_{^{\mathrm{tot}}}^{_{z}}) = (0.14, 0.16, 0.32)}$ $&gt;$ 1/9, which should enable the 3D motional quantum ground state of a levitated optomechanical system. Further, we believe this technique opens up the possibility to implement coherent feedback control of a levitated nanoparticle.</description>

      <title>Waveguide-multiplexed photonic matrix-vector multiplication processor using multiport photodetectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The slowing down of Moore's law has driven the development of application-specific processors for deep learning. Analog photonic processors offer a promising solution for accelerating matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) in deep learning by leveraging parallel computations in the optical domain. Intensity-based photonic MVM processors, which do not utilize the phase information of light, are appealing due to their simplified operations. However, existing intensity-based schemes for such processors often employ wavelength multiplexing or mode multiplexing, both of which have limited scalability due to high insertion loss or wavelength crosstalk. In this work, we present a scalable intensity-based photonic MVM processor based on the concept of waveguide multiplexing. This scheme employs multiport photodetectors (PDs) to sum the intensities of multiple optical signals, eliminating the need for multiple wavelengths or modes. A 16-port Ge PD with a 3 dB bandwidth of 11.8 GHz at a bias voltage of -3 V is demonstrated, and it can be further scaled up to handle 250 ports while maintaining a 6.1 GHz operation bandwidth. A 4 $\times$ 4 circuit fabricated on a Si-on-insulator (SOI) platform is used to perform MVMs in a 3-layer neural network designed for classifying Iris flowers, achieving a classification accuracy of 93.3%. Furthermore, the performance of large-scale circuits in a convolutional neural network (CNN) for Fashion-MNIST is simulated, resulting in a classification accuracy of 90.53%. This work provides a simplified and scalable approach to photonic MVM, laying a foundation for large-scale and multi-dimensional photonic matrix-matrix multiplication in optical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Characterization of Photonic Lanterns Using Coupled-Mode Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design space for the fabrication of photonic lanterns is vast, which allows for a great diversity of designs but also complicates finding the right parameters for a given component. Coupled-mode theory is a great tool to sort through the parameter space and find the right designs for a multiplicity of photonic lantern types, including conventional, mode-selective, and anything in-between. It correctly models the behavior of the fabricated component, but it also simplifies the task of finding the right fabrication sequence by computing the all-important adiabatic criteria, which dictate which transverse modes will couple, and at which step of the recipe. Here, using coupled-mode theory, we predict and test experimentally the behavior of four types of 3X1 photonic lanterns ranging from conventional to mode-specific and hybrid configurations, and explain mode-coupling, operation bandwidth, and excess loss mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization of blazed gratings under conical incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A topology optimization method is presented and applied to a blazed diffraction grating in reflection under conical incidence. This type of gratings is meant to disperse the incident light on one particular diffraction order and this property is fundamental in spectroscopy. Conventionally, a blazed metallic grating is made of a sawtooth profile designed to work with the +/-1st diffraction order in reflection. In this paper, we question this intuitive triangular pattern and look for optimal opto-geometric characteristics using topology optimization based on Finite Element modelling of Maxwell's equations. In practical contexts, the grating geometry is mono-periodic but it is enlightened by a 3D plane wave with a wavevector outside of the plane of invariance. Consequently, this study deals with the resolution of a direct and inverse problem using the Finite Element Method in this intermediate state between 2D and 3D: the so-called conical incidence. A multi-wavelength objective is used in order to obtain a broadband blazed effect. Finally, several numerical experiments are detailed. The results show that it is possible to reach a 98% diffraction efficiency on the -1st diffraction order if the optimization is performed on a single wavelength, and that the reflection integrated over the [400,1500]nm wavelength range can be 29% higher in absolute terms, 56% in relative terms, than that of the sawtooth blazed grating when using a multi-wavelength optimization criterion (from 52% to 81%).</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Spherical Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Updates to the Chu-Harrington Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07085v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large spherical radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit has limitations in predicting bandwidth. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n&gt;ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</description>

      <title>Differential pumping for kHz operation of a Laser Wakefield accelerator based on a continuously flowing Hydrogen gas jet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laser-Wakefield Accelerators (LWFA) running at kHz repetition rates hold great potential for applications. They typically operate with low-energy, highly compressed laser pulses focused in high-pressure gas targets. Experiments have shown that the best-quality electron beams are achieved using Hydrogen gas targets. However, continuous operation with Hydrogen requires a dedicated pumping system. This work presents the design of a differential pumping system, enabling, for the first time, continuous operation of our kHz LWFA using a high-pressure Hydrogen gas jet. The system successfully maintained a pressure below 3e-4 mbar, even with a free-flowing gas jet operating at 140 bar backing pressure. Numerical fluid dynamics and optical simulations were used to guide and validate the system's design.</description>
