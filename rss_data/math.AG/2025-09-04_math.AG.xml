      <title>Realization of Cohomology Classes in Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of irreducible subvarieties has recently seen a surge of interest due to connections with convex geometry. In this paper, we study cohomology classes of Grassmannians that are realizable by irreducible subvarieties. We completely classify the cohomology classes that can be realized by irreducible subvarieties in dimensions 2 and 3 and codimensions 2 and 3. We also classify all the classes that can be realizable by an irreducible subvariety for the Grassmannians $G(2,n)$ for $n \leq 6$ and $G(3,6)$. We classify the cohomology classes in all dimensions that are, up to positive multiple, realizable by an irreducible subvariety for the Grassmannians $G(2,n)$.</description>

      <title>A primer on measures of irrationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measures of irrationality are a numerical way of quantifying how far a given variety is from being rational (or rationally connected, uniruled, etc.). In the last two decades, there has been renewed interest in the study of these invariants. The goal of this expository survey is to summarize known results from the point of view of the Kodaira--Enriques classification of surfaces, highlight recent progress, and discuss a number of open problems and questions.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Orbit Construction of GKZ-Type Systems for Commutative Linear Algebraic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Fourier-orbit construction of GKZ-type D-modules associated with commutative linear algebraic group actions G = TU (where T is an algebraic torus and U a unipotent group) on a vector space V. This framework generalizes the classical toric GKZ system to mixed torus-unipotent settings. We establish generic holonomicity via a parameter-free symbolic moment ideal, develop symbolic tools for rank analysis, and exhibit new families with Airy-type irregular behavior. Our approach recovers the classical GKZ rank formula in the pure torus case and provides explicit lower bounds in the mixed case.</description>

      <title>The irreducibility of the moduli space of pointed stable curves with dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{(N)}$-oper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\mathrm{PGL}_n^{(N)}$-oper is a specific type of flat $\mathrm{PGL}_n$-bundle on an algebraic curve in prime characteristic $p$ enhanced by an action of the sheaf of differential operators of level $N-1$. In this paper, we introduce and study a higher-level generalization of the Hitchin-Mochizuki morphism on the moduli space of $\mathrm{PGL}_n^{(N)}$-opers, defined via the characteristic polynomials of their $p^N$-curvatures. As an application, we prove the irreducibility of the moduli space classifying pointed stable curves equipped with dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{(N)}$-opers, i.e., $\mathrm{PGL}_2^{(N)}$-opers with vanishing $p^N$-curvature.</description>

      <title>Explicit computation of the generic degree of the generalized Verschiebung in rank two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to apply previous work on dormant opers to the study of the moduli space of stable bundles in positive characteristic. We affirmatively resolve the rank $2$ case of a conjecture proposed by the second author, which predicts a direct relationship between the number of higher-level dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_2$-opers and the generic degree of the generalized Verschiebung map for rank $2$ stable bundles induced by Frobenius pull-back. As a consequence, we obtain a procedure for explicitly determining these generic degrees in the previously unexplored range of genera by counting certain combinatorial objects.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note studies $\mathrm{PGL}_n$-opers arising from generalized hypergeometric differential equations in prime characteristic $p$. We prove that these opers are rigid within the class of dormant opers. By combining this rigidity result with previous work in the enumerative geometry of dormant opers, we obtain a complete and explicit description of the $2$d TQFTs that compute the number of dormant $\mathrm{PGL}_n$-opers for primes $p \leq 7$.</description>

      <title>Welschinger--Witt invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Welschinger invariants are signed counts of real rational curves satisfying contraints. Quadratic Gromov--Witten invariants give such counts over general fields of characteristic different from 2 and 3. For rational del Pezzo surfaces over a field, we propose a conjectural relationship between Welschinger and quadratic Gromov--Witten invariants. We construct multivariable unramified Witt invariants, in the sense of Serre, from Welschinger invariants and call them Welschinger--Witt invariants. We show that quadratic Gromov--Witten invariants are also Witt invariants and control their ramification. We then conjecture an equality between these Witt invariants, in particular giving a conjectural computation of all the quadratic Gromov--Witten invariants of $k$-rational surfaces. We prove this conjecture for $k$-rational del Pezzo surfaces of degree at least 6.</description>

Abstract: We determine the pure magnets (certain monoids) for the double scalar action of $\mathbb{G}_m^2$ on $\mathbb{P}^2$, and compute the associated attractors, yielding a canonical, fully explicit stratification. This provides a concrete non-affine example illustrating the invariants of Algebraic Magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work [CMS24] we defined a new class of enumerative invariants called $k$-leaky double Hurwitz descendants, generalizing both descendant integrals of double ramification cycles and $k$-leaky double Hurwitz numbers. Here, we focus on the one-part version of these numbers, i.e.\ when the positive ramification profile is $(d)$. We derive recursions and use them to produce explicit formulas and structure results for some infinite families of these numbers.</description>

      <title>An axiomatic approach to analytic $1$-affineness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of $1$-affineness was originally formulated by Gaitsgory in the context of derived algebraic geometry. Motivated by applications to rigid and analytic geometry, we introduce two very general and abstract frameworks where it makes to ask for objects to be $1$-affine with respect to some sheaf of categories. The first framework is suited for studying the problem of $1$-affineness when the sheaf of categories arises from an operation in a six-functor formalism over $\mathscr{C}$; we apply it to the setting of analytic stacks and condensed mathematics. The second one concerns $1$-affineness in the context of quasi-coherent sheaves of categorical modules over stable module categories: it simultaneously generalizes the algebro-geometric setting of Gaitsgory and makes it possible to formulate the problem also when dealing with rigid analytic varieties and categories of nuclear modules.</description>

      <title>On the Homogeneous Space of a Pair of Associative Composition Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between associative composition algebras of dimensions 2 and 4 within the context of homogeneous spaces, with a particular focus on Hamiltonian quaternions, is explored. In the special case of Hamiltonian quaternions, the equivariant cohomology rings of the homogeneous spaces are computed to gain a deeper understanding of their topological structure. In the general case, equivariant K-theory is utilized to examine the categories of vector bundles on these spaces.Taking this one step further, the Grothendieck ring of the category of locally free modules on the variety of singular matrices of size $n$ with entries from an associative composition algebra is determined. As a natural extension of these ideas, to define and study determinantal varieties of matrices with entries from a composition algebra, a notion of rank with respect to the base composition algebra is introduced, and criteria are established for the spanning set of a finite set of matrices with entries from the associative composition algebra to contain elements of certain ranks.</description>

      <title>Differential forms on varieties with pre-$k$-rational singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complex algebraic variety. With $\mathbb{Q}$-coefficients, the compactly supported cohomology groups $H^{i}_{c}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ and the compactly supported intersection cohomology groups $IH^{i}_{c}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ have mixed Hodge structures. We compare these two mixed Hodge structures for varieties with pre-$k$-rational singularities. We then study various notions of differential forms on varieties with pre-$k$-rational singularities. In particular, we investigate the depth of the complex $\underline{\Omega}^{p}_{X}$, where $\underline{\Omega}^{p}_{X}$ is the $p^{th}$-graded piece of the Du Bois complex.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p&gt;0$, and let $X\subseteq\mathbb{P}^n_k$ be a quasi-projective variety that is $F$-rational and $F$-pure. We prove that if $H \subseteq \mathbb{P}^n_k$ is a general hyperplane, then $X \cap H$ is also $F$-rational and $F$-pure. Of related but independent interest, we find a characterization in terms of the torsion index of $\mathbb{Q}$-Gorenstein varieties with isolated non-$F$-regular loci which are $F$-pure but not $F$-regular.</description>

We deduce the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for their intermediate Jacobians, and use it to construct new examples of varieties over finite fields satisfying the Tate conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of nets of conics containing at least one double line in $\mathrm{PG}(2,q)$ for $q$ even. This classification is obtained by classifying the orbits of planes in $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$ that intersect the nucleus plane in at least one point, under the action of the group that stabilizes the Veronese surface in $\mathrm{PG}(5,q)$ for $q\geq 4$ even. As a result, we show the existence of $18$ nets containing at least one double line, $9$ of which have an empty base.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the local behavior of integral points on log pairs near a fixed rational point in the boundary by means of an integral approximation constant. In light of Siegel's theorem about integral points on curves and McKinnon's conjecture on rational approximation constants, we conjecture that integral points that are close to the fixed point in archimedean topology should lie on certain rational curves with at most two points at infinity on weakly log Fano varieties. We verify this conjecture for a number of examples.</description>

Abstract: Frobenius splitting, pioneered by Hochster and Roberts in the 1970s and Mehta and Ramanathan in the 1980s, is a technique in characteristic $p$ commutative algebra and algebraic geometry used to control singularities. In the aughts, Knutson showed that Frobenius splittings of a certain type descend through Gr\"obner degeneration of a certain type, called geometric vertex decomposition. In the present paper, we give a partial converse to Knutson's result. We show that a Frobenius splitting that compatibly splits both link and deletion of a geometric vertex decomposition can, under an additional hypothesis on the form of the splitting, be lifted to a splitting that compatibly splits the original ideal. We discuss an example showing that the additional hypothesis cannot be removed. Our argument uses the relationship between geometric vertex decomposition and Gorenstein liaison developed by Klein and Rajchgot. Additionally, we show that Li's double determinantal varieties defined by maximal minors are Frobenius split.</description>

      <title>The boundary of the moduli space of stable cubic fivefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4525</link>
      <description>arXiv:1401.4525v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Geometric Invariant Theory, we compactify the moduli space of stable cubic fivefolds by adjoining strictly semistable hypersurfaces. We prove that the strictly semistable locus decomposes into twenty-one irreducible components and provide an explicit closed-orbit representative for each. Our Jacobian computations show that wild isolated hypersurface singularities already occur along the boundary such as quasi-homogeneous types of corank 3 and 4, thereby marking dimension five as a threshold beyond the ADE paradigm known for cubic threefolds and fourfolds. We also record adjacency relations among boundary components as wall crossings in Kirwan's stratification.</description>

      <title>Quantum intersection numbers and the Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{CP}^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a quantum tau-function for a natural quantization of the KdV hierarchy was introduced in a work of Dubrovin, Gu\'er\'e, Rossi, and the second author. A certain natural choice of a quantum tau-function was then described by the first author, the coefficients of the logarithm of this series are called the quantum intersection numbers. Because of the Kontsevich-Witten theorem, a part of the quantum intersection numbers coincides with the classical intersection numbers of psi-classes on the moduli spaces of stable algebraic curves. In this paper, we relate the quantum intersection numbers to the stationary relative Gromov-Witten invariants of $(\mathbb{CP}^1,0,\infty)$ with an insertion of a Hodge class. Using the Okounkov-Pandharipande approach to such invariants (with the trivial Hodge class) through the infinite wedge formalism, we then give a short proof of an explicit formula for the ``purely quantum'' part of the quantum intersection numbers, found by the first author, which in particular relates these numbers to the one-part double Hurwitz numbers.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements from the perspective of homological properties of their derivation modules. In particular, we define the notion of the type of hyperplane arrangements that will be used in our characterization of rigid Cynk-Szemberg octic hyperplane arrangements. Moreover, we deliver a combinatorial non-freeness criterion for essential hyperplane arrangements in $\mathbb{C}^{4}$.</description>

      <title>Images of toric variety and amplified endomorphism of weak Fano threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that some important classes of weak Fano $3$-folds of Picard rank $2$ do not satisfy Bott vanishing. Using this we show that any smooth projective $3$-fold $X$ of Picard rank $2$ with $-K_X$ nef which is the image of a projective toric variety is toric. This proves a special case of a conjecture by Ochetta-Wisniewski, extending a corresponding previous work for Fano $3$-folds. We also show that a weak Fano $3$-fold of Picard rank $2$ having an int-amplified endomorphism is toric. This proves a special case of a conjecture by Fakhrudding, Meng, Zhang and Zhong, extending corresponding previous work for Fano $3$-folds.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs embedded in generic ways and realizing them as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with long-time interest of us, especially, the author, in realizing graphs as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions of certain nice classes.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the set consisting of all components of preimages of all single points and endowed with the quotient topology canonically. In tame cases, such objects are graphs. The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and homeomorphic to a closed interval. These graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry since theory of Morse functions has been established in the former half of the last century.
  We present a new answer to the problem, saying that generically embedded planar graphs are homeomorphic to the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions obtained by elementary polynomials and elementary procedures.</description>

      <title>Completions of complexes of differential modules on singular schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spencer cohomology theory studies the cohomology of chain complexes of modules over the ring of differential operators $\mathscr{D}$ of a smooth analytic space. In this paper we give a generalisation of Spencer cohomology suitable for singular schemes of finite type over a field. Our motivation was a conjecture of Vinogradov concerning the homological properties of differential operators on singular affine varieties; namely, that complexes of certain such operators are acyclic if and only if the variety is smooth. We will provide a negative answer to Vinogradov's conjecture as stated. In principle Vinogradov's conjecture can also be posed for the Spencer complex of a general $\mathscr{D}$-module -- however the answer is trivial, since singularities prohibit a definition of Spencer cohomology with any good properties. Our main result will be the construction of a Spencer complex on a large class of singular schemes which is suitable as a cohomology theory for the space. Following this we are able to ask the same question as Vinogradov in this case, where we give a more positive answer. Our main technique draws from Hartshorne's construction of de Rham cohomology by formal completion.</description>

Abstract: We give a universal property of the construction of the ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors of a commutative ring, endowed with Witt vectors Frobenius and Verschiebung, and generalize this construction to the derived setting. We define an $\infty$-category of $p$-typical derived $\delta$-Cartier rings and show that the derived ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors of a derived ring is naturally an object in this $\infty$-category. Moreover, we show that for any prime $p$, the formation of the derived ring of $p$-typical Witt vectors gives an equivalence between the $\infty$-category of all derived rings and the full subcategory of all derived $p$-typical $\delta$-Cartier rings consisting of $V$-complete objects.</description>

      <title>Algebra and geometry of ASM weak order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Much of modern Schubert calculus is centered on Schubert varieties in the complete flag variety and on their classes in its integral cohomology ring. Under the Borel isomorphism, these classes are represented by distinguished polynomials called Schubert polynomials, introduced by Lascoux and Sch\"utzenberger.
  Knutson and Miller showed that Schubert polynomials are multidegrees of matrix Schubert varieties, affine varieties introduced by Fulton, which are closely related to Schubert varieties. Many roads to studying Schubert polynomials pass through unions and intersections of matrix Schubert varieties. The third author showed that the natural indexing objects of arbitrary intersections of matrix Schubert varieties are alternating sign matrices (ASMs). Every ASM variety is expressible as a union of matrix Schubert varieties.
  Many fundamental algebro-geometric invariants (e.g., codimension, degree, and Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity) are well understood combinatorially for matrix Schubert varieties, substantially via the combinatorics of strong Bruhat order on $S_n$. The extension of strong order to ASM(n), the set of $n \times n$ ASMs, has so far not borne as much algebro-geometric fruit for ASM varieties.
  Hamaker and Reiner proposed an extension of weak Bruhat order from $S_n$ to ASM(n), which they studied from a combinatorial perspective. In the present paper, we place this work on algebro-geometric footing. We use weak order on ASMs to give a characterization of codimension of ASM varieties. We also show that weak order operators commute with K-theoretic divided difference operators and that they satisfy the same derivative formula that facilitated the first general combinatorial computation of Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of matrix Schubert varieties. Finally, we build from these results to generalizations that apply to arbitrary unions of matrix Schubert varieties.</description>

Abstract: We establish a certain strong smooth stratification of sets and a term description of functions, which are definable over valued fields (possibly non algebraically closed) with separated analytic structure. The basic tools are: elimination of valued field quantifiers, term structure of definable functions, Lipschitz cell decomposition with preparation of $RV$-parametrized sets, and a non-Archimedean definable version of Bierstone-Milman's canonical desingularization algorithm, achieved in an earlier paper of ours. As application, we give uniform Yomdin-Gromov parametrizations over Henselian fields $K$ with separated analytic structure.</description>

Abstract: Let $A,B$ be nonzero rational numbers. Consider the elliptic curve $E_{A,B}/\mathbb{Q}(t)$ with Weierstrass equation $y^2=x^3+At^6+B$.
  An algorithm to determine $\mathrm{rank } E_{A,B}(\mathbb{Q}(t))$ as a function of $(A,B)$ was presented in a recent paper by Desjardins and Naskrecki. We will give a different and shorter proof for the correctness of that algorithm, using a more geometric approach and discuss for which classes of examples this approach might be useful.</description>

Abstract: The connected components of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}(\mathbb{R})$ are in bijection with the $(n-1)!/2$ dihedral orderings of $[n]$. They are all isomorphic. We construct monomial maps between them, and use these maps to prove a conjecture of Arkani-Hamed, He, and Lam in the case of $\mathcal{M}_{0,n}$. Namely, we provide a bijection between connected components and sign patterns that are consistent with the extended $u$-relations for the dihedral embedding.</description>
