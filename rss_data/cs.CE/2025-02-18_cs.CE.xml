      <title>Local Multiple Traces Formulation for Heterogeneous Electromagnetic Scattering: Implementation and Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional time-harmonic electromagnetic (EM) wave scattering transmission problem involving heterogeneous scatterers. The fields are approximated using the local multiple traces formulation (MTF), originally introduced for acoustic scattering. This scheme assigns independent boundary unknowns to each subdomain and weakly enforces Calder\'on identities along with interface transmission conditions. As a result, the MTF effectively handles shared points or edges among multiple subdomains, while supporting various preconditioning and parallelization strategies. Nevertheless, implementing standard solvers presents significant challenges, particularly in managing the degrees of freedom associated with subdomains and their interfaces. To address these difficulties, we propose a novel framework that suitably defines approximation spaces and enables the efficient exchange of normal vectors across subdomain boundaries. This framework leverages the skeleton mesh, representing the union of all interfaces, as the computational backbone, and constitutes the first scalable implementation of the EM MTF. Furthermore, we conduct several numerical experiments, exploring the effects of increasing subdomains and block On-Surface-Raditation-Condition (OSRC) preconditioning, to validate our approach and provide insights for future developments.</description>

      <title>Neural Chaos: A Spectral Stochastic Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building surrogate models with uncertainty quantification capabilities is essential for many engineering applications where randomness, such as variability in material properties, is unavoidable. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is widely recognized as a to-go method for constructing stochastic solutions in both intrusive and non-intrusive ways. Its application becomes challenging, however, with complex or high-dimensional processes, as achieving accuracy requires higher-order polynomials, which can increase computational demands and or the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, PCE requires specialized treatments to manage random variables that are not independent, and these treatments may be problem-dependent or may fail with increasing complexity. In this work, we adopt the spectral expansion formalism used in PCE; however, we replace the classical polynomial basis functions with neural network (NN) basis functions to leverage their expressivity. To achieve this, we propose an algorithm that identifies NN-parameterized basis functions in a purely data-driven manner, without any prior assumptions about the joint distribution of the random variables involved, whether independent or dependent. The proposed algorithm identifies each NN-parameterized basis function sequentially, ensuring they are orthogonal with respect to the data distribution. The basis functions are constructed directly on the joint stochastic variables without requiring a tensor product structure. This approach may offer greater flexibility for complex stochastic models, while simplifying implementation compared to the tensor product structures typically used in PCE to handle random vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through several numerical examples of varying complexity and provide comparisons with classical PCE.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Based Framework for Quantum Machine Learning: Bridging Classical Data and Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper dives into the exciting and rapidly growing field of quantum computing, explaining its core ideas, current progress, and how it could revolutionize the way we solve complex problems. It starts by breaking down the basics, like qubits, quantum circuits, and how principles like superposition and entanglement make quantum computers fundamentally different-and far more powerful for certain tasks-than the classical computers we use today. We also explore how quantum computing deals with complex problems and why it is uniquely suited for challenges classical systems struggle to handle. A big part of this paper focuses on Quantum Machine Learning (QML), where the strengths of quantum computing meet the world of artificial intelligence. By processing massive datasets and optimizing intricate algorithms, quantum systems offer new possibilities for machine learning. We highlight different approaches to combining quantum and classical computing, showing how they can work together to produce faster and more accurate results. Additionally, we explore the tools and platforms available-like TensorFlow Quantum, Qiskit and PennyLane-that are helping researchers and developers bring these theories to life. Of course, quantum computing has its hurdles. Challenges like scaling up hardware, correcting errors, and keeping qubits stable are significant roadblocks. Yet, with rapid advancements in cloud-based platforms and innovative technologies, the potential of quantum computing feels closer than ever. This paper aims to offer readers a clear and comprehensive introduction to quantum computing, its role in machine learning, and the immense possibilities it holds for the future of technology.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven Convergence Analysis in Multijurisdictional Compliance Using BERT and K-Means Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital data continues to grow, there has been a shift towards using effective regulatory mechanisms to safeguard personal information. The CCPA of California and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union are two of the most important privacy laws. The regulation is intended to safeguard consumer privacy, but it varies greatly in scope, definitions, and methods of enforcement. This paper presents a fresh approach to adaptive compliance, using machine learning and emphasizing natural language processing (NLP) as the primary focus of comparison between the GDPR and CCPA. Using NLP, this study compares various regulations to identify areas where they overlap or diverge. This includes the "right to be forgotten" provision in the GDPR and the "opt-out of sale" provision under CCPA. International companies can learn valuable lessons from this report, as it outlines strategies for better enforcement of laws across different nations. Additionally, the paper discusses the challenges of utilizing NLP in legal literature and proposes methods to enhance the model-ability of machine learning models for studying regulations. The study's objective is to "bridge the gap between legal knowledge and technical expertise" by developing regulatory compliance strategies that are more efficient in operation and more effective in data protection.</description>

      <title>Hybrid high-order methods for elasto-acoustic wave propagation in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We devise a Hybrid High-Order (HHO) method for the coupling between the acoustic and elastic wave equations in the time domain. A first-order formulation in time is considered. The HHO method can use equal-order and mixed-order settings, as well as O(1)- and O(1/h)-stabilizations. An energy-error estimate is established in the time-continuous case. A numerical spectral analysis is performed, showing that O(1)-stabilization is required to avoid excessive CFL limitations for explicit time discretizations. Moreover, the spectral radius of the stiffness matrix is fairly independent of the geometry of the mesh cells. For analytical solutions on general meshes, optimal convergence rates of order (k+1) are shown in both equal- and mixed-order settings using O(1)-stabilization, whereas order (k+2) is achieved in the mixed-order setting using O(1/h)-stabilization. Test cases with a Ricker wavelet as an initial condition showcase the relevance of the proposed method for the simulation of elasto-acoustic wave propagation across media with contrasted material properties.</description>

      <title>\textsc{FLAG-Trader}: Fusion LLM-Agent with Gradient-based Reinforcement Learning for Financial Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on multimodal financial data have demonstrated impressive reasoning capabilities in various financial tasks. However, they often struggle with multi-step, goal-oriented scenarios in interactive financial markets, such as trading, where complex agentic approaches are required to improve decision-making. To address this, we propose \textsc{FLAG-Trader}, a unified architecture integrating linguistic processing (via LLMs) with gradient-driven reinforcement learning (RL) policy optimization, in which a partially fine-tuned LLM acts as the policy network, leveraging pre-trained knowledge while adapting to the financial domain through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Through policy gradient optimization driven by trading rewards, our framework not only enhances LLM performance in trading but also improves results on other financial-domain tasks. We present extensive empirical evidence to validate these enhancements.</description>

Abstract: We study Walrasian economies (or general equilibrium models) and their solution concept, the Walrasian equilibrium. A key challenge in this domain is identifying price-adjustment processes that converge to equilibrium. One such process, t\^atonnement, is an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by L\'eon Walras. While continuous-time variants of t\^atonnement are known to converge to equilibrium in economies satisfying the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP), the process fails to converge in a pathological Walrasian economy known as the Scarf economy. To address these issues, we analyze Walrasian economies using variational inequalities (VIs), an optimization framework. We introduce the class of mirror extragradient algorithms, which, under suitable Lipschitz-continuity-like assumptions, converge to a solution of any VI satisfying the Minty condition in polynomial time. We show that the set of Walrasian equilibria of any balanced economy-which includes among others Arrow-Debreu economies-corresponds to the solution set of an associated VI that satisfies the Minty condition but is generally discontinuous. Applying the mirror extragradient algorithm to this VI we obtain a class of t\^atonnement-like processes, which we call the mirror extrat\^atonnement process. While our VI formulation is generally discontinuous, it is Lipschitz-continuous in variationally stable Walrasian economies with bounded elasticity-including those satisfying WARP and the Scarf economy-thus establishing the polynomial-time convergence of mirror extrat\^atonnement in these economies. We validate our approach through experiments on large Arrow-Debreu economies with Cobb-Douglas, Leontief, and CES consumers, as well as the Scarf economy, demonstrating fast convergence in all cases without failure.</description>

      <title>Detecting hidden structures from a static loading experiment: topology optimization meets physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most noninvasive imaging techniques utilize electromagnetic or acoustic waves originating from multiple locations and directions to identify hidden geometrical structures. Surprisingly, it is also possible to image hidden voids and inclusions buried within an object using a single static thermal or mechanical loading experiment by observing the response of the exposed surface of the body, but this problem is challenging to invert. Although physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise as a simple-yet-powerful tool for problem inversion, they have not yet been applied to imaging problems with a priori unknown topology. Here, we introduce a topology optimization framework based on PINNs that identifies concealed geometries using exposed surface data from a single loading experiment, without prior knowledge of the number or types of shapes. We allow for arbitrary solution topology by representing the geometry using a material density field combined with a novel eikonal regularization technique. We validate our framework by detecting the number, locations, and shapes of hidden voids and inclusions in many example cases, in both 2D and 3D, and we demonstrate the method's robustness to noise and sparsity in the data. Our methodology opens a pathway for PINNs to solve geometry optimization problems in engineering.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Learning for Glass Composition Screening</title>

Abstract: Glass composition screening seeks to identify the optimal combination of components that satisfy specific performance criteria, thereby facilitating the development of new glass materials for a wide range of applications. However, the inherent complexity of multicomponent glass systems presents significant challenges in effectively correlating composition with property and achieving efficient screening processes. Current machine learning approaches for composition screening predominantly rely on supervised learning paradigms, which focus on precisely fitting sample labels. These methods not only require large amounts of high-quality data but are also susceptible to overfitting noisy samples and frequently occurring head samples, thereby limiting their generalization capabilities. In this study, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning framework specifically designed to screen glass compositions within predefined glass transition temperature (Tg) ranges. We reformulate the compositional screening task as a classification problem, aiming to predict whether the Tg of a given composition falls within the specified range. To enhance the training dataset and improve the model's resilience to noise, we propose an innovative data augmentation strategy grounded in asymptotic theory. Additionally, we present DeepGlassNet, a specialized network architecture engineered to capture and analyze the intricate interactions between different glass components. Our results demonstrate that DeepGlassNet achieves significantly higher screening accuracy compared to traditional methods and is readily adaptable to other composition screening tasks.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Surrogates for Optimizing Transportation Policies with Agent-Based Models</title>

Abstract: Rapid urbanization and growing urban populations worldwide present significant challenges for cities, including increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Effective strategies are needed to manage traffic volumes and reduce emissions. In practice, traditional traffic flow simulations are used to test those strategies. However, high computational intensity usually limits their applicability in investigating a magnitude of different scenarios to evaluate best policies. This paper presents a first approach of using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) as surrogates for large-scale agent-based simulation models. In a case study using the MATSim model of Paris, the GNN effectively learned the impacts of capacity reduction policies on citywide traffic flow. Performance analysis across various road types and scenarios revealed that the GNN could accurately capture policy-induced effects on edge-based traffic volumes, particularly on roads directly affected by the policies and those with higher traffic volumes.</description>

Abstract: Generative models such as denoising diffusion models are quickly advancing their ability to approximate highly complex data distributions. They are also increasingly leveraged in scientific machine learning, where samples from the implied data distribution are expected to adhere to specific governing equations. We present a framework that unifies generative modeling and partial differential equation fulfillment by introducing a first-principle-based loss term that enforces generated samples to fulfill the underlying physical constraints. Our approach reduces the residual error by up to two orders of magnitude compared to previous work in a fluid flow case study and outperforms task-specific frameworks in relevant metrics for structural topology optimization. We also present numerical evidence that our extended training objective acts as a natural regularization mechanism against overfitting. Our framework is simple to implement and versatile in its applicability for imposing equality and inequality constraints as well as auxiliary optimization objectives.</description>

      <title>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with minimal computational overhead, effectively eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. The methodology accelerates the training process by enabling gradient construction on a fixed, finite discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without relying on labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than $1\,\%$ error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced by integrating a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), enabling the mapping of microstructures to mechanical responses using solely physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields, Additionally, its zero-shot super-resolution capabilities are explored in heterogeneous domains. Finally, SPiFOL is extended to handle 3D problems and further adapted to finite elasticity, demonstrating the robustness of the framework in handling nonlinear mechanical behavior. SPiFOL achieves significantly higher speed-up factors compared to conventional FFT solvers.</description>

      <title>Using Domain Knowledge with Deep Learning to Solve Applied Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of mechanical behavior is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To demonstrate this, stress-strain curves were used to predict key microstructural features of porous materials, and the performance of models trained with and without domain knowledge was compared using five deep learning models: Convolutional Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results of the models with domain-specific characteristics consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values and improved learning efficiency compared to models without prior knowledge. When the models did not include domain knowledge, the model results revealed meaningful patterns were not recognized, while those enhanced with mechanical insights showed superior feature extraction and predictions. These findings underscore the critical role of domain knowledge in guiding deep learning models, highlighting the need to combine domain expertise with data-driven approaches to achieve reliable and accurate outcomes in materials science and related fields.</description>

Abstract: The rapid emergence of hydrogen in long-term energy strategies requires a broad understanding on how hydrogen is currently modelled in national energy system models. This study provides a review on hydrogen representation within selected energy system models that are tailored towards providing policy insights. The paper adopts a multi-layered review approach and selects eleven notable models for the review. The review covers hydrogen production, storage, transportation, trade, demand, modeling strategies, and hydrogen policies. The review suggests existing models would often opt for a simplified representation that can capture each stage of the hydrogen supply chain. This approach allows models to strike a balance between accuracy and preserving computational resources. The paper provides several suggestions for modeling hydrogen in national energy system models.</description>
