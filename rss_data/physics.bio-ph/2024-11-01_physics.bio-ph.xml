      <title>Physics of collective transport and traffic phenomena in biology: progress in 20 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enormous progress have been made in the last 20 years since the publication of our review \cite{csk05polrev} in this journal on transport and traffic phenomena in biology. In this brief article we present a glimpse of the major advances during this period. First, we present similarities and differences between collective intracellular transport of a single micron-size cargo by multiple molecular motors and that of a cargo particle by a team of ants on the basis of the common principle of load-sharing. Second, we sketch several models all of which are biologically motivated extensions of the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP); some of these models represent the traffic of molecular machines, like RNA polymerase (RNAP) and ribosome, that catalyze template-directed polymerization of RNA and proteins, respectively, whereas few other models capture the key features of the traffic of ants on trails. More specifically, using the ASEP-based models we demonstrate the effects of traffic of RNAPs and ribosomes on random and `programmed' errors in gene expression as well as on some other subcellular processes. We recall a puzzling empirical result on the single-lane traffic of predatory ants {\it Leptogenys processionalis} as well as recent attempts to account for this puzzle. We also mention some surprising effects of lane-changing rules observed in a ASEP-based model for 3-lane traffic of army ants. Finally, we explain the conceptual similarities between the pheromone-mediated indirect communication, called stigmergy, between ants on a trail and the floor-field-mediated interaction between humans in a pedestrian traffic. For the floor-field model of human pedestrian traffic we present a major theoretical result that is relevant from the perspective of all types of traffic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Modeling Full-Scale Leaf Venation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vascular network of leaves, comprising xylem and phloem, is a highly optimized system for the delivery of water, nutrients, and sugars. The design rules for these naturally occurring networks have been studied since the time of Leonardo da Vinci, who constructed a local rule for comparing the widths of in- and outgoing veins at branch points. Recently, physical models have been developed that seek to explain the full morphogenesis of leaf venial networks in which veins grow in response to local hydrodynamic feedback. Although these models go beyond simple local rules, they are challenging to compare to experimental data. Here, we extend these hydrodynamic models to a state where the direct comparison with images of full leaves becomes possible on the level of individual veins. We present a dataset of the venial networks of leaves that maintain full network topology and use this to discuss the benefits and drawbacks of such a direct comparison. We apply our approach to the direct estimation of a sink fluctuation parameter, demonstrating consistency within distinct leaf species. Finally, we utilize the ability of the model to run on full leaves to define and calculate exponents for a Murray's law that applies to reticulate venation networks.</description>

      <title>Extended electrochemical monitoring of biomolecular binding using commercially available, reusable electrodes in microliter volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical biosensors ("E-AB" or "E-DNA" type sensors) that utilize square-wave voltammetry originated in academic labs with a few standard experimental configurations for the electrochemical cell and data analysis. We report here on adaptations of these approaches that are friendly to novice scientists such as those in undergraduate laboratories. These approaches utilize commercially available components, low volumes, work over extended periods and enable facile analysis using a custom excel sheet.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter optimal control of F1-ATPase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological molecular machines convert free energy between different forms in cells, often at high efficiency. Optimal control theory provides a framework to elucidate design principles governing energetically efficient driving. Here, we use linear-response theory to design efficient protocols exercising dynamic control of trap center and stiffness in a model of driven F1-ATPase. We find that the key design principles of an efficient protocol can be satisfied either by dynamic control of both parameters, or by dynamic control of a single parameter and a good static choice for the second. These results illustrate that accessing a new degree of dynamic control provides varying performance improvements in different systems.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal pattern formation of membranes induced by surface molecular binding/unbinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium membrane pattern formation is studied using meshless membrane simulation. We consider that molecules bind to either surface of a bilayer membrane and move to the opposite leaflet by flip-flop. When binding does not modify the membrane properties and the transfer rates among the three states are cyclically symmetric, the membrane exhibits spiral-wave and homogeneous-cycling modes at high and low binding rates, respectively, as in an off-lattice cyclic Potts model. When binding changes the membrane spontaneous curvature, these spatiotemporal dynamics are coupled with microphase separation. When two symmetric membrane surfaces are in thermal equilibrium, the membrane domains form 4.8.8 tiling patterns in addition to stripe and spot patterns. In nonequilibrium conditions, moving biphasic domains and time-irreversible fluctuating patterns appear. The domains move ballistically or diffusively depending on the conditions.</description>

      <title>Generic theory of interacting, spinning, active polar particles: a model for cell aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generic framework for describing interacting, spinning, active polar particles, aimed at modelling dense cell aggregates, where cells are treated as polar, rotating objects that interact mechanically with one another and their surrounding environment. Using principles from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we derive constitutive equations for interaction forces, torques, and polarity dynamics. We subsequently use this framework to analyse the spontaneous motion of cell doublets, uncovering a rich phase diagram of collective behaviours, including steady rotation driven by flow-polarity coupling or interactions between polarity and cell position.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>
