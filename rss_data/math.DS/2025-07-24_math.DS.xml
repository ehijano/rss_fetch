      <title>Normally hyperbolic limit tori near monodromic singularities in 3D polynomial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the maximal number $N_h(m)$ of normally hyperbolic limit tori in three-dimensional polynomial vector fields of degree $m$, which extends the classical notion of Hilbert numbers to higher dimensions. Using recent developments in averaging theory, we show the existence of families of vector fields near monodromic singularities, including both Hopf-zero and nilpotent-zero cases, that exhibit multiple nested normally hyperbolic limit tori. This approach allows us to establish improved lower bounds: $N_h(2) \geq 3$, $N_h(3) \geq 5$, $N_h(4) \geq 7$, and $N_h(5) \geq 13$, which are currently the best available in the literature. Furthermore, these bounds are extended using the strict monotonicity of the function $N_h(m)$ and a recursive construction inspired by the Christopher-Lloyd method, leading to new estimates for higher degrees which improves all the previously known results.</description>

      <title>Multifractal analysis of the Lyapunov exponent for random graph directed Markov systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform the multifractal analysis of the Lyapunov exponent for random conformal graph directed Markov systems introduced by Roy and Urba\'nski (2011). We also generalize Bowen's formula for the limit set of a random conformal graph directed Markov system established by Roy and Urba\'nski. To do this, we develop several refined properties of random finitely primitive countable Markov shifts.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a discrete phytoplankton-zooplankton model with Holling type~II grazing and Holling type~III toxin release. The existence and stability of positive fixed points are analyzed, and conditions for the occurrence of Neimark--Sacker bifurcation are established. We show how feedback control can suppress complex dynamics near bifurcation. Global stability of the boundary equilibrium is also discussed. Numerical simulations confirm the theoretical findings, illustrating the rich behavior of the model under varying parameters</description>

      <title>Optical Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of optical billiards, a generalization of classic billiards, where light rays travel within a refractive medium and reflect elastically at the boundary. Inspired by studies of acoustic modes in rapidly rotating stars, optical billiards are approached using Riemannian geometry, treating the refractive index as a metric. The discrete dynamics is explored through geodesics, curvature properties, highlighting similarities and differences with classical billiards. Examples include geodesic circular billiards and refractive media with zero Gaussian curvature, revealing integrability conditions and singular behaviors. The study establishes foundational results for optical billiards, emphasizing their dependence on boundary convexity and refractive index.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis of Generalized Hopf Bifurcation in Ordinary and Delay Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Hopf (Bautin) bifurcation is a well-studied codimension two bifurcation characterized by an equilibrium with a pair of simple purely imaginary eigenvalues as the only critical eigenvalues and the vanishing first Lyapunov coefficient. This bifurcation arises in both ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and delay differential equations (DDEs). Generically, a codimension one bifurcation curve of nonhyperbolic (double) limit cycles ($LPC$ curve) emanates from a generalized Hopf point at the Hopf bifurcation curve $H$. By performing the parameter-dependent center manifold reduction near this point, the first-order predictors to initiate continuation of the $LPC$ curve have been derived in the literature. These predictors, however, do not distinguish the curves $H$ and $LPC$ in the parameter space. In this paper, we overcome this deficiency by deriving higher-order predictors for the $LPC$ curve in ODEs and DDEs for the first time. The new predictors, which require seventh-order derivatives of the system, have been implemented, and their effectiveness is demonstrated in several models.</description>

      <title>Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics with library optimization mechanism: Recursive long-term prediction perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) approach can discover the governing equations of dynamical systems based on measurement data, where the dynamical model is identified as the sparse linear combination of the given basis functions. A major challenge in SINDy is the design of a library, which is a set of candidate basis functions, as the appropriate library is not trivial for many dynamical systems. To overcome this difficulty, this study proposes SINDy with library optimization mechanism (SINDy-LOM), which is a combination of the sparse regression technique and the novel learning strategy of the library. In the proposed approach, the basis functions are parametrized. The SINDy-LOM approach involves a two-layer optimization architecture: the inner-layer, in which the data-driven model is extracted as the sparse linear combination of the candidate basis functions, and the outer-layer, in which the basis functions are optimized from the viewpoint of the recursive long-term (RLT) prediction accuracy; thus, the library design is reformulated as the optimization of the parametrized basis functions. The resulting SINDy-LOM model has good interpretability and usability, as the proposed approach yields the parsimonious model. The library optimization mechanism significantly reduces user burden. The RLT perspective improves the reliability of the resulting model compared with the traditional SINDy approach that can only ensure the one-step-ahead prediction accuracy. The validity of the proposed approach is demonstrated by applying it to a diesel engine airpath system, which is a well-known complex industrial system.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation with the 2D Navier-Stokes equations: Optimal Gaussian asymptotics for the posterior measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A functional Bernstein - von Mises theorem is proved for posterior measures arising in a data assimilation problem with the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation where a Gaussian process prior is assigned to the initial condition of the system. The posterior measure, which provides the update in the space of all trajectories arising from a discrete sample of the (deterministic) dynamics, is shown to be approximated by a Gaussian random vector field arising from the solution to a linear parabolic PDE with Gaussian initial condition. The approximation holds in the strong sense of the supremum norm on the regression functions, showing that predicting future states of Navier-Stokes systems admits $1/\sqrt N$-consistent estimators even for commonly used nonparametric models. Consequences for coverage of credible bands and uncertainty quantification are discussed. A local asymptotic minimax theorem is derived that describes the lower bound for estimating the state of the nonlinear system, which is shown to be attained by the Bayesian data assimilation algorithm.</description>

      <title>The Alpha Group Dynamic Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical behavior of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) governed by a matrix that represents the division in the algebra of the Alpha group. As the system evolves, the matrix induces topological transitions in geometric spaces, controlled by a rotational parameter. Numerical simulations are performed using a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method implemented in Python. The results reveal the emergence of topological nodes, the existence of critical points at which the rotation between dividing planes transitions from 0 to $\pi/2$ radians. Near zero radians, the system exhibits a Euclidean geometric structure, while rotations close to $\pi/2$ define an Alpha Group space. At these nodes, the matrix-driven ODE system undergoes qualitative dynamic changes, reflecting distinct topological behaviors. The Alpha Group matrix is interpreted as a generator of symmetry transformations, potentially analogous to gauge fields under local or global symmetries. This work provides a computational framework for exploring dynamic topologies, attractors at infinity, and internal coherence in hyper-complex vector spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The robustness of properties of a statistical physics model to slight perturbations in the exact local interactions of the model is a very relevant philosophical question, considering real-life measurements on which we base some models can only ever reach a finite precision. In this article, we will discuss this topic in a formal mathematical setting, and notably exhibit a family of models for which the low-temperature behaviour is highly non-robust.</description>

      <title>Three characterizations of a self-similar aperiodic 2-dimensional subshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.03892v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this chapter is to illustrate a generalization of the Fibonacci word to the case of 2-dimensional configurations on $\mathbb{Z}^2$. More precisely, we consider a particular subshift of $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Z}^2}$ on the alphabet $\mathcal{A}=\{0,\dots,15\}$ for which we give three characterizations: as the subshift $\mathcal{X}_\Phi$ generated by a 2-dimensional morphism $\Phi$ defined on $\mathcal{A}$; as the Wang shift $\Omega_\mathcal{Z}$ defined by a set $\mathcal{Z}$ of 16 Wang tiles; as the symbolic dynamical system $\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{Z},R_\mathcal{Z}}$ representing the orbits under some $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action $R_\mathcal{Z}$ defined by rotations on $\mathbb{T}^2$ and coded by some topological partition $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{Z}$ of $\mathbb{T}^2$ into 16 polygonal atoms. We prove their equality $\Omega_\mathcal{Z} =\mathcal{X}_\Phi=\mathcal{X}_{\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{Z},R_\mathcal{Z}}$ by showing that they are self-similar with respect to the substitution $\Phi$.
  This chapter provides a transversal reading of results divided into four different articles obtained through the study of the Jeandel-Rao Wang shift. It gathers in one place the methods introduced to desubstitute Wang shifts and to desubstitute codings of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-actions by focussing on a simple 2-dimensional self-similar subshift. SageMath code to find marker tiles and compute the Rauzy induction of $\mathbb{Z}^2$-rotations is provided allowing to reproduce the computations. The chapter contains many exercises whose solutions are provided at the end.</description>

      <title>Sensitive actions in non-compact spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Devaney defines a function as chaotic if it satisfies the following three conditions: transitivity, having a dense set of periodic points, and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. In \cite{3}, it was demonstrated that the first two conditions imply the third. This result was generalized in \cite{aak} by replacing the density of periodic points with the density of minimal points. The result was further generalized in \cite{g} for group actions, in \cite{km} for $C$-semigroups actions, and in \cite{d} for a continuous semi-flow with $X$ being a Polish space. Subsequently, in \cite{ip1} and \cite{ip2}, it was generalized for compact spaces and for non-compact spaces in \cite{z}. The objective of this work is to generalize the result in \cite{z}, providing a simple proof.</description>

      <title>The Hopf-Rinow theorem and the Ma\~n\'e critical value for magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The subject of this article are magnetic geodesics on odd-dimensional spheres endowed with the round metric and with the magnetic potential given by the standard contact form. We compute the Ma\~n\'e's critical value of the system and show that a value of the energy is supercritical if and only if all pairs of points on the sphere can be connected by a magnetic geodesic with that value of the energy. Our methods are explicit and rely on the description of the submanifolds invariant by the flow and of the symmetries of the system, which we define for a general magnetic system and call totally magnetic submanifolds and magnetomorphisms, respectively. We recover hereby the known fact that the system is super-integrable: the three-spheres obtained intersecting the ambient space with a complex plane are totally magnetic and each magnetic geodesic is tangent to a two-dimensional Clifford torus. In our study the integral of motion given by the angle between magnetic geodesics and the Reeb vector field plays a special role, and can be used to realize the magnetic flow as an interpolation between the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow of the contact distribution and the Reeb flow of the contact form.</description>

      <title>Information Geometry on the $\ell^2$-Simplex via the $q$-Root Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce \emph{$\ell^p$-information geometry}, an infinite dimensional framework that shares key features with the geometry of the space of probability densities \( \mathrm{Dens}(M) \) on a closed manifold, while also incorporating aspects of measure-valued information geometry. We define the \emph{$\ell^2$-probability simplex} with a noncanonical differentiable structure induced via the \emph{$q$-root transform} from an open subset of the $\ell^p$-sphere. This structure renders the $q$-root map an \emph{isometry}, enabling the definition of \emph{Amari--\v{C}encov $\alpha$-connections} in this setting.
  We further construct \emph{gradient flows} with respect to the $\ell^2$ Fisher--Rao metric, which solve an infinite-dimensional linear optimization problem. These flows are intimately linked to an \emph{integrable Hamiltonian system} via a \emph{momentum map} arising from a Hamiltonian group action on the infinite-dimensional complex projective space.</description>
