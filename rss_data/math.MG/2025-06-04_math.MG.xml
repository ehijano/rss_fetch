      <title>A family of non Minkowski measurable fractals in $\mathbb{R}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A long-standing conjecture of Lapidus asserts that, under certain conditions, a self-similar fractal set is not Minkowski measurable if and only if it is of lattice-type. For self-similar sets in $\mathbb{R}$, the Lapidus conjecture has been confirmed. However, in higher dimensions, it remains unclear whether all lattice-type self-similar sets are not Minkowski measurable. This work presents a family of lattice-type subsets in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that are not Minkowski measurable, hence providing further support for the conjecture. Furthermore, an argument is presented to illustrate why these sets are not covered by previous results.</description>

      <title>Higher Order Rigidity and Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the notion of higher-order rigidity of a bar-and-joint framework. In particular, we provide a link between the rigidity properties of a framework, and the growth order of an energy function defined on that framework. Using our approach, we propose a general definition for the rigidity order of a framework, and we show that this definition does not depend on the details of the chosen energy function. Then we show how this order can be studied using higher order derivative tests. Doing so, we obtain a new proof that the lack of a second order flex implies rigidity. Our proof relies on our construction of a fourth derivative test, which may be applied to a critical point when the second derivative test fails. We also obtain a new proof that when the dimension of non-trivial first-order flexes equals $1$, then the lack of a $k$th order flex for some $k$ implies a framework is rigid. The higher order derivative tests that we study here may have applications beyond rigidity theory.</description>

      <title>Generalized cones admitting a curvature-dimension condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study (generalized) cones over metric spaces, both in Riemannian and Lorentzian signature. In particular, we establish synthetic lower Ricci curvature bounds \`a la Lott-Villani-Sturm and Ohta in the metric measure case, and \`a la Cavalletti-Mondino in Lorentzian signature. Here, a generalized cone is a warped product of a one-dimensional base space, which will be positive or negative definite, over a fiber that is a metric space. We prove that Riemannian or Lorentzian generalized cones over $\mathsf{CD}$-spaces satisfy the (timelike) measure contraction property $\mathsf{(T)MCP}$ - a weaker version of a (timelike) curvature-dimension condition $\mathsf{(T)CD}$. Conversely, if the generalized cone is a $\mathsf{(T)CD}$-space, then the fiber is a $\mathsf{CD}$-space with the appropriate bounds on Ricci curvature and dimension. In proving these results we develop a novel and powerful two-dimensional localization technique, which we expect to be interesting in its own right and useful in other circumstances. We conclude by giving several applications including synthetic singularity and splitting theorems for generalized cones. The final application is that we propose a new definition for lower curvature bounds for metric and metric measure spaces via lower curvature bounds for generalized cones over the given space.</description>

      <title>Euclidean nets under isometric embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that there exists a discrete subset $X$ of a complete, connected, $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$ such that the Riemannian distances between points of $X$ correspond to the Euclidean distances of a net in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. What can then be derived about the geometry of $M$? In arXiv:2004.08621 it was shown that if $n=2$ then $M$ is isometric to $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. In this paper we show two consequential geometric properties that the manifold $M$ shares with the Euclidean space in any dimension. The first property is that $X$ is a net with respect to the Riemannian distance in $M$. The second property is that all geodesics in $M$ are distance minimizing, and there are no conjugate points in $M$. This demonstrates the possibility of inferring infinitesimal qualities from discrete data, even in higher dimensions. As a corollary we obtain that the large-scale geometry of $M$ is asymptotically Euclidean.</description>

      <title>On lattice coverings by locally anti-blocking bodies and polytopes with few vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, Ordentlich, Regev and Weiss made a breakthrough that the lattice covering density of any $n$-dimensional convex body is upper bounded by $cn^{2}$, improving on the best previous bound established by Rogers in 1959. However, for the Euclidean ball, Rogers obtained the better upper bound $n(\log_{e}n)^{c}$, and this result was extended to certain symmetric convex bodies by Gritzmann. The constant $c$ above is independent on $n$. In this paper, we show that such a bound can be achieved for more general classes of convex bodies without symmetry, including anti-blocking bodies, locally anti-blocking bodies and $n$-dimensional polytopes with $n+2$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Affine Isoperimetric Inequalities for Higher-Order Projection and Centroid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07859v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th order difference body of a convex body, and also established the $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. In this paper, we extend this idea to the projection body, centroid body, and radial mean bodies, as well as prove the associated inequalities (analogues of Zhang's projection inequality, Petty's projection inequality, the Busemann-Petty centroid inequality and Busemann's random simplex inequality). We also establish a new proof of Schneider's $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. As an application, a $m$th-order affine Sobolev inequality for functions of bounded variation is provided.</description>

      <title>Maximal Non-Kochen-Specker Sets and a Lower Bound on the Size of Kochen-Specker Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The challenge of determining bounds for the minimal number of vectors in a three-dimensional Kochen-Specker (KS) set has captivated the quantum foundations community for decades. This paper establishes a weak lower bound of 10 vectors, which does not surpass the current best-known bound of 24 vectors. By exploring the complementary concept of large non-KS sets and employing a probability argument independent of the graph structure of KS sets, we introduce a novel technique that could be applied in the future to derive tighter bounds. Additionally, we highlight an intriguing connection to a generalisation of the moving sofa problem in navigating a right-angled hallway on the surface of a two-dimensional sphere.</description>

      <title>Topological rigidity of small RCD(K,N) spaces with maximal rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a polycyclic group $\Lambda$, $\text{rank} ( \Lambda )$ is defined as the number of $\mathbb{Z}$ factors in a polycyclic decomposition of $\Lambda$. For a finitely generated group $G$, $\text{rank} (G)$ is defined as the infimum of $ \text{rank} (\Lambda )$ among finite index polycyclic subgroups $\Lambda \leq G$. For a compact $\text{RCD} (K,N)$ space $(X,\mathsf{d}, \mathfrak{m})$ with $\text{diam} (X) \leq \varepsilon (K,N)$, the rank of $\pi_1(X)$ is at most $N$. We show that in case of equality, $X$ is homeomorphic to an infranilmanifold, generalizing a result by Kapovitch--Wilking to the non-smooth setting. We also fill a gap in the proof by Mondello--Mondino--Perales that if $\pi_1(X) = \mathbb{Z}^N$, then $X$ is bi-H\"older homeomorphic to a flat torus (diffeomorphic in the smooth case).</description>

      <title>Geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces via Banach representations of Roe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces, which jointly generalizes Banach property (T) for groups and geometric property (T) for metric spaces. Our framework is achieved by Banach representations of Roe algebras of metric spaces. We show that geometric Banach property (T) is a coarse geometric invariant, and it is equivalent to the existence of the Kazhdan projections in the Banach-Roe algebras. Further, we study the implications of this property for sequences of finite Cayley graphs, establishing two key results: 1. geometric Banach property (T) of such sequences implies Banach property (T) for their limit groups; 2. while the Banach coarse fixed point property implies geometric Banach property (T), the converse fails. Additionally, we provide a geometric characterization of V. Lafforgue's strong Banach property (T) for a residually finite group in terms of geometric Banach property (T) of its box spaces.</description>
