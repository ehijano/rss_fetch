      <title>Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution of walkers in AFQMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is typically formulated as an open-ended random walk in an overcomplete space of Slater determinants, implemented through a Langevin equation. However, the explicit form of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation governing the walker population distribution has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its accuracy, which we outline in this paper.</description>

      <title>Applying R-Matrix Theory to Atom-Molecule Inelastic Collisions: the case study of H$_2$O + H</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study presents a comprehensive theoretical investigation of atom and asymmetric top molecule inelastic scattering based on the R-matrix formalism. The proposed methodology establishes a rigorous framework for treating inelastic collisions in the space-fixed coordinate system. The excellent numerical performance of the method is demonstrated through the comparison of state-to-state rotationally inelastic R-matrix cross sections for the H + H$_2$O system with those obtained using conventional close-coupling (CC) theory. The R-matrix approach is shown to deliver results of comparable accuracy while achieving substantially reduced computation times. The method is furthermore shown to achieve more than one order-of-magnitude speedup by exploiting GPU-accelerated diagonalisation through the MAGMA library. This combination of accuracy and computational efficiency positions the R--matrix approach as a powerful and scalable tool for investigating inelastic scattering involving complex polyatomic systems, thereby paving the way for systematic studies of molecule-molecule interactions in astrophysical, atmospheric, and cold-matter environments.</description>

      <title>Extending machine learning model for implicit solvation to free energy calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implicit solvent approach offers a computationally efficient framework to model solvation effects in molecular simulations. However, its accuracy often falls short compared to explicit solvent models, limiting its use in precise thermodynamic calculations. Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) present an opportunity to overcome these limitations by leveraging neural networks to develop more precise implicit solvent potentials for diverse applications. A major drawback of current ML-based methods is their reliance on force-matching alone, which can lead to energy predictions that differ by an arbitrary constant and are therefore unsuitable for absolute free energy comparisons. Here, we introduce a novel methodology with a graph neural network (GNN)-based implicit solvent model, dubbed Lambda Solvation Neural Network (LSNN). In addition to force-matching, this network was trained to match the derivatives of alchemical variables, ensuring that solvation free energies can be meaningfully compared across chemical species.. Trained on a dataset of approximately 300,000 small molecules, LSNN achieves free energy predictions with accuracy comparable to explicit-solvent alchemical simulations, while offering a computational speedup and establishing a foundational framework for future applications in drug discovery.</description>

      <title>An interpretable molecular descriptor for machine learning predictions in atmospheric science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of aerosol formation and chemistry using machine learning is limited by the lack of molecular descriptors suited to atmospheric compounds. Interpretable models are particularly affected because they often rely on dictionary-based descriptors tied to specific molecular substructures, which currently fail to capture the full range of organic atmospheric compounds, including large, highly oxidized molecules common in the atmosphere. We introduce ATMOMACCS, an interpretable descriptor combining the 166 binary keys of the MACCS fingerprint with motifs inspired by the SIMPOL method for estimating saturation vapor pressures. We show that ATMOMACCS based models improve predictions of saturation vapor pressures (7-8 % error reduction), equilibrium partition coefficients (5 % and 9 % error reduction), glass transition temperatures (22 % error reduction), and enthalpy of vaporization (61 % error reduction) on four datasets with atmospheric compounds. Feature analysis shows that saturation vapor pressure and partition coefficients are governed by carbon number and oxygen-related features, whereas other phase-transition properties (e.g., enthalpy of vaporization, glass transition temperature) depend on carbon-hydrogen bond types and the presence of heteroatoms other than oxygen. This highlights the generalizability of ATMOMACCS across different datasets and properties as an interpretable molecular descriptor.</description>

      <title>Stoichiometrically-informed symbolic regression for extracting chemical reaction mechanisms from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-driven computational method is introduced to extract chemical reaction mechanisms from time series chemical concentration data. It is realized through the use of dynamic symbolic regression in which a sparse analytical form for a dynamical system is discoverable from the underlying data. We specifically develop the stoichiometrically-informed symbolic regression (SISR) method to address a standing challenge in complex chemical reaction networks: Given a time-series dataset of concentrations of several components, what is the mechanism and the associated rate constants? SISR finds the optimal mechanism, kinetic equations and rate constants by combining differential optimization with a genetic optimization approach that searches a symbolic space of possible reaction mechanisms. Use of SISR in several paradigmatic examples spanning linear and nonlinear reaction schemes results in excellent agreement between true and predicted mechanisms, including when the method is applied to noisy data. The advantages of a stoichiometrically-informed approach such as SISR to address reaction discovery is illustrated through comparison with the use of generic state-of-the-art data-driven approaches.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Peierls dimerization transition: Machine learning force-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) force-field framework for simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order driven by the Peierls instability. Since the Peierls distortion arises from the coupling between lattice displacements and itinerant electrons, evaluating the adiabatic forces during time evolution is computationally intensive, particularly for large systems. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop a generalized Behler-Parrinello neural-network architecture -- originally formulated for ab initio molecular dynamics -- to accurately and efficiently predict forces from local structural environments. Using the locality of electronic responses, the resulting ML force field achieves linear scaling efficiency while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Large-scale dynamical simulations using this framework uncover a two-stage coarsening behavior of CDW domains: an early-time regime characterized by a power-law growth $L \sim t^{\alpha}$ with an effective exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, followed by a crossover to the Allen-Cahn scaling $L \sim \sqrt{t}$ at late times. The enhanced early-time coarsening is attributed to anisotropic domain-wall motion arising from electron-mediated directional interactions. This work demonstrates the promise of ML-based force fields for multiscale dynamical modeling of condensed-matter lattice models.</description>

      <title>Mixed Quantum-Classical Methods for Polaron Spectral Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, using two distinct semiclassical approaches, namely the mean-field Ehrenfest (MFE) method and the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), we investigate the spectral function of a single charge interacting with phonons on a lattice. This quantity is relevant for the description of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Focusing on the one-dimensional Holstein model, we compare the performance of these approaches across a range of coupling strengths and lattice sizes, exposing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. We demonstrate that these approaches can be efficiently applied with reasonable accuracy to ab initio polaron models. Our work provides a route to the calculation of spectral properties in realistic electron-phonon-coupled systems in a computationally inexpensive manner with encouraging accuracy.</description>

      <title>Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22574v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>aims-PAX: Parallel Active eXploration for the automated construction of Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning force fields (MLFF) have significantly extended the reach of atomistic simulations. Continuous progress in this field requires reliable reference datasets, accurate MLFF architectures, and efficient active learning strategies to enable robust modeling of complex molecular and material systems. Here we introduce aims-PAX, an expedited, multi-trajectory active learning framework that streamlines the development of stable and accurate MLFFs. Designed for a wide range of researchers, aims-PAX offers a modular, high-performance workflow that couples diversified sampling with scalable training across CPU and GPU architectures. Integrated with the widely used ab initio code FHI-aims, the framework supports state-of-the-art ML models and dataset generation using general-purpose (or "foundational") force-fields for rapid deployment in diverse systems. We demonstrate the capabilities of aims-PAX in various challenging tasks: creating datasets and models for highly flexible peptides, multiple organic molecules at once, explicitly solvated molecules, and for efficiently handling computationally demanding systems such as the CsPbI$_3$ perovskite. We show that aims-PAX achieves a reduction of up to three orders of magnitude in the number of required reference calculations, automatically selects challenging systems within a given chemical space, facilitates simulation of solvated molecules with more than thousand atoms, while enabling a ten-fold speedup in active-learning time through optimized resource utilization. This positions aims-PAX as a powerful and versatile platform for next-generation atomistic simulations in both academic and industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of the electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene induces a robust and reversible conductor-insulator transition, of strong interest in logic-and-memory applications. However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control these materials' electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Aligning Transformers with Continuous Feedback via Energy Rank Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12961v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Searching through chemical space is an exceptionally challenging problem because the number of possible molecules grows combinatorially with the number of atoms. Large, autoregressive models trained on databases of chemical compounds have yielded powerful generators, but we still lack robust strategies for generating molecules with desired properties. This molecular search problem closely resembles the "alignment" problem for large language models, though for many chemical tasks we have a specific and easily evaluable reward function. Here, we introduce an algorithm called energy rank alignment (ERA) that leverages an explicit reward function to produce a gradient-based objective that we use to optimize autoregressive policies. We show theoretically that this algorithm is closely related to proximal policy optimization (PPO) and direct preference optimization (DPO), but has a minimizer that converges to an ideal Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution with the reward playing the role of an energy function. Furthermore, this algorithm is highly scalable, does not require reinforcement learning, and performs well relative to DPO when the number of preference observations per pairing is small. We deploy this approach to align molecular transformers and protein language models to generate molecules and protein sequences, respectively, with externally specified properties and find that it does so robustly, searching through diverse parts of chemical space.</description>
