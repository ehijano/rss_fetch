      <title>Mirror Symmetry Breaking Disclosed in the Decay of Three-Proton Emitter 20Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The previously-unknown nucleus 20Al has been observed for the first time by detecting its in-flight decays. Tracking trajectories of all decay products with silicon micro-strip detectors allowed for a conclusion that 20Al is unbound with respect to three-proton (3p) emission. The 3p-decay energy of 20Al ground state has been determined to be 1.93(+0.11,-0.09) MeV through a detailed study of angular correlations of its decay products, 17Ne+p+p+p. This value is much smaller in comparison with the predictions inferred from the isospin symmetry by using the known energy of its mirror nucleus 20N, which indicates a possible mirror symmetry violation in the structure of 3p emitters. Such an isospin symmetry breaking is supported by the calculations of the continuum embedded theoretical frameworks, describing the observed 20Al ground state as an 1p s-wave state with a spin-parity of 1-, which contradicts to the spin-parity (2-) of the 20N ground state. The 20Al ground state decays by sequential 1p-2p emission via intermediate ground state of 19Mg, which is the first observed case of daughter two-proton radioactivity following 1p decay of the parent state.</description>

      <title>Analysis Note: Directed flow $v_1$ of protons in the Xe+Cs(I) collisions at 3.8 AGeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08570v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we present the directed flow $v_1$ measurements of protons from Xe+Cs(I) collisions at 3.8 AGeV (BM@N run8). We show the datasets, event and track selection cuts, centrality definition, event plane reconstruction and resolution. The $v_1$ results are presented as function of transverse momentum ($p_T$) and rapidity ($y_{cm}$) for 10-30\% central Xe+Cs(I) collisions. The systematic uncertainty study will also be presented and discussed. The $v_1$ measurements are compared with results of JAM transport model calculations and published data from other experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin thickness for $^{208}$Pb from total cross sections of neutron scattering at 14.137 MeV and neutron skin thickness for $^{48}$Ca, O, N, C isotopes from reaction and interaction cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10690v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foster {\it et al.} measured total neutron cross sections $\sigma_{\rm T}$ of n+$^{208}$Pb scattering at $14.137$MeV. Carlson {\it et al.} measured $\sigma_{\rm R}$ for $p$+$^{48}$Ca scattering in $23 \text{--} 48$MeV. Tanaka {\it et al.} measured $\sigma_{\rm I}$ for $^{42\text{--}51}$Ca + $^{12}$C scattering at 280MeV/u. Bagchi {\it et al.} measured the charge-changing (CC) cross sections and determined proton radii $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{14,15,17 \text{--} 22}$N from the CC cross sections. Kanungo {\it et al.} measured the CC cross sections and extracted $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{12\text{--} 19}$C. Kaur {\it et al.} measured the CC cross sections and determined $r_{\rm p}({\rm CC})$ for $^{16,18 \text{--} 24}$O. Our 1st aim is to extract $r_{\rm skin}^{208}$ from the the $\sigma_{\rm T}$ of n+$^{208}$Pb scattering at $14.137$MeV. Our 2nd aim is to determine $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm skin})$ from $\sigma_{\rm R}$ on p+$^{48}$Ca scattering in $E_{\rm lab}=23 \text{--} 48$MeV. Our 3rd aim is to find light stable nuclei having nuclei having large $r_{\rm skin}$. We use the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model for lower $E_{\rm lab}$ and the folding model based on the Love-Franey $t$-matrix for higher $E_{\rm lab}$. We determine $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm skin})=0.163 \pm 0.037{\rm fm}$ from the $\sigma_{\rm R}$ on p+$^{48}$Ca scattering, using the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model with the D1M-GHFB+AMP proton and neutron densities. We show that D1M-GHFB+AMP is better than D1S-GHFB+AMP for the matter radius and the binding energy. Our skin value is consistent with $r_{\rm skin}^{48}({\rm CREX})$. For C, N, O isotopes, we find that $r_{\rm skin}= 0.267 \pm 0.056$~fm for $^{14}$N and $r_{\rm skin}= 0.197 \pm 0.067$~fm for $^{17}$O. Our value $r_{\rm skin}^{208}=0.309 \pm 0.057$fm agrees with $r_{\rm skin}^{208}({\rm PREX2})$.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the influence of excitation energy and compound nucleus angular momentum on fission fragment angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of the large angular momenta observed for fission fragments is still a question under discussion. To address this, we study isomeric yield ratios (IYR), i.e. the relative population of two or more long-lived metastable states with different spins, of fission products.
  We report on IYR of 17 isotopes produced in the 28 MeV $\alpha$-induced fission of $^{232}$Th at the IGISOL facility of the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a. The fissioning nuclei in this reaction are $^{233,234,235}$U*. We compare our data to IYR from thermal neutron-induced fission of $^{233}$U and $^{235}$U, and we observe statistically significant larger IYR in the $^{232}$Th($\alpha$,f) reaction, where the average compound nucleus (CN) spin is 7.5 $\hbar$, than in $^{233,235}$U(n$_{th}$,f), with average spins 2.5 and 3.5 $\hbar$, respectively.
  To assess the influence of the excitation energy, we study literature data of IYR from photon-induced fission reactions, and find that the IYR are independent of the CN excitation energy. We conclude that the different IYR must be explained by the different CN spin alone. This implies that the FF angular momentum only partly comes from the fission process itself, and is in addition influenced by the angular momentum present in the CN.</description>

      <title>Angular anisotropy in prefission neutron spectra and PFNS of $^{240}$Pu$(n,F)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Angular anisotropy of secondary neutrons was evidenced in neutron emission spectra (NES) of $^{239}$Pu+n in 1972, and prompt fission neutron spectra (PFNS) of $^{239}$Pu$(n,F)$ in 2019, it might be predicted for $^{240}$Pu(n,F) PFNS now. In case of NES angular anisotropy is due to direct excitation of collective levels and pre-equilibrium/semi-direct (states in the continuum are excited) mechanism of neutron emission of first neutron in (n,nX) reaction, while in case of PFNS it is due to exclusive spectra of pre-fission neutrons of (n, xnf) reactions. In $^{239}$Pu$(n,xnf)$ and $^{240}$Pu(n,xnf) reactions observed PFNS envision different response to the emission of first pre-fission neutron in forward or backward semi-spheres with respect to the momentum of incident neutrons. Since energies of (n,nf) neutrons and their average values depend on angle of emission theta with respect to the incident neutron momentum, the observed PFNS, average prompt fission neutron multiplicity, fission cross section, average total kinetic energy TKE, etc. also would be quite dependent on angle theta. Exclusive spectra of (n, xnf) neutrons at theta of 90 degrees are consistent with $^{240}$Pu(n, F)($^{239}$Pu$(n,F)$, $^{239}$Pu$(n,2n)$) observed cross sections and neutron emission spectra of $^{239}$Pu+n interaction at En up to 20 MeV. The correlations of the angular anisotropy of PFNS with the relative contribution of the $(n,nf)$ fission chance to the observed fission cross section and angular anisotropy of pre-fission neutron emission are ascertained.</description>

      <title>Pion-nucleon scattering with decuplet contribution in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the complete $T$ matrices with decuplet contributions for pion-nucleon scattering to order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^3)$ in heavy baryon SU(3) chiral perturbation theory. The baryon mass in the chiral limit $M_0$ and the low-energy constants are determined by fitting to phase shifts of $\pi N$, the experimental octet-baryon masses, and the value of $\sigma_{\pi N}$ simultaneously. By using these constants, we obtain the $KN$ $\sigma$ terms, $\sigma_{KN}^{(1)}=(375.07\pm33.02)$ MeV and $\sigma_{KN}^{(2)}=(275.32\pm32.24)$ MeV, with the errors being only statistical. An excellent description of the phase shifts is obtained for all partial waves. We also present results for scattering lengths and scattering volumes. In addition, the convergence of the approach is also discussed.</description>

      <title>New Insights into Supradense Matter from Dissecting Scaled Stellar Structure Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong-field gravity in General Relativity (GR) realized in neutron stars (NSs) renders the Equation of State (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of supradense neutron star (NS) matter to be essentially nonlinear and refines the upper bound for $\phi\equiv P/\varepsilon$ to be much smaller than the Special Relativity (SR) requirement with linear EOSs, where $P$ and $\varepsilon$ are respectively the pressure and energy density of the system considered. Specifically, a tight bound $\phi\lesssim0.374$ is obtained by anatomizing perturbatively the intrinsic structures of the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations without using any input nuclear EOS. New insights gained from this novel analysis provide EOS-model independent constraints on properties (e.g., density profiles of the sound speed squared $s^2=\d P/\d\varepsilon$ and trace anomaly $\Delta=1/3-\phi$) of cold supradense matter in NS cores. Using the gravity-matter duality in theories describing NSs, we investigate the impact of gravity on supradense matter EOS in NSs. In particular, we show that the NS mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$, radius $R$ and its compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ scale with certain combinations of its central pressure and energy density (encapsulating its central EOS). Thus, observational data on these properties of NSs can straightforwardly constrain NS central EOSs without relying on any specific nuclear EOS-model.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Spin Dressing Sensitivity for the nEDMSF Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: nEDMSF aims to measure the neutron electric dipole moment ($d_n$) with unprecedented precision. In this paper we explore the experiment's sensitivity when operating with an implementation of the critical dressing method in which the angle between the neutron and Helium-3 spins ($\phi_{3n}$) is subjected to a square modulation by an amount $\phi_d$ (the "dressing angle"). Several parameters can be tuned to optimize sensitivity. We find roughly 10% improvement over a previous estimate, resulting primarily from the addition of a waiting period between the $\pi/2$ pulse that initiates $d_n$-driven $\phi_{3n}$ growth and the start of $\phi_{3n}$ modulation. We find negligible further improvement by allowing $\phi_d$ to vary continuously over the course of a run, and no degradation resulting from the addition of an in situ background measurement into each $\phi_{3n}$ modulation sequence. A complete simulation confirms a 300 live-day sensitivity of $\sigma = 1.45\times10^{-28}\,e \cdot \rm{cm}$. At this level of sensitivity, $\sigma_{\phi_{3n0}} = 1\,{\rm mrad}$ precision on the initial $n/^3{\rm He}$ angle difference is not negligible.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Excited-State Nuclear Recoil Spectroscopy with Superconducting Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting sensors doped with rare isotopes have recently demonstrated powerful sensing performance for sub-keV radiation from nuclear decay. Here, we report the first high-resolution recoil spectroscopy of a single, selected nuclear state using superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensors. The STJ sensors were used to measure the eV-scale nuclear recoils produced in $^7$Be electron capture decay in coincidence with a 478 keV $\gamma$-ray emitted in decays to the lowest-lying excited nuclear state in $^7$Li. Details of the Doppler broadened recoil spectrum depend on the slow-down dynamics of the recoil ion. The measured spectral broadening is compared to empirical stopping power models as well as modern molecular dynamics simulations at low energy. The results have implications in several areas from nuclear structure and stopping powers at eV-scale energies to direct searches for dark matter, neutrino mass measurements, and other physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>New calculation of the geo-neutrino energy spectrum and its implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos plays a vital role in the experimental measurement of geo-neutrinos that have profound implications for both particle physics and earth sciences. In this letter, we present a state-of-the-art calculation of the energy spectrum of geo-neutrinos originating from the beta decay of Uranium-238 and Thorium-232. Our calculation is underpinned by the latest updates in the nuclear database, accounts for previously overlooked forbidden transitions, and incorporates advanced corrections for the beta decay. This brand new geo-neutrino flux model, compared to the widely-used estimates from Enomoto, reveals notable distinction in the energy spectrum shape because of our comprehensive approach. When considering the inverse beta decay (IBD) detection process, our findings show a significant deviation in the predicted IBD yield of around 4% for Uranium-238 and 9% for Thorium-232 decay chains. The implications of using the new geo-neutrino flux model for the experimental analysis are substantial, potentially affecting the analysis results of geo-neutrino measurements of KamLAND and Borexino by around 10% to 20%. Our study represents a significant advancement in geo-neutrino research, establishing a new benchmark for accuracy and reliability in the field.</description>
