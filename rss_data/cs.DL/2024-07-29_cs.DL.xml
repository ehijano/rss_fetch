      <title>Using Bibliometrics to Detect Unconventional Authorship Practices and Examine Their Impact on Global Research Metrics, 2019-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Between 2019 and 2023, sixteen universities increased their research output by over fifteen times the global average, alongside significant changes in authorship dynamics (e.g., decreased first authorship, rise in hyperprolific authors, increased multi-affiliations, and increased authors per publication rate). Using bibliometric methods, this study detected patterns suggesting a reliance on unconventional authorship practices, such as gift, honorary, and sold authorship, to inflate publication metrics. The study underscores the need for reforms by universities, policymakers, funding agencies, ranking agencies, accreditation bodies, scholarly publishers, and researchers to maintain academic integrity and ensure the reliability of global ranking systems.</description>

      <title>Decoding Knowledge Claims: The Evaluation of Scientific Publication Contributions through Semantic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in scientific publications challenges the use of publication counts as a measure of scientific progress, requiring alternative metrics that emphasize the quality and novelty of scientific contributions rather than sheer quantity. This paper proposes the use of Relaxed Word Mover's Distance (RWMD), a semantic text similarity measure, to evaluate the novelty of scientific papers. We hypothesize that RWMD can more effectively gauge the growth of scientific knowledge. To test such an assumption, we apply RWMD to evaluate seminal papers, with Hirsch's H-Index paper as a primary case study. We compare RWMD results across three groups: 1) H-Index-related papers, 2) scientometric studies, and 3) unrelated papers, aiming to discern redundant literature and hype from genuine innovations. Findings suggest that emphasizing knowledge claims offers a deeper insight into scientific contributions, marking RWMD as a promising alternative method to traditional citation metrics, thus better tracking significant scientific breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>SWARM-SLR -- Streamlined Workflow Automation for Machine-actionable Systematic Literature Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Authoring survey or review articles still requires significant tedious manual effort, despite many advancements in research knowledge management having the potential to improve efficiency, reproducibility, and reuse. However, these advancements bring forth an increasing number of approaches, tools, and systems, which often cover only specific stages and lack a comprehensive workflow utilizing their task-specific strengths. We propose the Streamlined Workflow Automation for Machine-actionable Systematic Literature Reviews (SWARM-SLR) to crowdsource the improvement of SLR efficiency while maintaining scientific integrity in a state-of-the-art knowledge discovery and distribution process. The workflow aims to domain-independently support researchers in collaboratively and sustainably managing the rising scholarly knowledge corpus. By synthesizing guidelines from the literature, we have composed a set of 65 requirements, spanning from planning to reporting a review. Existing tools were assessed against these requirements and synthesized into the SWARM-SLR workflow prototype, a ready-for-operation software support tool. The SWARM-SLR was evaluated via two online surveys, which largely confirmed the validity of the 65 requirements and situated 11 tools to the different life-cycle stages. The SWARM-SLR workflow was similarly evaluated and found to be supporting almost the entire span of an SLR, excelling specifically in search and retrieval, information extraction, knowledge synthesis, and distribution. Our SWARM-SLR requirements and workflow support tool streamlines the SLR support for researchers, allowing sustainable collaboration by linking individual efficiency improvements to crowdsourced knowledge management. If these efforts are continued, we expect the increasing number of tools to be manageable and usable inside fully structured, (semi-)automated literature review workflows.</description>

      <title>Science for whom? The influence of the regional academic circuit on gender inequalities in Latin America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Latin-American scientific community has achieved significant progress towards gender parity, with nearly equal representation of women and men scientists. Nevertheless, women continue to be underrepresented in scholarly communication. Throughout the 20th century, Latin America established its academic circuit, focusing on research topics of regional significance. However, the community has since reoriented its research towards the global academic circuit. Through an analysis of scientific publications, this article explores the relationship between gender inequalities in science and the integration of Latin-American researchers into the regional and global academic circuits between 1993 and 2022. We find that women are more likely to engage in the regional circuit, while men are more active within the global circuit. This trend is attributed to a thematic alignment between women's research interests and issues specific to Latin America. Furthermore, our results reveal that the mechanisms contributing to gender differences in symbolic capital accumulation vary between circuits. Women's work achieves equal or greater recognition compared to men's within the regional circuit, but generally garners less attention in the global circuit. Our findings suggest that policies aimed at strengthening the regional academic circuit would encourage scientists to address locally relevant topics while simultaneously fostering gender equality in science.</description>

      <title>Every Part Matters: Integrity Verification of Scientific Figures Based on Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles a key issue in the interpretation of scientific figures: the fine-grained alignment of text and figures. It advances beyond prior research that primarily dealt with straightforward, data-driven visualizations such as bar and pie charts and only offered a basic understanding of diagrams through captioning and classification. We introduce a novel task, Figure Integrity Verification, designed to evaluate the precision of technologies in aligning textual knowledge with visual elements in scientific figures. To support this, we develop a semi-automated method for constructing a large-scale dataset, Figure-seg, specifically designed for this task. Additionally, we propose an innovative framework, Every Part Matters (EPM), which leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to not only incrementally improve the alignment and verification of text-figure integrity but also enhance integrity through analogical reasoning. Our comprehensive experiments show that these innovations substantially improve upon existing methods, allowing for more precise and thorough analysis of complex scientific figures. This progress not only enhances our understanding of multimodal technologies but also stimulates further research and practical applications across fields requiring the accurate interpretation of complex visual data.</description>

      <title>Efficient OCR for Building a Diverse Digital History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of users consult digital archives daily, but the information they can access is unrepresentative of the diversity of documentary history. The sequence-to-sequence architecture typically used for optical character recognition (OCR) - which jointly learns a vision and language model - is poorly extensible to low-resource document collections, as learning a language-vision model requires extensive labeled sequences and compute. This study models OCR as a character level image retrieval problem, using a contrastively trained vision encoder. Because the model only learns characters' visual features, it is more sample efficient and extensible than existing architectures, enabling accurate OCR in settings where existing solutions fail. Crucially, the model opens new avenues for community engagement in making digital history more representative of documentary history.</description>
