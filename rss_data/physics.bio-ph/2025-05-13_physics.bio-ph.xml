      <title>Graphene-based magnetoelastic biosensor for COVID-19 serodiagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an innovative magnetoelastic (ME) biosensor using graphene functionalized with the SARS-CoV-2 N protein for antibody detection via magnetoelastic resonance. Graphene was chosen for its biocompatibility and high surface area, enabling efficient antigen adsorption, validated by techniques such as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and micro-Raman spectroscopy. Changes in Raman bands (a $\sim 10~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ shift in the 2D band and an increase in the $I_D/I_G$ ratio from 0.03 to 0.60) confirmed non-covalent interactions and enhanced surface coverage with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Tests using human plasma (10 RT-PCR-positive and 10 negative samples) demonstrated a clear distinction between groups using graphene sensors functionalized with ~100 $\mu$g of N protein. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) validation corroborated the results. Optimization of protein concentration and biofunctionalization time highlighted the importance of homogeneous surface coverage for reproducibility of the graphene-based ME biosensor. The platform combines graphene's advantages with the wireless, real-time detection capabilities of ME sensors, offering low cost, high sensitivity, and potential for automation, with applications in point-of-care diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of kinetic proofreading inherited in ligation-based information replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate that information replication by templated ligation of DNA strands inherits a kinetic proofreading mechanism and achieves significant error suppression through cascade replication. A simple simulation model derived from the experimental results shows that templated ligation has a significant advantage over replication by polymerization for error suppression of long strands. This mechanism provides a plausible route for high-fidelity replication in prebiotic chemistry and illustrates how physical principles such as nonequilibrium kinetics and network architecture can drive reliable molecular information replication. The approach also offers new strategies for error suppression in biotechnology.</description>

      <title>Measurements of molecular size and shape on a chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Size and shape are critical discriminators between molecular species and states. We describe a micro-chip based high-throughput imaging approach offering rapid and precise determination of molecular properties under native solution conditions. Our method detects differences in molecular weight across at least three orders of magnitude, and down to two carbon atoms in small molecules. We quantify the strength of molecular interactions over six orders of magnitude in affinity constant, and track reactions in real-time. Highly parallel measurements on individual molecules serve to characterize sample-state heterogeneity at the highest resolution, offering predictive input to model three-dimensional structure. We further leverage the method's structural sensitivity for diagnostics, exploiting ligand-induced conformational changes in the insulin receptor to sense insulin concentration in serum at the sub-nanoliter and sub-zeptomole scale.</description>

      <title>Micro-swimmer locomotion and hydrodynamics in Brinkman Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-swimmer locomotion in heterogeneous media is increasingly relevant in biological physics due to the prevalence of microorganisms in complex environments. A model for such porous media is the Brinkman fluid which accounts for a sparse matrix of stationary obstacles via a linear resistance term in the momentum equation. We investigate two models for the locomotion and the flow field generated by a swimmer in such a medium. First, we analyze a dumbbell swimmer composed of two spring-connected spheres and driven by a flagellar force and derive its exact swimming velocity as a function of the Brinkman medium resistance, showing that the swimmer monotonically slows down as the medium drag monotonically increases. In the limit of no resistance the model reduces to the classical Stokes dipole swimmer, while finite resistance introduces hydrodynamic screening that attenuates long-range interactions. Additionally, we derive an analytical expression for the far-field flow generated by a Brinkmanlet force-dipole, which can be used for propulsive point-dipole swimmer models. Remarkably, this approximation reproduces the dumbbell swimmer's flow field in the far-field regime with high accuracy. These results provide new analytical tools for understanding locomotion in complex fluids and offer foundational insights for future studies on collective behavior in active and passive suspensions within porous or structured environments.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian replica exchange augmented with diffusion-based generative models and importance sampling to assess biomolecular conformational basins and barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhanced sampling techniques are essential for exploring biomolecular conformational dynamics that occur on timescales inaccessible to conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study introduces a framework that combines Hamiltonian replica exchange (REST2) with denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) and importance sampling to enhance the mapping of conformational free-energy landscapes. Building on previous applications of DDPMs to temperature replica exchange (TREM), we propose two key improvements. First, we adapt the method to REST2 by treating potential energy as a fluctuating variable. This adaptation allows for more efficient sampling in large biomolecular systems. Second, to further improve resolution in high-barrier regions, we develop an iterative scheme combining replica exchange, DDPM, and importance sampling along known collective variables. Benchmarking on the mini-protein CLN025 demonstrates that DDPM-refined REST2 achieves comparable accuracy to TREM while requiring fewer replicas. Application to the enzyme PTP1B reveals a loop transition pathway consistent with prior complex biased simulations, showcasing the approach's ability to uncover high-barrier transitions with minimal computational overhead with respect to conventional replica exchange approaches. Overall, this hybrid strategy enables more efficient exploration of free-energy landscapes, expanding the utility of generative models in enhanced sampling simulations.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin cylindrical membranes arise in a wide variety of biological systems ranging from tubular structures on and within cell membranes to in-vitro experiments on artificial vesicles. Motor proteins embedded in such fluidic membranes often induce vortex-like flows. In this work, we construct a class of 2D vortex flow in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to 3D external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian, This Hamiltonian also incorporates the specific couplings of the 2D membrane flow with the 3D external fluids. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, such as orbit pinching, For a two-vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time, unlike flat and spherical fluid membranes, where the separation remains constant. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999), now extended to tubular geometries. We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>
