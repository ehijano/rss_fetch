      <title>The derived moduli of Stokes data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to show that Stokes data coming from flat bundles form a locally geometric derived stack locally of finite presentation. This generalizes existing geometricity results on Stokes data in four different directions: our result applies in any dimension, $\infty$-categorical coefficients are allowed, derived structures on moduli spaces are considered and more general spaces than those arising from flat bundles are permitted.</description>

      <title>Invariant vector bundles and Hitchin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X\rightarrow Y$ be a Galois cover with Galois group $\Gamma$, where $X$ and $Y$ are smooth complex projective curve of genus $\geqslant 2$. In this paper, we study the moduli spaces of semistable $\Gamma-$invariant vector bundles on $X$ and classify their connected components. We also study the Hitchin systems on these moduli spaces and determine their fibers in the smooth case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there are only finitely many combinatorial types of free real line arrangements with only double, triple and quadruple intersection points, and we enlist all admissible weak-combinatorics of them. Then we classify all real $M$-line arrangements. In particular, we show that real $M$-line arrangements are simplicial.</description>

      <title>A characterization of quasi-homogeneity in terms of liftable vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove under certain conditions that any stable unfolding of a quasi-homogeneous map-germ with finite singularity type is substantial. We then prove that if an equidimensional map-germ is finitely determined, of corank 1, and either it admits a minimal stable unfolding or it is of multipliticy 3, then it admits a substantial unfolding if and only if it is quasi-homogeneous. Based on this we pose the following conjecture: a finitely determined map-germ is quasi-homogeneous if and only if it admits a substantial unfolding.</description>

      <title>Classifying Isolated Symplectic Singularities via 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Coulomb Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Decay and Fission Conjecture, we provide a classification of unitary quivers whose 3d $\mathcal{N}=4$ Coulomb branches exhibit isolated singularities. This yields the complete list of isolated conical symplectic singularities that can arise in this way. In the process, we identify three new families of stable quivers: two giving rise to previously unknown isolated symplectic singularities, and one offering a novel realization of a known family.</description>

      <title>Closure operations induced via resolutions of singularities in characteristic zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the fact that the structure sheaf of a resolution of singularities, or regular alteration, pushes forward to a Cohen-Macaulay complex in characteristic zero with a differential graded algebra structure, we introduce a tight-closure-like operation on ideals in characteristic zero using the Koszul complex, which we call KH closure (Koszul-Hironaka). We prove it satisfies various strong colon capturing properties and a version of the Brian\c{c}on-Skoda theorem, and it behaves well under finite extensions. It detects rational singularities and is tighter than characteristic zero tight closure. Furthermore, its formation commutes with localization and it can be computed effectively. On the other hand, the product of the KH closures of ideals is not always contained in the KH closure of the product, as one might expect.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the higher Chow groups, specifically $SK_1(E)$ for elliptic curves $E$ over number fields $F$. Focusing on the kernel $V(E)$ of the norm map $SK_1(E)\to F^{\times}$, we analyze its mod $p$ structure. We provide conditions, based on the mod $p$ Galois representations associated to $E$, under which the torsion subgroup of $V(E)$ is infinite.</description>

      <title>In search of almost generic Calabi-Yau 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We call a projective Calabi-Yau (CY) 3-fold almost generic if it has only isolated nodes as singularities and the homology classes of all of the exceptional curves in an analytic small resolution are non-trivial but torsion. Such a Calabi-Yau supports a topologically non-trivial flat B-field and the corresponding A-model topological string partition function encodes a torsion refinement of the Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of the smooth deformation. Our goal in this paper is to find new examples of almost generic CY 3-folds, using both conifold transitions as well as the integral structure of the periods of the mirrors. In this way we explicitly construct two quintic CY 3-folds with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-torsion, two octics with $\mathbb{Z}_3$-torsion and deduce the existence of a complete intersection $X_{(6,6)}\subset\mathbb{P}^5_{1,1,2,2,3,3}$ with $\mathbb{Z}_5$-torsion. Via mirror symmetry, the examples give new geometric interpretations to several AESZ Calabi-Yau operators. The mirror periods of the almost generic $X_{(6,6)}$ with non-trivial B-field topology are annihilated by an irrational Picard-Fuchs operator. We describe how the usual integral structure of the periods has to be modified and in all of the cases we calculate the monodromies around the singular points to verify integrality. Additional points of maximally unipotent monodromy in the moduli spaces lead us to find several more examples of smooth or almost generic CY 3-folds and to conjecture new twisted derived equivalences. We integrate the holomorphic anomaly equations and extract the torsion refined Gopakumar-Vafa invariants up to varying genus. For our construction of the almost generic octic CY 3-folds, we also give a short introduction to the subject of hypermatrices and hyperdeterminants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study matrix transfers to achieve elementary models for bivariant $K$-theory. They share lots of common properties with Voevodsky's framed correspondences and lead to symmetric matrix motives of algebraic varieties introduced in this paper. Symmetric matrix motives recover $K$-motives and fit in a closed symmetric monoidal triangulated category of symmetric matrix motives constructed in this paper by using methods of enriched motivic homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>A virtual $\mathrm{PGL}_r$-$\mathrm{SL}_r$ correspondence for projective surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth projective surface $X$ satisfying $H_1(X,\mathbb{Z}) = 0$ and $w \in H^2(X,\mu_r)$, we study deformation invariants of the pair $(X,w)$. Choosing a Brauer-Severi variety $Y$ (or, equivalently, Azumaya algebra $\mathcal{A}$) over $X$ with Stiefel-Whitney class $w$, the invariants are defined as virtual intersection numbers on suitable moduli spaces of stable twisted sheaves on $Y$ constructed by Yoshioka (or, equivalently, moduli spaces of $\mathcal{A}$-modules of Hoffmann-Stuhler).
  We show that the invariants do not depend on the choice of $Y$. Using a result of de Jong, we observe that they are deformation invariants of the pair $(X,w)$. For surfaces with $h^{2,0}(X) &gt; 0$, we show that the invariants can often be expressed as virtual intersection numbers on Gieseker-Maruyama-Simpson moduli spaces of stable sheaves on $X$. This can be seen as a $\mathrm{PGL}_r$-$\mathrm{SL}_r$ correspondence.
  As an application, we express $\mathrm{SU}(r) / \mu_r$ Vafa-Witten invariants of $X$ in terms of $\mathrm{SU}(r)$ Vafa-Witten invariants of $X$. We also show how formulae from Donaldson theory can be used to obtain upper bounds for the minimal second Chern class of Azumaya algebras on $X$ with given division algebra at the generic point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an interpretation of the semi-infinite intersection cohomology sheaf associated to a semisimple simply-connected algebraic group in terms of finite-dimensional geometry. Specifically, we describe a procedure for building factorization spaces over moduli spaces of finite subsets of a curve from factorization spaces over moduli spaces of divisors, and show that under this procedure the compactified Zastava space is sent to the support of the semi-infinite IC sheaf in the factorizable Grassmannian. We define "semi-infinite t-structures" for a large class of schemes with an action of the multiplicative group, and show that, for the Zastava, the limit of these t-structure recovers the infinite-dimensional version. As an application, we also construct factorizable parabolic semi-infinite IC sheaves and a generalization (of the principal case) to Kac-Moody algebras.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic forms and non-tautological cycles on moduli spaces of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove, for infinitely many values of $g$ and $n$, the existence of non-tautological algebraic cohomology classes on the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ of smooth, genus-$g$, $n$-pointed curves. In particular, when $n=0$, our results show that there exist non-tautological algebraic cohomology classes on $\mathcal{M}_g$ for $g=12$ and all $g \geq 16$. These results generalize the work of Graber--Pandharipande and van Zelm, who proved that the classes of particular loci of bielliptic curves are non-tautological and thereby exhibited the only previously-known non-tautological class on any $\mathcal{M}_g$: the bielliptic cycle on $\mathcal{M}_{12}$. We extend their work by using the existence of holomorphic forms on certain moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ to produce non-tautological classes with nontrivial restriction to the interior, via which we conclude that the classes of many new double-cover loci are non-tautological.</description>

Abstract: We define arroids as an abstract axiom set encoding the intersection properties of arrangements of curves. The tropicalization of the complement of arrangement of curves meeting pairwise transversely is shown to be determined by the associated arroid. We give conditions for when the cohomology of the complement of an arrangement is computable using tropical cohomology, and we give criteria for when the complement is a maximal variety in terms of tropical geometry.</description>

      <title>On deformations of Azumaya algebras with quadratic pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a tangent-obstruction theory for Azumaya algebras equipped with a quadratic pair. Under the assumption that either 2 is a global unit or the algebra is of degree 2, we show how the deformation theory of these objects reduces to the deformation theory of the underlying Azumaya algebra. Namely, if the underlying Azumaya algebra has unobstructed deformations then so does the quadratic pair.
  On the other hand, in the purely characteristic 2 setting, we construct an Azumaya algebra with unobstructed deformations which can be equipped with a quadratic pair such that the associated triple has obstructed deformations. Our example is a biquaternion Azumaya algebra on an Igusa surface.
  Independently from the above results, we also introduce a new obstruction for quadratic pairs, existing only in characteristic 2, which is intermediate to both the strong and weak obstructions that were recently introduced by Gille, Neher, and the second named author. This intermediate obstruction characterizes when a canonical extension of the Lie algebra sheaf of the automorphism group scheme of some quadratic triple is split.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We relate full exceptional sequences in Fukaya categories of surfaces or equivalently in derived categories of graded gentle algebras to branched coverings over the disk, building on a previous classification result of the first and third author. This allows us to apply tools from the theory of branched coverings such as Birman--Hilden theory and Hurwitz systems to study the natural braid group action on exceptional sequences. As an application, counterexamples are given to a conjecture of Bondal--Polishchuk on the transitivity of the braid group action on full exceptional sequences in a triangulated category.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2306.07329 we established a connection between symplectic cuts of Calabi-Yau threefolds and open topological strings, and used this to introduce an equivariant deformation of the disk potential of toric branes. In this paper we establish a connection to higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries by showing that the equivariant disk potential arises as an equivariant period of certain Calabi-Yau fourfolds and fivefolds, which encode moduli spaces of one and two symplectic cuts (the maximal case) by a construction of Braverman arXiv:alg-geom/9712024. Extended Picard-Fuchs equations for toric branes, capturing dependence on both open and closed string moduli, are derived from a suitable limit of the equivariant quantum cohomology rings of the higher Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>
