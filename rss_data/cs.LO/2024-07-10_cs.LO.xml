      <title>Guarded Successor: A Novel Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GS (Guarded Successor), a novel decidable temporal logic with several unique distinctive features. Among those, it allows infinitely many data values that come not only with equality but with a somehow rich theory too: the first-order theory of atomless Boolean algebras. The language also distinguishes between inputs and outputs, and has a decision procedure for determining whether for all inputs exist outputs, at each point of time. Moreover, and maybe most surprisingly, the data values can be nothing but sentences in GS itself. We also present a non-temporal fragment called NSO (Nullary Second Order) that enjoys merely this last property. These results are crucial necessary ingredients in any meaningful design of safe AI. Finally, all those results are obtained from a novel treatment of the first-order theory of atomless Boolean algebras.</description>

      <title>Around Classical and Intuitionistic Linear Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curry-Howard correspondences between Linear Logic (LL) and session types provide a firm foundation for concurrent processes. As the correspondences hold for intuitionistic and classic versions of LL (ILL and CLL), we obtain two different families of type systems for concurrency. An open question remains: how do these two families exactly relate to each other? Based upon a translation from CLL to ILL due to Laurent (2018), we provide two complementary answers, in the form of full abstraction results based on a typed observational equivalence due to Atkey (2017). Our results elucidate hitherto missing formal links between seemingly related yet different type systems for concurrency.</description>

      <title>Geospatial Trajectory Generation via Efficient Abduction: Deployment for Independent Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to generate artificial human movement patterns while meeting location and time constraints is an important problem in the security community, particularly as it enables the study of the analog problem of detecting such patterns while maintaining privacy. We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</description>

      <title>A Beluga Formalization of the Harmony Lemma in the $\pi$-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Harmony Lemma", as formulated by Sangiorgi &amp; Walker, establishes the equivalence between the labelled transition semantics and the reduction semantics in the $\pi$-calculus. Despite being a widely known and accepted result for the standard $\pi$-calculus, this assertion has never been rigorously proven, formally or informally. Hence, its validity may not be immediately apparent when considering extensions of the $\pi$-calculus. Contributing to the second challenge of the Concurrent Calculi Formalization Benchmark -- a set of challenges tackling the main issues related to the mechanization of concurrent systems -- we present a formalization of this result for the fragment of the $\pi$-calculus examined in the Benchmark. Our formalization is implemented in Beluga and draws inspiration from the HOAS formalization of the LTS semantics popularized by Honsell et al. In passing, we introduce a couple of useful encoding techniques for handling telescopes and lexicographic induction.</description>

      <title>Binding Contexts as Partitionable Multisets in Abella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When reasoning about formal objects whose structures involve binding, it is often necessary to analyze expressions relative to a context that associates types, values, and other related attributes with variables that appear free in the expressions. We refer to such associations as binding contexts. Reasoning tasks also require properties such as the shape and uniqueness of associations concerning binding contexts to be made explicit. The Abella proof assistant, which supports a higher-order treatment of syntactic constructs, provides a simple and elegant way to describe such contexts from which their properties can be extracted. This mechanism is based at the outset on viewing binding contexts as ordered sequences of associations. However, when dealing with object systems that embody notions of linearity, it becomes necessary to treat binding contexts more generally as partitionable multisets. We show how to adapt the original Abella encoding to encompass such a generalization. The key idea in this adaptation is to base the definition of a binding context on a mapping to an underlying ordered sequence of associations. We further show that properties that hold with the ordered sequence view can be lifted to the generalized definition of binding contexts and that this lifting can, in fact, be automated. These ideas find use in the extension currently under development of the two-level logic approach of Abella to a setting where linear logic is used as the specification logic. </description>

      <title>Kuroda's Translation for the $\lambda\Pi$-Calculus Modulo Theory and Dedukti</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kuroda's translation embeds classical first-order logic into intuitionistic logic, through the insertion of double negations. Recently, Brown and Rizkallah extended this translation to higher-order logic. In this paper, we adapt it for theories encoded in higher-order logic in the lambdaPi-calculus modulo theory, a logical framework that extends lambda-calculus with dependent types and user-defined rewrite rules. We develop a tool that implements Kuroda's translation for proofs written in Dedukti, a proof language based on the lambdaPi-calculus modulo theory.</description>

      <title>Proofs for Free in the $\lambda\Pi$-Calculus Modulo Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametricity allows the transfer of proofs between different implementations of the same data structure. The lambdaPi-calculus modulo theory is an extension of the lambda-calculus with dependent types and user-defined rewrite rules. It is a logical framework, used to exchange proofs between different proof systems. We define an interpretation of theories of the lambdaPi-calculus modulo theory, inspired by parametricity. Such an interpretation allows to transfer proofs for free between theories that feature the notions of proposition and proof, when the source theory can be embedded into the target theory.</description>

      <title>Formal Modelling and Analysis of Slot Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slot machines can have fairly complex behaviour. Determining the RTP (return to player) can be involved, especially when a player has an influence on the course of the game. In this paper we model the behaviour of slot machines using probabilistic process specifications where the intervention of players is modelled using non-determinism. The RTP is formulated as a quantitative modal formula which can be evaluated fully automatically on the behavioural specifications of these slot machines. We apply the method on an actual slot machine provided by the company Err\`el Industries B.V. The most useful contribution of this paper is that we show how to describe the behaviour of slot machines both concisely and unequivocally. Using quantitative modal logics there is an extra bonus, as we can quite easily provide valuable insights by a.o. computing the exact RTP and obtaining the optimal player strategies.</description>

      <title>Coinductive Techniques for Checking Satisfiability of Generalized Nested Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nested conditions, a generalization of first-order logic to a categorical setting, and provide a tableau-based (semi-decision) procedure for checking (un)satisfiability and finite model generation. This generalizes earlier results on graph conditions. Furthermore we introduce a notion of witnesses, allowing the detection of infinite models in some cases. To ensure completeness, paths in a tableau must be fair, where fairness requires that all parts of a condition are processed eventually. Since the correctness arguments are non-trivial, we rely on coinductive proof methods and up-to techniques that structure the arguments. We distinguish between two types of categories: categories where all sections are isomorphisms, allowing for a simpler tableau calculus that includes finite model generation; in categories where this requirement does not hold, model generation does not work, but we still obtain a sound and complete calculus.</description>

      <title>Risk-averse optimization of total rewards in Markovian models using deviation measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses objectives tailored to the risk-averse optimization of accumulated rewards in Markov decision processes (MDPs). The studied objectives require maximizing the expected value of the accumulated rewards minus a penalty factor times a deviation measure of the resulting distribution of rewards. Using the variance in this penalty mechanism leads to the variance-penalized expectation (VPE) for which it is known that optimal schedulers have to minimize future expected rewards when a high amount of rewards has been accumulated. This behavior is undesirable as risk-averse behavior should keep the probability of particularly low outcomes low, but not discourage the accumulation of additional rewards on already good executions. The paper investigates the semi-variance, which only takes outcomes below the expected value into account, the mean absolute deviation (MAD), and the semi-MAD as alternative deviation measures. Furthermore, a penalty mechanism that penalizes outcomes below a fixed threshold is studied. For all of these objectives, the properties of optimal schedulers are specified and in particular the question whether these objectives overcome the problem observed for the VPE is answered. Further, the resulting algorithmic problems on MDPs and Markov chains are investigated.</description>

      <title>Domain theory in univalent foundations I: Directed complete posets and Scott's $D_\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop domain theory in constructive and predicative univalent foundations (also known as homotopy type theory). That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. Domain theory studies so-called directed complete posets (dcpos) and Scott continuous maps between them and has applications in a variety of fields, such as programming language semantics, higher-type computability and topology. A common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative foundation is to work with information systems, abstract bases or formal topologies rather than dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott continuous functions. In our type-theoretic approach, we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work with type universes to account for this. A priori one might expect that iterative constructions of dcpos may result in a need for ever-increasing universes and are predicatively impossible. We show, through a careful tracking of type universe parameters, that such constructions can be carried out in a predicative setting. In particular, we give a predicative reconstruction of Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>

      <title>Domain theory in univalent foundations II: Continuous and algebraic domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of continuous and algebraic domains in constructive and predicative univalent foundations, building upon our earlier work on basic domain theory in this setting. That we work predicatively means that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional resizing axioms. Our work is constructive in the sense that we do not rely on excluded middle or the axiom of (countable) choice. To deal with size issues and give a predicatively suitable definition of continuity of a dcpo, we follow Johnstone and Joyal's work on continuous categories. Adhering to the univalent perspective, we explicitly distinguish between data and property. To ensure that being continuous is a property of a dcpo, we turn to the propositional truncation, although we explain that some care is needed to avoid needing the axiom of choice. We also adapt the notion of a domain-theoretic basis to the predicative setting by imposing suitable smallness conditions, analogous to the categorical concept of an accessible category. All our running examples of continuous dcpos are then actually examples of dcpos with small bases which we show to be well behaved predicatively. In particular, such dcpos are exactly those presented by small ideals. As an application of the theory, we show that Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped $\lambda$-calculus is an example of an algebraic dcpo with a small basis. Our work is formalised in the Agda proof assistant and its ability to infer universe levels has been invaluable for our purposes.</description>

      <title>An automata-based approach for synchronizable mailbox communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit finite-state communicating systems with round-based communication under mailbox semantics. Mailboxes correspond to one FIFO buffer per process (instead of one buffer per pair of processes in peer-to-peer systems). Round-based communication corresponds to sequences of rounds in which processes can first send messages, then only receive (and receives must be in the same round as their sends). Our main contribution shows that the problem whether a mailbox communication system complies with the round-based policy, with no size limitation on rounds, is Pspace-complete. For this we use a novel automata-based approach, that also allows to determine the precise complexity (Pspace) of several questions considered in previous literature.</description>

      <title>A PSPACE Algorithm for Almost-Sure Rabin Objectives in Multi-Environment MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) model systems with uncertain transition dynamics. Multiple-environment MDPs (MEMDPs) extend MDPs. They intuitively reflect finite sets of MDPs that share the same state and action spaces but differ in the transition dynamics. The key objective in MEMDPs is to find a single policy that satisfies a given objective in every associated MDP. The main result of this paper is PSPACE-completeness for almost-sure Rabin objectives in MEMDPs. This result clarifies the complexity landscape for MEMDPs and contrasts with results for the more general class of partially observable MDPs (POMDPs), where almost-sure reachability is already EXPTIME-complete, and almost-sure Rabin objectives are undecidable.</description>

      <title>Integer Linear-Exponential Programming in NP by Quantifier Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides an NP procedure that decides whether a linear-exponential system of constraints has an integer solution. Linear-exponential systems extend standard integer linear programs with exponential terms $2^x$ and remainder terms ${(x \bmod 2^y)}$. Our result implies that the existential theory of the structure $(\mathbb{N},0,1,+,2^{(\cdot)},V_2(\cdot,\cdot),\leq)$ has an NP-complete satisfiability problem, thus improving upon a recent EXPSPACE upper bound. This theory extends the existential fragment of Presburger arithmetic with the exponentiation function $x \mapsto 2^x$ and the binary predicate $V_2(x,y)$ that is true whenever $y \geq 1$ is the largest power of $2$ dividing $x$.
  Our procedure for solving linear-exponential systems uses the method of quantifier elimination. As a by-product, we modify the classical Gaussian variable elimination into a non-deterministic polynomial-time procedure for integer linear programming (or: existential Presburger arithmetic).</description>

      <title>Safe and Reliable Training of Learning-Based Aerospace Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches have generated highly successful controllers for a myriad of complex domains. However, the opaque nature of these models limits their applicability in aerospace systems and safety-critical domains, in which a single mistake can have dire consequences. In this paper, we present novel advancements in both the training and verification of DRL controllers, which can help ensure their safe behavior. We showcase a design-for-verification approach utilizing k-induction and demonstrate its use in verifying liveness properties. In addition, we also give a brief overview of neural Lyapunov Barrier certificates and summarize their capabilities on a case study. Finally, we describe several other novel reachability-based approaches which, despite failing to provide guarantees of interest, could be effective for verification of other DRL systems, and could be of further interest to the community.</description>

      <title>Operations on Fixpoint Equation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07162v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study operations on fixpoint equation systems (FES) over arbitrary complete lattices. We investigate under which conditions these operations, such as substituting variables by their definition, and swapping the ordering of equations, preserve the solution of a FES. We provide rigorous, computer-checked proofs. Along the way, we list a number of known and new identities and inequalities on extremal fixpoints in complete lattices.</description>

      <title>Regularization in Spider-Style Strategy Discovery and Schedule Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To achieve the best performance, automatic theorem provers often rely on schedules of diverse proving strategies to be tried out (either sequentially or in parallel) on a given problem. In this paper, we report on a large-scale experiment with discovering strategies for the Vampire prover, targeting the FOF fragment of the TPTP library and constructing a schedule for it, based on the ideas of Andrei Voronkov's system Spider. We examine the process from various angles, discuss the difficulty (or ease) of obtaining a strong Vampire schedule for the CASC competition, and establish how well a schedule can be expected to generalize to unseen problems and what factors influence this property.</description>
