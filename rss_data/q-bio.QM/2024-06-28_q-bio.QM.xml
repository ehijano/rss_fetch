      <title>An LLM-based Knowledge Synthesis and Scientific Reasoning Framework for Biomedical Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present BioLunar, developed using the Lunar framework, as a tool for supporting biological analyses, with a particular emphasis on molecular-level evidence enrichment for biomarker discovery in oncology. The platform integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate complex scientific reasoning across distributed evidence spaces, enhancing the capability for harmonizing and reasoning over heterogeneous data sources. Demonstrating its utility in cancer research, BioLunar leverages modular design, reusable data access and data analysis components, and a low-code user interface, enabling researchers of all programming levels to construct LLM-enabled scientific workflows. By facilitating automatic scientific discovery and inference from heterogeneous evidence, BioLunar exemplifies the potential of the integration between LLMs, specialised databases and biomedical tools to support expert-level knowledge synthesis and discovery.</description>

      <title>LICO: Large Language Models for In-Context Molecular Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing black-box functions is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO achieves state-of-the-art performance on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising over 20 objective functions.</description>

      <title>Dimensions underlying the representational alignment of deep neural networks with humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the similarities and differences between humans and artificial intelligence is an important goal both in machine learning and cognitive neuroscience. However, similarities in representations only inform us about the degree of alignment, not the factors that determine it. Drawing upon recent developments in cognitive science, we propose a generic framework for yielding comparable representations in humans and deep neural networks (DNN). Applying this framework to humans and a DNN model of natural images revealed a low-dimensional DNN embedding of both visual and semantic dimensions. In contrast to humans, DNNs exhibited a clear dominance of visual over semantic features, indicating divergent strategies for representing images. While in-silico experiments showed seemingly-consistent interpretability of DNN dimensions, a direct comparison between human and DNN representations revealed substantial differences in how they process images. By making representations directly comparable, our results reveal important challenges for representational alignment, offering a means for improving their comparability.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the local contractility of the cardiac muscle from deficient apparent kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active solids are a large class of materials, including both living soft tissues and artificial matter, that share the ability to undergo strain even in absence of external loads. While in engineered materials the actuation is typically designed a priori, in natural materials it is an unknown of the problem. In such a framework, the identification of inactive regions in active materials is of particular interest. An example of paramount relevance is cardiac mechanics and the assessment of regions of the cardiac muscle with impaired contractility. The impossibility to measure the local active forces directly suggests us to develop a novel methodology exploiting kinematic data from clinical images by a variational approach to reconstruct the local contractility of the cardiac muscle. By finding the stationary points of a suitable cost functional we recover the contractility map of the muscle. Numerical experiments, including severe conditions with added noise to model uncertainties, and data knowledge limited to the boundary, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Unlike other methods, we provide a spatially continuous recovery of the contractility map without compromising the computational efficiency.</description>
