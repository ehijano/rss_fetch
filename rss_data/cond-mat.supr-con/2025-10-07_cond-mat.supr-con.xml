      <title>Anomalous Fraunhofer patterns in Cd$_3$As$_2$ Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors are promising for quantum computing, yet their unambiguous detection remains challenging. We fabricated Josephson junctions (JJs) using Cd$_3$As$_2$ Dirac semimetal nanoribbons with NbTi superconducting electrodes to investigate topological supercurrents through Fraunhofer pattern analysis. The JJs exhibited excellent quality with high transparency ($\tau$ = 0.77) and large induced superconducting gap ($\Delta$ = 1.10 meV), confirmed by multiple Andreev reflection features. While node lifting at the third minimum of the Fraunhofer pattern was observed as a predicted signature of 4{$\pi$}-periodic topological supercurrents, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that asymmetric supercurrent distributions can reproduce this behavior without invoking MZMs. These findings reveal that anomalous Fraunhofer patterns alone cannot reliably confirm topological superconductivity, necessitating complementary experimental approaches for conclusive Majorana detection</description>

      <title>Variation Monte Carlo Study on the bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model for La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has aroused significant interest in exploring the pairing mechanism. Previous studies have proposed an effective d$_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital bilayer $t-J_{\parallel}-J_{\perp}$ model, in which the electrons of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are charge carriers, which are subject to the intralayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) superexchange $J_{\parallel}$ and the large interlayer AFM superexchange $J_{\perp}\approx 2J_{\parallel}$, with the latter transferred from the nearly half-filled and hence localized $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the strong Hund's rule coupling. Here we study this model by the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) simulation and find a dominant interlayer s-wave pairing, in which the SC order parameters have a drastic improvement compared with those of the mean field (MF) type of theories. In real materials, the Hund's coupling is finite, leading to reduced $J_{\perp}$, dictating that the MF-type theories have difficulty explaining the HTSC. However, our VMC calculations find that even for effective $J_{\perp}$ as weak as $J_{\perp}=J_{\parallel}$, the interlayer pairing is still considerably large and can be compared with the $T_c$ observed in experiments, which is very weak in MF-type theories. This result indicates the important role of the Gutzwiller projection in improving the $T_c$, which is ignored in the MF-type theories. In addition, our results show that suppressed interlayer hopping can promote interlayer pairing, which is consistent with the fact that the interlayer hopping of the d$_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is very weak. Our research offers a new perspective for understanding the pairing mechanism of bilayer nickelates and provides a reference for recent ultra-cold atom experiments in mixed-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Systematic evolution of superconducting pairing strength and Seebeck coefficients in correlated infinite-layer La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered superconducting infinite-layer nickelates offer a novel platform to explore an exotic pairing mechanism in multi-band systems towards high-temperature superconductivity and associated rich quantum phases, contrasting with cuprates. Here, we show that infinite-layer (La,Sr)NiO$_2$ exhibits strong-coupling superconductivity, resilient to in-plane magnetic fields exceeding 47 T at optimal doping - more than twice the Pauli limit for conventional BCS superconductors. This violation becomes pronounced towards the underdoped regime, implying an intriguing evolution of pairing glue. The unexpected observation of positive Seebeck coefficients in this regime indicates the presence of nontrivial electron correlations. Furthermore, our comprehensive investigation across the superconducting dome reveals that the evolution of (thermo)electric normal-state properties - specifically, the sign changes of the Hall and Seebeck coefficients - coincide with the evolution of superconducting anisotropy and pairing strength. This demonstrates a definitive link between electron correlations and strong-coupling superconductivity in (La,Sr)NiO$_2$, contributing to a unified framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Anyon interactions in the Chern--Simons--Landau--Ginzburg model of the fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interactions of anyonic quasi-particles (vortices) in the Chern--Simons extension of the Ginzburg--Landau model is investigated and we show that it manifestly realizes a hybridization of type I/II superconductivity. Through Gauss' law, each vortex simultaneously carries a flux quantum and a proportional Noether charge, thereby realizing an anyonic excitation. The Chern--Simons coupling also modifies the screening structure of the gauge fields, producing complex-conjugate masses that yield a common penetration depth with an oscillatory phase. This altered asymptotic behavior breaks the conventional type-I/type-II dichotomy of the Ginzburg--Landau model. As a result, vortex anyons experience short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, enabling the formation of separated multi-vortex bound states with non-monotonic interaction energy.</description>

      <title>Right-eigenstate-based approach to non-Hermitian superfluidity with two-body loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically explore a non-Hermitian superfluid model with complex-valued interaction, inspired by two-body loss stemming from inelastic scattering observed in ultracold atomic experiments. Utilizing both the right-eigenstate-based mean-field theory and its biorthogonal counterpart, we study the properties of the system. Notably, the right-eigenstate-based framework produces smooth and continuous solutions, in stark contrast to the absence of nontrivial solutions and the abrupt discontinuities observed in the biorthogonal-eigenstate-based framework under moderate dissipation. In addition, the lower condensation energy obtained in the former framework suggests its superior suitability for describing this system. Furthermore, we explore the impact of backscattering, a crucial factor in realistic systems. Our analysis reveals that, facilitated by two-body loss, even moderate backscattering destabilizes the superfluid state. Sufficiently strong backscattering completely destroys it, highlighting a key mechanism for the fragility of this non-Hermitian quantum phase.</description>

      <title>Classification of Weyl point trajectories in multi-terminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04279v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological protection is an attractive signature in both fundamental and applied researches because it provides an exotic and robust state. Multi-terminal Josephson junctions have recently been studied extensively owing to the emergence of topologically protected Weyl points without the need for topological materials. In this study, we examine the dynamic properties of Weyl points in multi-terminal Josephson junctions. The junctions are modulated by external parameters, such as electric gate voltage, magnetic flux, bias voltage. The Weyl points are manipulated and draw trajectories accompanied by pair creation and annihilation. The trajectories form both closed loops and open lines. We classify these trajectories using the Chern number and the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Repulsive-Interaction-Driven Topological Superconductivity in a Landau Level Coupled to an $s$-Wave Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A two-dimensional topologically nontrivial state of noninteracting electrons, such as the surface state of a three-dimensional topological insulator, is predicted to realize a topological superconductor when proximity-coupled to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor. In contrast, noninteracting electrons partially occupying a Landau level, with Rashba spin-orbit coupling that lifts the spin degeneracy, fail to develop topological superconductivity under similar proximity coupling in the presence of the conventional Abrikosov vortex lattice. We demonstrate through exact diagonalization that, at half-filled Landau level, introducing a repulsive interaction between electrons induces topological superconductivity for a range of parameters. This appears rather surprising because a repulsive interaction is expected to inhibit, not promote, pairing, but suggests an appealing principle for realizing topological superconductivity: proximity-coupling a composite Fermi liquid to an ordinary $s$-wave superconductor.</description>

      <title>Controlling an altermagnetic spin density wave in the kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of charge and spin orders lies at the heart of correlated electron physics and plays a critical role in the emergence of unconventional quantum phases. Kagome magnets provide a particularly promising platform to investigate these phenomena, owing to their geometrically frustrated lattice structure. However, resolving spin and charge orders microscopically and establishing ways to control them remain fundamental challenges. Here, we demonstrate magnetic field control of an altermagnetic spin density wave order intertwined with charge density wave order in kagome magnet CsCr3Sb5. Scanning tunneling microscopy down to deep cryogenic temperature of 50 mK reveals two previously unreported charge density wave orders in the Sb surface. Density functional theory confirms that one of them is coupled to a spin density wave with an altermagnetic ground state. The charge density waves can be tuned in both amplitude and phase by an external magnetic field, reflected in domain switching and stripe sliding of the charge density wave. Our findings deepen the understanding of symmetry-breaking in kagome systems, providing a tunable platform to explore the interplay of electronic correlation with emergent quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Local Limit Disorder Characteristics of Superconducting Radio Frequency Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04203v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays Nb-based superconducting radio-frequency cavities represent fundamental tools used for (Standard Model) particle acceleration, (beyond Standard Model) particle probing, and long-lifetime photon preservation. We study the SRF frequency shift in the vicinity of the critical temperature $T_c$ and the quality factor mainly at low temperatures within the Dynes superconductor model. We scrutinize and use the local limit response to the external electromagnetic field. Our approach allows for a finer analysis of the peculiar behavior of the resonant frequency shift immensely close to $T_c$, observed in recent experiments. In several regimes, we analytically elaborate on the width and depth of the resulting dip. Studying the sign of the slope of the resonant frequency shift at $T_c$ in the moderately clean regime clarifies the role of the pair-breaking and pair-conserving disorder. Next, to find the relevance of our description, we compare and also fit our results with the recent experimental data from the N-doped Nb sample presented by Zarea {\it et al.} [Front. Supercond. Mater. 3, 1 (2023), arXiv:2307.07905]. Our analysis complies with the experimental findings, especially concerning the dip width. We offer a straightforward, homogeneous-disorder-based interpretation within the moderately clean regime. Comparative analysis for three other cavities with different resonant frequencies reported by Ueki {\it et al.} [Prog. Theor. Exp. Phys. 5, 053I02 (2025), arXiv:2207.14236] points toward a similar regime. Assuming the same regime at low temperatures, we address details of the high-quality plateaus. Summing all up, this work presents (and studies the limits of) the simple, effective description of the complex problem corresponding to the electromagnetic response in the superconductors, combining homogeneous conventional pairing and two different kinds of disorder scattering.</description>

      <title>Revisiting dissipation-driven phase transition in a Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite extensive experimental and theoretical work over several decades, Schmid-Bulgadaev quantum phase transition remains a subject of debate. Here we revisit this problem by performing systematic experiments on low-frequency current-voltage characteristics of Josephson junctions over a wide range of parameters. The experiments are conducted in a true resistive environment formed by a metallic on-chip resistor located near the junction. Over the parameter range of the experiment, we find that the transition occurs when the resistance crosses the quantum value $h/(4e^2)\simeq 6.5$ k$\Omega$ for Cooper pairs, as originally predicted. The temperature $T$ of the experiment is naturally non-zero, but our basic theoretical modeling corroborates that the observations under these conditions can serve as the basis for the conclusions made, in particular, the crossover resistance from superconducting to insulating regime is the same as that at $T=0$.</description>

      <title>Room-Temperature Superconductivity at 298 K in Ternary La-Sc-H System at High-pressure Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01273v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Room-temperature superconductor has been a century-long dream of humankind. Recent research on hydrogen-based superconductors (e.g., CaH6, LaH10, etc.) at high-pressure conditions lifts the record of superconducting critical temperature (Tc) up to ~250 kelvin. We here report the experimental synthesis of the first-ever room-temperature superconductor by compression on a mixture of La-Sc alloy and ammonia borane at pressures of 250-260 gigapascals (GPa) via a diamond anvil cell by a laser-heating technique. Superconductivity with an onset temperature of 271-298 kelvin at 195-266 GPa is observed by the measurement of zero electrical resistance and the suppression of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data unambiguously reveal that this superconductor crystallizes in a hexagonal structure with a stoichiometry LaSc2H24, in excellent agreement with our previous prediction1. Through thirteen reproducible experimental runs, we provide solid evidence of the realization of a room-temperature superconductor for the first time, marking a milestone in the field of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Engineering second order topological superconductor hosting tunable Majorana corner modes in magnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrid platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically study the noncollinear magnetic texture effect on second-order topological superconductor (SOTSC) phase generated in unconventional $d$-wave superconductors and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHI). While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has been studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show that the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs. Each corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending on the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of the spin texture. To characterize the higher order bulk topology, we compute the quadrupolar winding number, which directly corresponds to the number of MCMs acquiring a value of one for four corner modes and two for eight corner modes. We investigate and show the close resemblance in the topological phase diagrams obtained from the low energy effective Hamiltonian that reveals an emergent in-plane Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling induced by the spin texture, and the real space tight binding lattice model. The microscopic pairing mechanism responsible for the appearance of SOTSC phase is investigated via an effective bulk pairing analysis, while a low-energy edge theory captures the mechanism behind tunability of MCMs. Our result paves the way for realizing SOTC with multiple MCMs which can be tuned via system parameters.</description>

      <title>Two-photon coupling via Josephson element II: Interaction renormalizations and cross-Kerr coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interactions mediated by symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), their renormalizations, and applicability of the anharmonic oscillator model for a coupled phase qubit. The coupling SQUID can switch between single- or two-photon interaction in situ. We consider a coupled resonator and an rf SQUID. The latter dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of anharmonic energy states and acts as an artificial atom known as the phase qubit. Apart from the linear and two-photon couplings, interactions of optomechanical type and a cross-Kerr coupling arise. Near the two-photon resonance, we calculate the renormalizations due to nonresonant interactions, which are more prominent with the higher Josephson energy of the coupler. We interpret the renormalizations by depicting some of the virtual processes involved. That also allows us to determine the minimal amount of metastable states in the phase qubit for the renormalization formulas to hold.</description>
