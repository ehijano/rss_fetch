      <title>Input-to-state stability-based chemical reaction networks composition for molecular computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular computation based on chemical reaction networks (CRNs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for designing programmable biochemical systems. However, the implementation of complex computations still requires excessively large and intricate network structures, largely due to the limited understanding of composability, that is, how multiple subsystems can be coupled while preserving computational functionality. Existing composability frameworks primarily focus on rate-independent CRNs, whose computational capabilities are severely restricted. This article aims to establish a systematic framework for composable CRNs governed by mass-action kinetics, a common type of rate-dependent CRNs. Drawing upon the concepts of composable rate-independent CRNs, we introduce the notions of mass-action chemical reaction computers (msCRCs), dynamic computation and dynamic composability to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for composing two or more msCRCs to achieve layer-by-layer computation of composite functions. Further, we derive several sufficient conditions based on the notions of input-to-state stability (ISS) to characterize msCRCs that can be composed to implement desired molecular computations, thereby providing theoretical support for this framework. Some examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency of our method. Finally, comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits notable advantages in both computational ability and accuracy over the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Network Pharmacology Reveals HSPA1A/BST2 as Potential Targets of Ci Bai Capsule's Active Compounds Intervening in Leukopenia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Radiation-induced leukopenia caused by low-dose exposure is frequently associated with Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes like "blood deficiency" and "fatigue syndrome". Ci Bai Capsule (CB) has been reported to enhance white blood cell levels; however, its mechanisms and bioactive compounds remain unclear.Aim: This study aimed to identify the bioactive compounds group of CB and elucidate its potential mechanisms in radiation-induced leukopenia.Methods: Syndrome-related data were gathered from SYMMAP and CTD database. CB's target profile is predicted by DrugCIPHER. Network pharmacology approaches were employed to identify active compounds and related pathways. Experimental validation was conducted through flow cytometry and RNA-sequencing in both ex vivo and in vivo models.Results: A total of 22 pathways related to cellular processes, immune responses, and signal transduction were identified. Five key bioactive compounds (kaempferol-3-glucorhamnoside, syringin, schisandrin, 3-hydroxytyrosol 3-O-glucoside and salidroside) were found to significantly modulate syndrome-related pathways. Optimal dosing of this compound combination enhanced leukocyte counts and splenic immune cell proliferation in irradiated mice. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the compounds exert regulatory effects on PP1A, RB, CDK4/6, CDK2, and CDK1, thereby modulating downstream immune and hematopoietic markers such as MNDA, BST2, and HSPA1A.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that CB mitigates radiation-induced leukopenia by enhancing immune and hematopoietic recovery, offering a promising therapeutic approach for managing radiation-related hematological disorders.</description>

      <title>Upper bound for the stability of Boolean networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Boolean networks, inspired by gene regulatory networks, were developed to understand the complex behaviors observed in biological systems, with network attractors corresponding to biological phenotypes or cell types. In this article, we present a proof for a conjecture by Williadsen, Triesch and Wiles about upper bounds for the stability of basins of attraction in Boolean networks. We further extend this result from a single basin of attraction to the entire network. Specifically, we demonstrate that the asymptotic upper bound for the robustness and the basin entropy of a Boolean network are negatively linearly related.</description>

      <title>Complex forming behaviour of {\alpha}, \b{eta} and {\gamma}-cyclodextrins with varying size probe particles in silico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides composed of glucopyranose units bonded together to form a truncated cone that can make inclusion complexes with guest molecules. The {\alpha}, \b{eta}, and {\gamma}-CDs, which respectively comprise six, seven or eight glucopyranose units, are used extensively in pharmaceutical formulations as functional excipients. The cavity sizes of all three natural CDs have been approximated using static structures but a growing consensus is that the CDs are flexible; moreover, the size range of molecules that CDs can accommodate has not been systematically studied. Here the results of molecular dynamics simulations performed using spherical continuum probe particles of different sizes to observe the complex-forming behaviour of CDs are presented. Results revealed that CDs can make dynamic complexes with guest molecules that are larger than their reported cavity sizes.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced stabilization in a chemical reaction network without boundary effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a chemical reaction network that is unstable under deterministic mass action kinetics, exhibiting finite-time blow-up of trajectories in the interior of the state space, but whose stochastic counterpart is positive recurrent. This provides an example of noise-induced stabilization of the model's dynamics arising due to noise perturbing transversally the divergent trajectories of the system that is independently of boundary effects. The proof is based on a careful decomposition of the state space and the construction of suitable Lyapunov functions in each region.</description>

      <title>Finding Thermodynamically Favorable Pathways in Chemical Reaction Networks Using Flows in Hypergraphs and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for pathways that optimize the formation of a particular target molecule in a reaction network is a key problem in many settings, including reactor systems. Chemical reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in the literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.</description>
