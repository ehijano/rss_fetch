      <title>MOSAIK: Multi-Origin Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis and Integration Kit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) has revolutionised transcriptomics analysis by preserving tissue architecture, allowing researchers to study gene expression in its native spatial context. However, despite its potential, ST still faces significant technical challenges. Two major issues include: (1) the integration of raw data into coherent and reproducible analysis workflows, and (2) the accurate assignment of transcripts to individual cells. To address these challenges, we present MOSAIK, the first fully integrated, end-to-end workflow that supports raw data from both NanoString CosMx Spatial Molecular Imager (CosMx) and 10x Genomics Xenium In Situ (Xenium). MOSAIK (Multi-Origin Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis and Integration Kit) unifies transcriptomics and imaging data into a single Python object based on the spatialdata format. This unified structure ensures compatibility with a broad range of Python tools, enabling robust quality control and downstream analyses. With MOSAIK, users can perform advanced analyses such as re-segmentation (to more accurately assign transcripts to individual cells), cell typing, tissue domain identification, and cell-cell communication within a seamless and reproducible Python environment.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic inference of stochastic gene expression from structured single-cell data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell gene expression measurements encode variability spanning molecular noise, cellular heterogeneity, and technical artifacts. Mechanistic models provide a principled framework to disentangle these sources and extract insight, but inferring underlying dynamics from standard sequencing count data faces fundamental limitations. Structured datasets with temporal, spatial, or multimodal features offer constraints that help resolve these ambiguities, but demand more complex models and advanced inference strategies, including machine learning techniques with associated tradeoffs. This review highlights recent progress in the judicious integration of structured single-cell data, stochastic model development, and innovative inference strategies to extract gene-level insights. These approaches lay the foundation for mechanistic understanding of regulatory networks and multicellular systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Spatial Transcriptomics Interpolation via Cross-modal Cross-slice Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) is a promising technique that characterizes the spatial gene profiling patterns within the tissue context. Comprehensive ST analysis depends on consecutive slices for 3D spatial insights, whereas the missing intermediate tissue sections and high costs limit the practical feasibility of generating multi-slice ST. In this paper, we propose C2-STi, the first attempt for interpolating missing ST slices at arbitrary intermediate positions between adjacent ST slices. Despite intuitive, effective ST interpolation presents significant challenges, including 1) limited continuity across heterogeneous tissue sections, 2) complex intrinsic correlation across genes, and 3) intricate cellular structures and biological semantics within each tissue section. To mitigate these challenges, in C2-STi, we design 1) a distance-aware local structural modulation module to adaptively capture cross-slice deformations and enhance positional correlations between ST slices, 2) a pyramid gene co-expression correlation module to capture multi-scale biological associations among genes, and 3) a cross-modal alignment module that integrates the ST-paired hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained images to filter and align the essential cellular features across ST and H\&amp;E images. Extensive experiments on the public dataset demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art approaches on both single-slice and multi-slice ST interpolation.

      <title>Modeling Cell Dynamics and Interactions with Unbalanced Mean Field Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the dynamics from sparsely time-resolved snapshot data is crucial for understanding complex cellular processes and behavior. Existing methods leverage optimal transport, Schr\"odinger bridge theory, or their variants to simultaneously infer stochastic, unbalanced dynamics from snapshot data. However, these approaches remain limited in their ability to account for cell-cell interactions. This integration is essential in real-world scenarios since intercellular communications are fundamental life processes and can influence cell state-transition dynamics. To address this challenge, we formulate the Unbalanced Mean-Field Schr\"odinger Bridge (UMFSB) framework to model unbalanced stochastic interaction dynamics from snapshot data. Inspired by this framework, we further propose CytoBridge, a deep learning algorithm designed to approximate the UMFSB problem. By explicitly modeling cellular transitions, proliferation, and interactions through neural networks, CytoBridge offers the flexibility to learn these processes directly from data. The effectiveness of our method has been extensively validated using both synthetic gene regulatory data and real scRNA-seq datasets. Compared to existing methods, CytoBridge identifies growth, transition, and interaction patterns, eliminates false transitions, and reconstructs the developmental landscape with greater accuracy.</description>

      <title>BayesianFitForecast: A User-Friendly R Toolbox for Parameter Estimation and Forecasting with Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Mathematical models based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are essential tools across various scientific disciplines, including biology, ecology, and healthcare informatics. They are used to simulate complex dynamic systems and inform decision-making. In this paper, we introduce BayesianFitForecast, an R toolbox specifically developed to streamline Bayesian parameter estimation and forecasting in ODE models, making it particularly relevant to health informatics and public health decision-making. The toolbox is available at https://github.com/gchowell/BayesianFitForecast/.
  Results: This toolbox enables automatic generation of Stan files, allowing users to configure models, define priors, and analyze results with minimal programming expertise. To demonstrate the versatility and robustness of BayesianFitForecast, we apply it to the analysis of the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco, comparing Poisson and negative binomial error structures within the SEIR model. We also test it by fitting multiple time series of state variables using simulated data. BayesianFitForecast provides robust tools for evaluating model performance, including convergence diagnostics, posterior distributions, credible intervals, and performance metrics.
  Conclusion: By improving the accessibility of advanced Bayesian methods, this toolbox significantly broadens the application of Bayesian inference methods to dynamical systems critical for healthcare and epidemiological forecasting. A tutorial video demonstrating the toolbox's functionality is available at https://youtu.be/jnxMjz3V3n8.</description>

      <title>Impact of SMILES Notational Inconsistencies on Chemical Language Model Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical language models (CLMs), inspired by natural language processing (NLP), have recently emerged as powerful tools for various cheminformatics tasks such as molecular property prediction and molecule generation. The simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) is commonly employed in CLMs for representing molecular structures. However, despite attempts at standardization through Canonical SMILES, significant representational inconsistencies remain due to variations in canonicalization methods (grammatical inconsistencies) and incomplete stereochemical annotations (stereochemical inconsistencies). This study systematically investigates the prevalence and impact of these inconsistencies. Our literature review reveals that nearly half (45.4%) of the studies employing CLMs omit explicit mention of SMILES canonicalization, potentially impairing reproducibility. Through quantitative analysis of publicly available datasets, we observed substantial variability in SMILES representations, particularly highlighting significant gaps in stereochemical information approximately 50% of enantiomers and 30% of geometric isomers lacked complete annotations. Empirical evaluations using an encoder-decoder CLM demonstrated that representational variations significantly affect latent molecular representations, notably reducing translation accuracy. Interestingly, these variations minimally impacted downstream property prediction tasks, likely due to robust feature selection driven by label information. Furthermore, explicit manipulation of stereochemical annotations confirmed their crucial role in accurate cyclic structure reconstruction.</description>
