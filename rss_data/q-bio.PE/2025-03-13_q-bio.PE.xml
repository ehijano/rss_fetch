      <title>Genome evolution in and endangered freshwater mussel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearly neutral theory predicts that evolutionary processes will differ in small populations compared to large populations, a key point of concern for endangered species. The nearly-neutral threshold, the span of neutral variation, and the adaptive potential from new mutations all differ depending on $N_e$. To determine how genomes respond in small populations, we have created a reference genome for a US federally endangered IUCN Red List freshwater mussel, \emph{Elliptio spinosa}, and compare it to genetic variation for a common and successful relative, \emph{Elliptio crassidens}. We find higher rates of background duplication rates in \emph{E. spinosa} consistent with proposed theories of duplicate gene accumulation according to nearly-neutral processes. Along with these changes we observe fewer cases of adaptive gene family amplification in this endangered species. However, TE content is not consistent with nearly-neutral theory. We observe substantially less recent TE proliferation in the endangered species with over 500 Mb of newly copied TEs in \emph{Elliptio crassidens}. These results suggest a more complex interplay between TEs and duplicate genes than previously proposed for small populations. They further suggest that TEs and duplications require greater attention in surveys of genomic health for endangered species.</description>

      <title>Maintaining diversity in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine population structures for their ability to maintain diversity in neutral evolution. We use the general framework of evolutionary graph theory and consider birth-death (bd) and death-birth (db) updating. The population is of size $N$. Initially all individuals represent different types. The basic question is: what is the time $T_N$ until one type takes over the population? This time is known as consensus time in computer science and as total coalescent time in evolutionary biology. For the complete graph, it is known that $T_N$ is quadratic in $N$ for db and bd. For the cycle, we prove that $T_N$ is cubic in $N$ for db and bd. For the star, we prove that $T_N$ is cubic for bd and quasilinear ($N\log N$) for db. For the double star, we show that $T_N$ is quartic for bd. We derive upper and lower bounds for all undirected graphs for bd and db. We also show the Pareto front of graphs (of size $N=8$) that maintain diversity the longest for bd and db. Further, we show that some graphs that quickly homogenize can maintain high levels of diversity longer than graphs that slowly homogenize. For directed graphs, we give simple contracting star-like structures that have superexponential time scales for maintaining diversity.</description>

      <title>Vector encoding of phylogenetic trees by ordered leaf attachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of work to connect phylogenetics with machine learning, there has been considerable recent interest in vector encodings of phylogenetic trees. We present a simple new ``ordered leaf attachment'' (OLA) method for uniquely encoding a binary, rooted phylogenetic tree topology as an integer vector. OLA encoding and decoding take linear time in the number of leaf nodes, and the set of vectors corresponding to trees is a simply-described subset of integer sequences. The OLA encoding is unique compared to other existing encodings in having these properties. The integer vector encoding induces a distance on the set of trees, and we investigate this distance in relation to the NNI and SPR distances.</description>

      <title>Climate land use and other drivers impacts on island ecosystem services: a global review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Islands are diversity hotspots and vulnerable to environmental degradation, climate variations, land use changes and societal crises. These factors can exhibit interactive impacts on ecosystem services. The study reviewed a large number of papers on the climate change-islands-ecosystem services topic worldwide. Potential inclusion of land use changes and other drivers of impacts on ecosystem services were sequentially also recorded. The study sought to investigate the impacts of climate change, land use change, and other non-climatic driver changes on island ecosystem services. Explanatory variables examined were divided into two categories: environmental variables and methodological ones. Environmental variables include sea zone geographic location, ecosystem, ecosystem services, climate, land use, other driver variables, Methodological variables include consideration of policy interventions, uncertainty assessment, cumulative effects of climate change, synergistic effects of climate change with land use change and other anthropogenic and environmental drivers, and the diversity of variables used in the analysis. Machine learning and statistical methods were used to analyze their effects on island ecosystem services. Negative climate change impacts on ecosystem services are better quantified by land use change or other non-climatic driver variables than by climate variables. The synergy of land use together with climate changes is modulating the impact outcome and critical for a better impact assessment. Analyzed together, there is little evidence of more pronounced for a specific sea zone, ecosystem, or ecosystem service. Climate change impacts may be underestimated due to the use of a single climate variable deployed in most studies. Policy interventions exhibit low classification accuracy in quantifying impacts indicating insufficient efficacy or integration in the studies.</description>

      <title>A novel metric for species vulnerability and coexistence in spatially-extended ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework to understand the persistence and coexistence of competitive species in a spatially explicit metacommunity model with a heterogeneous dispersal kernel. Our analysis, based on methods from the physics of disordered systems and non-Gaussian dynamical mean field theory, reveals that species coexistence is governed by a single key parameter, which we term competitive balance. From competitive balance, we derive a novel metric to quantitatively assess the vulnerability of a species, showing that abundance alone is not sufficient to determine it. Rather, a species' vulnerability crucially depends on the state of the metacommunity as a whole. We test our theory by analyzing two distinct tropical forest datasets, finding excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions. A key step in our analysis is the introduction of a new quantity - the competitive score - which disentangles the abundance distribution and enables us to circumvent the challenge of estimating both the colonization kernel and the joint abundance distribution. Our findings provide novel and fundamental insights into the ecosystem-level trade-offs underlying macroecological patterns and introduce a robust approach for estimating extinction risks.</description>

      <title>Once bitten, twice shy: A modeling framework for incorporating heterogeneous mosquito biting into transmission models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for outbreaks of mosquito-borne disease is linked to the frequency at which mosquitoes feed on blood, also known as the biting rate. But standard models of mosquito-borne disease transmission inherently assume that mosquitoes bite only once per reproductive cycle, an assumption commonly violated in nature. Drivers of multiple biting, like host defensive behaviors or climate factors, also affect the mosquito gonotrophic cycle duration, a quantity used to estimate the biting rate. Here, we present a novel framework for incorporating complex mosquito biting behaviors into transmission models. This framework accounts for heterogeneity in and linkages between biting rates and multiple biting. We provide formulas for the basic offspring number, $\mathcal{N}_0$, and basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, threshold measures for mosquito population and pathogen transmission persistence, respectively. To exhibit its flexibility, we expand on models derived from the framework that arise from empirical, phenomenological, or mechanistic perspectives. Using the GCD as a standard quantity to make comparisons among the models, we show that assumptions about the biting process affect the relationship between GCD and $\mathcal{R}_0$. While under standard assumptions, $\mathcal{R}_0$ is an increasing linear function of the inverse of the GCD, other models of the biting process exhibit saturating or concave relationships. Through sensitivity analysis of the mechanistic model, we determine that parameters related to probing and ingesting success are the most important targets for disease control. This work highlights the importance of incorporating the behavioral dynamics of mosquitoes into transmission models and provides methods for evaluating how individual-level interventions against mosquito biting scale up to determine population-level mosquito-borne disease risk.</description>

      <title>Coupling in situ and remote sensing data to assess $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity over biogeographic gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mapping of plant biodiversity represents a fundamental stage in establishing conservation priorities, particularly in identifying groups of species that share ecological requirements or evolutionary histories. This is often achieved by assessing different spatial diversity patterns in plant population distributions. In this paper, we present two primary data sources crucial for biodiversity monitoring: in situ measurements from botanical observations and remote sensing (RS). In situ methods involve directly collecting data from specific sites, providing detailed insights into ecological patterns but often constrained by resource limitations. Integrating in situ and RS data highlights their complementary strengths, which depend on factors such as study scale, resolution, and logistical feasibility. While in situ approaches are characterized by precision, RS offers efficiency and extensive, repeated coverage. This research integrates in situ and RS data to analyze plant and spectral diversity across France at a spatial resolution of 5 km, encompassing over 23,000 grid cells. We employ four established diversity metrics leveraging the spatial distribution of 6,650 plant species and 250 spectral clusters (derived from MODIS data at a 500-meter resolution). Through bioregionalization network analysis combining these data sources, we identified five distinct bioregions that capture the biogeographical structure of plant biodiversity in France. Additionally, we explore the relationship between plant species diversity and spectral cluster diversity within and between these bioregions, offering novel insights into the spatial dynamics of plant biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Connections between sequential Bayesian inference and evolutionary dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been posited that there is a connection between the dynamical equations describing evolutionary processes in biology and sequential Bayesian learning methods. This manuscript describes new research in which this precise connection is rigorously established in the continuous time setting. Here we focus on a partial differential equation known as the Kushner-Stratonovich equation describing the evolution of the posterior density in time. Of particular importance is a piecewise smooth approximation of the observation path from which the discrete time filtering equations, which are shown to converge to a Stratonovich interpretation of the Kushner-Stratonovich equation. This smooth formulation will then be used to draw precise connections between nonlinear stochastic filtering and replicator-mutator dynamics. Additionally, gradient flow formulations will be investigated as well as a form of replicator-mutator dynamics which is shown to be beneficial for the misspecified model filtering problem. It is hoped this work will spur further research into exchanges between sequential learning and evolutionary biology and to inspire new algorithms in filtering and sampling.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>
