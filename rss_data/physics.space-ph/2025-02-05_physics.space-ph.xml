      <title>Nowcasting Solar Energetic Particle Events for Mars Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addition to the omnipresent Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs), sudden solar energetic particle (SEP) events present considerable health hazards for manned space missions. These events not only contribute to an increased long-term cancer risk, but can, in extreme cases, cause acute radiation syndromes. Forecasting their imminent occurrence could significantly reduce radiation exposure by warning astronauts to move to shelter. However, all currently available tools are primarily designed for the Earth or Earth-Moon system, which limits their applicability to future Mars missions. To address this, we developed a nowcasting system for SEP events applicable in deep space and on the Martian surface, which serves as a reliable last-resort backup when forecasts fail. The methodology of this system is based on dose rates measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) onboard the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), which recorded 5 SEP events during the seven-month flight to Mars and 16 since its landing on Mars on August 6, 2012. An SEP event is triggered, and an astronaut is warned as soon as dose rates exceed the omnipresent background level by at least 25%. This approach suggests that our system can provide astronauts with at least 30 minutes to avoid both peak radiation exposure and the majority of the cumulative dose from SEP events. Our nowcasting system is robust, easily implementable in real-life scenarios, and achieves a near-zero false alarm rate both in deep space and on the Martian surface.</description>

      <title>Computing the generalized plasma dispersion function for non-Maxwellian plasmas, with applications to Thomson scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetic plasma studies often require computing integrals of the velocity distribution over a complex-valued pole. The standard method is to solve the integral in the complex plane using the Plemelj theorem, resulting in the standard plasma dispersion function for Maxwellian plasmas. For non-Maxwellian plasmas, the Plemelj theorem does not generalize to an analytic form, and computational methods must be used. In this paper, a new computational method is developed to accurately integrate a non-Maxwellian velocity distribution over an arbitrary set of complex valued poles. This method works by keeping the integration contour on the real line, and applying a trapezoid rule-like integration scheme over all discretized intervals. In intervals containing a pole, the velocity distribution is linearly interpolated, and the analytic result for the integral over a linear function is used. The integration scheme is validated by comparing its results to the analytic plasma dispersion function for Maxwellian distributions. We then show the utility of this method by computing the Thomson scattering spectra for several non-Maxwellian distributions: the kappa, super Gaussian, and toroidal distributions. Thomson scattering is a valuable plasma diagnostic tool for both laboratory and space plasmas, but the technique relies on fitting measured wave spectra to a forward model, which typically assumes Maxwellian plasmas. Therefore, this integration method can expand the capabilities of Thomson scatter diagnostics to regimes where the plasma is non-Maxwellian, including high energy density plasmas, frictionally heated plasmas in the ionosphere, and plasmas with a substantial suprathermal electron tail.</description>

      <title>The Stationary Point: A New Method for Solar Wind Speed Measurements from a Moving Vantage Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The WISPR imager on Parker Solar Probe provides a unique view the young solar wind, flying through solar wind structures at high speed. It is of interest to use WISPR image sequences to measure the velocity of both large features (such as CMEs) and the background, ambient wind. However, WISPR's close-up, rapidly-moving perspective makes the usual methods for measuring velocities from images difficult or impossible to apply, as most apparent motion through the image is due to the motion or rotation of the imager. In this work, we propose a new method of looking for features at the "stationary point" -- a direction from which some plasma parcels appear to approach the spacecraft, remaining at a constant direction in the image sequence. This direction is a function of the plasma's radial velocity, the encounter geometry, and the spacecraft velocity, allowing the former two to be inferred. We demonstrate the technique with forward-modeled images, and we apply it to WISPR observations, inferring the speed and trajectory of a particular density feature. This method promises to enable speed measurements of the young solar wind in an important acceleration region, from a close-up perspective and at latitudes well outside the PSP orbital plane. And while we present this method in a solar wind context, it is broadly applicable to any situation of a moving viewpoint traveling through an expanding cloud of features.</description>
