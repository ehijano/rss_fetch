      <title>Cutting a Wire with Non-Maximally Entangled States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing supports combining the computational power of multiple quantum devices to overcome the limitations of individual devices. Circuit cutting techniques enable the distribution of quantum computations through classical communication. These techniques involve partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits, each containing fewer qubits. The original circuit's outcome can be replicated by executing these subcircuits on separate devices and combining their results. However, the number of shots required to achieve a fixed result accuracy with circuit cutting grows exponentially with the number of cuts, posing significant costs. In contrast, quantum teleportation allows the distribution of quantum computations without an exponential increase in shots. Nevertheless, each teleportation requires a pre-shared pair of maximally entangled qubits for transmitting a quantum state, and non-maximally entangled qubits cannot be used for this purpose. To address this, this work investigates the potential of utilizing non-maximally entangled qubit pairs in wire cutting, a specific form of circuit cutting, to mitigate the associated costs. The cost of this cutting procedure reduces with the increasing degree of entanglement in the pre-shared qubit pairs. We derive the optimal sampling overhead in this context and present a wire cutting technique employing pure non-maximally entangled states that achieves this optimal sampling overhead. Hence, this offers a continuum between existing wire cutting and quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Negative pressure in the quantum vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that a constant energy density of the vacuum produces a negative pressure. We show that, in the presence of special boundaries for the photon field, the virtual photons in the quantum vacuum may induce a negative pressure of this type. In this context, we find in particular that an anomalous quantum vacuum radiation is responsible for the appearance of this negative pressure in a system, which generates the tangential Casimir force [Z. Zhang, New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 113036] experienced by parallel conducting plates.</description>

      <title>Engineering nonequilibrium steady states through Floquet Liouvillians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally study the transient dynamics of a dissipative superconducting qubit under periodic drive towards its nonequilibrium steady states. The corresponding stroboscopic evolution, given by the qubit states at times equal to integer multiples of the drive period, is determined by a (generically non-Hermitian) Floquet Liouvillian. The drive period controls both the transients across its non-Hermitian degeneracies and the resulting nonequilibrium steady states. These steady states can exhibit higher purity compared to those achieved with a constant drive. We further study the dependence of the steady states on the direction of parameter variation and relate these findings to the recent studies of dynamically encircling exceptional points. Our work provides a new approach to control non-Hermiticity in dissipative quantum systems and presents a new paradigm in quantum state preparation and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of the parameter space: a proposal for curved systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the quantum geometric tensor for parameter-dependent curved spaces to higher dimensions, and introduce an equivalent definition that generalizes the Zanardi, et al, formulation of the tensor. The parameter-dependent metric modifies the behavior of both the quantum metric tensor and Berry curvature in a purely geometric way. Our focus is on understanding the distinctions in higher dimensions that emerge when using the generalized tensor compared to the conventional one. Through a comparative analysis, illustrated with examples in two dimensions, we highlight unique quantum geometric properties for both the quantum metric tensor and the Berry curvature. Additionally, we explore differences between analytical and perturbative approaches in solving the problems.</description>

      <title>Revealing hidden physical nonclassicality with nonnegative polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum phenomena which go beyond classical concepts is a focus of modern quantum physics. Here, we show how the theory of nonnegative polynomials emerging around Hilbert's 17th problem, can be used to optimally exploit data capturing the nonclassical nature of light. Specifically, we show that nonnegative polynomials can reveal nonclassicality in data even when it is hidden from standard detection methods up to now. Moreover, the abstract language of nonnegative polynomials also leads to a unified mathematical approach to nonclassicality for light and spin systems, allowing us to map methods for one to the other. Conversely, the physical problems arising also inspire several mathematical insights into characterisation of nonnegative polynomials.</description>

      <title>Generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we derive the fluctuation-dissipation theorem from Bayesian statistics in the language of quantum statistical mechanics, using density matrices representing the respective state of knowledge about the system. This theorem, which we have called the quantum-fluctuation-dissipation theorem (Q-FDT), allows us to obtain expectation identities between quantum observables depending on a continuous parameter $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$. In this sense, we consider parameters contained in the observables (e.g. a perturbative parameter), or parameters such as Lagrange multipliers only, excluding parameters that modify the underlying Hilbert space. Using both canonical and grand canonical density matrices in the Q-FDT, we explore the resulting fluctuation-dissipation identities. In this sense, we found that some of the expectation identities in common use in traditional quantum statistics and quantum chemistry, such as the thermodynamical fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the Ehrenfest and the Hellmann-Feynman theorems, among others, are particular instances of the Q-FDT. Lastly, using a \textit{generalized} density matrix arising from a Maximum-Entropy procedure, we derive generalized fluctuation-dissipation identities: these generalized identities allow us to group all the previous cases in a unitary scheme.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Gaussian-Schell Model: A Link Between Classical and Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum theory of the electromagnetic field uncovered that classical forms of light were indeed produced by distinct superpositions of nonclassical multiphoton wavepackets. Specifically, partially coherent light represents the most common kind of classical light. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate the extraction of the constituent multiphoton quantum systems of a partially coherent light field. We shift from the realm of classical optics to the domain of quantum optics via a quantum representation of partially coherent light using its complex-Gaussian statistical properties. Our formulation of the quantum Gaussian-Schell model unveils the possibility of performing photon-number-resolving detection to isolate the constituent quantum multiphoton wavepackets of a classical light field. We experimentally verified the coherence properties of isolated vacuum systems and wavepackets with up to sixteen photons. Our findings not only demonstrate the possibility of observing quantum properties of classical macroscopic objects, but also establish a fundamental bridge between the classical and quantum worlds.</description>

      <title>A field theory representation of sum of powers of principal minors and physical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel field theory representation for the Sum of Powers of Principal Minors (SPPM), a mathematical construct with profound implications in quantum mechanics and statistical physics. We begin by establishing a Berezin integral formulation of the SPPM problem, showcasing its versatility through various symmetries including $SU(n)$, its subgroups, and particle-hole symmetry. This representation not only facilitates new analytical approaches but also offers deeper insights into the symmetries of complex quantum systems. For instance, it enables the representation of the Hubbard model's partition function in terms of the SPPM problem. We further develop three mean field techniques to approximate SPPM, each providing unique perspectives and utilities: the first method focuses on the evolution of symmetries post-mean field approximation, the second, based on the bosonic representation, enhances our understanding of the stability of mean field results, and the third employs a variational approach to establish a lower bound for SPPM. These methods converge to identical consistency relations and values for SPPM, illustrating their robustness. The practical applications of our theoretical advancements are demonstrated through two compelling case studies. First, we exactly solve the SPPM problem for the Laplacian matrix of a chain, a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, allowing for precise benchmarking of mean-field theory results. Second, we present the first analytical calculation of the Shannon-R\'enyi entropy for the transverse field Ising chain, revealing critical insights into phase transitions and symmetry breaking in the ferromagnetic phase. This work not only bridges theoretical gaps in understanding principal minors within quantum systems but also sets the stage for future explorations in more complex quantum and statistical physics models.</description>

      <title>Markovian and non-Markovian master equations versus an exactly solvable model of a qubit in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum master equations are commonly used to model the dynamics of open quantum systems, but their accuracy is rarely compared with the analytical solution of exactly solvable models. In this work, we perform such a comparison for the damped Jaynes-Cummings model of a qubit in a leaky cavity, for which an analytical solution is available in the one-excitation subspace. We consider the non-Markovian time-convolutionless master equation up to the second (Redfield) and fourth orders as well as three types of Markovian master equations: the coarse-grained, cumulant, and standard rotating-wave approximation (RWA) Lindblad equations. We compare the exact solution to these master equations for three different spectral densities: impulse, Ohmic, and triangular. We demonstrate that the coarse-grained master equation outperforms the standard RWA-based Lindblad master equation for weak coupling or high qubit frequency (relative to the spectral density high-frequency cutoff $\omega_c$), where the Markovian approximation is valid. In the presence of non-Markovian effects characterized by oscillatory, non-decaying behavior, the TCL approximation closely matches the exact solution for short evolution times (in units of $\omega_c^{-1}$) even outside the regime of validity of the Markovian approximations. For long evolution times, all master equations perform poorly, as quantified in terms of the trace-norm distance from the exact solution. The fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation achieves the top performance in all cases. Our results highlight the need for reliable approximation methods to describe open-system quantum dynamics beyond the short-time limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general formalism and specific implementation of quantum gates based on interaction of single photons with open dissipative nanocavities containing ensembles of quantum emitters. Rich dynamics of entangled bright and dark states of quantum emitters coupled to a nanocavity field gives rise to efficient manipulation of the quantum state of an incident photon. In its simplest implementation, an initial preparation of the state of quantum emitters by a classical optical pulse controls the polarization state of the reflected photon.</description>

      <title>Concatenated Steane code with single-flag syndrome checks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fault-tolerant error correction (FTEC) protocol with a high error suppression rate and low overhead is very desirable for the near-term implementation of quantum computers. In this work, we develop a distance-preserving flag FTEC protocol for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which requires only two ancilla qubits per generator and can be implemented on a planar layout. We generalize the weight-parity error correction (WPEC) technique from [Phys. Rev. A 104, 042410 (2021)] and find a gate ordering of flag circuits for the concatenated Steane code which makes syndrome extraction with two ancilla qubits per generator possible. The FTEC protocol is constructed using the optimization tools for flag FTEC developed in [arXiv:2306.12862] and is simulated under the circuit-level noise model without idling noise. Our simulations give a pseudothreshold of $1.64 \times 10^{-3}$ for the [[49,1,9]] concatenated Steane code, which is better than a pseudothreshold of $1.43 \times 10^{-3}$ for the [[61,1,9]] 6.6.6 color code simulated under the same settings. This is in contrast to the code capacity model where the [[61,1,9]] code performs better.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage of One-Way Squeezing in Enhancing Weak-Force Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity optomechanical (COM) sensors, featuring efficient light-motion couplings, have been widely used for ultra sensitive measurements of various physical quantities ranging from displacements to accelerations or weak forces. Previous works, however, have mainly focused on reciprocal COM systems. Here, we propose how to further improve the performance of quantum COM sensors by breaking reciprocal symmetry in purely quantum regime. Specifically, we consider a spinning COM resonator and show that by selectively driving it in opposite directions, highly nonreciprocal optical squeezing can emerge, which in turn provides an efficient way to surpass the standard quantum limit that otherwise exists in conventional reciprocal devices. Our work confirms that breaking reciprocal symmetry, already achieved in diverse systems well beyond spinning systems, can serve as a new strategy to further enhance the abilities of advanced quantum sensors, for applications ranging from testing fundamental physical laws to practical quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Measurement-device-independent quantum random number generation over 23 Mbps with imperfect single-photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum randomness relies heavily on the accurate characterization of the generator implementation, where the device imperfection or inaccurate characterization can lead to incorrect entropy estimation and practical bias, significantly affecting the reliability of the generated randomness. Measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum random number generation (QRNG) endeavors to produce certified randomness, utilizing uncharacterized and untrusted measurement devices that are vulnerable to numerous attack schemes targeting measurement loopholes. However, existing implementations have shown insufficient performance thus far. Here, we propose a high-speed MDI-QRNG scheme based on a robust measurement tomography approach against the imperfection of single-photon sources. Compared with the conventional approach, the decoy-state method is introduced to obtain more accurate tomography results and a tighter lower bound of randomness. Finally, by using a high-speed time-bin encoding system, we experimentally demonstrated the scheme and obtained a reliable min-entropy lower bound of $7.37 \times 10^{-2}$ bits per pulse, corresponding to a generation rate over 23 Mbps, which substantially outperforms the existing realizations and makes a record in discrete-variable semi-device-independent QRNGs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for partial differential equations via Schr\"odingerisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising avenue for achieving significant speedup, particularly in large-scale PDE simulations, compared to classical computing. One of the main quantum approaches involves utilizing Hamiltonian simulation, which is directly applicable only to Schr\"odinger-type equations. To address this limitation, Schr\"odingerisation techniques have been developed, employing the warped transformation to convert general linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations. However, despite the development of Schr\"odingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of the corresponding quantum circuit for solving general PDEs remains to be designed. In this paper, we present detailed implementation of a quantum algorithm for general PDEs using Schr\"odingerisation techniques. We provide examples of the heat equation, and the advection equation approximated by the upwind scheme, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Complexity analysis is also carried out to demonstrate the quantum advantages of these algorithms in high dimensions over their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Fast biological imaging with quantum-enhanced Raman microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a powerful label-free imaging technique that probes the vibrational response of chemicals with high specificity and sensitivity. High-power, quantum-enhanced SRS microscopes have been recently demonstrated and applied to polymers and biological samples. Quantum correlations, in the form of squeezed light, enable the microscopes to operate below the shot noise limit, enhancing their performance without increasing the illumination intensity. This addresses the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and speed constraints introduced by photodamage in shot noise-limited microscopes. Previous microscopes have either used single-beam squeezing, but with insufficient brightness to reach the optimal ratio of pump-to-Stokes intensity for maximum SNR, or have used twin-beam squeezing and suffered a 3 dB noise penalty. Here we report a quantum-enhanced Raman microscope that uses a bright squeezed single-beam, enabling operation at the optimal efficiency of the SRS process. The increase in brightness leads to multimode effects that degrade the squeezing level, which we partially overcome using spatial filtering. We apply our quantum-enhanced SRS microscope to biological samples, and demonstrate quantum-enhanced multispectral imaging of living cells. The imaging speed of 100x100 pixels in 18 seconds allows the dynamics of cell organelles to be resolved. The SNR achieved is compatible with video rate imaging, with the quantum correlations yielding a 20% improvement in imaging speed compared to shot noise limited operation.</description>

      <title>Impact of dark states on the stationary properties of quantum particles with off-centered interactions in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the two-body contact interaction for non-relativistic particles trapped in one dimension. The particles interact only when they are a distance c apart. The competition of the interaction length scale with the oscillator length leads to three regimes identified from the energy spectra. When c is less than the oscillator length, particles avoid each other, whereas in the opposite case bunching occurs. In the intermediate region where the oscillator length is comparable to c, both exclusion and bunching are manifested. All of these regions are separated by dark states, i.e. bosonic or fermionic states which are not affected by the interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the temperature of a quantum system is an essential task in almost all aspects of quantum technologies. Theoretically, an optimal strategy for thermometry requires measuring energy which demands full accessibility over the entire system as well as complex entangled measurement basis. In this paper, we take a different approach and show that single qubit sequential measurements in the computational basis not only allows precise thermometry of a many-body system but may also achieve precision beyond the theoretical bound, avoiding demanding energy measurements at equilibrium. To obtain such precision, the time between the two subsequent measurements should be smaller than the thermalization time so that the probe never thermalizes. Therefore, the non-equilibrium dynamics of the system continuously imprint information about temperature in the state of the probe. This allows the sequential measurement scheme to reach precision beyond the accuracy achievable by complex energy measurements on equilibrium probes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear-ancilla aided quantum algorithm for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that uses a single ancilla qubit that can evolve nonlinearly, and show how to use it to efficiently solve generic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations, including nonlocal Hartree equations and the Navier-Stokes equation for an irrotational, non-viscous flow. We propose a realization of such nonlinear qubits via spin-spin coupling of neutral atom qubits to a Bose-Einstein condensate. The results suggest that the use of nonlinear ancillas can provide substantial speedups compared to exclusively linear qubit devices.</description>

      <title>Universal correlations in chaotic many-body quantum states: Fock-space formulation of Berrys random wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The apparent randomness of chaotic eigenstates in interacting quantum systems hides subtle correlations dynamically imposed by their finite energy per particle. These correlations are revealed when Berrys approach for chaotic eigenfunctions in single-particle systems is lifted into many-body space. We achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined, these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>Device-independent quantum secret sharing with noise pre-processing and post-selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum secret sharing (QSS) is a fundamental quantum secure communication primitive, which enables a dealer to distribute secret keys to a set of players. Device-independent (DI) QSS can relax the security assumptions about the devices' internal working, and effectively enhance QSS's security under practical experimental conditions. Here, we propose a DI-QSS protocol based on Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state, which guarantees the security of keys by the observation of the data conclusively violating the Svetlichny inequality. We estimate the performance of our DI-QSS protocol in practical noisy communication scenarios by simulating its key generation rate, noise tolerance threshold, and detection efficiency threshold. Moreover, some active improvement strategies, such as the noise pre-processing strategy and post-selection strategy are introduced into the DI-QSS protocol, which can increase its noise tolerance threshold from 7.148% to 8.072%, and reduce the detection efficiency threshold from 96.32% to 94.30%. It indicates that the adoption of the active improvement strategies can enhance DI-QSS's robustness against the noise and photon loss, which can reduce the experimental difficulty and promote DI-QSS's experimental realization. Our work may be a promising guidance for future DI-QSS's experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of excitonic energy transfer in molecular complexes triggered by interaction with laser pulses offers a unique window into the underlying physical processes. The absorbed energy moves through the network of interlinked pigments and in photosynthetic complexes reaches a reaction center. The efficiency and time-scale depend not only on the excitonic couplings, but are also affected by the dissipation of energy to vibrational modes of the molecules. An open quantum system description provides a suitable tool to describe the involved processes and connects the decoherence and relaxation dynamics to measurements of the time-dependent polarization.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature detection of quantum critical points via internal quantum teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the teleportation protocol can be efficiently used to detect quantum critical points using finite temperature data even if all resources needed to its implementation lie within the system under investigation. Contrary to a previous proposal, there is no need to use an external qubit as the input state to be teleported to one of the qubits within the system. Here, we use a pair of nearest neighbor spins from an infinite spin-1/2 chain in equilibrium with a heat bath as the entangled resource of the quantum teleportation protocol and a third adjacent qubit within the chain itself as the input state to be teleported. For several spin chain models subjected to an external magnetic field, we show that the efficiency of the teleportation protocol is severely affected as we cross the quantum critical points associated with those spin chains. This abrupt change in efficiency gives us a clear indication of a quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Dynamics, locality and weak measurements: trajectories and which-way information in the case of a simplified double-slit setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how the interference pattern produced by a quantum particle in Young's double-slit setup builds up -- the "only mystery" of quantum mechanics according to Feynman -- is still a matter of discussion and speculation. Recent works have revisited the possibility of acquiring which-way information based on weak measurements. Weak measurements preserve the interference pattern due to their minimally perturbing character while still leading to a final position detection. Here we investigate a simplified double-slit setup by including weakly coupled pointers. We examine how the information provided by the weak pointers can be interpreted to infer the dynamics within a local picture through "weak trajectories". We contrast our approach with non-local dynamical accounts, such as the modular momentum approach to weak values and the trajectories defined by the de Broglie-Bohm picture.</description>

      <title>Genuine non-Gaussian entanglement of light and quantum coherence for an atom from noisy multiphoton spin-boson interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harnessing entanglement and quantum coherence plays a central role in advancing quantum technologies. In quantum optical light-atom platforms, these two fundamental resources are often associated with a Jaynes-Cummings model description describing the coherent exchange of a photon between an optical resonator mode and a two-level spin. In a generic nonlinear spin-boson system, more photons and more modes will take part in the interactions. Here we consider such a generalisation -- the two-mode multiphoton Jaynes-Cummings (MPJC) model. We show how entanglement and quantum coherence can be optimally generated and subsequently manipulated with it in experimentally accessible parameter regimes. A detailed comparative analysis of this model reveals that nonlinearities within the MPJC interactions produce genuinely non-Gaussian entanglement, devoid of Gaussian contributions, from noisy resources. More specifically, strong coherent sources may be replaced by weaker, incoherent ones, significantly reducing the resource overhead, though at the expense of reduced efficiency. At the same time, increasing the multiphoton order of the MPJC interactions expedites the entanglement generation process, thus rendering the whole generation scheme again more efficient and robust. We further explore the use of additional dispersive spin-boson interactions and Kerr nonlinearities in order to create spin coherence solely from incoherent sources and to enhance the quantum correlations, respectively. As for the latter, somewhat unexpectedly, there is not necessarily an increase in quantum correlations due to the augmented nonlinearity. Towards possible applications of the MPJC model, we demonstrate how to engineer arbitrary NOON states with appropriately chosen experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale quantum circuits are required to exploit the advantages of quantum computers. Present-day quantum computers have become less reliable with increasing depths of quantum circuits. To overcome this limitation, quantum error-correction codes have been introduced. Although the success of quantum error correction codes has been announced in Google[1, 2] and neutral atom[3] quantum computers, there have been no reports on IBM quantum computers showing error suppression owing to its unique heavy-hexagon structure. This structure restricts connectivity, and quantum error-correction codes on IBM quantum computers require flag qubits. Here, we report the successful implementation of a syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum computers. Moreover, we demonstrate its effectiveness by considering the repetition code as a test code among the quantum error-correcting codes. Even though the data qubit is not adjacent to the syndrome qubit, logical error rates diminish exponentially as the distance of the repetition code increases from three to nine. Even when two flag qubits exist between the data and syndrome qubits, the logical error rates decrease as the distance increases similarly. This confirms the successful implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on the IBM quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Iterative Confinement of Ions via the Quantum Zeno Effect: Probing Paradoxical Energy Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon our previously introduced mechanism for ion trapping based on the quantum Zeno effect (QZE), we propose a novel approach to systematically draw ions closer together, solely via quantum measurements. The proposed method involves repeated measurements of the electromagnetic force exerted by ions on an enclosure of conductor plates to confine the ions within an incrementally smaller spatial region, achieved by exploiting the behaviour of the wavefunction at its boundaries. Taking a two-proton system as a case study, we explore the dynamics between the energy gain of the system, attributed to successive QZE measurements, and the energy expended making such measurements. The results reveal a paradox wherein, under specific circumstances, protons appear to accumulate more energy than is seemingly introduced into the system. This peculiarity aligns with prior studies that highlight challenges in energy conservation within quantum mechanics. To verify these observations, we propose an iterative confinement setup that is feasible with current technological capabilities. Confirmation of these findings could offer new insights for applications in quantum physics, including fusion research. Therefore, the proposed novel method of manipulating ions not only harbours considerable potential for diverse applications but also furnishes an additional tool for probing fundamental questions in the field.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Bounded by Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general upper bound to mutual information in terms of the Fisher information. The bound may be further used to derive a lower bound for Bayesian quadratic cost. These two provide alternatives to the Efroimovich and to the van Trees inequality that are useful also for classes of prior distributions where the latter ones give trivial bounds. We illustrate the usefulness of our bounds with a case study in quantum phase estimation. Here, they allow us to adapt to mutual information the known and highly nontrivial bounds for Fisher information in the presence of noise. This nicely complements quantum metrology, since Fisher information is useful to gauge local estimation strategies, whereas mutual information is useful for global strategies.</description>

      <title>Low-density parity-check representation of fault-tolerant quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, quantum algorithms are implemented through quantum circuits capable of error correction. These circuits are typically constructed based on specific quantum error correction codes, with consideration given to the characteristics of the underlying physical platforms. Optimising these circuits within the constraints of today's quantum computing technologies, particularly in terms of error rates, qubit counts, and network topologies, holds substantial implications for the feasibility of quantum applications in the near future. This paper presents a toolkit for designing and analysing fault-tolerant quantum circuits. We introduce a framework for representing stabiliser circuits using classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Each codeword in the representation corresponds to a quantum-mechanical equation regarding the circuit, formalising the correlations utilised in parity checks and delineating logical operations within the circuit. Consequently, the LDPC code provides a means of quantifying fault tolerance and verifying logical operations. We outline the procedure for generating LDPC codes from circuits using the Tanner graph notation, alongside proposing graph-theory tools for constructing fault-tolerant quantum circuits from classical LDPC codes. These findings offer a systematic approach to applying classical error correction techniques in optimising existing fault-tolerant protocols and developing new ones.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of improved reference-frame-independent quantum key distribution over 175km</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reference-frame-independent (RFI) quantum key distribution (QKD) presents promising advantages, especially for mobile-platform-based implementations, as it eliminates the need for active reference frame calibration. While RFI-QKD has been explored in various studies, limitations in key rate and distance persist due to finite data collection. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate an improved RFI-QKD protocol proposed by Zhu \textit{et al.} [Opt. Lett. 47, 4219 (2022)], featuring a statistical quantity for bounding information leaked to Eve that exhibits more insensitivity to statistical fluctuations and more robustness to variations in the reference frame. Taking into account finite-size considerations and potential general attacks, RFI-QKD is implemented over a distance of 175 \si{\kilo\meter} in this work. We believe that our study extends the communication distance achievable by RFI-QKD, thereby constituting a notable advancement for its practical application.</description>

      <title>A de Finetti theorem for quantum causal structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What does it mean for a causal structure to be `unknown'? Can we even talk about `repetitions' of an experiment without prior knowledge of causal relations? And under what conditions can we say that a set of processes with arbitrary, possibly indefinite, causal structure are independent and identically distributed? Similar questions for classical probabilities, quantum states, and quantum channels are beautifully answered by so-called "de Finetti theorems", which connect a simple and easy-to-justify condition -- symmetry under exchange -- with a very particular multipartite structure: a mixture of identical states/channels. Here we extend the result to processes with arbitrary causal structure, including indefinite causal order and multi-time, non-Markovian processes applicable to noisy quantum devices. The result also implies a new class of de Finetti theorems for quantum states subject to a large class of linear constraints, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Application of machine learning to experimental design in quantum mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent advances in machine learning hold great promise for the fields of quantum sensing and metrology. With the help of reinforcement learning, we can tame the complexity of quantum systems and solve the problem of optimal experimental design. Reinforcement learning is a powerful model-free technique that allows an agent, typically a neural network, to learn the best strategy to reach a certain goal in a completely a priori unknown environment. However, in general, we know something about the quantum system with which the agent is interacting, at least that it follows the rules of quantum mechanics. In quantum metrology, we typically have a model for the system, and only some parameters of the evolution or the initial state are unknown. We present here a general machine learning technique that can optimize the precision of quantum sensors, exploiting the knowledge we have on the system through model-aware reinforcement learning. This framework has been implemented in the Python package qsensoropt, which is able to optimize a broad class of problems found in quantum metrology and quantum parameter estimation. The agent learns an optimal adaptive strategy that, based on previous outcomes, decides the next measurements to perform. We have explored some applications of this technique to NV centers and photonic circuits. So far, we have been able to certify better results than the current state-of-the-art controls for many cases. The machine learning technique developed here can be applied in all scenarios where the quantum system is well-characterized and relatively simple and small. In these cases, we can extract every last bit of information from a quantum sensor by appropriately controlling it with a trained neural network. The qsensoropt software is available on PyPI and can be installed with pip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop methods to find the limits to finite-time single photon extraction from emitter-cavity systems. We first establish analytic upper and lower bounds on the maximum extraction probability from a canonical $\Lambda$-system before developing a numeric method to optimise generic output probabilities from $\Lambda$-systems generalised to multiple ground states. We use these methods to study the limits to finite-time photon extraction and the wavepackets that satisfy them, finding that using an optimised wavepacket ranging between a sinusoidal and exponentially decaying profile can considerably reduce photon duration for a given extraction efficiency. We further optimise the rates of quantum protocols requiring emitter-photon correlation to obtain driving-independent conclusions about the effect of system parameters on success probability. We believe that these results and methods will provide valuable tools and insights for the development of cavity-based single photon sources combining high efficiency and high rate.</description>

      <title>Transport of non-classical light mediated by topological domain walls in a SSH photonic lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in photonics technologies have significantly enhanced their capability to facilitate experiments involving quantum light, even at room temperature. Nevertheless, fully integrating photonic chips that include quantum light sources, effective manipulation and transport of light minimizing losses, and appropriate detection systems remains an ongoing challenge. Topological photonic systems have emerged as promising platforms to protect quantum light properties during propagation, beyond merely preserving light intensity. In this work, we delve into the dynamics of non-classical light traversing a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic lattice with topological domain walls. Our focus centers on how topology influences the quantum properties of light as it moves across the array. By precisely adjusting the spacing between waveguides, we achieve dynamic repositioning and interaction of domain walls, facilitating effective beam-splitting operations. Our findings demonstrate high-fidelity transport of non-classical light across the lattice, replicating known results that are now safeguarded by the topology of the system. This protection is especially beneficial for quantum communication protocols with continuous variable states. Our study enhances the understanding of light dynamics in topological photonic systems and paves the way for high-fidelity, topology-protected quantum communication.</description>

Abstract: In this work we first show a simple approach to constructing non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with a real spectrum, which are \textit{not} obtained by a non-unitary transformation such as the imaginary gauge transformation. They are given, instead, by the product of a Hermitian Hamiltonian $H_0$ and a positive semi-definite matrix $A$. Depending on whether $A$ has zero eigenvalue(s), the resulting $H$ can possess an exceptional point at zero energy. When $A$ is only required to be Hermitian instead, the resulting $H$ is pseudo-Hermitian that can have real and complex conjugate energy levels. In the special case where $A$ is diagonal, we compare our approach to an imaginary gauge transformation, which reveals a selective non-Hermitian skin effect in our approach, i.e., only the zero mode is a skin mode and the non-zero modes reside in the bulk. We further show that this selective non-Hermitian skin mode has a much lower lasing threshold than its counterpart in the standard non-Hermitian skin effect with the same spatial profile, when we pump at the boundary where they are localized. The form of our construction can also be found, for example, in dynamical matrices describing coupled frictionless harmonic oscillators with different masses.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Quantum and Hybrid Solvers for Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Academic and industrial sectors have been engaged in a fierce competition to develop quantum technologies, fueled by the explosive advancements in quantum hardware. While universal quantum computers have been shown to support up to hundreds of qubits, the scale of quantum annealers has reached three orders of magnitude (i.e., thousands of qubits). Therefore, quantum algorithms are becoming increasingly popular in a variety of fields, with optimization being one of the most prominent. This work aims to explore the topic of quantum optimization by comprehensively evaluating the technologies provided by D-Wave Systems. To do so, a model for the energy optimization of data centers is proposed as a benchmark. D-Wave quantum and hybrid solvers are compared, in order to identify the most suitable one for the considered application. To highlight its advantageous performance capabilities and associated solving potential, the selected D-Wave hybrid solver is then contrasted with CPLEX, a highly efficient classical solver.</description>

      <title>Verification of Quantum Computations without Trusted Preparations or Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of delegated quantum computing as a service, verifying quantum computations is becoming a question of great importance. Existing information theoretically Secure Delegated Quantum Computing (SDQC) protocols require the client to possess the ability to perform either trusted state preparations or measurements. Whether it is possible to verify universal quantum computations with information-theoretic security without trusted preparations or measurements was an open question so far. In this paper, we settle this question in the affirmative by presenting a modular, composable, and efficient way to turn known verification schemes into protocols that rely only on trusted gates.
  Our first contribution is an extremely lightweight reduction of the problem of quantum verification for BQP to the trusted application of single-qubit rotations around the Z axis and bit flips. The second construction presented in this work shows that it is generally possible to information-theoretically verify arbitrary quantum computations with quantum output without trusted preparations or measurements. However, this second protocol requires the verifier to perform multi-qubit gates on a register whose size is independent of the size of the delegated computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Synchronization in Nonconservative Electrical Circuits with Kirchhoff-Heisenberg Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum synchronization phenomena in electrical circuits that incorporate specifically designed nonconservative elements. A dissipative theory of classical and quantized electrical circuits is developed based on the Rayleigh dissipation function. The introduction of this framework enables the formulation of a generalized version of classical Poisson brackets, which are termed Poisson-Rayleigh brackets. By using these brackets, we are able to derive the equations of motion for a given circuit. Remarkably, these equations are found to correspond to Kirchhoff's current laws when Kirchhoff's voltage laws are employed to impose topological constraints, and vice versa. In the quantum setting, the equations of motion are referred to as the Kirchhoff-Heisenberg equations, as they represent Kirchhoff's laws within the Heisenberg picture. These Kirchhoff-Heisenberg equations, serving as the native equations for an electrical circuit, can be used in place of the more abstract master equations in Lindblad form. To validate our theoretical framework, we examine three distinct circuits. The first circuit consists of two resonators coupled via a nonconservative element. The second circuit extends the first to incorporate weakly nonlinear resonators, such as transmons. Lastly, we investigate a circuit involving two resonators connected through an inductor in series with a resistor. This last circuit, which incidentally represents a realistic implementation, allows for the study of a singular system, where the absence of a coordinate leads to an ill-defined system of Hamilton's equations. To analyze such a pathological circuit, we introduce the concept of auxiliary circuit element. After resolving the singularity, we demonstrate that this element can be effectively eliminated at the conclusion of the analysis, recuperating the original circuit.</description>

      <title>Quantum States Seen by a Probe: Partial Trace Over a Region of Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The partial trace operation is usually considered in composite quantum systems, to reduce the state on a single subsystem. This operation has a key role in the decoherence effect and quantum measurements. However, partial trace operations can be defined in more generic situations. In particular, it can be used to restrict a quantum state (for a single or several quantum entities) on a specific region of space, the rest of the universe being treated as an environment. The reduced state is then interpreted as the state that can be detected by an ideal probe with a limited spatial extent. In this paper, such an operation is investigated for systems defined on a Fock Hilbert space. A generic expression of the reduced density matrix is computed, and it is applied to several case studies: eigenstates of the number operator, coherent states, and thermal states. These states admit very different behaviors. In particular, (i) a decoherence effect happens on eigenstates of the number operator (ii) coherent or thermal states remain coherent or thermal, but with an amplitude/temperature reduced non-trivially by the overlap between the field and the region of interest.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing exposes the brilliance of quantum mechanics through computer science and, as such, gives oneself a marvelous and exhilarating journey to go through. This article leads along that journey with a historical and current outlook on quantum computation that is geared toward computer experts but also to experts from other disciplines as well. It is an article that will bridge the vast gap between classical and quantum computation and open an entering wedge through which one will be able to both bring himself up to speed on quantum computation and, intrinsically, in a straightforward manner, become acquainted with it. We are indeed in luck to be living in an age where computing is being reinvented, and not only seeing history in the making firsthand but, in fact, having the opportunity to be the ones who are reinventing--and that is quite a thought.</description>

      <title>Solving deep-learning density functional theory via variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning models, chiefly deep neural networks, have revealed suited to learn accurate energy-density functionals from data. However, problematic instabilities have been shown to occur in the search of ground-state density profiles via energy minimization. Indeed, any small noise can lead astray from realistic profiles, causing the failure of the learned functional and, hence, strong violations of the variational property. In this article, we employ variational autoencoders to build a compressed, flexible, and regular representation of the ground-state density profiles of various quantum models. Performing energy minimization in this compressed space allows us to avoid both numerical instabilities and variational biases due to excessive constraints. Our tests are performed on one-dimensional single-particle models from the literature in the field and, notably, on a three-dimensional disordered potential. In all cases, the ground-state energies are estimated with errors below the chemical accuracy and the density profiles are accurately reproduced without numerical artifacts.</description>

      <title>Doppler-free three-photon spectroscopy on narrow-line optical transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent Doppler-free three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ optical clock transition and the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ intercombination transition in free-space thermal clouds of $^{88}$Sr atoms. By appropriate orientation of the wavevectors of three lasers incident on the atoms, the first-order Doppler shift can be eliminated for all velocity classes. Three-photon excitation of the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transition enables high-contrast Ramsey spectroscopy with interrogation times comparable to the 21$\mu$s natural lifetime using a single near-resonant laser source. Three-photon spectroscopy on the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ clock transition, using only laser frequencies nearly resonant with the $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{0}$ and $^{1}S_{0}$$\leftrightarrow$$^{3}P_{1}$ transitions, enables a reduction in Doppler broadening by two orders of magnitude and a corresponding $\sim470$Hz linewidth without a confining potential.</description>

      <title>Topological frequency conversion in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that rhombohedral multilayer graphene supports topological frequency conversion, whereby a fraction of electrons transfer energy between two monochromatic light sources at a quantized rate. The pristine nature and gate tunability of these materials, along with a Berry curvature that directly couples to electric fields, make them ideal platforms for the experimental realization of topological frequency conversion. Among the rhombohedral family, we find that Bernal bilayer graphene appears most promising for THz-scale applications due to lower dissipation. We discuss strategies to circumvent cancellations between the two valleys of graphene and to minimize dissipative losses using commensurate frequencies, thus opening a potential pathway for net amplification.</description>

      <title>SO(n) AKLT Chains as Symmetry Protected Topological Quantum Ground States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis studies a pair of symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases which arise when considering one-dimensional quantum spin systems possessing a natural orthogonal group symmetry. Particular attention is given to a family of exactly solvable models whose ground states admit a matrix product state description and generalize the AKLT chain. We call these models ``$SO(n)$ AKLT chains'' and the phase they occupy the ``$SO(n)$ Haldane phase''. We present new results describing their ground state structure and, when $n$ is even, their peculiar $O(n)$-to-$SO(n)$ symmetry breaking. We also prove that these states have arbitrarily large correlation and injectivity length by increasing $n$, but all have a 2-local parent Hamiltonian, in contrast to the natural expectation that the interaction range of a parent Hamiltonian should diverge as these quantities diverge. We extend Ogata's definition of an SPT index for a split state for a finite symmetry group $G$ to an SPT index for a compact Lie group $G$. We then compute this index, which takes values in the second Borel group cohomology $H^2(SO(n),U(1))$, at a single point in each of the SPT phases. The two points have different indices, confirming the two SPT phases are indeed distinct. Chapter 1 contains an introduction with a detailed overview of the contents of this thesis, which includes several chapters of background information before presenting new results in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8.</description>

      <title>Sensing Aharonov--Bohm phase using a multiply-orbiting-ion interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometers, which are built using spatially propagating light or matter waves, are commonly used to measure physical quantities. These measurements are made possible by exploiting the interference between waves traveling along different paths. This study introduces a novel approach to sensing of the Aharonov--Bohm phase, an ion matter-wave interferometer operating within a two-dimensional circular trajectory in a trap potential. The ion orbitals in the potential form Lissajous curves, causing the direction of ion rotation to reverse. This reversal results in a corresponding change in the interference phase. Our study is groundbreaking as it is the first attempt to utilize propagating matter waves of an ion in constructing an interferometer for the measurement of physical quantities. Given that the scale factor of the interferometer to the cyclotron motion and the rotation of the system is common, the sensitivity to the Aharonov--Bohm phase in this study corresponds to a rotation sensitivity of approximately 300~rad/s. Besides advancing interferometry, our work also lays the foundation for future research into the use of ion matter waves in gyroscopic applications.</description>

Abstract: We give a corrected proof that if PP $\subseteq$ BQP/qpoly, then the Counting Hierarchy collapses, as originally claimed by Aaronson CCC'06 arXiv:cs/0504048. This recovers the related unconditional claim that PP does not have circuits of any fixed size $n^k$ even with quantum advice. We do so by proving that YQP*, an oblivious version of (QMA $\cap$ coQMA), is contained in APP, and so is PP-low.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantum many-body systems in one dimension, computational complexity theory reveals that the evaluation of ground-state energy remains elusive on quantum computers, contrasting the existence of a classical algorithm for temperatures higher than the inverse logarithm of the system size. This highlights a qualitative difference between low- and high-temperature states in terms of computational complexity. Here, we describe finite-temperature states using the matrix product state formalism. Within the framework of random samplings, we derive an analytical formula for the required number of samples, which provides both quantitative and qualitative measures of computational complexity. At high and low temperatures, its scaling behavior with system size is linear and quadratic, respectively, demonstrating a distinct crossover between these numerically difficult regimes of quantitative difference.</description>

      <title>A single-photon large-momentum-transfer atom interferometry scheme for Sr/Yb atoms with application to determining the fine-structure constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading experimental determinations of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, currently rely on atomic photon-recoil measurements from Ramsey-Bord\'e atom interferometry with large momentum transfer to provide an absolute mass measurement. We propose an experimental scheme for an intermediate-scale differential atom interferometer to measure the photon-recoil of neutral atomic species with a single-photon optical clock transition. We calculate trajectories for our scheme that optimise the recoil phase while nullifying the undesired gravity gradient phase by considering independently launching two clouds of ultracold atoms with the appropriate initial conditions. For Sr and Yb, we find an atom interferometer of height 3m to be sufficient for an absolute mass measurement precision of $\Delta m / m \sim 1\times 10^{-11}$ with current technology. Such a precise measurement (the first of its kind for Sr or Yb) would yield a factor of two reduction in the uncertainty of $\alpha$ -- an uncertainty that would no longer be limited by an absolute mass measurement. The removal of this bound facilitates reducing the uncertainty in $\alpha$ by a factor of 10 with improvements in relative mass measurements, thus paving the way for higher-precision tests of the Standard Model of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Exact time-evolving scattering states in open quantum-dot systems with an interaction: Discovery of time-evolving resonant states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study exact time-evolving many-electron states of an open double quantum-dot system with an interdot Coulomb interaction. A systematic construction of the time-evolving states for arbitrary initial conditions is proposed. For any initial states of one- and two-electron plane waves on the electrical leads, we obtain exact solutions of the time-evolving scattering states, which converge to known stationary scattering eigenstates in the long-time limit. For any initial states of localized electrons on the quantum dots, we find exact time-evolving states of a new type, which we refer to as time-evolving resonant states. In contrast to stationary resonant states, whose wave functions spatially diverge and not normalizable, the time-evolving resonant states are normalizable since their wave functions are restricted to a finite space interval due to causality. The exact time-evolving resonant states enable us to calculate the time-dependence of the survival probability of electrons on the quantum dots for the system with the linearized dispersions. It decays exponentially in time on one side of an exponential point of resonance energies while, on the other side, it oscillates during the decay as a result of the interference of the two resonance energies.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center in diamond is an increasingly popular quantum sensor for microscopy of electrical current, magnetization, and spins. However, efficient NV-sample integration with a robust, high-quality interface remains an outstanding challenge to realize scalable, high-throughput microscopy. In this work, we characterize a diamond micro-chip (DMC) containing a (111)-oriented NV ensemble; and demonstrate its utility for high-resolution quantum microscopy. We perform strain imaging of the DMC and find minimal detrimental strain variation across a field-of-view of tens of micrometer. We find good ensemble NV spin coherence and optical properties in the DMC, suitable for sensitive magnetometry. We then use the DMC to demonstrate wide-field microscopy of electrical current, and show that diffraction-limited quantum microscopy can be achieved. We also demonstrate the deterministic transfer of DMCs with multiple materials of interest for next-generation electronics and spintronics. Lastly, we develop a polymer-based technique for DMC placement. This work establishes the DMC's potential to expand the application of NV quantum microscopy in materials, device, geological, biomedical, and chemical sciences.</description>

      <title>Microscopic understanding of NMR signals by dynamic mean-field theory for spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recently developed dynamic mean-field theory for disordered spins (spinDMFT) is shown to capture the spin dynamics of nuclear spins very well. The key quantities are the spin autocorrelations. In order to compute the free induction decay (FID), pair correlations are needed in addition. They can be computed on spin clusters of moderate size which are coupled to the dynamic mean fields determined in a first step by spinDMFT. We dub this versatile approach non-local spinDMFT (nl-spinDMFT). It is a particular asset of nl-spinDMFT that one knows from where the contributions to the FID stem. We illustrate the strengths of nl-spinDMFT in comparison to experimental data for CaF$_2$. Furthermore, spinDMFT provides the dynamic mean-fields explaining the FID of the nuclear spins in $^{13}$C in adamantane up to some static noise. The spin Hahn echo in adamantane is free from effects of static noise and agrees excellently with the spinDMFT results without further fitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian relations and positive affine Lagrangian relations. The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.
  The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. We interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.10908v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide more sample-efficient versions of some basic routines in quantum data analysis, along with simpler proofs. Particularly, we give a quantum "Threshold Search" algorithm that requires only $O((\log^2 m)/\epsilon^2)$ samples of a $d$-dimensional state $\rho$. That is, given observables $0 \le A_1, A_2, ..., A_m \le 1$ such that $\mathrm{tr}(\rho A_i) \ge 1/2$ for at least one $i$, the algorithm finds $j$ with $\mathrm{tr}(\rho A_j) \ge 1/2-\epsilon$. As a consequence, we obtain a Shadow Tomography algorithm requiring only $\tilde{O}((\log^2 m)(\log d)/\epsilon^4)$ samples, which simultaneously achieves the best known dependence on each parameter $m$, $d$, $\epsilon$. This yields the same sample complexity for quantum Hypothesis Selection among $m$ states; we also give an alternative Hypothesis Selection method using $\tilde{O}((\log^3 m)/\epsilon^2)$ samples.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of noise channels on the quality of unitary t-designs</title>

Abstract: Unitary t-designs have a wide variety of applications in quantum information theory, such as quantum data encryption and randomised benchmarking. However, experimental realisations of t-designs are subject to noise. Here we investigate the effect of noise channels on the quality of single-qubit t-designs. The noise channels we study are bit flips, phase flips, bit and phase flips, phase damping, amplitude damping, and depolarising noise. We consider two noise models: the first has noise applied before the t-design unitary operations, while the second has noise applied after the unitary operations. We show that the single-qubit 1-design is affected only by amplitude damping, while numeric results obtained for the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-designs suggest that a 2t-design is significantly more sensitive to noise than a (2t-1)-design and that, with the exception of amplitude damping, a (2t+1)-design is as sensitive to noise as a 2t-design. Numeric results also reveal substantial variations in sensitivity to noise throughout the Bloch sphere. In particular, t-designs appear to be most sensitive to noise when acting on pure states and least sensitive to noise for the maximally mixed state. For depolarising noise, we show that our two noise models are equivalent, and for the other noise channels, numeric results obtained for the model where noise is applied after the unitaries reflect the transformation of the noise channel into a depolarising channel, an effect exploited in randomised benchmarking with 2-designs.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Picture of Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.09314v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although local Hamiltonians exhibit local time dynamics, this locality is not explicit in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture in the sense that the wavefunction amplitudes do not obey a local equation of motion. We show that geometric locality can be achieved explicitly in the equations of motion by "gauging" the global unitary invariance of quantum mechanics into a local gauge invariance. That is, expectation values $\langle \psi|A|\psi \rangle$ are invariant under a global unitary transformation acting on the wavefunction $|\psi\rangle \to U |\psi\rangle$ and operators $A \to U A U^\dagger$, and we show that it is possible to gauge this global invariance into a local gauge invariance. To do this, we replace the wavefunction with a collection of local wavefunctions $|\psi_J\rangle$, one for each patch of space $J$. The collection of spatial patches is chosen to cover the space; e.g. we could choose the patches to be single qubits or nearest-neighbor sites on a lattice. Local wavefunctions associated with neighboring pairs of spatial patches $I$ and $J$ are related to each other by dynamical unitary transformations $U_{IJ}$. The local wavefunctions are local in the sense that their dynamics are local. That is, the equations of motion for the local wavefunctions $|\psi_J\rangle$ and connections $U_{IJ}$ are explicitly local in space and only depend on nearby Hamiltonian terms. (The local wavefunctions are many-body wavefunctions and have the same Hilbert space dimension as the usual wavefunction.) We call this picture of quantum dynamics the gauge picture since it exhibits a local gauge invariance. The local dynamics of a single spatial patch is related to the interaction picture, where the interaction Hamiltonian consists of only nearby Hamiltonian terms. We can also generalize the explicit locality to include locality in local charge and energy densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Present-day quantum devices require precise implementation of desired quantum channels. To characterize the quality of implementation one uses the average operation fidelity $F$, defined as the fidelity between an initial pure state and its image with respect to the analyzed operation, averaged over an ensemble of pure states. We analyze statistical properties of the operation fidelity for low-dimensional channels and study its extreme values and probability distribution, both of which can be used for statistical channel discrimination. These results are obtained with help of the joint numerical range of the set of Kraus operators representing a channel. Analytic expressions for the density $P\left(F\right)$ are derived in some particular cases including unitary and mixed unitary channels as well as quantum maps represented by commuting Kraus operators. Measured distributions of operation fidelity can be used to distinguish between two quantum operations.</description>

Abstract: Dissipation induced by interactions with an external environment typically hinders the performance of quantum computation, but in some cases can be turned out as a useful resource. We show the potential enhancement induced by dissipation in the field of quantum reservoir computing introducing tunable local losses in spin network models. Our approach based on continuous dissipation is able not only to reproduce the dynamics of previous proposals of quantum reservoir computing, based on discontinuous erasing maps but also to enhance their performance. Control of the damping rates is shown to boost popular machine learning temporal tasks as the capability to linearly and non-linearly process the input history and to forecast chaotic series. Finally, we formally prove that, under non-restrictive conditions, our dissipative models form a universal class for reservoir computing. It means that considering our approach, it is possible to approximate any fading memory map with arbitrary precision.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting coupler architecture demonstrates great potential for scalable and high-performance quantum processors, yet how to design efficiently and automatically 'Qubit-Coupler-Qubit (QCQ)' of high performance from the layout perspective remains obscure. In this work, this issue is studied for the first time resulting in three key findings. Firstly, we acquire the crucial zero-coupling condition that is only dependent on the geometric design of the layout. Secondly, the upper bound of the qubit-qubit effective coupling is found as $0.0822~ \omega_l/\beta_s^2$ which surprisingly depends only on the artificially pre-decided quantities $\omega_l, \beta_s$ instead of specific layouts. Thirdly, we propose an optimal layout design procedure to reach the very upper bound, leading to efficient and high-performance layout design. The effectiveness of the procedure has been demonstrated scrupulously using electromagnetic simulation experiments. As a stirring application, we report a state-of-the-art 3202 um long-range and scalable QCQ layout that is especially crucial to quantum error correction. Our work provides practical guides to optimize the performance of the existing coupler architecture, find out novel layouts, and further advance the progress of quantum chip design automation.</description>

      <title>Assessment of error variation in high-fidelity two-qubit gates in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity entangling operations between qubits consistently is essential for the performance of multi-qubit systems and is a crucial factor in achieving fault-tolerant quantum processors. Solid-state platforms are particularly exposed to errors due to materials-induced variability between qubits, which leads to performance inconsistencies. Here we study the errors in a spin qubit processor, tying them to their physical origins. We leverage this knowledge to demonstrate consistent and repeatable operation with above 99% fidelity of two-qubit gates in the technologically important silicon metal-oxide-semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot platform. We undertake a detailed study of these operations by analysing the physical errors and fidelities in multiple devices through numerous trials and extended periods to ensure that we capture the variation and the most common error types. Physical error sources include the slow nuclear and electrical noise on single qubits and contextual noise. The identification of the noise sources can be used to maintain performance within tolerance as well as inform future device fabrication. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of qubit design, feedback systems, and robust gates on implementing scalable, high-fidelity control strategies. These results are achieved by using three different characterization methods, we measure entangling gate fidelities ranging from 96.8% to 99.8%. Our analysis tools identify the causes of qubit degradation and offer ways understand their physical mechanisms. These results highlight both the capabilities and challenges for the scaling up of silicon spin-based qubits into full-scale quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: We developed an inductive energy participation ratio (IEPR) method and a streamlined procedure for simulating and verifying superconducting quantum chips. These advancements are increasingly vital in the context of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computing. Our approach efficiently extracts the key linear and nonlinear characteristic parameters, as well as the Hamiltonian of a quantum chip layout. In theory, the IEPR method provides insights into the relationship between energy distribution and representation transformation. We demonstrate its practicality by applying it to quantum chip layouts, efficiently obtaining crucial characteristic parameters in both bare and normal representations-an endeavor that challenges existing methods. Our work holds the promise of significant enhancements in simulation and verification techniques and represents a pivotal step towards quantum electronic design automation.</description>

Abstract: We present a single-photon-sensitive spectrometer, based on a linear array of 512 single-photon avalanche diode detectors, with 0.04 nm spectral and 40 ps temporal resolutions. We employ a fast data-driven operation that allows direct measurement of time and frequency for simultaneous single photons, time- and frequency-stamping each single-photon detection. Our results combine excellent temporal and spectral resolution. We benchmark our result against the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle limit of hbar/2 for time and energy, and we are only a factor of 10 above it, despite the simplicity of our experimental setup, including room temperature operation. This work opens numerous applications in both classical and quantum photonics, especially when both spectral and temporal properties of single photons are exploited.</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation via engineered ancilla resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08641v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this theoretical investigation, we study the effectiveness of a protocol that incorporates periodic quantum resetting to prepare ground states of frustration-free parent Hamiltonians. This protocol uses a steering Hamiltonian that enables local coupling between the system and ancillary degrees of freedom. At periodic intervals, the ancillary system is reset to its initial state. For infinitesimally short reset times, the dynamics can be approximated by a Lindbladian whose steady state is the target state. For finite reset times, however, the spin chain and the ancilla become entangled between reset operations. To evaluate the performance of the protocol, we employ Matrix Product State simulations and quantum trajectory techniques, focusing on the preparation of the spin-1 Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state. Our analysis considers convergence time, fidelity, and energy evolution under different reset intervals. Our numerical results show that ancilla system entanglement is essential for faster convergence. In particular, there exists an optimal reset time at which the protocol performs best. Using a simple approximation, we provide insights into how to optimally choose the mapping operators applied to the system during the reset procedure. Furthermore, the protocol shows remarkable resilience to small deviations in reset time and dephasing noise. Our study suggests that stroboscopic maps using quantum resetting may offer advantages over alternative methods, such as quantum reservoir engineering and quantum state steering protocols, which rely on Markovian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Concrete Quantum Channels and Algebraic Structure of Abstract Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article analyzes the algebraic structure of the set of all quantum channels and its subset consisting of quantum channels that have Holevo representation. The regularity of these semigroups under composition of mappings are analysed. It is also known that these sets are compact convex sets and, therefore, rich in geometry. An attempt is made to identify generalized invertible channels and also the idempotent channels. When channels are of the Holevo type, these two problems are fully studied in this article. The motivation behind this study is its applicability to the reversibility of channel transformations and recent developments in resource-destroying channels, which are idempotents. This is related to the coding-encoding problem in quantum information theory. Several examples are provided, with the main examples coming from pre-conditioner maps which assigns preconditioners to matrices, in numerical linear algebra.Thus the known pre-conditioner maps are viewd as a quantum-channel in finite dimentions.</description>

The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are popular variational approaches that are considered the most viable solutions in the noisy-intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. Here, we study the scaling of the quantum resources, defined as the required number of circuit repetitions, to reach a fixed success probability as the problem size increases, focusing on the role played by measurement shot noise, which is unavoidable in realistic implementations. Simple and reproducible problem instances are addressed, namely, the ferromagnetic and disordered Ising chains. Our results show that: (i) VQE with the standard heuristic ansatz scales comparably to direct brute-force search when energy-based optimizers are employed. The performance improves at most quadratically using a gradient-based optimizer. (ii) When the parameters are optimized from random guesses, also the scaling of QAOA implies problematically long absolute runtimes for large problem sizes. (iii) QAOA becomes practical when supplemented with a physically-inspired initialization of the parameters. Our results suggest that hybrid quantum-classical algorithms should possibly avoid a brute force classical outer loop, but focus on smart parameters initialization.</description>

Abstract: Observational entropy captures both the intrinsic uncertainty of a thermodynamic state and the lack of knowledge due to coarse-graining. We demonstrate two interpretations of observational entropy, one as the statistical deficiency resulting from a measurement, the other as the difficulty of inferring the input state from the measurement statistics by quantum Bayesian retrodiction. These interpretations show that the observational entropy implicitly includes a uniform reference prior. Since the uniform prior cannot be used when the system is infinite-dimensional or otherwise energy-constrained, we propose generalizations by replacing the uniform prior with arbitrary quantum states that may not even commute with the state of the system. We propose three candidates for this generalization, discuss their properties, and show that one of them gives a unified expression that relates both interpretations.</description>

      <title>The cost of solving linear differential equations on a quantum computer: fast-forwarding to explicit resource counts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How well can quantum computers simulate classical dynamical systems? There is increasing effort in developing quantum algorithms to efficiently simulate dynamics beyond Hamiltonian simulation, but so far exact resource estimates are not known. In this work, we provide two significant contributions. First, we give the first non-asymptotic computation of the cost of encoding the solution to general linear ordinary differential equations into quantum states -- either the solution at a final time, or an encoding of the whole history within a time interval. Second, we show that the stability properties of a large class of classical dynamics allow their fast-forwarding, making their quantum simulation much more time-efficient. From this point of view, quantum Hamiltonian dynamics is a boundary case that does not allow this form of stability-induced fast-forwarding. In particular, we find that the history state can always be output with complexity $O(T^{1/2})$ for any stable linear system. We present a range of asymptotic improvements over state-of-the-art in various regimes. We illustrate our results with a family of dynamics including linearized collisional plasma problems, coupled, damped, forced harmonic oscillators and dissipative nonlinear problems. In this case the scaling is quadratically improved, and leads to significant reductions in the query counts after inclusion of all relevant constant prefactors.</description>

      <title>Polarization-based cyclic weak value metrology for angular velocity measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11041v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak measurement has been proven to amplify the detection of changes in meters while discarding most photons due to the low probability of post-selection. Previous power-recycling schemes enable the failed post-selection photons to be repeatedly selected, thus overcoming the inefficient post-selection and increasing the precision of detection. In this study, we focus on the polarization-based weak value angular-velocity measurement and introduce three cyclic methods to enhance the accuracy of detecting time shift in a Gaussian beam: power recycling, signal recycling, and dual recycling schemes. By incorporating one or two partially transmitting mirrors into the system, both the power and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the detected light are substantially enhanced. Compared to non-polarization schemes, polarization-based approaches offer several advantages, including lower optical loss, unique cyclic directions, and a wider optimal region. These features effectively reduce crosstalk among different light paths and theoretically eliminate the walk-off effect, thus yielding improvements in both theoretical performance and application.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of the Hexagonal Lattice in Two-Dimensional Wigner Fragments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At very low density, the electrons in a uniform electron gas spontaneously break symmetry and form a crystalline lattice called a Wigner crystal. But which type of crystal will the electrons form? We report a numerical study of the density profiles of fragments of Wigner crystals from first principles. To simulate Wigner fragments we use Clifford periodic boundary conditions and a renormalized distance in the Coulomb potential. Moreover, we show that high-spin restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock theory becomes exact in the low-density limit. We are thus able to accurately capture the localisation in two-dimensional Wigner fragments with many electrons. No assumptions about the positions where the electrons will localise are made. The density profiles we obtain emerge naturally when we minimise the total energy of the system. We clearly observe the emergence of the hexagonal crystal structure which has been predicted to be ground-state structure of the two-dimensional Wigner crystal.</description>

Abstract: Correlated states of light, both classical and quantum, can find useful applications in the implementation of several imaging techniques. Among the employed sources, pseudo-thermal states, generated by the passage of a laser beam through a diffuser, represent the standard choice. To produce light with a higher level of correlation, in this work we consider and characterize the speckled-speckle field obtained with two diffusers using both a numerical simulation and an experimental implementation. In order to discuss the potential usefulness of super-thermal light in imaging protocols, we analyze the behavior of some figures of merit, namely the contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio and the image resolution. The obtained results clarify the possible advantages offered by this kind of light, and at the same time better emphasize the reasons why it does not outperform pseudo-thermal light.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Simulation of a Mixed Spin-Boson Hamiltonian and Its Performance for a Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics Problem</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to broaden the spectrum of possible applications of quantum computers and use their capabilities to investigate effects in cavity quantum electrodynamics ("cavity QED"). Interesting application examples are material properties, multiphoton effects such as superradiance, systems with strong field-matter coupling, and others. For QED applications, experimental studies are challenging, and classical simulations are often expensive. Therefore, exploring the capabilities of quantum computers is of interest. Below we present a methodology for simulating a phase transition in a pair of coupled cavities that permit photon hopping. We map the spin and boson systems to separate parts of the register and use first-order Trotterization to time-propagate the wavefunction. The order parameter, which is the observable for the phase transition, is calculated by measuring the number operator and its square. We introduce a boson-to-qubit mapping to facilitate a multi-photon, multi-atom case study. Our mapping scheme is based on the inverse Holstein-Primakoff transformation. In the multi-photon regime, boson operators are expressed via higher-spin operators which are subsequently mapped on a circuit using Pauli operators. We use a Newton series expansion to enable rigorous treatment of the square root operator. We reproduce the results of classical simulations of a phase transition with a noiseless 6-qubit simulation. We find that the simulation can be performed with a modest amount of quantum resources. Finally, we perform simulations on noisy emulators and find that mitigation techniques are essential to distinguish signal from noise.</description>

      <title>Experimental verification of the steering ellipsoid zoo via two-qubit states</title>

Abstract: Quantum steering ellipsoid visualizes the set of all qubit states that can be steered by measuring on another correlated qubit in the Bloch picture. Together with local reduced states, it provides a faithful geometric characterization of the underlying two-qubit state so that almost all nonclassical state features can be reflected in its geometric properties. Consequently, the various types of quantum ellipsoids with different geometric properties form an ellipsoid zoo, which, in this work, is experimentally verified via measurements on many polarization-path photonic states. By generating two-qubit states with high fidelity, the corresponding ellipsoids are constructed to certify the presence of entanglement, one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering, discord, and steering incompleteness. It is also experimentally verified that the steering ellipsoid can be reconstructed from using the twelve vertices of the icosahedron as measurement directions. Our results aid progress in applying the quantum steering ellipsoid to reveal nonclassical features of the multi-qubit system.</description>

Abstract: Analog quantum simulation is an essential routine for quantum computing and plays a crucial role in studying quantum many-body physics. Typically, the quantum evolution of an analog simulator is largely determined by its physical characteristics, lacking the precise control or versatility of quantum gates. This limitation poses challenges in extracting physical properties on analog quantum simulators, an essential step of quantum simulations. To address this issue, we introduce the Hamiltonian shadow protocol, which uses a single quench Hamiltonian for estimating arbitrary state properties, eliminating the need for ancillary systems and random unitaries. Additionally, we derive the sample complexity of this protocol and show that it performs comparably to the classical shadow protocol. The Hamiltonian shadow protocol does not require sophisticated control and can be applied to a wide range of analog quantum simulators. We demonstrate its utility through numerical demonstrations with Rydberg atom arrays under realistic parameter settings. The new protocol significantly broadens the application of randomized measurements for analog quantum simulators without precise control and ancillary systems.</description>

      <title>EHA: Entanglement-variational Hardware-efficient Ansatz for Eigensolvers</title>

Abstract: Variational quantum eigensolvers (VQEs) are one of the most important and effective applications of quantum computing, especially in the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. There are mainly two ways for VQEs: problem-agnostic and problem-specific. For problem-agnostic methods, they often suffer from trainability issues. For problem-specific methods, their performance usually relies upon choices of initial reference states which are often hard to determine. In this paper, we propose an Entanglement-variational Hardware-efficient Ansatz (EHA), and numerically compare it with some widely used ansatzes by solving benchmark problems in quantum many-body systems and quantum chemistry. Our EHA is problem-agnostic and hardware-efficient, especially suitable for NISQ devices and having potential for wide applications. EHA can achieve a higher level of accuracy in finding ground states and their energies in most cases even compared with problem-specific methods. The performance of EHA is robust to choices of initial states and parameters initialization and it has the ability to quickly adjust the entanglement to the required amount, which is also the fundamental reason for its superiority.</description>

Abstract: We present COGNAC, a novel strategy for compiling quantum circuits based on numerical optimization algorithms from scientific computing. Using a simple noise model informed by the duration of entangling gates, our gradient-based method can quickly converge to a local optimum that closely approximates the target unitary. By iteratively and continuously decreasing a gate's duration to zero, we reduce a circuit's gate count without the need for a large number of explicit elimination rewrite rules. We have implemented this technique as a general-purpose Qiskit compiler plugin and compared performance with state-of-the-art optimizers on a variety of standard 4-qubit benchmarks. COGNAC typically outperforms existing optimizers in reducing 2-qubit gate count, sometimes significantly. Running on a low-end laptop, our plugin takes seconds to optimize a small circuit, making it effective and accessible for a typical quantum programmer.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum information and quantum science have inspired the development of various compact dynamic structured ans\"{a}tze that are expected to be realizable in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. However, such ans\"{a}tze construction strategies hitherto developed involve considerable measurements, and thus they deviate significantly in NISQ platform from their ideal structures. Therefore, it is imperative that the usage of quantum resources must be minimized while retaining the expressivity and dynamical structure of the ansatz that can adapt itself depending on the degree of correlation. We propose a novel ansatz construction strategy based on the \textit{ab-initio} many-body perturbation theory that requires \textit{no} pre-circuit measurement and thus it remains structurally unaffected by any hardware noise. The accuracy and quantum complexity associated with the ansatz are solely dictated by a pre-defined perturbative order as desired and hence are tunable. Furthermore, the underlying perturbative structure of the ansatz construction pipeline enables us to decompose any high-rank excitation that appears in higher perturbative orders into the product of various low-rank operators, and it thus keeps the execution gate-depth to its minimum. With a number of challenging applications on strongly correlated systems, we demonstrate that our ansatz performs significantly better, both in terms of accuracy, parameter count and circuit depth, in comparison to the allied unitary coupled cluster based ans\"{a}tze.</description>

Abstract: Phase estimation is a major mission in quantum metrology. In the finite-dimensional Fock space the NOON state ceases to be optimal when the particle number is fixed yet not equal to the space dimension minus one, and what is the true optimal state in this case is still undiscovered. Hereby we present three theorems to answer this question and provide a complete optimal scheme to realize the ultimate precision limit in practice. These optimal states reveal an important fact that the space dimension could be treated as a metrological resource, and the given scheme is particularly useful in scenarios where weak light or limited particle number is demanded.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits have emerged as a premier platform for large-scale quantum computation, yet the fidelity of state readout is often hindered by random noise and crosstalk, especially in multi-qubit systems. While neural networks trained on labeled data have shown promise in reducing crosstalk effects during readout, their current capabilities are limited to binary discrimination of joint-qubit states due to architectural constraints. Here we introduce a time-resolved modulated neural network capable of full-state tomography for individual qubits, enabling detailed time-resolved measurements like Rabi oscillations. This scalable approach, with a dedicated module per qubit, mitigated readout error by an order of magnitude under low signal-to-noise ratios and substantially reduced variance in Rabi oscillation measurements. This advancement bolsters quantum state discrimination with neural networks, and propels the development of next-generation quantum processors with enhanced performance and scalability.</description>

Abstract: We present a Jordan algebraic formulation of the non-commutative Landau problem coupled to a harmonic potential. To achieve this, an alternative formulation of the Hilbert space version of quantum mechanics is presented. Using this construction, the Hilbert space corresponding to the non-commutative Landau problem is obtained. Non-commutative parameters are then described in terms of an associator in the Jordan algebraic setting. Pure states and density matrices arising from this problem are characterized. This in turn leads us to the Jordan-Schr\"odinger time-evolution equation for the state vectors for this specific problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emitters in high refractive index materials like 4H-SiC suffer from reduced detection of photons because of losses caused by total internal reflection. Thus, integration into efficient nanophotonic structures which couple the emission of photons to a well defined waveguide mode can significantly enhance the photon detection efficiency. In addition, interfacing this waveguide to a classical fiber network is of similar importance to detect the photons and perform experiments. Here, we show a waveguide fiber interface in SiC. By careful measurements we determine efficiencies exceeding 93 % for the transfer of photons from SiC nanobeams to fibers. We use this interface to create a bright single photon source based on waveguide integrated V2 defects in 4H-SiC and achieve an overall photon count rate of 181,000 counts/s. We observe and quantify the strain induced shift of the ground state spin states and demonstrate coherent control of the electron spin with a coherence time of T2=42.5 $\rm\mu$s.</description>

Abstract: We introduce harmonization, an ensembling method that combines several "noisy" decoders to generate highly accurate decoding predictions. Harmonized ensembles of MWPM-based decoders achieve lower logical error rates than their individual counterparts on repetition and surface code benchmarks, approaching maximum-likelihood accuracy at large ensemble sizes. We can use the degree of consensus among the ensemble as a confidence measure for a layered decoding scheme, in which a small ensemble flags high-risk cases to be checked by a larger, more accurate ensemble. This layered scheme can realize the accuracy improvements of large ensembles with a relatively small constant factor of computational overhead. We conclude that harmonization provides a viable path towards highly accurate real-time decoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum algorithm for approximating the ground-state in quantum many-body systems, particularly suited for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Our approach integrates Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) with Quantum Gaussian Filters (QGF), utilizing an iterative methodology that discretizes the application of the QGF operator into small, optimized steps through VQE. Demonstrated on the Transverse Field Ising models, our method shows improved convergence speed and accuracy, particularly under noisy conditions, compared to conventional VQE methods. This advancement highlights the potential of our algorithm in effectively addressing complex quantum simulations, marking a significant stride in quantum computing applications within the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emitters in WSe$_2$: The critical role of phonons on excitation schemes and indistinguishability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within optical quantum information processing, single-photon sources based on a two-level system in a semiconductor material allow for on-demand generation of single photons. To initiate the spontaneous emission process, it is necessary to efficiently populate the excited state. However, reconciling the requirement for on-demand excitation with both high efficiency and high photon indistinguishability remains a challenge due to the presence of charge noise and phonon-induced decoherence in the solid-state environment. Here, we propose a method for reconstructing the phonon spectral density experienced by WSe$_{2}$ quantum emitters in the emission process. Using the reconstructed phonon spectral density, we analyze the performance of the resonant, phonon-assisted, and SUPER swing-up excitation schemes. Under resonant excitation, we obtain an exciton preparation fidelity limited to $\sim$0.80 by the strong phonon coupling, which improves to 0.96 for the SUPER scheme (or 0.89, depending on the type of emitter considered). Under near-resonant phonon-assisted excitation, we observe near-unity excitation fidelity up to 0.976 (0.997). Additionally, we demonstrate that, assuming the suppression of the phonon sidebands, residual dephasing mechanisms such as charge/spin fluctuations are the dominating decoherence mechanisms undermining the photon indistinguishability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shadow estimation is a method for deducing numerous properties of an unknown quantum state through a limited set of measurements, which suffers from noises in quantum devices. In this paper, we introduce an error-mitigated shadow estimation approach based on virtual distillation, tailored for applications in near-term quantum devices. Our methodology leverages the qubit reset technique, thereby reducing the associated qubit overhead. Crucially, our approach ensures that the required qubit resources remain independent of the desired accuracy and avoid an exponential measurement overhead, marking a substantial advancement in practical applications. Furthermore, our technique accommodates a mixed Clifford and Pauli-type shadow, which can result in a reduction in the number of required measurements across various scenarios. We also study the trade-off between circuit depth and measurement overhead quantitatively. Through numerical simulations, we substantiate the efficacy of our error mitigation method, establishing its utility in enhancing the robustness of shadow estimations on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Learning interacting fermionic Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently learning an unknown Hamiltonian given access to its dynamics is a problem of interest for quantum metrology, many-body physics and machine learning. A fundamental question is whether learning can be performed at the Heisenberg limit, where the Hamiltonian evolution time scales inversely with the error, $\varepsilon$, in the reconstructed parameters. The Heisenberg limit has previously been shown to be achievable for certain classes of qubit and bosonic Hamiltonians. Most recently, a Heisenberg-limited learning algorithm was proposed for a simplified class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians restricted to real hopping amplitudes and zero chemical potential at all sites, along with on-site interactions. In this work, we provide an algorithm to learn a more general class of fermionic Hubbard Hamiltonians at the Heisenberg limit, allowing complex hopping amplitudes and nonzero chemical potentials in addition to the on-site interactions, thereby including several models of physical interest. The required evolution time across all experiments in our protocol is $\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon)$ and the number of experiments required to learn all the Hamiltonian parameters is $\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(1/\varepsilon))$, independent of system size as long as each fermionic mode interacts with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ other modes. Unlike prior algorithms for bosonic and fermionic Hamiltonians, to obey fermionic parity superselection constraints in our more general setting, our protocol utilizes $\mathcal{O}(N)$ ancillary fermionic modes, where $N$ is the system size. Each experiment involves preparing fermionic Gaussian states, interleaving time evolution with fermionic linear optics unitaries, and performing local occupation number measurements on the fermionic modes. The protocol is robust to a constant amount of state preparation and measurement error.</description>

      <title>A unified diagrammatic approach in Liouville space to quantum transport for bosonic and fermionic reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a diagrammatic approach to quantum transport based on a master equation formalism in Liouville space. It can be applied to linear and nonlinear transport in generic multi-level junctions coupled to bosonic or fermionic reservoirs and presents a convenient perturbation expansion in the strength of the coupling between the reservoirs and the junction. The Redfield theory is recovered at second order, with the partial and full secular master equations discussed. Analytical, approximate expressions are provided up to fourth order for the steady-state boson transport that generalize to multi-level systems the known formula for the low-temperature thermal conductance in the spin-boson model. The formalism is applied to the problem of heat transport in a qubit-resonator junction modeled by the quantum Rabi model. Nontrivial transport features emerge as a result of the interplay between the qubit-oscillator detuning and coupling strength. For quasi-degenerate spectra, nonvanishing steady-state coherences cause a suppression of the thermal conductance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note shows that adaptive strategies do not offer additional advantages for learning and testing Pauli channels with entangled input. First, the tight query complexity of learning Pauli channels with entangled input is established for the general norm $l_p$. In particular, the complexities for the $l_{1}$, $l_2$ and $l_\infty$ norms are improved or matched compared to previous results using entanglement in the literature. We also settle the query complexity to test if Pauli channels are white noise sources across $l_p$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the query complexity of estimating the noise level of a Pauli channel, characterized by the entropy of its error distribution and the count of non-zero probabilities, is $\Theta(4^n/n)$. Further, $\Theta(4^n/n)$ queries are sufficient to estimate the diamond norm between two Pauli channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the path-integral of conformal field theories in $D$ dimensions (CFT$_D$) can be constructed by solving for eigenstates of an RG operator following from the Turaev-Viro formulation of a topological field theory in $D+1$ dimensions (TQFT$_{D+1}$), explicitly realising the holographic sandwich relation between a symmetric theory and a TQFT. Generically, exact eigenstates corresponding to symmetric-TQFT$_D$ follow from Frobenius algebra in the TQFT$_{D+1}$. For $D=2$, we constructed eigenstates that produce 2D rational CFT path-integral exactly, which, curiously connects a continuous field theoretic path-integral with the Turaev-Viro state sum. We also devise and illustrate numerical methods for $D=2,3$ to search for CFT$_D$ as phase transition points between symmetric TQFT$_D$. Finally since the RG operator is in fact an exact analytic holographic tensor network, we compute ``bulk-boundary'' correlator and compare with the AdS/CFT dictionary at $D=2$. Promisingly, they are numerically compatible given our accuracy, although further works will be needed to explore the precise connection to the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Higgs Condensates are Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases: I. Discrete Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Where in the landscape of many-body phases of matter do we place the Higgs condensate of a gauge theory? On the one hand, the Higgs phase is gapped, has no local order parameter, and for fundamental Higgs fields is adiabatically connected to the confined phase. On the other hand, Higgs phases such as superconductors display rich phenomenology. In this work, we propose a minimal description of the Higgs phase as a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase, utilizing conventional and higher-form symmetries. In this first part, we focus on 2+1D $\mathbb Z_2$ gauge theory and find that the Higgs phase is protected by a higher-form magnetic symmetry and a matter symmetry, whose meaning depends on the physical context. While this proposal captures known properties of Higgs phases, it also predicts that the Higgs phase of the Fradkin-Shenker model has SPT edge modes in the symmetric part of the phase diagram, which we confirm analytically. In addition, we argue that this SPT property is remarkably robust upon explicitly breaking the magnetic symmetry. Although the Higgs and confined phases are then connected without a bulk transition, they are separated by a boundary phase transition, which we confirm with tensor network simulations. More generally, the boundary anomaly of the Higgs SPT phase coincides with the emergent anomaly of symmetry-breaking phases, making precise the relation between Higgs phases and symmetry breaking. The SPT nature of the Higgs phase can also manifest in the bulk, e.g., at transitions between distinct Higgs condensates. Finally, we extract insights which are applicable to general SPT phases, such as a 'bulk-defect correspondence' generalizing discrete gauge group analogs of Superconductor-Insulator-Superconductor (SIS) junctions. The sequel to this work will generalize 'Higgs=SPT' to continuous symmetries, interpreting superconductivity as an SPT property.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Connes-Rovelli thermal time associated with the quantum harmonic oscillator can be described as an (unsharp) observable, that is, as a positive operator valued measure. We furthermore present extensions of this result to the free massless relativistic particle in one dimension and to a hypothetical physical system whose equilibrium state is given by the noncommutative integral.</description>

      <title>Disparities in access to US quantum information education</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08629v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven in large part by the National Quantum Initiative Act of 2018, quantum information science (QIS) coursework and degree programs are rapidly spreading across US institutions. Yet prior work suggests that access to quantum workforce education is unequally distributed, disproportionately benefiting students at private research-focused institutions whose student bodies are unrepresentative of US higher education as a whole. We use regression analysis to analyze the distribution of QIS coursework across 456 institutions of higher learning as of fall 2022, identifying statistically significant disparities across institutions in particular along the axes of institution classification, funding, and geographic distribution suggesting today's QIS education programs are largely failing to reach low-income and rural students. We also conduct a brief analysis of the distribution of emerging dedicated QIS degree programs, discovering much the same trends. We conclude with a discussion of implications for educators, policymakers, and education researchers including specific policy recommendations to direct investments in QIS education to schools serving low-income and rural students, leverage existing grassroots diversity and inclusion initiatives that have arisen within the quantum community, and update and modernize procedures for collecting QIS educational data to better track these trends.</description>

      <title>$W$ state is not the unique ground state of any local Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characterization of ground states among all quantum states is an important problem in quantum many-body physics. For example, the celebrated entanglement area law for gapped Hamiltonians has allowed for efficient simulation of 1d and some 2d quantum systems using matrix product states. Among ground states, some types, such as cat states (like the GHZ state) or topologically ordered states, can only appear alongside their degenerate partners, as is understood from the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking. In this work, we introduce a new class of simple states, including the $W$ state, that can only occur as a ground state alongside an exactly degenerate partner, even in gapless or disordered models. We show that these states are never an element of a stable gapped ground state manifold, which may provide a new method to discard a wide range of 'unstable' entanglement area law states in the numerical search of gapped phases. On the other hand when these degenerate states are the ground states of gapless systems they possess an excitation spectrum with $O(1/L^2)$ finite-size splitting. One familiar situation where this special kind of gaplessness occurs is at a Lifshitz transition due to a zero mode; a potential quantum state signature of such a critical point. We explore pathological parent Hamiltonians, and discuss generalizations to higher dimensions, other related states, and implications for understanding thermodynamic limits of many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Maglev for Dark Matter: Dark-photon and axion dark matter sensing with levitated superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultraprecise mechanical sensors offer an exciting avenue for testing new physics. While many of these sensors are tailored to detect inertial forces, magnetically levitated (Maglev) systems are particularly interesting, in that they are also sensitive to electromagnetic forces. In this work, we propose the use of magnetically levitated superconductors to detect dark-photon and axion dark matter through their couplings to electromagnetism. Several existing laboratory experiments search for these dark-matter candidates at high frequencies, but few are sensitive to frequencies below $\mathrm{1\,kHz}$ (corresponding to dark-matter masses $m_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$). As a mechanical resonator, magnetically levitated superconductors are sensitive to lower frequencies, and so can probe parameter space currently unexplored by laboratory experiments. Dark-photon and axion dark matter can source an oscillating magnetic field that drives the motion of a magnetically levitated superconductor. This motion is resonantly enhanced when the dark matter Compton frequency matches the levitated superconductor's trapping frequency. We outline the necessary modifications to make magnetically levitated superconductors sensitive to dark matter, including specifications for both broadband and resonant schemes. We show that in the $\mathrm{Hz}\lesssim f_\mathrm{DM}\lesssim\mathrm{kHz}$ frequency range our technique can achieve the leading sensitivity amongst laboratory probes of both dark-photon and axion dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian in the axial approximation, the transcendental equations determining the hole subband dispersions in a cylindrical Ge nanowire are analytically derived. These equations are more general than that derived using the spherical approximation, and are suitable to study the growth direction dependence of the subband dispersions. The axial approximation almost gives rise to the accurate low-energy subband dispersions for high-symmetry nanowire growth directions [001] and [111]. The perturbation correction from the non-axial term is negligible for these two directions. The lowest two subband dispersions can be regarded as two shifted parabolic curves with an energy gap at $k_{z}=0$ for both growth directions [001] and [111]. At the position of the energy gap, the eigenstates for growth direction [111] are inverted in comparison with the normal eigenstates for growth direction [001]. A nanowire growth direction where the energy gap closes at $k_{z}=0$ is predicted to exist between directions [001] and [111].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14606v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on ultracold dipoles in optical lattices open exciting possibilities for the quantum simulation of extended Hubbard models. When considered in one dimension, these models present at unit filling a particularly interesting ground-state physics, including a symmetry-protected topological phase known as Haldane insulator. We show that the tail of the dipolar interaction beyond nearest-neighbors, which may be tailored by means of the transversal confinement, does not only modify quantitatively the Haldane insulator regime and lead to density waves of larger periods, but results as well in unexpected insulating phases. These insulating phases may be topological or topologically trivial, and are characterized by peculiar correlations of the site occupations. These phases may be realized and observed in state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

      <title>Full leading-order nuclear polarization in highly charged ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear-polarization corrections to the energy levels of highly charged ions are systematically investigated to leading order in the fine-structure constant. To this end, the notion of effective photon propagators with nuclear-polarization insertions is employed, where the nuclear excitation spectrum is calculated by means of the Hartree-Fock-based random-phase approximation. The effective Skyrme force is used to describe the interaction between nucleons, and the model dependence is analyzed. To leading order, the formalism predicts two contributions given by the effective vacuum-polarization and self-energy diagrams. The existing ambiguity around the vacuum-polarization term is resolved by demonstrating that it is effectively absorbed in the standard finite-nuclear-size correction. The self-energy part is evaluated with the full electromagnetic electron-nucleus interaction taken into account, where the importance of the effects of the nuclear three-currents is emphasized.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-Induced Spin Parity Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311</link>

Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model -- an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <title>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Heat transport in the quantum Rabi model: Universality and ultrastrong coupling effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heat transport in the quantum Rabi model at weak interaction with the heat baths is controlled by the qubit-oscillator coupling. Universality of the linear conductance versus the temperature is found for $T\lesssim T_K$, with $T_K$ a coupling-dependent Kondo-like temperature. At low temperature, coherent heat transfer via virtual processes yields a $\sim T^3$ behavior with destructive interference in the presence of quasi-degeneracies in the spectrum. As the temperature increases, incoherent emission and absorption dominate and a maximum is reached at $T\sim T_K/2$. In the presence of a bias on the qubit, the conductance makes a transition from a resonant to a broad, zero-bias peak regime. Parallels and differences are found compared to the spin-boson model in [K. Saito and T. Kato, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{111}, 214301 (2013)], where the qubit-bath coupling instead of the internal qubit-oscillator coupling rules thermal transport.</description>
