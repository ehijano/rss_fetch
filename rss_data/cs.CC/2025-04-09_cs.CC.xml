      <title>CMAT: A Multi-Agent Collaboration Tuning Framework for Enhancing Small Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01663v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural language processing, showcasing impressive performance across various tasks.Despite the significant advancements in LLMs, their effective operation still relies heavily on human input to accurately guide the dialogue flow, with agent tuning being a crucial optimization technique that involves human adjustments to the model for better response to such guidance.Addressing this dependency, our work introduces the TinyAgent model, trained on a meticulously curated high-quality dataset. We also present the Collaborative Multi-Agent Tuning (CMAT) framework, an innovative system designed to augment language agent capabilities through adaptive weight updates based on environmental feedback. This framework fosters collaborative learning and real-time adaptation among multiple intelligent agents, enhancing their context-awareness and long-term memory. In this research, we propose a new communication agent framework that integrates multi-agent systems with environmental feedback mechanisms, offering a scalable method to explore cooperative behaviors. Notably, our TinyAgent-7B model exhibits performance on par with GPT-3.5, despite having fewer parameters, signifying a substantial improvement in the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Power Loss Identification through Physics-Based Thermal Model Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital twins for power electronics require accurate power losses whose direct measurements are often impractical or impossible in real-world applications. This paper presents a novel hybrid framework that combines physics-based thermal modeling with data-driven techniques to identify and correct power losses accurately using only temperature measurements. Our approach leverages a cascaded architecture where a neural network learns to correct the outputs of a nominal power loss model by backpropagating through a reduced-order thermal model. We explore two neural architectures, a bootstrapped feedforward network, and a recurrent neural network, demonstrating that the bootstrapped feedforward approach achieves superior performance while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications. Between the interconnection, we included normalization strategies and physics-guided training loss functions to preserve stability and ensure physical consistency. Experimental results show that our hybrid model reduces both temperature estimation errors (from 7.2+-6.8{\deg}C to 0.3+-0.3{\deg}C) and power loss prediction errors (from 5.4+-6.6W to 0.2+-0.3W) compared to traditional physics-based approaches, even in the presence of thermal model uncertainties. This methodology allows us to accurately estimate power losses without direct measurements, making it particularly helpful for real-time industrial applications where sensor placement is hindered by cost and physical limitations.</description>

      <title>Tight bounds on depth-2 QAC-circuits computing parity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the parity of more than three non-target input bits cannot be computed by QAC-circuits of depth-2, not even uncleanly, regardless of the number of ancilla qubits. This result is incomparable with other recent lower bounds on constant-depth QAC-circuits by Rosenthal [ICTS~2021,arXiv:2008.07470] and uses different techniques which may be of independent interest:
  1. We show that all members of a certain class of multivariate polynomials are irreducible. The proof applies a technique of Shpilka &amp; Volkovich [STOC 2008]. 2. We give a tight-in-some-sense characterization of when a multiqubit CZ gate creates or removes entanglement from the state it is applied to.
  The current paper strengthens an earlier version of the paper [arXiv:2005.12169].</description>

      <title>Matching and Edge Cover in Temporal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are a special class of graphs for which a temporal component is added to edges, that is, each edge possesses a set of times at which it is available and can be traversed. Many classical problems on graphs can be translated to temporal graphs, and the results may differ. In this paper, we define the Temporal Edge Cover and Temporal Matching problems and show that they are NP-complete even when fixing the lifetime or when the underlying graph is a tree. We then describe two FPT algorithms, with parameters lifetime and treewidth, that solve the two problems. We also find lower bounds for the approximation of the two problems and give two approximation algorithms which match these bounds. Finally, we discuss the differences between the problems in the temporal and the static framework.</description>

      <title>More-efficient Quantum Multivariate Mean Value Estimator from Generalized Grover Gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an efficient algorithm for multivariate mean value estimation. Our algorithm outperforms previous work by polylog factors and nearly saturates the known lower bound. We find an algorithm that uses $O\left(n \log \frac{d}{\delta}\right)$ to achieve precision $\frac{\sqrt{\text{tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\lVert \rVert_\infty$ norm and hence $\frac{\sqrt{d \text{ tr } \Sigma}}{n}$ in $\lVert \rVert_2$ norm, where $d$ is the dimension and $\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix. We also presented another algorithm that uses smaller memory but costs an extra $d^\frac{1}{4}$ in complexity. The idea originates from the previous observations that the Grover gate, when generalized to allow for arbitrary phases instead of $\pm 1$, becomes a good mean value estimator in some mathematical notion. The only remaining $\log \frac{d}{\delta}$ as opposed to $\log \frac{1}{\delta}$ is due to the phase estimation primitive we employed, which so far is the only major known method to tackle the problem. Our results demonstrates that our methodology with generalized Grover gate can be used locate the optimal algorithm, without polylog overhead, for different taks relating to mean value estimation.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial bounds for the corners theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group and $A$ be a subset of $G \times G$ which is corner-free, meaning that there are no $x, y \in G$ and $d \in G \setminus \{0\}$ such that $(x, y)$, $(x+d, y)$, $(x, y+d) \in A$. We prove that \[|A| \le |G|^2 \cdot \exp(-(\log |G|)^{\Omega(1)}).\] As a consequence, we obtain polynomial (in the input length) lower bounds on the non-deterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 3-player Number-on-Forehead model. We also obtain the first "reasonable'' lower bounds on the coloring version of the $3$-dimensional corners problem and equivalently the deterministic communication complexity of Exactly-N in the 4-player Number-on-Forehead model.</description>

      <title>Between the deterministic and non-deterministic query complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.09531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider problems that can be solved by asking certain queries. The deterministic query complexity $D(P,n)$ of a problem $P$ is the smallest number of queries needed to ask in order to find the solution with an input of size $n$ (in the worst case), while the non-deterministic query complexity $D_0(P,n)$ is the smallest number of queries needed to ask, in case we know the solution, to prove that it is indeed the solution (in the worst case). Equivalently, $D(P,n)$ is the largest number of queries needed to find the solution in case an Adversary is answering the queries, while $D_0(P)$ is the largest number of queries needed to find the solution in case an Adversary chooses the input. We define a series of quantities between these two values, $D_k(P,n)$ is the largest number of queries needed to find the solution in case an Adversary chooses the input, and answers the queries, but he can change the input at most $k$ times. We give bounds on $D_k(P,n)$ for various problems $P$.</description>

      <title>The membership problem for constant-sized quantum correlations is undecidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.11087v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When two spatially separated parties make measurements on an unknown entangled quantum state, what correlations can they achieve? How difficult is it to determine whether a given correlation is a quantum correlation? These questions are central to problems in quantum communication and computation. Previous work has shown that the general membership problem for quantum correlations is computationally undecidable. In the current work we show something stronger: there is a family of constant-sized correlations -- that is, correlations for which the number of measurements and number of measurement outcomes are fixed -- such that solving the quantum membership problem for this family is computationally impossible. Thus, the undecidability that arises in understanding Bell experiments is not dependent on varying the number of measurements in the experiment. This places strong constraints on the types of descriptions that can be given for quantum correlation sets. Our proof is based on a combination of techniques from quantum self-testing and from undecidability results of the third author for linear system nonlocal games.</description>
