      <title>Bayesian Parameter Inference and Uncertainty-Informed Sensitivity Analysis in a 0D Cardiovascular Model for Intraoperative Hypotension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational cardiovascular models are promising tools for clinical decision support, particularly in complex conditions, such as intraoperative hypotension (IOH). IOH arises from different mechanisms, making treatment selection non-trivial. Patient-specific predictions require calibration, typically performed using deterministic approaches prone to parameter non-identifiability and lacking uncertainty quantification, hindering clinical translation. Consequently, Bayesian approaches are needed that facilitate parameter inference, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification in cardiovascular models.
  We utilize Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate parameter distributions of a cardiovascular lumped parameter model (LPM) across different IOH scenarios. We demonstrate parameter non-uniqueness and its impact on sensitivity indices. We improve parameter reliability by incorporating clinical knowledge and measurement uncertainties. We enable continual learning of the model using sequential parameter updating as new patient data become available. We introduce an uncertainty-aware sensitivity analysis and compare it with a deterministic approach.
  Deterministic calibration yielded many local solutions for IOH, with notably different sensitivities. MCMC distinguished different hypotension scenarios, such as those induced by impaired contractility or hypovolemia. Propagating uncertainties from MCMC through sensitivity analysis provided tighter credible intervals, resulting in more stable parameter rankings than the deterministic approach. The Bayesian approach revealed differences in model behavior and treatment suggestions across patient conditions.
  Combining Bayesian inference with sequential updating and sensitivity analysis improves the reliability and identifiability of parameter estimates, enhancing the clinical utility of LPMs for therapy guidance.</description>

      <title>Design and Validation of Metasurface Transmitarrays for Time-Reversal Microwave Hyperthermia in Deep Brain Tumors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a systematic design of a metasurface-based microwave hyperthermia system, leveraging the time-reversal technique to achieve precise focusing of electromagnetic energy at deep-seated brain tumors. The manuscript includes detailed numerical simulations on realistic and spherical head models, as well as the experimental realization of a quad-layer transmissive metasurface and an electrothermal head phantom. This represents the first experimental demonstration of metasurface-based time-reversal focusing for deep brain hyperthermia, achieving localized heating while minimizing temperature rise in healthy tissue.</description>

      <title>A Noninvasive and Dispersive Framework for Estimating Nonuniform Conductivity of Brain Tumor in Patient-Specific Head Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a noninvasive and dispersive framework for estimating the spatially nonuniform conductivity of brain tumors using MR images. The method consists of two components: (i) voxel-wise assignment of tumor conductivity based on reference values fitted to the Cole-Cole model using empirical data from the literature and (ii) fine-tuning of a deep learning model pretrained on healthy participants. A total of 67 cases, comprising both healthy participants and tumor patients and including 9,806 paired T1- and T2-weighted MR images, were used for training and evaluation. The proposed method successfully estimated patient-specific conductivity maps, exhibiting smooth spatial variations that reflected tissue characteristics, such as edema, necrosis, and rim-associated intensity gradients observed in T1- and T2-weighted MR images. At 10 kHz, case-wise mean conductivity values varied across patients, ranging from 0.132 to 0.512 S/m in the rim (defined as the region within 2 mm of the tumor boundary), from 0.132 to 0.608 S/m in the core (the area inside the rim), and from 0.141 to 0.542 S/m in the entire tumor. Electromagnetic simulations for transcranial magnetic stimulation in individualized head models showed substantial differences in intratumoral field distributions between uniform assignments and the proposed nonuniform maps. Furthermore, this framework demonstrated voxel-wise dispersive mapping at 10 kHz, 1 MHz, and 100 MHz. This framework supports accurate whole-brain conductivity estimation by incorporating both individual anatomical structures and tumor-specific characteristics. Collectively, these results advance patient-specific EM modeling for tumor-bearing brains and lay the groundwork for subsequent microwave-band validation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Stain Mapping in X-ray Virtual Histology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual histology is an emerging field in biomedicine that enables three-dimensional tissue visualization using X-ray micro-computed tomography. However, the method still lacks the specificity of conventional histology, in which parts of the tissue are selectively highlighted using targeted stains. Though some first X-ray stains have been developed to address this issue, their precise location and quantity inside the tissue volume remain largely unknown. In this work, we present a novel approach to virtual histology that simultaneously captures electron number density and X-ray attenuation values through modulation-based X-ray imaging with a structured phase modulator. These complementary measurements enable decomposition of tissue volumes into basis materials, which allows the extraction of three-dimensional maps of molar contrast agent distribution alongside morphological details on the micrometer scale -- here demonstrated on murine kidneys. The concentration values are validated against the established method of K-edge subtraction imaging. We also create a direct bridge from X-ray to visible light imaging by detecting the same stain both using classical histology and our proposed X-ray approach. Our methodology opens new possibilities for biomedical research into disease progression by providing quantitative three-dimensional stain mapping across entire tissue volumes alongside high-contrast morphology, enabling deeper insights into disease mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Non-Intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak Reconstruction of Cardiac Displacement Fields from Sparse MRI-like Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personalized cardiac diagnostics require accurate reconstruction of myocardial displacement fields from sparse clinical imaging data, yet current methods often demand intrusive access to computational models. In this work, we apply the non-intrusive Parametrized-Background Data-Weak (PBDW) approach to three-dimensional (3D) cardiac displacement field reconstruction from limited Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI)-like observations. Our implementation requires only solution snapshots -- no governing equations, assembly routines, or solver access -- enabling immediate deployment across commercial and research codes using different constitutive models. Additionally, we introduce two enhancements: an H-size minibatch worst-case Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (wOMP) algorithm that improves Sensor Selection (SS) computational efficiency while maintaining reconstruction accuracy, and memory optimization techniques exploiting block matrix structures in vectorial problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method through validation on a 3D left ventricular model with simulated scar tissue. Starting with noise-free reconstruction, we systematically incorporate Gaussian noise and spatial sparsity mimicking realistic MRI acquisition protocols. Results show exceptional accuracy in noise-free conditions (relative L2 error of order O(1e-5)), robust performance with 10% noise (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)), and effective reconstruction from sparse measurements (relative L2 error of order O(1e-2)). The online reconstruction achieves four-order-of-magnitude computational speed-up compared to full Finite Element (FE) simulations, with reconstruction times under one tenth of second for sparse scenarios, demonstrating significant potential for integration into clinical cardiac modeling workflows.</description>
