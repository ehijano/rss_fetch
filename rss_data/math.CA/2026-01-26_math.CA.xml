      <title>The Fourier Ratio: A Unifying Measure of Complexity for Recovery, Localization, and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized Fourier ratio, the \(\ell^1/\ell^2\) norm ratio of coefficients in an \emph{arbitrary} orthonormal system, as a single, basis-invariant measure of \emph{effective dimension} that governs fundamental limits across signal recovery, localization, and learning. First, we prove that functions with small Fourier ratio can be stably recovered from random missing samples via \(\ell^1\) minimization, extending and clarifying compressed sensing guarantees for general bounded orthonormal systems. Second, we establish a sharp \emph{localization obstruction}: any attempt to localize recovery to subslices of a product space necessarily inflates the Fourier ratio by a factor scaling with the square root of the slice count, demonstrating that global complexity cannot be distributed locally. Finally, we show that the same parameter controls key complexity-theoretic measures: it provides explicit upper bounds on Kolmogorov rate-distortion description length and on the statistical query (SQ) dimension of the associated function class. These results unify analytic, algorithmic, and learning-theoretic constraints under a single complexity parameter, revealing the Fourier ratio as a fundamental invariant in information-theoretic signal processing.</description>

      <title>Painlev\'e IV, bi-confluent Heun equations and the Hankel determinant generated by a discontinuous semi-classical Laguerre weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discontinuous semi-classical Laguerre weight function with a jump $w(x;t,s)=\mathrm{e}^{-x^2+tx}(A+B\theta(x-s))$, where $x\in\mathbf{R}$, $t,s\ge0$, $A\ge0$, $A+B\ge0$, where $\theta(x)$ is 1 for $x &gt; 0$ and 0 otherwise. Based on the ladder operator approach, we obtain some important difference and differential equations about the auxiliary quantities and the recurrence coefficients. By proper tranformation, It is shown that $R_{n}(t,s)$ is related to Painlev\'{e} IV equations and $r_{n}(t,s)$ satisfies the Chazy II equations. With the aid of Dyson's Coulomb fluid approach, we derive the asymptotic expansions for $\alpha_{n}$ and $\beta_{n}$ as $n\rightarrow\infty$. Furthermore, This enables us to obtain the lagre $n$ behavior of the orthogonal polynomials and derive that they satisfy the biconfluent Heun equation. We also consider the Hankel determinant $D_{n}(t,s)$ generated by the discountinuous semi-classical Laguerre weight. We find that the quantity $\sigma_{n}(t,s)$, allied to the logarithmic derivative of $D_{n}(t,s)$, satisfies the Jimbo-Miwa-Okamoto $\sigma$-form of Painlev\'{e} IV.</description>

      <title>Fourier transforms of bounded functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier transform of a bounded measurable function, $f$, on the real line is shown to be the second distributional derivative of a H\"older continuous function. The Fourier transform is written as the difference of $\int_{-1}^1 e^{-ist}f(t)\,dt$ and the second distributional derivative of the integral $\int_{\lvert{t}\rvert&gt;1}e^{-ist}f(t)\,dt/t^2$. The space of such Fourier transforms is isometrically isomorphic to $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$. There is an exchange theorem, inversion and convolution results. The Fourier transform of the functions $x\mapsto\cos^m(a/x)$ for each natural number $m$ are computed. Also for $x\mapsto x\sin(a/x)$ and $x\mapsto\arctan(x/a)$.</description>

      <title>Aggregate Bounds on the eigenvalues of the principal submatrices of a Hermitian matrix and majorization relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend bounds, proved by R.C. Thompson in 1966, on the sum of the $j$-th largest eigenvalues of the $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ principal matrices of an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. Our bounds are stronger than just summing up Thompson's bounds. We achieve the extensions as a corollary of a more general result giving bounds on the zeros of the generalized derivatives of polynomials with real roots. We use the extended bounds to obtain majorization relationships between the eigenvalues of all $m \times m$ principal matrices of an $n \times n$ Hermitian matrix. These majorization relationships imply both a well-known majorization result by Schur and the well-known Szasz's inequalities.</description>

      <title>A Refinement of Vapnik--Chervonenkis' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vapnik--Chervonenkis' theorem is a seminal result in machine learning. It establishes sufficient conditions for empirical probabilities to converge to theoretical probabilities, uniformly over families of events. It also provides an estimate for the rate of such uniform convergence.
  We revisit the probabilistic component of the classical argument. Instead of applying Hoeffding's inequality at the final step, we use a normal approximation with explicit Berry--Esseen error control. This yields a moderate-deviation sharpening of the usual VC estimate, with an additional factor of order $(\varepsilon\sqrt{n})^{-1}$ in the leading exponential term when $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}$ is large.</description>

      <title>Affine thickness: Patterns and a Gap Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new notion of thickness for subsets of $B[0,1]\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ called affine thickness is defined; this notion of thickness is a generalisation of Falconer-Yavicoli thickness and is adapted to be used in the study of certain sets with affine cut outs. Thick sets are proven to be winning for the matrix potential game introduced in (arXiv:2508.11577) and as an application we can prove that for a thick set, there exists $M\in\mathbb{N}$ depending on the thickness of the set, such that the set contains a homothetic copy of every finite set with at most $M$ elements. Additionally, the author provides a counter-example to the gap lemma in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) for Falconer-Yavicoli thickness, stated in (Math. Z., 2022) proving this result does not hold in the generality stated. We go on to provide a gap lemma for affine thickness in $\mathbb{R}^n$ (for $n\geq 2$) under additional conditions to the classical Newhouse gap lemma.</description>

      <title>Intersections of thick compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.01186v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a definition of thickness in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and obtain a lower bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the intersection of finitely or countably many thick compact sets using a variant of Schmidt's game. As an application we prove that given any compact set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with thickness $\tau$, there is a number $N(\tau)$ such that the set contains a translate of all sufficiently small similar copies of every set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with at most $N(\tau)$ elements; indeed the set of such translations has positive Hausdorff dimension. We also prove a gap lemma and bounds relating Hausdorff dimension and thickness.</description>

      <title>The H\"{o}rmander--Bernhardsson extremal function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the function $\varphi$ of minimal $L^1$ norm among all functions $f$ of exponential type at most $\pi$ for which $f(0)=1$. This function, studied by H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson in 1993, has only real zeros $\pm \tau_n$, $n=1,2, \ldots$. Starting from the fact that $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ is an $\ell^2$ sequence, established in an earlier paper of ours, we identify $\varphi$ in the following way. We factor $\varphi(z)$ as $\Phi(z)\Phi(-z)$, where $\Phi(z)= \prod_{n=1}^\infty(1+(-1)^n\frac{z}{\tau_n})$ and show that $\Phi$ satisfies a certain second order linear differential equation along with a functional equation either of which characterizes $\Phi$. We use these facts to establish an odd power series expansion of $n+\frac12-\tau_n$ in terms of $(n+\frac12)^{-1}$ and a power series expansion of the Fourier transform of $\varphi$, as suggested by the numerical work of H\"{o}rmander and Bernhardsson. The dual characterization of $\Phi$ arises from a commutation relation that holds more generally for a two-parameter family of differential operators, a fact that is used to perform high precision numerical computations.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of bilinear polynomial averages over the primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that on a $\sigma$-finite measure preserving system $X = (X,\nu, T)$, the non-conventional ergodic averages $$ \mathbb{E}_{n \in [N]} \Lambda(n) f(T^n x) g(T^{P(n)} x)$$ converge pointwise almost everywhere for $f \in L^{p_1}(X)$, $g \in L^{p_2}(X)$, and $1/p_1 + 1/p_2 \leq 1$, where $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients of degree at least $2$. This had previously been established with the von Mangoldt weight $\Lambda$ replaced by the constant weight $1$ by the first and third authors with Mirek, and by the M\"obius weight $\mu$ by the fourth author. The proof is based on combining tools from both of these papers, together with several Gowers norm and polynomial averaging operator estimates on approximants to the von Mangoldt function of ''Cram\'er'' and ''Heath-Brown'' type.</description>
