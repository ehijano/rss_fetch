      <title>Tensor decomposition beyond uniqueness, with an application to the minrank problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a generalization to Jennrich's uniqueness theorem for tensor decompositions in the undercomplete setting. Our uniqueness theorem is based on an alternative definition of the standard tensor decomposition, which we call matrix-vector decomposition. Moreover, in the same settings in which our uniqueness theorem applies, we also design and analyze an efficient randomized algorithm to compute the unique minimum matrix-vector decomposition (and thus a tensor rank decomposition of minimum rank).
  As an application of our uniqueness theorem and our efficient algorithm, we show how to compute all matrices of minimum rank (up to scalar multiples) in certain generic vector spaces of matrices.</description>

      <title>Limitation of Quantum Walk Approach to the Maximum Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Matching problem has a quantum query complexity lower bound of $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ for graphs on $n$ vertices represented by an adjacency matrix. The current best quantum algorithm has the query complexity $O(n^{7/4})$, which is an improvement over the trivial bound $O(n^2)$. Constructing a quantum algorithm for this problem with a query complexity improving the upper bound $O(n^{7/4})$ is an open problem. The quantum walk technique is a general framework for constructing quantum algorithms by transforming a classical random walk search into a quantum search, and has been successfully applied to constructing an algorithm with a tight query complexity for another problem. In this work we show that the quantum walk technique fails to produce a fast algorithm improving the known (or even the trivial) upper bound on the query complexity. Specifically, if a quantum walk algorithm designed with the known technique solves the Maximum Matching problem using $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ queries with any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, and if the underlying classical random walk is independent of an input graph, then the guaranteed time complexity is larger than any polynomial of $n$.</description>

      <title>Runtime Repeated Recursion Unfolding in CHR: A Just-In-Time Online Program Optimization Strategy That Can Achieve Super-Linear Speedup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02180v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a just-in-time runtime program transformation strategy based on repeated recursion unfolding. Our online program optimization generates several versions of a recursion differentiated by the minimal number of recursive steps covered. The base case of the recursion is ignored in our technique.
  Our method is introduced here on the basis of single linear direct recursive rules. When a recursive call is encountered at runtime, first an unfolder creates specializations of the associated recursive rule on-the-fly and then an interpreter applies these rules to the call. Our approach reduces the number of recursive rule applications to its logarithm at the expense of introducing a logarithmic number of generic unfolded rules.
  We prove correctness of our online optimization technique and determine its time complexity. For recursions which have enough simplifyable unfoldings, a super-linear is possible, i.e. speedup by more than a constant factor. The necessary simplification is problem-specific and has to be provided at compile-time. In our speedup analysis, we prove a sufficient condition as well as a sufficient and necessary condition for super-linear speedup relating the complexity of the recursive steps of the original rule and the unfolded rules.
  We have implemented an unfolder and meta-interpreter for runtime repeated recursion unfolding with just five rules in Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) embedded in Prolog. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with simplifications, time complexity results and benchmarks for some basic tractable algorithms. The simplifications require some insight and were derived manually. The runtime improvement quickly reaches several orders of magnitude, consistent with the super-linear speedup predicted by our theorems.</description>

      <title>No exponential quantum speedup for $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ anymore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2021, Chen, Liu, and Zhandry presented an efficient quantum algorithm for the average-case $\ell_\infty$-Short Integer Solution ($\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$) problem, in a parameter range outside the normal range of cryptographic interest, but still with no known efficient classical algorithm. This was particularly exciting since $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ is a simple problem without structure, and their algorithmic techniques were different from those used in prior exponential quantum speedups.
  We present efficient classical algorithms for all of the $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ and (more general) Constrained Integer Solution problems studied in their paper, showing there is no exponential quantum speedup anymore.</description>
