      <title>Non-symmetric discrete Colonel Blotto game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equilibrium strategies and the value of the asymmetric variant of the discrete Colonel Blotto game with $K \geq 2$ battlefields, $B \geq 1$ resources of the weaker player and $A &gt; B$ resources of the stronger player. We derive equilibrium strategies and the formulas for the value of the game for the cases where the number of resources of the weaker player, $B$, is at least $2(\lceil A/K \rceil - 1)$ as well as for the cases where this number is at most $\lfloor A/K \rfloor$. In particular, we solve all the cases of the game which can be solved using the discrete General Lotto game of~\cite{Hart08}. We propose a constrained variant of the discrete General Lotto game and use it to derive equilibrium strategies in the discrete Colonel Blotto game, that go beyond the General Lotto solvable cases game.</description>

      <title>A simple model for the population dynamics in OTC wholesale fresh product markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the combined evidences of bounded rationality, limited information and short-term optimization, over-the-counter (OTC) fresh product markets provide a perfect instance where to develop a behavioural approach to the analysis of micro-economic systems. Aiming at characterizing via a rigorous mathematical analysis, the main features of the spontaneous organization and functioning of such markets, we introduce and we study a stylized dynamical model for the time evolution of buyers populations and prices/attractiveness at each wholesaler. The dynamics is governed by immediate reactions of the actors to changes in basic indicators. Buyers are influenced by some degree of loyalty to their regular suppliers. Yet, at times, they also prospect for potential better offers. On the other hand, sellers primarily aim at maximising their profit. Yet, they can be also prone to improving their competitiveness in case of clientele deficit.
  Our results reveal that, in spite of being governed by simple and immediate rules, the competition between sellers self-regulates in time, as it constrains to bounded ranges the dispersion of both prices and clientele volumes, does similarly for the mean clientele volume, and it generates oscillatory behaviours that prevent any seller to dominate permanently its competitors (and to be dominated forever). Long-term behaviours are also investigated, with focus on asymptotic convergence to an equilibrium, as can be expected for a standard functioning mode. In particular, in the simplest case of 2 competing sellers, a normal-form-like analysis proves that such convergence holds, provided that the buyer's loyalty is sufficiently high or the sellers' reactivity is sufficiently low. In other words, this result identifies and proves those characteristics of the system that are responsible for long term stability and asymptotic damping of the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Peer Selection with Friends and Enemies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A planner wants to select one agent out of n agents on the basis of a binary characteristic that is commonly known to all agents but is not observed by the planner. Any pair of agents can either be friends or enemies or impartials of each other. An individual's most preferred outcome is that she be selected. If she is not selected, then she would prefer that a friend be selected, and if neither she herself or a friend is selected, then she would prefer that an impartial agent be selected. Finally, her least preferred outcome is that an enemy be selected. The planner wants to design a dominant strategy incentive compatible mechanism in order to be able choose a desirable agent. We derive sufficient conditions for existence of efficient and DSIC mechanisms when the planner knows the bilateral relationships between agents. We also show that if the planner does not know these relationships, then there is no efficient and DSIC mechanism and we compare the relative efficiency of two ``second-best'' DSIC mechanisms. Finally, we obtain sharp characterization results when the network of friends and enemies satisfies structural balance.</description>

      <title>Complete Exchange Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies one-sided matching under a complete exchange (CE) requirement, where each agent must be assigned an object different from its initial endowment. We introduce assignment partition -- a partition of agents and choice sets that builds CE into feasibility -- and, within this structure, propose two new mechanisms.
  Chain Serial Dictatorship (C-SD) operates within the partition as a binding-choice chain: the highest-priority agent picks from its allowed set and the right to pick passes to the owner of the chosen object; if that owner has already picked, the right reverts to the highest-priority remaining agent. Two-Stage Serial Dictatorship (T-SD) operates within the partition as a nominate-then-assign procedure: in Stage 1, agents tentatively nominate objects in exogenous priority, and the owners of nominated objects determine an endogenous final priority; in Stage 2, serial dictatorship runs within the partition using that final priority. For any given assignment partition, C-SD and T-SD simultaneously satisfy strategy-proofness, respecting improvement, and efficiency relative to the partition.
  We then examine the limits of pursuing market-wide efficiency under the CE constraint. As a benchmark, we study a modified TTC, CE-TTC, which first enforces a CE-compliant reassignment and then runs a self-avoiding top-trading-cycles phase; CE-TTC achieves efficiency within the CE constraint and strategy-proofness but fails respecting improvement. Moreover, for three and four agents, no mechanism can simultaneously achieve efficiency within the CE constraint, respecting improvement, and strategy-proofness. These findings underscore the value of partition-based design for truthful implementation with investment incentives under a hard CE mandate.</description>

      <title>The disclosure of information about the range of asset value in market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The information released to investors in financial markets has various forms. We refer to range information as information about the upper and lower bound which the payoff of a risky asset may reach in the future. This study develops rational expectation models to explore the market impacts of disclosure of range information. Our model shows that its disclosure can decrease the sensitivity of market price to private signal and increase market liquidity. The market impact of its disclosure depends on the position and precision of the disclosed range. When the linear combination of private signal and noise trading volume is distant from the disclosed range, the reaction of price to a variation in private signal will almost vanish, whereas a movement of the disclosed range can affect the price efficiently. If the midpoint of the disclosed range is higher (lower) than a criterion which is specified in this study, the disclosure will reduce (raise) asset premium.</description>

      <title>Public Goods Games in Directed Networks with Constraints on Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a public goods game, every player chooses whether or not to buy a good that all neighboring players will have access to. We consider a setting in which the good is indivisible, neighboring players are out-neighbors in a directed graph, and there is a capacity constraint on their number, k, that can benefit from the good. This means that each player makes a two-pronged decision: decide whether or not to buy and, conditional on buying, choose which k out-neighbors to share access. We examine both pure and mixed Nash equilibria in the model from the perspective of existence, computation, and efficiency. We perform a comprehensive study for these three dimensions with respect to both sharing capacity (k) and the network structure (the underlying directed graph), and establish sharp complexity dichotomies for each.</description>

      <title>Welfare and Distributional Effects of Joint Intervention in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimal joint intervention of a planner who can influence both the standalone marginal utilities of agents in a network and the weights of the links connecting them. The welfare-maximizing intervention displays two key features. First, when the planner's budget is moderate (yielding interior solutions), the optimal change in link weight between any pair of agents is proportional to the product of their eigen-centralities. Second, when the budget is sufficiently large, the optimal network converges to a simple structure: a complete network under strategic complements, or a complete balanced bipartite network under strategic substitutes. We show that welfare effects are governed by the principal eigenvalue of the network, while distributional outcomes are driven by the dispersion of the corresponding eigen-centralities. Comparing joint interventions to single interventions targeting only standalone marginal utilities, we find that joint interventions consistently generate higher aggregate welfare, but may also increase inequality, revealing a potential trade-off between efficiency and equity.</description>

      <title>Motivated Reasoning and the Political Economy of Climate Change Inaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20982v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two office-driven politicians compete in an election by proposing policies. There are two possible states of the world: climate change is either mild, with no lasting effect on welfare if addressed properly, or severe, leading to reduced welfare even with appropriate measures. Voters receive signals about the state but may interpret them in a non-Bayesian way, holding motivated beliefs. An equilibrium always exists where voters ignore signals suggesting severe consequences, causing politicians to propose policies for mild climate change--even when they know otherwise. If severe climate change leads to only moderate welfare losses, an efficient equilibrium also exists. In this equilibrium, voters trust politicians to choose the optimal policies, implying voters choose to trust their signals, which in turn encourages optimal policy choices by politicians. The model highlights the role of political rhetoric and trust in government, and a first glance at the data reveals patterns consistent with the models predictions.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning to Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can players sustain long-run trust when their equilibrium beliefs are shaped by machine-learning methods that penalize complexity? I study a game in which an infinite sequence of agents with one-period recall decides whether to place trust in their immediate successor. The cost of trusting is state-dependent. Each player's best response is based on a belief about others' behavior, which is a coarse fit of the true population strategy with respect to a partition of relevant contingencies. In equilibrium, this partition minimizes the sum of the mean squared prediction error and a complexity penalty proportional to its size. Relative to symmetric mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, this solution concept significantly narrows the scope for trust.</description>

      <title>Optimal Taxation under Imperfect Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study optimal taxation when citizens are not fully confident that the government will transform tax revenue into useful public goods. In an otherwise standard Ramsey framework, a representative agent values a public good financed by distortionary taxes, but believes that the government is honest only with some given probability and may otherwise divert all revenue. This simple departure from the canonical model delivers two central results. First, there is a sharp trust threshold: if perceived government honesty is too low, any positive tax rate lowers expected welfare and the optimal policy is a zero-tax corner, even though the public good is valued. Second, once trust exceeds this threshold, the usual sufficient-statistics logic of optimal taxation re-emerges, but with a trust-adjusted marginal value of public funds that scales down the benefits of raising revenue. In a simple parametric example we obtain closed-form expressions that map trust into the optimal tax rate and the size of the public sector. The framework provides a compact way to incorporate government credibility into tax design and suggests that in low-trust environments credibility-enhancing reforms should precede attempts to expand the tax base.</description>
