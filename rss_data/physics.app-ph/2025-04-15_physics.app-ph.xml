      <title>Fundamental longitudinal electromagnetic (EM) force investigation using DC current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work was to investigate historical claims of the existence of a longitudinal ElectroMagnetic (EM) force component acting on metallic atomic current elements in a direction parallel to the current flowing through them. This lies outside conventional textbook physics predictions, yet its existence has been indicated previously and if eventually confirmed will have a significant effect on physics theory and many technological applications, especially those involving high current density (&gt; 10^9 A/m2). The experiment described here is based on the measurement of force on a copper armature submerged in a trough containing liquid metal through which constant DC current is passing. The coaxial symmetry of the experiment (CRE Coaxial Recoil Experiment) was able to limit all net force on the centred armature to the direction of interest, parallel to the current within it. All the experimental data related the measured forces on the armature to the current flowing through the circuit. Variations were made to the length and location of the armature along the central axis as well as modifications to the liquid metal configuration. Raw and processed results are presented, and an experimental technique described that revealed strong evidence for the existence of and discrimination between axial mechanical contact forces and longitudinal EM force. The original EM force law, proposed in 1822 by Ampere, includes a longitudinal component and has been found to be qualitatively consistent with all experiments to date, including these reported findings, and is considered a candidate explanatory theory.</description>

      <title>Sub-nanosecond in-plane magnetization switching induced by field-like spin-orbit torques from ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torques (SOTs) generated in SOT-material/ferromagnet structures are classified as damping-like (DL) and field-like (FL) torques for current-driven magnetization switching. It is well known that both DL- and FL-SOTs originate from the SOT-material and DL-SOT dominates the current-driven switching process while FL-SOT contributes limitedly, resulting in an incubation time (several nanoseconds) during collinear magnetization switching with the spin polarization because of the DL attributes. Here we report a FL-SOT originated from the ferromagnet, different from the origin of DL-SOT, and demonstrate that it dominates the collinear magnetization switching. We show that the FL-SOT and resultant collinear switching can be modulated, one order of magnitude and sign reversal, by controlling the ferromagnet. Because of no incubation time and higher charge-to-spin efficiencies in the FL switching, we further show that the switching time can be down to 200 ps with one order lower critical switching current density compared to DL switching. These results indicate that the FL switching may provide a practical solution for magnetic memory in speed-priority cache applications.</description>

      <title>Simulation of TOPCon/PERC Hybrid Bottom Structure for Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells using Quokka3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work emphasizes the potential of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells for increased power conversion efficiencies. By employing crystalline silicon (c-Si) as the bottom cell, particularly with p-type PERC technology, there are cost-effective and advantageous physical properties. However, traditional phosphorus-doped emitters in PERC Si bottom cells are hindered by high surface recombination, which limits their performance. This research introduces a novel hybrid PERC/TOPCon structure that integrates a phosphorus-doped poly-Si (n+ TOPCon) layer as the front emitter to address these challenges. Numerical simulations using Quokka3 confirmed the feasibility of the design, focusing on optimizing the rear side metallization to enhance implied open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). A two-step process systematically varied local contact openings to examine their impact on performance metrics. Results highlighted optimal rear metallization parameters, achieving optimal metal fractions approximately 2%. This innovative approach demonstrates the effectiveness of combining TOPCon and PERC technologies for bottom cells in tandem structures, providing valuable insights into their development and optimization. The study underscores the potential of the hybrid PERC/TOPCon structure in enhancing the functionality and efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of multiresonance filters via quasi-normal mode theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical methodology for inverse design of compact high-order/multiresonance filters in linear passive 2-port wave-scattering systems, targeting any desired transmission spectrum (such as standard pass/stop-band filters). Our formulation allows for both large-scale topology optimization and few-variable parametrized-geometry optimization. It is an extension of a quasi-normal mode theory and analytical filter-design criteria (on the system resonances and background response) derived in our previous work. Our new optimization-oriented formulation relies solely on a scattering solver and imposes these design criteria as equality constraints with easily calculated (via the adjoint method) derivatives, so that our algorithm is numerically tractable, robust, and well-suited for large-scale inverse design. We demonstrate its effectiveness by designing 3rd- and 4th-order elliptic and Chebyshev filters for photonic metasurfaces, multilayer films, and electrical LC-ladder circuits.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale second harmonic generation microscopy of ferroelectric domains in x-cut thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) is a widely used platform for nonlinear frequency conversion, as its strong nonlinear susceptibility and enhanced modal confinement intensify nonlinear interactions. Frequency doubling from NIR to visible wavelengths necessitates fabrication of quasi-phase matching (QPM) gratings with minimal period variation (&lt;20nm) and control of ferroelectric domain inversion at the micron-scale along centimeter-long waveguides. Second harmonic generation microscopy (SHM) is a powerful tool for optimizing domain engineering (E-field poling), and it enabled the fabrication of near-ideal QPM gratings. Here, we show that increasing the SHM raster scan step size from 200nm to 400nm results in a 4x imaging speedup without sacrificing the accuracy of QPM grating characterization. To that end, Monte Carlo simulation of the coupled rate equations agreed with experimental measurements of second harmonic output power. We also employed a statistical subsampling scheme to characterize 5.6 mm-long waveguides (poling period = 3.240um) in approximately 5 minutes (30 seconds per field x 10 fields per waveguide). Each field is 100 microns in length, so our results indicate that sampling only ~300 periods of a QPM grating is sufficient to accurately predict its second harmonic output. For the device characterized, this corresponds to ~20% of the total grating length. Together, discretization and device-length subsampling speed up SHM imaging by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the weak and critical points of various uncertainty relations that follow from the inequalities for the norms of vectors in the Hilbert space of states of a quantum system. There are studied uncertainty relations for sums of standard deviations, for sums of variances, and other relations between standard deviations or variances. The obtained results are compared with the conclusions obtained in similar cases using the standard Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation. We also show that there exists an upper bound on the product of standard deviations that appears in the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Strongly confined Mid-infrared to Terahertz Phonon Polaritons in Ultra-thin SrTiO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have emerged as a promising platform for subwavelength optical manipulation, offering distinct advantages for applications in infrared sensing, imaging, and optoelectronic devices. However, the narrow Reststrahlen bands of conventional polar materials impose significant limitations on their applications across the mid-infrared (MIR) to terahertz (THz) range. Addressing this challenge requires the development of materials capable of supporting SPhPs with broad spectral range, strong field confinement, slow group velocity, and high quality factor. Here, using monochromatic electron energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we demonstrate that ultra-thin SrTiO3 membranes encompass the exceptional properties mentioned above that have long been sought after. Systematic measurements across varying membrane thicknesses reveal two distinct SPhP branches characterized by wide spectral dispersion, high field confinement, and anomalously slow group velocities spanning from the MIR (68 ~ 99 meV) to THz (12 ~ 59 meV) range. Notably, in membranes approaching ~ 3 nm thickness (~ 8 unit cells), these polaritons exhibit unprecedented confinement factors exceeding 500 and group velocities as low as ~ 7 * 10-5 c, rivaling the best-performing van der Waals materials. These findings establish perovskite oxide such as SrTiO3 as a versatile platform for tailoring light-matter interactions at the nanoscale, providing critical insights for the design of next-generation photonic devices requiring broadband operation and enhanced optical confinement.</description>

      <title>Effects resulting from magnetic interactions in low-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research delves into the critical effects of magnetic interactions in low-dimensional systems, offering invaluable insights that deepen our comprehension of magnetic behavior at the nanoscale. By implementing this innovative approach, one can unequivocally identify two distinct magnetic states: demagnetizing and magnetizing. The resulting measurements significantly enhance our grasp of the magnetic dynamics within these nanostructures, paving the way for spin-wave excitations. To validate the effectiveness of this methodology, it was conducted rigorous numerical simulations on a diverse array of nanostructures, including one-dimensional nanowires and three-dimensional hexagonal arrays of nanowires. Each nanowire is precisely modeled as a chain of interacting ellipsoidal grains, illustrating the intricate nature of these magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching and charge accumulation effect in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method. To explain the experimental results, we analyze phase composition of the nanopowder samples annealed at temperatures from 500{\deg}C to 800{\deg}C, determined by the X-ray diffraction analysis, and relate it with the peculiarities of their electronic paramagnetic resonance spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy infrared lasers have enabled the generation of strong field phenomena, and among such phenomena, high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from gases has enabled attosecond-scale observations in atoms or molecules. Lasers with longer wavelengths and shorter pulse widths are advantageous for generating higher photon energy and shorter attosecond pulses via HHG. Thus, the development of ultrashort mid-infrared (MIR) lasers has progressed. This paper reviews research on developing high-energy MIR lasers using the dual-chirped optical parametric amplification (DC-OPA) method. We developed TW-class multi-cycle lasers in the MIR region, which was previously difficult. The advanced DC-OPA method, an extension of the conventional DC-OPA method, enables one-octave amplification of the wavelength, and a TW-class single-cycle laser was developed. These lasers were utilized for HHG, enabling single-shot absorption spectroscopy, and one-octave supercontinuum soft X-ray generation for single-cycle isolated attosecond pulse. We also show the development of multi-TW sub-cycle DC-OPA pumped by Ti:sapphire laser and high average power MIR single-cycle DC-OPA using thin-disk laser technology.</description>

      <title>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the liquid-vapor interface. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on a quasi-continuum approach. Experimental evidence for this effect has been scarce so far. Here, we examine evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates, including the liquid films on both sides, by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Our solution shows that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, i.e., the evaporative refrigeration effect. Our work not only re-affirms the refrigeration effect, but clarifies that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. At the interface, the asymmetry in the distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules creates a cooling effect, which is the dominant mechanism. Additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. Our work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning and refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N\'eel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.</description>

      <title>CMOS-compatible vanadium dioxide via Pulsed Laser and Atomic Layer deposition: towards ultra-thin film phase-change layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide, a well-known Mott insulator, is a highly studied electronic material with promising applications in information processing and storage. While fully crystalline layers exhibit exceptional properties, such as a sharp and abrupt conductivity change at the metal-insulator transition, fabricating poly-crystalline films on silicon substrates often involves trade-offs in transport characteristics and switching performance, especially for ultra-thin layers required in advanced gate applications. In this study, we explore the growth of vanadium dioxide films on standard wet-oxidized silicon wafers using two established deposition techniques with pulsed laser deposition and atomic layer deposition. Thin films, ranging in thickness from 200 to 10 nano meters, were systematically characterized through structural and electrical analyses to optimize key growth parameters. Temperature and pressure were identified as the primary factors affecting film quality, and the optimal growth conditions across the entire thickness range are discussed in detail. We demonstrate that both pulsed laser deposition and atomic layer deposition methods can successfully produce ultra-thin vanadium dioxide layers down to 8 nano meters with functional properties suitable for practical applications. This work underscores the potential of vanadium dioxide for fully industry compatible phase-change switching devices and provides valuable insights into optimizing growth processes for poly-crystalline films.</description>

Polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) nanoparticles with nominal diameters of 100, 54, and 262~nm, respectively, were analyzed by NEMS--FTIR with limits of detection (LoD) of 353~pg for PS, 102~pg for PP, and 355~pg for PVC. The PS mass deposited on the NEMS chips was estimated from the measured absorptance values and the attenuation coefficient of PS. The wide spectral range of the FTIR allowed the identification of individual polymer nanoparticles from a mixture. The potential of NEMS--FTIR for the analysis of real--world samples was evaluated by confirming the presence of polyamide (PA) particles released from commercial tea bags during brewing. Accelerated aging of the tea bags under elevated temperature and UV radiation showed continuous release of PA particles over time.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Ferroelectric Behavior of Wurtzite Ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first experimental exploration into cryogenic ferroelectric behavior in wurtzite ferroelectrics. A breakdown field (EBD) to coercive field (EC) ratio of 1.8 is achieved even at 4 K, marking the lowest ferroelectric switching temperature reported for wurtzite ferroelectrics. Additionally, a significant evolution in fatigue behavior is captured, transitioning from hard breakdown to ferroelectricity loss at cryogenic temperatures. These findings unlock the feasibility for wurtzite ferroelectrics to advance wide temperature non-volatile memory.</description>

      <title>Analogical models to introduce high school students to modern physics: an inquiry-based activity on Rutherford's gold foil experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a didactic proposal on Rutherford's gold foil experiment, tailored for high schools. Grounded in constructivist pedagogy, the activity introduces key concepts of modern physics-often absent from standard curricula-through a hands on, inquiry-based approach. By employing analogical reasoning and black box modeling, students engage in experimental investigation and collaborative problem-solving to explore atomic structure. The activity was implemented as a case study with a class of first-year students (aged 14-15) from a applied science-focused secondary school in Italy. Data collection combined qualitative observations, structured discussions, and digital feedback tools to assess conceptual learning and student engagement. Findings indicate that well-designed, student-centered interventions can meaningfully support the development of abstract scientific understanding, while fostering critical thinking and collaborative skills.</description>

      <title>AC Current-Driven Magnetization Switching and Nonlinear Hall Rectification in a Magnetic Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque arising from the spin-orbit-coupled surface states of topological insulators enables current-induced control of magnetization with high efficiency. Here, alternating-current (AC) driven magnetization reversal is demonstrated in a semi-magnetic topological insulator (Cr,Bi,Sb)2Te3/(Bi,Sb)2Te3, facilitated by a low threshold current density of 1.5x10^9 A/m^2. Time-domain Hall voltage measurements using an oscilloscope reveal a strongly nonlinear and nonreciprocal Hall response during the magnetization reversal process. Fourier analysis of the time-varying Hall voltage identifies higher-harmonic signals and a rectified direct-current (DC) component, highlighting the complex interplay among the applied current, external magnetic field, and magnetization dynamics. Furthermore, a hysteretic behavior in the current-voltage characteristics gives rise to frequency mixing under dual-frequency excitation. This effect, distinct from conventional polynomial-based nonlinearities, allows for selective extraction of specific frequency components. The results demonstrate that AC excitation can not only switch magnetization efficiently but also induce tunable nonlinear responses, offering a new pathway for multifunctional spintronic devices with potential applications in energy-efficient memory, signal processing, and frequency conversion.</description>

      <title>Radiative Cooling and Thermoregulation of Vertical Facades with Micropatterned Directional Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a micropatterned directional emitter ({\mu}DE) with an ultrabroadband, azimuthally selective and tailorable emittance across the thermal wavelengths and over wide angles. The {\mu}DE can enable a novel and passive seasonal thermoregulation of buildings by reducing summertime terrestrial radiative heat gain, and wintertime loss. We show several types of {\mu}DE, such as metallic, white and transparent variants, made using low-cost materials and scalable manufacturing techniques that are already in large-scale use. Furthermore, we show that its directional emittance can be geometrically tailored to sky-view factors in different urban scenarios. Outdoor experiments show that {\mu}DEs stay 1.53-3.26{\deg}C cooler than traditional omnidirectional building envelopes in warm weather, including when they are sunlit. In cold weather, {\mu}DEs can be up to 0.46{\deg}C warmer. Additionally, {\mu}DEs demonstrate significant cooling powers of up to 40 Wm-2 in warm conditions and heating powers of up to 30 Wm-2 in cool conditions, relative to typical building envelopes. Building energy models show that {\mu}DEs can achieve all-season energy savings similar to or higher than those of cool roofs. Collectively, our findings show {\mu}DEs as highly promising for thermoregulating buildings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00953v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stirling engine is a type of heat engine known as its high efficiency. It is applied in solar thermal power, cogeneration, space nuclear power, and other fields. Although there are many different types of Stirling engines, their airflow paths are always linear. This article designs two types of Stirling engines with loop airflow path: the O-type engines without regenerator and the 8-type engines with regenerator. The modeling and simulation of the O-type engines show its extremely excellent performance compared with the conventional Stirling engine. Because the regenerator is the main loss and power limitation in Stirling engines, O-type engines do not have this limitation. At the same time, its design without regenerator makes it more practical and has greater potential in terms of power. The 8-type engines use its unique 8-type airflow path to allow gas to enter the regenerator in advance, eliminating the almost useless four heat exchanges, resulting in higher thermal efficiency and better robustness.</description>

      <title>Elastic anisotropy in heterogeneous materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous materials exhibit anisotropy which is influenced by factors such as individual phase properties and microstructural configuration that form crucial descriptors of heterogeneity. A review of anisotropy indices proposed in the context of single crystals reveals that they do not account for the descriptors of heterogeneity limiting their utility in heterogeneous materials. To address this shortcoming, this work presents a novel approach to quantify elastic anisotropy in heterogeneous materials utilizing their effective elastic properties. Anisotropy quantification has been demonstrated considering two phase composite materials highlighting the crucial role of constituent volume fractions, secondary phase shape, and elastic contrast in influencing the extent of anisotropy. Additionally, specific material and microstructural descriptors leading to overall isotropy in composite materials are validated and an extension of the approach to account for defects such as porosity and cracks is presented. The presented results demonstrate the applicability of the anisotropy quantification approach to any configuration of heterogeneous materials.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-Engineered Phonon Polaritons in a van der Waals Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon-polaritons (PhPs) in low-symmetry van der Waals materials confine mid-infrared electromagnetic radiation well below the diffraction limit for nanoscale optics, sensing, and energy control. However, controlling the PhP dispersion at the nanoscale through intrinsic material properties$-$without external fields, lithography, or intercalants$-$remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate vacancy-engineered tuning of PhPs in $\alpha$-phase molybdenum trioxide ($\alpha$-MoO$_3$) via oxygen vacancy formation and lattice strain. Near-field nanoimaging of PhPs in processed $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ reveals an average polariton wavevector modulation of $\Delta k/k \approx 0.13 $ within the lower Restrahlen band. Stoichiometric analysis, density functional theory, and finite-difference time-domain simulations show agreement with the experimental results and suggest an induced vacancy concentration of $1\% - 2\%$ along with $(1.2\pm 0.2)\%$ compressive strain, resulting in a non-volatile dielectric permittivity modulation of up to $\Delta \varepsilon / \varepsilon \approx 0.15$. Despite these lattice modifications, the lifetimes of thermomechanically tuned PhPs remain high at $1.2 \pm 0.31$ ps. These results establish thermomechanical vacancy engineering as a general strategy to reprogram polaritonic response in vdW crystals, offering a new degree of freedom for embedded, non-volatile nanophotonics.</description>

Abstract: As photonic technologies continue to grow in multidimensional aspects, integrated photonics holds a unique position and continuously presents enormous possibilities to research communities. Applications span across data centers, environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and highly compact communication components, with further possibilities growing endlessly. Here, we provide a review of state of the art integrated photonic sensors operating in near and mid infrared wavelength regions on various material platforms. Among different materials, architectures, and technologies leading the way for on chip sensors, we discuss optical sensing principles commonly applied to biochemical and gas sensing. Our focus is particularly on passive and active optical waveguides, including dispersion engineered metamaterial based structures an essential approach for enhancing the interaction between light and analytes in chip scale sensors. We harness a diverse array of cutting edge sensing technologies, heralding a revolutionary on chip sensing paradigm. Our arsenal includes refractive index based sensing, plasmonic, and spectroscopy, forging an unparalleled foundation for innovation and precision. Furthermore, we include a brief discussion of recent trends and computational concepts incorporating Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning (AI/ML) and deep learning approaches over the past few years to improve the qualitative and quantitative analysis of sensor measurements.</description>

      <title>Double helical plasmonic antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14927v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic double helical antennas are a means to funnel circularly polarized light down to the nanoscale. Here, an existing design tool for single helices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas that combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional light emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides additional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The helical antennas are fabricated by direct writing with a focused electron beam, a technique that is unrivaled in terms of spatial resolution and 3D shape fidelity. After the printing process, the structures are purified using ozone plasma at room temperature, resulting in the smallest continuous double helix antennas ever realized in gold. Fabricated antennas are studied regarding their polarization-dependent transmission behavior, which shows a large and broadband dissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an important tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum photonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future nanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05323v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fitting oscillator models to variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE) data can lead to non-unique, unphysical results. We demonstrate using temperature-dependent trends to prevent overfitting and ensure model physicality. As a case study, we performed mid-infrared VASE measurements on fused silica (SiO2) of various grades, from room temperature to 600 {\deg}C. We fitted oscillator models independently at each temperature, and confirmed the model's physical validity by observing the expected monotonic trends in vibrational oscillator parameters. Using this technique, we generated a highly accurate dataset for the temperature-dependent complex refractive index of fused silica for modeling mid-infrared optical components such as thermal emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanometers thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Phononic Dressed States in a Nanomechanical System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) provide a platform for probing the quantum nature of mechanical motion in mesoscopic systems. This nature manifests most profoundly when the device vibrations are nonlinear and, currently, achieving vibrational nonlinearity at the single-phonon level is an active area of pursuit in quantum information science. Despite much effort, however, this has remained elusive. Here, we report the first observation of intrinsic mesoscopic vibrational dressed states. The requisite nonlinearity results from strong resonant coupling between an eigenmode of our NEMS resonator and a single, two-level system (TLS) that is intrinsic to the device material. We control the TLS in situ by varying mechanical strain, tuning it in and out of resonance with the NEMS mode. Varying the resonant drive and/or temperature allows controlled ascent of the nonequidistant energy ladder and reveals the energy multiplets of the hybridized system. Fluctuations of the TLS on and off resonance with the mode induces switching between dressed and bare states; this elucidates the complex quantum nature of TLS-like defects in mesoscopic systems. These quintessential quantum effects emerge directly from the intrinsic material properties of mechanical systems - without need for complex, external quantum circuits. Our work provides long-sought insight into mesoscopic dynamics and offers a new direction to harness nanomechanics for quantum measurements.</description>
