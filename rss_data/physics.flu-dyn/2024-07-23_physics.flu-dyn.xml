      <title>Refined universality of the turbulence cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a very large dataset of turbulent wakes, which includes different generators and inflows, we explore the relationship between two fundamental quantities of turbulent flows: the dissipation constant $C_\varepsilon$ and the intermittency factor $\mu$. For the energy cascade, $C_\varepsilon$ is known to reflect its basic overall properties, while $\mu$ quantifies the emerging intermittency down the cascade. We find that these quantities are related, as $\mu$ is inversely proportional to $C_\varepsilon$, providing a new principle that also applies to inhomogeneous flows.</description>

      <title>Single-particle diffraction with a hydrodynamic pilot-wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A macroscopic hydrodynamic system that couples a particle and a wave has recently renewed interest in the question as to what extent a classical system may reproduce quantum phenomena. Here we investigate single-particle diffraction with a pilot-wave model originally developed to describe the hydrodynamic system. We study single-particle interactions with a barrier and slits of increasing width by focusing on the near field. We find single-particle diffraction arising as wavelike patterns in the particles' position statistics, which we compare to the predictions of quantum mechanics. We provide a mechanism that rationalizes the diffractive behavior in our system.</description>

      <title>WaterLily.jl: A differentiable and backend-agnostic Julia solver to simulate incompressible viscous flow and dynamic bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software into optimization and machine-learning frameworks is hampered by the rigidity of classic computational languages and the slow performance of more flexible high-level languages. In this work, we introduce WaterLily.jl: an open-source incompressible viscous flow solver written in the Julia language. An immersed boundary method is used to enforce the effect of solid boundaries on flow past complex geometries with arbitrary motions. The small code base is multidimensional, multiplatform and backend-agnostic (serial and multithreaded CPU, and GPU execution). Additionally, the dynamically typed language allows the solver to be fully differentiable using automatic differentiation. The computational time per time step scales linearly with the number of degrees of freedom (DOF) on CPUs, and we measure up to a 200x speed-up using CUDA kernels resulting in a cost of 1.44 nanoseconds per DOF and time step. This leads to comparable performance with low-level CFD solvers written in C and Fortran on research-scale problems, opening up exciting possible future applications on the cutting edge of machine-learning research.</description>

      <title>Time-resolving PIV measurements and modal analysis of turbulent flow in a bench-scale hydrodynamic separator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective stormwater treatment infrastructures are crucial for mitigating the adverse effects of runoff on urban water quality. However, designing cost-effective treatment systems can be challenging due to complex turbulent flow dynamics. This study presents an in-depth analysis of turbulent flow in hydrodynamic separators (HS) using time-resolving, high-resolution particle image velocimetry (PIV) and modal decomposition techniques. The examination of interrogation window sizes on PIV measurements highlights a trade-off between spatial resolution and measurement uncertainty. Additionally, the impact of sampling frequencies and durations on the convergence of turbulence statistics, such as mean flow and Reynolds stress, is quantified. Results indicate that higher-order statistics require significantly larger sampling sizes (5x) to achieve the same level of statistical convergence as mean flow statistics. Leveraging proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), dominant turbulence structures and coherent flow features are identified, providing a foundation for the development of reduced-order models (ROM). These ROMs demonstrate improved computational efficiency and have potential for real-time control applications and integration into larger drainage-scale simulations. Furthermore, the outcome of this study establishes a high-quality, open-source turbulent flow database for HS systems, offering the civil and environmental engineering community valuable resources to guide the development and application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools. This study represents a critical step toward the ultimate goal of facilitating scientifically guided HS design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Near-inertial echoes of ageostrophic instability in submesoscale filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocean submesoscales, flows with characteristic size around 10m--10km, are transitional between the larger, rotationally-constrained mesoscale and three-dimensional turbulence. In this paper we present simulations of a submesoscale ocean filament. The strong vertical transport associated with submesoscale fronts and filaments ventilates the deeper water and provides a route for the observed forward cascade of energy in the ocean. In our case, the filament is strongly sheared in both vertical and cross-filament directions and is unstable. Instability indeed dominates the early behaviour with a fast extraction of kinetic energy from the vertically sheared thermal wind. The filament is expected to be subject to instabilities, including symmetric and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. An instability emerges with a circulation that does not match either, though symmetric modes become apparent later. The action of the instability is sufficiently rapid that the filament does not respond in a geostrophically balanced sense. Instead, it later exhibits vertically sheared near-inertial oscillations with higher amplitude as the initial minimum Richardson number decreases. Horizontal gradients strengthen only briefly as the fronts restratify. These unstable filaments can be generated by strong mixing events at pre-existing stable structures. The oscillations must also be considered when designing initial conditions for numerical experiments of submesoscale flows, where the initial state is intended to be balanced.</description>

      <title>Feigenbaum universality in subcritical Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feigenbaum universality is shown to occur in subcritical shear flows. Our testing ground is the counter-rotation regime of the Taylor-Couette flow, where numerical calculations are performed within a small periodic domain. The accurate computation of up to the seventh period doubling bifurcation, assisted by a purposely defined Poincar\'e section, has enabled the estimation of the two Feigenbaum universal constants with unprecedented accuracy in a fluid flow problem. We have further devised a method to predict the bifurcation diagram up to the accumulation point of the cascade based on the detailed inspection of just the first few period doubling bifurcations. Remarkably, the method is applicable beyond the accumulation point, with predictions remaining valid, in a statistical sense, for the chaotic dynamics that follows.</description>

      <title>Zero-dimensional Analysis of Thermal Choking in Arbitrary Duct with Application to Dual-mode Ramjet Combustor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal choking in combustor ducts is a matter of great interest to researchers involved in the design and analysis of combustors. In case of scramjet combustors, a thermally choked state is undesirable whereas for a dual-mode combustor in the ram mode it is essential. Since real-life combustors feature volume heat addition due to combustion, area variation, wall heat loss and frictional losses, all of these effects must be included in the analysis. The standard Rayleigh flow assumes a constant-area duct with no frictional effects and a single heat addition/loss term without distinguishing between combustion and wall heat transfer effects. Instead, a generalized Rayleigh flow analysis is employed here which can account for all the above effects and also provide for different fuel injection rates and mixing efficiency. The forward and inverse heat transfer problems are stated and solutions are compared between Rayleigh flow in constant-area and variable-area ducts. The analysis is checked against a scramjet combustor in the literature and then used to study the occurrence of thermal choking in a dual-mode combustor geometry. The possibility of thermal choking and the location of the choking event can be easily detected by this method. The shift in the thermal choking location with variation in the duct heat and mass transfer state can be easily evaluated. In this manner, the present method provides a quick and accurate tool for preliminary design and analysis of ramjet and scramjet combustors.</description>

      <title>Analysis of soot formation in a lab-scale Rich-Quench-Lean combustor using LES with tabulated chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical study of the effects of air dilution on soot formation and particle dynamics in a lab-scale rich-quench-lean (RQL) combustor is presented using large-eddy simulations (LES) with tabulated chemistry. The modelling approach comprises a flamelet generated manifold (FGM) turbulent combustion model and an efficient discrete sectional method with clustering of sections (CDSM) to model soot formation. Three operating conditions are studied including a reference case without secondary air dilution and two cases with varying air dilution levels. For the latter, the split between primary and dilution air is varied from 80:20 to 60:40 expressed in percentage values. The study aims to investigate the effect of air dilution on the formation and oxidation of soot for various air splits using a direct comparison with the available experimental data. The results show a good correlation between predicted flame topology and spatial distribution of the soot volume fraction with the experimental observations. The introduction of air dilution is found to limit the production of soot with a more drastic reduction for the 40% dilution case compared to the 20% condition. Predicted particle size distributions (PSD) from the case without secondary air dilution correlate well with scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) measurements although fewer and smaller particles are predicted with air dilution. Leaner mixtures and enhanced oxidation, resulting from the interaction with air dilution jets, favor the decrease in soot formation.</description>

      <title>Measuring the local mechanical properties of a floating elastic sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar regions are covered by sea ice, which can be seen as a thin solid elastic sheet with heterogeneous mechanical properties. The dynamics of deformation of a floating solid sheet are primarly governed by gravity, water density, and the flexural modulus, which depends on its mechanical properties, namely the thickness, the Young's Modulus and the Poisson ratio. Non-invasive methods from seismology can retrieve these three parameters from sheet deformation dynamics. In this article, we developed another method to extract locally the flexural modulus of a floating thin elastic sheet from the spatio-temporal deformations of the sheet. We perform laboratory experiment to test the accuracy and the robustness of this method on silicon membranes of controlled mechanical properties. Using patches of different thicknesses and shapes, we eventually draw maps of sheet thickness, with a sub-wavelength spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>Positive pressure matters in acoustic droplet vaporization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustically vaporizable droplets are phase-change agents that can improve the effectiveness of ultrasound-based therapies. In this study, we demonstrate that the compression part of an acoustic wave can generate tension that initiates the vaporization. This counter-intuitive process is explained by the occurrence of Gouy phase shift due to the focusing of the acoustic wave inside the droplet. Our analysis unifies the existing theories for acoustic droplet vaporization under a single framework and is supported by experiments and simulations. We use our theory to identify governing parameters that allow to vaporize droplets using predominantly compression waves, which are safer in medical use.</description>

      <title>A Period-Doubling Route to Chaos in Viscoelastic Kolmogorov Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer solutions can develop chaotic flows, even at low inertia. This purely elastic turbulence is well studied, but little is known about the transition to chaos. In 2D channel flow and parallel shear flow, traveling wave solutions involving coherent structures are present for sufficiently large fluid elasticity. We numerically study 2D periodic parallel shear flow in viscoelastic fluids and show that these traveling waves become oscillatory and undergo a series of period-doubling bifurcations en-route to chaos.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Koopman operator predictions of turbulent dynamics in models of shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman operator enables the analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems through a linear perspective by describing time evolution in the infinite-dimensional space of observables. Here this formalism is applied to shear flows, specifically the minimal flow unit plane Couette flow and a nine-dimensional model of turbulent shear flow between infinite parallel free-slip walls under a sinusoidal body force (Moehlis et al., New J. Phys. 6, 56 (2004)). We identify a finite set of observables and approximate the Koopman operator using neural networks, following the method developed by Constante-Amores et al., Chaos, 34(4), 043119 (2024). Then the time evolution is determined with a method here denoted as "Projected Koopman Dynamics". Using a high-dimensional approximate Koopman operator directly for the plane Couette system is computationally infeasible due to the high state space dimension of direct numerical simulations (DNS). However, the long-term dynamics of the dissipative Navier-Stokes equations are expected to live on a lower-dimensional invariant manifold. Motivated by this fact, we perform dimension reduction on the DNS data with a variant of the IRMAE-WD (implicit rank-minimizing autoencoder-weight decay) autoencoder (Zeng et al., MLST 5(2), 025053 (2024)) before applying the Koopman approach. We compare the performance of data-driven state space (neural ordinary differential equation) and Projected Koopman Dynamics approaches in manifold coordinates for plane Couette flow. Projected Koopman Dynamics effectively captures the chaotic behavior of Couette flow and the nine-dimensional model, excelling in both short-term tracking and long-term statistical analysis, outperforming other frameworks applied to these shear flows.</description>

      <title>Bubble shape oscillations in a turbulent environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bubble deformations in an homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flow by means of direct numerical simulations of a single bubble in turbulence. We examine interface deformations by decomposing the local radius into the spherical harmonics base. We show that the linear dynamics of each mode, (for low Weber number), can be modeled by a forced stochastic linear oscillator. We measure the coefficients of the model directly from the modes' statistics. We find that the natural frequency corresponds to the Rayleigh frequency, derived in a quiescent flow. However, dissipation increases by a factor 15 compared to the quiescent case, at $Re_\lambda = 55$. This enhanced dissipation originates from a thick boundary layer surrounding the bubble. We demonstrate that the effective forcing, originating from the integration of pressure over the bubble surface, is independent on bubble deformability. Therefore, the interface deformations are only one-way coupled to the flow. Eventually, we investigate the pressure modes' statistics in the absence of bubbles and compare them to the effective forcing statistics. We show that both fields share the same pdf, characterized by exponential tails, and a characteristic timescale corresponding to the eddy turnover time at the mode scale.</description>

      <title>Ultimate regime of Rayleigh-Benard turbulence: Sub-regimes and their scaling relations for Nu vs. Ra and Pr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer a new model for the heat transfer and the turbulence intensity in strongly driven Rayleigh-Benard turbulence (the so-called ultimate regime), which in contrast to hitherto models is consistent with the new mathematically exact heat transfer upper bound of Choffrut et al. [J. Differential Equations 260, 3860 (2016)] and thus enables extrapolations of the heat transfer to geo- and astrophysical flows. The model distinguishes between four subregimes of the ultimate regime and well describes the measured heat transfer in various large-Ra experiments. In this new representation, which properly accounts for the Prandtl number dependence, the onset to the ultimate regime is seen in all available large-Ra data sets, though at different Rayleigh numbers, as to be expected for a non-normal-nonlinear instability.</description>

      <title>Propulsion Contribution from Individual Filament in Flagellar Bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flagellated microorganisms overcome the low-Reynolds-number time reversibility by rotating helical flagella. For peritrichous bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the randomly distributed flagellar filaments align along the same direction to form a bundle, facilitating complex locomotive strategies. To understand the process of flagella bundling, especially the propulsion force, we develop a multi-functional macroscopic experimental system and employ advanced numerical simulations for verification. Flagella arrangements and phase differences between helices are investigated, revealing the variation in propulsion contribution from the individual helix. Numerically, we build a time-dependent model to match the bundling process and study the influence of hydrodynamic interactions. Surprisingly, it is found that the total propulsion generated by a bundle of two filaments is constant at various phase differences between the helices. However, the difference between the propulsion from each helix is significantly affected by the phase difference, and only one of the helices is responsible for the total propulsion at a phase difference equals to pi. Through our experimental and computational results, we provide a new model considering the propulsion contribution of each filament to better understand microbial locomotion mechanisms, especially on the wobbling behavior of the cell. Our work also sheds light on the design and control of artificial microswimmers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the modelling and numerical simulation of a molten glass fluid flow in a furnace melting basin. We first derive a model for a molten glass fluid flow and present numerical simulations based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). We further discuss and validate the results obtained from the simulations by comparing them with experimental results. Finally, we also present a non-intrusive Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to efficiently handle scenarios which require multiple simulations of the fluid flow upon changing parameters of relevant industrial interest. This approach lets us obtain solutions of a complex 3D model, with good accuracy with respect to the FEM solution, yet with negligible associated computational times.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that buoyancy suppresses, and can even laminarise turbulence in upward heated pipe flow. Heat transfer seriously deteriorates in this case. Through a new DNS model, we confirm that the deteriorated heat transfer within convective turbulence is related to a lack of near-wall rolls, which leads to a weak mixing between the flow near the wall and centre of pipe. Having surveyed the fundamental properties of the system, we perform a nonlinear nonmodal stability analysis. it is found that, the minimal seed becomes thinner and closer to the wall, with increase of buoyancy number C. Most importantly, we show that the critical initial energy required to trigger shear-driven turbulence keeps increasing, implying that attempts to artificially trigger it may not be an efficient means to improve heat transfer at larger C. The new minimal seed, found at C=6, is localised in streamwise direction and is active in the centre of pipe. To find this branch of optimal, we took advantage of a window of linear stability. While the nonlinear optimal causes transition to convective turbulence directly at this and larger C, transition via the linear instability passes via a travelling wave or periodic orbit solutions. Detailed analysis of the periodic solution reveals three stages: growth of the unstable eigenfunction, the formation of streaks, and the decay of streaks due to suppression of the instability. Flow visualization at C up to 10 also show similar features, suggesting that convective turbulence is sustained by these three typical processes.</description>

      <title>Godunov Loss Functions for Modelling of Hyperbolic Conservation Laws</title>

Abstract: Machine learning techniques are being used as an alternative to traditional numerical discretization methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to fluid flow. Whilst numerical methods are higher fidelity, they are computationally expensive. Machine learning methods on the other hand are lower fidelity but can provide significant speed-ups. The emergence of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) in fluid dynamics has allowed scientists to directly use PDEs for evaluating loss functions. The downfall of this approach is that the differential form of systems is invalid at regions of shock inherent in hyperbolic PDEs such as the compressible Euler equations. To circumvent this problem we propose the Godunov loss function: a loss based on the finite volume method (FVM) that crucially incorporates the flux of Godunov-type methods. These Godunov-type methods are also known as approximate Riemann solvers and evaluate intercell fluxes in an entropy-satisfying and non-oscillatory manner, yielding more physically accurate shocks. Our approach leads to superior performance compared to PINNs that use regularized PDE-based losses as well as standard FVM-based losses, as tested on the 2D Riemann problem in the context of time-stepping and super-resolution reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Inferring turbulent velocity and temperature fields and their statistics from Lagrangian velocity measurements using physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

Abstract: We propose the Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT) method to infer hidden temperature fields from experimental turbulent velocity data. This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuous temperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. Specifically, AIVT is based on physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (not neural networks) and is trained by optimizing a combined loss function that minimizes the residuals of the velocity data, boundary conditions, and the governing equations. We apply AIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperature and velocity data of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) that we acquired by combining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. This allows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly. We demonstrate that we can reconstruct and infer continuous and instantaneous velocity and temperature fields from sparse experimental data at a fidelity comparable to direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence. This, in turn, enables us to compute important quantities for quantifying turbulence, such as fluctuations, viscous and thermal dissipation, and QR distribution. This paradigm shift in processing experimental data using AIVT to infer turbulent fields at DNS-level fidelity is a promising avenue in breaking the current deadlock of quantitative understanding of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, where DNS is computationally infeasible.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Onsager's Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:1608.08301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $\alpha &lt; 1/3$, we construct weak solutions to the $3D$ incompressible Euler equations in the class $C_tC_x^\alpha$ that have nonempty, compact support in time on ${\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb T}^3$ and therefore fail to conserve the total kinetic energy. This result, together with the proof of energy conservation for $\alpha &gt; 1/3$ due to [Eyink] and [Constantin, E, Titi], solves Onsager's conjecture that the exponent $\alpha = 1/3$ marks the threshold for conservation of energy for weak solutions in the class $L_t^\infty C_x^\alpha$. The previous best results were solutions in the class $C_tC_x^\alpha$ for $\alpha &lt; 1/5$, due to the author, and in the class $L_t^1 C_x^\alpha$ for $\alpha &lt; 1/3$ due to Buckmaster, De Lellis and Sz\'{e}kelyhidi, both based on the method of convex integration developed for the incompressible Euler equations by De Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi. The present proof combines the method of convex integration and a new "gluing approximation" technique. The convex integration part of the proof relies on the "Mikado flows" introduced by [Daneri, Sz\'ekelyhidi] and the framework of estimates developed in the author's previous work.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Degenerate Einstein Model of Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10682</link>

Abstract: Our Recent advancements in stochastic processes have illuminated a paradox associated with the Einstein model of Brownian motion. The model predicts an infinite propagation speed, conflicting with the second law of thermodynamics. The modified model successfully resolves the issue, establishing a finite propagation speed by introducing a concentration-dependent diffusion matrix. In this paper, we outline the necessary conditions for this property through a counter-example. The second part of the paper focuses on the stability analysis of the solution of the degenerate Einstein model. We introduce a functional dependence on the solution that satisfies a specific ordinary differential inequality. Our investigation explores the solution's dependence on the boundary and initial data of the original problem, demonstrating asymptotic stability under various conditions. These results have practical applications in understanding stochastic processes within bounded domains.</description>
