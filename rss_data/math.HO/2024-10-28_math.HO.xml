      <title>Hard Proofs and Good Reasons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practicing mathematicians often assume that mathematical claims, when they are true, have good reasons to be true. Such a state of affairs is "unreasonable", in Wigner's sense, because basic results in computational complexity suggest that there are a large number of theorems that have only exponentially-long proofs, and such proofs can not serve as good reasons for the truths of what they establish. Either mathematicians are adept at encountering only the reasonable truths, or what mathematicians take to be good reasons do not always lead to equivalently good proofs. Both resolutions raise new problems: either, how it is that we come to care about the reasonable truths before we have any inkling of how they might be proved, or why there should be good reasons, beyond those of deductive proof, for the truth of mathematical statements. Taking this dilemma seriously provides a new way to make sense of the unstable ontologies found in contemporary mathematics, and new ways to understand how non-human, but intelligent, systems might found new mathematics on inhuman "alien" lemmas.</description>

      <title>Elementary real analysis without compactness argument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a famous paper, R. A. Gordon proved a dozen theorems using tagged partitions and Cousin's theorem. Recently, I gave simple proofs of extreme value theorem and intermediate value theorem using the key-lemma underlying Cousin's theorem. The purpose of this paper is to present some further applications of such a lemma.</description>

      <title>Children's Drawings and the Riemann-Hilbert Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.12651</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.12651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dessin d'enfants (French for children's drawings) serve as a unique standpoint of studying classical complex analysis under the lens of combinatorial constructs. A thorough development of the background of this theory is developed with an emphasis on the relationship of monodromy to Dessins, which serve as a pathway to the Riemann Hilbert problem. This paper investigates representations of Dessins by permutations, the connection of Dessins to a particular class of Riemann surfaces established by Belyi's theorem and how these combinatorial objects provide another perspective of solving the discrete Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>
