      <title>A $3\times3$ linear $q$-difference system with $E_8^{(1)}$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a linear $q$-difference equation of rank $3$, which admits the affine Weyl group symmetry of type $E_8^{(1)}$. We further compare this equation with Moriyama-Yamada's quantum curve which has $W(E_8^{(1)})$-symmetry. The symmetry of our equation is provided by the $q$-middle convolution, defined by Sakai-Yamaguchi and reformulated by Arai-Takemura. In this paper, we provide a reconstruction of the $q$-middle convolution via a $q$-Okubo type equation.</description>

      <title>Fixed points and holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}_q^1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been observed that, in contrast to the classical case, holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}_q^1$ are not uniquely determined by degree. In this work, we develop a fixed-point-theoretic framework for the analysis of flat $\overline\partial$-connections that define holomorphic structures on line bundles over the quantum projective line. Within this framework, we establish sufficient conditions ensuring the gauge equivalence of holomorphic connections. Furthermore, we obtain a necessary and sufficient criterion characterising when two such holomorphic connections are gauge equivalent. This criterion is formulated in terms of the existence of fixed points, lying in the open unit ball, of certain nonlinear maps acting on an appropriate Banach space.</description>

      <title>On De Concini-Kac forms of quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum groups of semisimple Lie algebras at roots of unity admit several different forms. Among them is the De Concini-Kac form, which is the easiest to define but, perhaps, hardest to study. In this paper, we propose a suitable modification to the De Concini-Kac form, namely the even part algebra, which has some appealing features. Notably, it behaves uniformly with respect to the order of the roots of unity and admits an adjoint action of the Lusztig form. We revisit several results due to De Concini-Kac-Procesi and Tanisaki for the even part algebra. Namely, we give conceptual definitions of the Frobenius and Harish-Chandra centers and describe the entire center in terms of these two subalgebras getting a complete quantum analog of the Veldkamp theorem on the center of the universal enveloping algebras in positive characteristic. We investigate the Azumaya locus of the even part algebra over its center. We also show that the locally finite part of the even part algebra under the adjoint action of the Lusztig form is isomorphic to the reflection equation algebra, which is the quantized coordinate algebra with the product twisted by $R$-matrix. Some results on Lusztig forms at roots of unity are revisited and proved in greater generality including Kempf vanishing theorem and good filtrations on the quantized coordinate algebra.</description>

      <title>Quantum Howe duality and Schur duality of type AIII</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new connection between the iHowe duality of type AIII established by Luo-Xu and the iSchur duality established by Bao-Wang. We show that iweight $\overline{\rho}$ space in the iHowe duality is naturally isomorphic to the tensor space in the iSchur duality. Under this isomorphism, we show that the relative braid group action on this iweight space coincides with the action of the type B Hecke algebra in the iSchur duality. As a consequence, we derive from multiplicity-free decompositions that the iweight $\overline{\rho}$ spaces of irreducible modules over iquantum groups are irreducible modules over the type B Hecke algebra. Meanwhile, in the iHowe duality, we identify the relative braid group action from one side with the action of $K$-matrices and $R$-matrices from the other side.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a quantum version of the $n$-dimer model from statistical mechanics, based on the formalism from quantum topology developed by Reshetikhin and Turaev (the latter which, in particular, can be used to construct the Jones polynomial of a knot in $\mathbb{R}^3$). We apply this machinery to construct an isotopy invariant polynomial for knotted bipartite ribbon graphs in $\mathbb{R}^3$, giving, in the planar setting, a quantum $n$-dimer partition function. As one application, we compute the expected number of loops in the (classical) double dimer model for planar bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Wild genus-zero quantum de Rham spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17666v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The wild de Rham spaces parameterize isomorphism classes of (stable) meromorphic connections, defined on principal bundles over wild Riemann surfaces. Working on the Riemann sphere, we will deformation-quantize the standard open part of de Rham spaces, which corresponds to the moduli of linear ordinary differential equations with meromorphic coefficients. We treat the general untwisted/unramified case with nonresonant semisimple formal residue, for any polar divisor and reductive structure group. The main ingredients are: (i) constructing the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of a (tensor) product of quantized coadjoint orbits in dual truncated-current Lie algebras, involving the corresponding category-O Verma modules; and (ii) establishing sufficient conditions on the coadjoint orbits, so that generically all meromorphic connections are stable, and the (semiclassical) moment map for the gauge-group action is faithfully flat.</description>

Abstract: We consider the $R$-matrix presentations of the quantum queer superalgebra $U_q(q_n)$ and its affine counterpart $U_q(\widehat q_n)$. We derive crossing symmetry relations for the $R$-matrices and use them to construct central elements in both superalgebras. We also produce an epimorphism $ev:U_q(\widehat q_n)\to U_q(q_n)$ identical on the subalgebra isomorphic to $U_q(q_n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05504v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum loop group associated to a general symmetric Cartan matrix, by imposing just enough relations between the usual generators $\{e_{i,k}, f_{i,k}\}_{i \in I, k \in \mathbb{Z}}$ in order for the natural Hopf pairing between the positive and negative halves of the quantum loop group to be perfect. As an application, we describe the localized K-theoretic Hall algebra of any quiver without loops, endowed with a particularly important $\mathbb{C}^*$ action.</description>

      <title>Parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation: p-racks, solutions &amp; quantum algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04088v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the parametric set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation is established from a purely algebraic point of view. The first step towards this objective is the introduction of certain generalizations of the familiar shelves and racks called parametric (p)-shelves and racks. These objects satisfy a parametric self-distributivity condition and lead to solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Novel, non-reversible solutions are obtained from p-shelf/rack solutions by a suitable parametric twist, whereas all reversible set-theoretic solutions are reduced to the identity map via a parametric twist. The universal algebras associated to both p-rack and generic parametric, set-theoretic solutions are next presented and the corresponding universal R-matrices are derived. The admissible universal Drinfel'd twist is constructed allowing the derivation of the general set-theoretic universal R-matrix. By introducing the concept of a parametric coproduct we prove the existence of a parametric co-associativity. We show that the parametric coproduct is an algebra homomorphism and the universal R-matrices satisfy intertwining relations with the algebra coproducts</description>

      <title>Defining extended TQFTs via handle attachments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a finite presentation of the cobordism symmetric monoidal bicategory of (smooth, oriented) closed manifolds, cobordisms and cobordisms with corners as an extension of the bicategory of closed manifolds, cobordisms and diffeomorphisms. The generators are the standard handle attachments, and the relations are handle cancellations and invariance under reversing the orientation of the attaching spheres.
  In other words, given a categorified TQFT and 2-morphisms associated to the standard handles satisfying our relations, we construct a once extended TQFT.</description>

      <title>Gauge origami and quiver W-algebras IV: Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-characters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a contour integral formalism for computing the K-theoretic equivariant 3-vertex. Within the Jeffrey--Kirwan (JK) residue framework, we show that, by an appropriate choice of the reference vector, both the equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT) and Pandharipande--Thomas (PT) 3-vertices can be extracted from the same integrand. We analyze three distinct limits of the PT 3-vertex, recovering the unrefined topological vertex, the refined topological vertex, and the Macdonald refined topological vertex. Higher-rank extensions of PT counting and the DT/PT correspondence are also explored. From a quantum algebraic perspective, we construct an operator version of the equivariant PT 3-vertex and term it the Pandharipande--Thomas $qq$-character. We then discuss its connection with the quantum toroidal $\mathfrak{gl}_{1}$.</description>

      <title>Self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with transversal Clifford gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bivariate bicycle codes are promising candidates for high-threshold, low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum memories. Meanwhile, color codes are the most prominent self-dual CSS codes, supporting transversal Clifford gates that have been demonstrated experimentally. In this work, we combine these advantages and introduce a broad family of self-dual bivariate bicycle codes. These codes achieve higher encoding rates than surface and color codes while admitting transversal CNOT, Hadamard, and $S$ gates. In particular, we enumerate weight-8 self-dual bivariate bicycle codes with up to $n \leq 200$ physical qubits, realized on twisted tori that enhance code distance and improve stabilizer locality. Representative examples include codes with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$: $[[16,4,4]]$, $[[40,6,6]]$, $[[56,6,8]]$, $[[64,8,8]]$, $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[152,6,16]]$, and $[[160,8,16]]$.</description>

      <title>Classification of real and imaginary modules of quantum affine algebras in monoidal categorifications of affine cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Kashiwara-Kim-Oh-Park introduced a wide family of monoidal categories of finite-dimensional representations of quantum affine algebras, which provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras. In this paper, we prove that, for types $ADE$, some of these categories provide monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras of affine type. Moreover, by means of the combinatorial theory of affine type cluster algebras, we give a complete classification of real and imaginary simple modules in these categories. In particular, we show that, in these cases, the conjecture asserting that real simple modules correspond exactly to cluster monomials holds.</description>
