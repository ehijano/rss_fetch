      <title>Topological Phases of Many-Body Localized Systems: Beyond Eigenstate Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) lends remarkable robustness to nonequilibrium phases of matter. Such phases can show topological and symmetry breaking order in their ground and excited states, but they may also belong to an fanomalous localized topological phase (ALT phase). All eigenstates in an ALT phase are trivial, in that they can be deformed to product states, but the entire Hamiltonian cannot be deformed to a trivial localized model without going through a delocalization transition. Using a correspondence between MBL phases with short-ranged entanglement and locality preserving unitaries -- called quantum cellular automata (QCA) -- we reduce the classification of ALT phases to that of QCA. This method extends to periodically (Floquet) and quasiperiodically driven ALT phases, and captures anomalous Floquet phases within the same framework as static phases. The QCA framework further generalizes to include symmetry-enriched ALT phases (SALT phases), and provides a large class of soluble models suitable for realization in quantum simulators. In systematizing the study of ALT phases, we both greatly extend the classification of interacting nonequilibrium systems and clarify a confusion in the literature which implicitly equates nontrivial Hamiltonians with nontrivial ground states.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Luttinger Liquids from sublattice dependent interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how Exceptional Points (EPs) naturally occur in the Luttinger Liquid (LL) theory describing the low-energy excitations of a microscopic lattice model with sublattice dependent electron-electron interaction. Upon bosonization, this sublattice dependence directly translates to a non-standard sine-Gordon-type term responsible for the non-Hermitian matrix structure of the single-particle Green Function (GF). As the structure in the lifetime of excitations does not commute with the underlying free Bloch Hamiltonian, non-Hermitian topological properties of the single-particle GF emerge -- despite our Hermitian model Hamiltonian. Both finite temperature and a non-trivial Luttinger parameter $K\neq 1$ are required for the formation of EPs, and their topological stability in one spatial dimension is guaranteed by the chiral symmetry of our model. In the presence of the aforementioned sine-Gordon-term, we resort to leading order Perturbation Theory (PT) to compute the single-particle GF. All qualitative findings derived within LL theory are corroborated by comparison to both numerical simulations within the conserving second Born approximation, and, for weak interactions and high temperatures, by fermionic plain PT. In certain parameter regimes, quantitative agreement can be reached by a suitable parameter choice in the effective bosonized model.</description>

      <title>Variational wave-functions for correlated metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a set of many-body wave-functions of Fermions that are naturally written using momentum space basis and allow for quantum superposition of Fermion occupancy, $\{n_{\bf k}\}$. This {enables} us to capture the fluctuations of the Fermi-surface {(FS)} -- the singularly most important signature of a metal. We bench-mark our results in one spatial dimensions (1D) to show that these wave-functions allow for quantitative understanding of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL); computations of certain correlators using them can in fact be extended to larger systems sizes compared to conventional exact diagonalization (ED) allowing for a more systematic comparison with bosonization techniques. Finally we show that this basis may be useful for obtaining fixed-point wave-function for strongly correlated metals {in dimensions greater that one}. In particular, we study the case of coherent (equal) superposition of elliptical FS {in continuum (2D) and on a} square lattice{. In case of the former, our variational wave-function systematically interpolates between the phenomenology of the Fermi liquid ground state, i.e., finite single-Fermion residue at a sharp FS, to a non-Fermi liquid (NFL) with zero residue. In the NFL the jump in $\langle n_{\bf k}\rangle$ at the FS is replaced by a point of inflection (similar to a 1D TLL) whose contour is consistent with the Luttinger Theorem. In case of the square lattice, we} find highly anisotropic distribution of the quasi-particle residue, which, at finite resolution has an uncanny resemblance to the Fermi-arcs{, albeit at zero temperature,} seen in the pseudo-gap state of the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments on altermagnetism, we investigate the Hubbard model on the Shastry-Sutherland lattice, where the onsite repulsion between electrons induces the onset of a staggered magnetic order in which opposite magnetic sublattices are related to each other only by rotations and glide reflections, and not by inversion nor translations. As a consequence, the magnetic phase displays an altermagnetic character, i.e. a finite (non-relativistic) Zeeman splitting of the electronic excitations, despite the absence of a net magnetization. By means of a variational Monte Carlo approach based on Jastrow-Slater wave functions, which accounts for electronic correlations beyond the single-particle approximation, we study how $d$-wave altermagnetism shows up in the ground state properties and in the spectral function of the system. We characterize the metal-insulator transition between altermagnetic phases at half-filling and the stability of altermagnetism as a function of doping. The calculation of the single-particle spectral function displays the spin-split nature of the electronic excitations, also within the Mott insulating regime. We discuss possible realizations of the model in the context of organic $\alpha$- or $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X charge transfer salts.</description>

      <title>Constructive Fermionic Matrix Product States for Projected Fermi Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected wave functions offer a means for incorporating local correlation effects in gapless electronic phases of matter like metals. Although such wave functions can be readily specified formally, it is challenging to compute their associated physical observables. Tensor network approaches offer a modern numerical method for this task. In this work, we develop and demonstrate a constructive tensor-network approach for obtaining physical quantities, like fermion two-point functions and density-density correlation functions, for one-dimensional projected Fermi sea states. We benchmark our method against exact analytical results for spin-1/2 electrons subjected to the Gutzwiller projection, and then present results on spinless fermions with nearest-neighbor repulsion. For a state with two pairs of Fermi points, we reveal a correlation-tuning of the characteristic wave vector of the charge density modulation in the system.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior and giant field-enhancement of the thermal conductivity in the honeycomb antiferromagnet BaCo2(AsO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered honeycomb material BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO) is of topical interest because its magnetic state is related to that of the Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using thermal transport to probe how magnetic excitations interact with phonons, we have uncovered an unusually large enhancement of the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ in an in-plane magnetic field ${\bf H}$. Just above the N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$, a field of 13 T increases $\kappa_{xx}$ by a factor ($\sim 211$), much larger than reported previously in any magnetic insulator. Interestingly, $\kappa_{xx}(H,T)$ exhibits a scaling behavior in the entire magnetically disordered region that surrounds the ordered zigzag state.</description>

      <title>Proposal for unambiguous measurement of braid statistics in fractional quantum Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasiparticles (QPs) or quasiholes (QHs) of fractional quantum Hall states have been predicted to obey fractional braid statistics, which refers to the Berry phase (in addition to the usual Aharonov-Bohm phase) associated with an exchange of two QPs or two QHs, or equivalently, to half of the phase associated with a QP / QH going around another. Certain phase slips in interference experiments in the fractional quantum Hall regime have been interpreted as arising from the statistics associated with a QP moving along the edge of the sample around another QP in the interior. A conceptual difficulty with this interpretation is that the edge, being compressible, does not support a QP or a QH with a sharply quantized fractional charge or fractional statistics. We analyze the experiment in terms of composite fermions (CFs) obeying integral braid statistics and suggest that the observed phase slips can be naturally understood as a measure of the relative braid statistics of a CF in the ground state at the edge and a fractionally charged QP / QH in the interior; in contrast to fractionally charged excitations, the CFs are known to remain sharply defined even in compressible regions such as the edge or the CF Fermi liquid state at half filled Landau level. We further propose that transport through a closed $\textit{tunneling}$ loop confined entirely in the bulk can, in principle, allow an unambiguous measurement of the relative braid statistics of a fractionally charged QP / QH braiding around another fractionally charged QP / QH. Optimal parameters for this experimental geometry are determined from quantitative calculations.</description>

      <title>Efficient conversion from fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian states are eigenstates of quadratic Hamiltonians and widely used in quantum many-body problems. We propose a highly efficient algorithm that converts fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states. It can be formulated for finite-size systems without translation invariance, but becomes particularly appealing when applied to infinite systems with translation invariance. If the ground states of a topologically ordered system on infinite cylinders are expressed as matrix product states, then the fixed points of the transfer matrix can be harnessed to filter out the anyon eigenbasis, also known as minimally entangled states. This allows for efficient computation of universal properties such as entanglement spectrum and modular matrices. The potential of our method is demonstrated by numerical calculations in two chiral spin liquids that have the same topological orders as the bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states, respectively. The anyon eigenbasis for the first one has been worked out before and serves as a useful benchmark. The anyon eigenbasis of the second one is, however, not transparent and its successful construction provides a nontrivial corroboration of our method.</description>

      <title>Pressure-tuned magnetism and conductivity in pyrochlore iridates Lu2Ir2O7 and Er2Ir2O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A2Ir2O7 iridates were proven to crystallise in the geometrically frustrated pyrochlore structure, which remains stable upon rare-earth cation substitution, temperature variation, and external pressure application. However, the change of interatomic distances and local distortions in the lattice frequently leads to complex electronic properties. The low-temperature behaviour in light-A iridates has been thoroughly investigated, including its evolution with pressure. The present pressure study reports the electrical transport and magnetotransport properties in heavy rare-earth Lu2Ir2O7 and Er2Ir2O7. Both compounds reveal a semiconductor-to-insulator transition induced by the antiferromagnetic ordering of the all-in-all-out (AIAO) type in the Ir sublattice. The transition monotonously shifts to a higher temperature under applied pressure by approximately 20 K at 3 GPa. As the transition in resistivity originates in the antiferromagnetic order, the latter is expected to be enhanced with the applied pressure as well. Upon cooling the compound in a magnetic field, the AIAO/AOAI domain structure with non-zero net magnetic moment is formed, mirroring itself in an asymmetric term in the magnetoresistance of Lu2Ir2O7. The application of pressure then enhances the asymmetric term. The same behaviour is proposed for the whole heavy rare-earth A2Ir2O7 series (A = Gd - Lu), although with magnetoresistance features masked significantly by a stronger response of magnetic A cations.</description>

      <title>Polaron formation in insulators and the key role of hole scattering processes: Band insulators, charge density waves and Mott transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mobile impurity immersed in a non-interacting Fermi sea is dressed by the gapless particle-hole excitations of the fermionic medium. This conventional Fermi-polaron setting is well described by the so-called ladder approximation, which consists in neglecting impurity-hole scattering processes. In this work, we analyze polaron formation in the context of insulating states of matter, considering increasing levels of correlation in the medium:~band insulators originating from external periodic potentials, spontaneously-formed charge density waves, and a Fermi-Hubbard system undergoing a metal-Mott insulator transition. The polaron spectral function is shown to exhibit striking signatures of the underlying fermionic background, such as the single-particle band gap, particle-hole symmetry and the transition to the Mott state. These signatures are identified within the framework of the Chevy ansatz, i.e. upon restricting the Hilbert space to single particle-hole excitations. Interestingly, we find that the ladder approximation is inaccurate in these band systems, due to the fact that the particle and hole scattering phase spaces are comparable. Our results provide a step forward in the understanding of polaron formation in correlated many-body media, which are relevant to both cold-atom and semiconductor experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of the interacting SSH model: an analytical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interacting SSH model provides an ideal ground to study the interplay between topologically insulating phases and electron-electron interactions. We study the polarization density as a topological invariant and provide an analytic treatment of its behavior in the low-energy sector of the one-dimensional interacting SSH model. By formulating the topological invariant in terms of Green's functions, we use the low-energy field theory of the Thirring model to derive the behavior of the polarization density. We show that the polarization density in the continuum theory describes the usual topological insulating phases. Still, it contains an extra factor from the fields' scaling dimensions in the low-energy quantum field theory. We interpret this as a measure of the modified charge of the new excitations in the system. We find two distinct contributions: a renormalization of the electronic charge $e$ of a Fermi liquid because of quasiparticle smearing and an additional contribution coming from the topological charge of the soliton arising in the bosonized version of the Thirring model, the sine-Gordon model.</description>

      <title>Classical Benchmarks for Variational Quantum Eigensolver Simulations of the Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the Hubbard model is of great interest to a wide range of applications within condensed matter physics, however its solution on classical computers remains challenging in dimensions larger than one. The relative simplicity of this model, embodied by the sparseness of the Hamiltonian matrix, allows for its efficient implementation on quantum computers, and for its approximate solution using variational algorithms such as the variational quantum eigensolver. While these algorithms have been shown to reproduce the qualitative features of the Hubbard model, their quantitative accuracy in terms of producing true ground state energies and other properties, and the dependence of this accuracy on the system size and interaction strength, the choice of variational ansatz, and the degree of spatial inhomogeneity in the model, remains unknown. Here we present a rigorous classical benchmarking study, demonstrating the potential impact of these factors on the accuracy of the variational solution of the Hubbard model on quantum hardware. We find that even when using the most accurate wavefunction ans\"{a}tze for the Hubbard model, the error in its ground state energy and wavefunction plateaus for larger lattices, while stronger electronic correlations magnify this issue. Concurrently, spatially inhomogeneous parameters and the presence of off-site Coulomb interactions only have a small effect on the accuracy of the computed ground state energies. Our study highlights the capabilities and limitations of current approaches for solving the Hubbard model on quantum hardware, and we discuss potential future avenues of research.</description>

      <title>Petz map recovery for long-range entangled quantum many-body states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a tripartite quantum state on $A,B,C$ and the erasure channel on $C$, the rotated Petz map is a recovery channel that acts on $B$ to recover the erased quantum information. The infidelity of the best recovery is upper-bounded by the conditional mutual information (CMI). In this work, we study the infidelity of the rotated Petz map on several physically-relevant long-range entangled quantum states. Specifically, we study three classes of quantum phases: (i) steady states of measurement-induced phase transitions, (ii) critical ground state under local measurements, and (iii) chiral states under local measurements. We find that the average Petz map infidelity sharply distinguishes the three classes: (i) and (ii) are distinguished by the scaling of the infidelity with CMI and (iii) is characterized by an asymmetry of the infidelity with the rotation parameter. We also study Petz map recovery for topological order and find an operational interpretation of the topological entanglement entropy. Our result indicates that the Petz map fidelity is a useful diagnostic of quantum phases of matter.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Bosonic and Fermionic One-Form Symmetries in $2+1$d and 't Hooft Anomaly Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the fundamental role that bosonic and fermionic symmetries play in physics, we study (non-invertible) one-form symmetries in $2 + 1$d consisting of topological lines with bosonic and fermionic self-statistics. We refer to these lines as Bose-Fermi-Braided (BFB) symmetries and argue that they can be classified. Unlike the case of generic anyonic lines, BFB symmetries are closely related to groups. In particular, when BFB lines are non-invertible, they are non-intrinsically non-invertible. Moreover, BFB symmetries are, in a categorical sense, weakly group theoretical. Using this understanding, we study invariants of renormalization group flows involving non-topological QFTs with BFB symmetry.</description>

      <title>Strongly correlated Hofstadter subbands in minimally twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene has been proven to be a versatile platform for exploring exotic quantum phases. Extensive investigations have been invoked focusing on the zero-magnetic-field phase diagram at the magic twist angle around $\theta=1.1\degree$, which has been indicated to be an exclusive regime for exhibiting flat band with the interplay of strong electronic correlation and untrivial topology in the experiment so far. In contrast, electronic bands in non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene host dominant electronic kinetic energy compared to Coulomb interaction. By quenching the kinetic energy and enhancing Coulomb exchange interactions by means of an applied perpendicular magnetic field, here we unveil gapped flat Hofstadter subbands at large magnetic flux that yield correlated insulating states in minimally twisted bilayer graphene at $\theta=0.41\degree$. These states appear with isospin symmetry breaking due to strong Coulomb interactions. Our work provides a platform for studying the phase transition of the strongly correlated Hofstadter spectrum.</description>

      <title>Confinement of quasi-atomic structures in Ti$_2$N and Ti$_3$N$_2$ MXene Electrides</title>

Abstract: Metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides of early transition metals, better known as MXenes, possess notable structural, electrical, and magnetic properties. Analyzing electronic structures by calculating structural stability, band structure, density of states, Bader charge transfer, and work functions utilizing first principle calculations, we revealed that titanium nitride Mxenes, namely Ti$_2$N and Ti$_3$N$_2$, have excess anionic electrons in their pseudo-atomic structure inside the crystal lattice, making them MXene electrides. Bulk Ti$_3$N$_2$ has competing antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic(FM) configurations with slightly more stable AFM configurations, while the Ti$_2$N MXene is nonmagnetic. Although Ti$_3$N$_2$ favors AFM configurations with hexagonal crystal systems having $6/mmm$ point group symmetry, Ti$_3$N$_2$ does not support altermagnetism. The monolayer of the Ti$_3$N$_2$ MXene is a ferromagnetic electride. These unique properties of having non-nuclear interstitial anionic electrons in the electronic structure of titanium nitride MXene have not yet been reported in the literature. Density functional theory calculations show TiN is neither an electride, MXene, or magnetic.</description>

      <title>Electronic Landscape of Group-5 Transition Metal Ditellurides $M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = V, Nb, Ta): Multiple Crystal Phases with Local Bonds and Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Group-5 transition metal ditellurides $M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = V, Nb, Ta) are unique CdI$_2$-type layered materials that exhibit peculiar quasi-one-dimensional intralayer superstructures, known as ribbon-chains and butterfly-like clusters of $M$ atoms. In this review article, we attempt to systematically understand their electronic band structures based on our recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies and first-principles calculations. We underscore the role of the localized molecular-like orbital bonds that form the anomalous flat bands in the momentum space, and demonstrate how they influence the Fermi surface anisotropy, phase stabilities of crystal structures, and nontrivial topological properties in some cases. We also elaborate the future prospects for novel quantum phenomena that can be realized in these materials.</description>

      <title>p-wave superconductivity induced by nearest-neighbor attraction in the square-lattice extended Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The two-dimensional (2D) Hubbard model is widely believed to contain the key ingredients of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprate materials. Here, we report a constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) study of the square-lattice extended Hubbard model with on-site Coulomb repulsion U and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron attraction V. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.125, we find that the NN electron attraction V can notably drive an exotic spin-triplet (p-wave) superconducting (SC) phase, and enhance the p-wave SC correlations with the increase of V. But in the intermediate coupling regime, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave (d-wave) does not significantly increase with the increase of V, indicating that the d-wave is not affected by V in strongly correlated system. Besides the pairing phase, a spin density wave (SDW) only exists near the half-filling in the particle-hole channel, and doping disrupts the formation of SDW order. Especially, the NN electron attraction V has no significant effect on SDW, reflecting the consistent relationship between d-wave SC and spin correlation. Moreover, as doping increases, the dominant region of p-wave also expands, further suppressing the presence of d-wave, which may help explain the disappearance of d-wave SC in overdoped cuprate superconductors. We also find the d-wave exhibits a singular nonzero (near point ($2{\pi}/3, {\pi}$)) condensation structure in momentum space, resulting in a different staggered behavior in the x and y direction with distance in real space. On the contrary, the p-wave condensed at zero momentum, and the p-wave correlation exhibits exponential decay in real space. Our work suggests the p-wave SC region can be induced and further broadened by the NN electron attraction V, offering a feasible mechanism to realize p-wave superconductivity in realistic cuprate materials.</description>

      <title>Displacive Jahn--Teller transition in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Below its Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{JT}$, NaNiO$_2$ has a monoclinic layered structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing NaO$_6$ and Jahn-Teller-distorted NiO$_6$ octahedra. Above $T_\mathrm{JT}$ where NaNiO$_2$ is rhombohedral, diffraction measurements show the absence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, accompanied by an increase in the unit cell volume. Using neutron total scattering, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments as local probes of the structure we find direct evidence for a displacive, as opposed to order-disorder Jahn-Teller transition at $T_\mathrm{JT}$. This is supported by \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To our knowledge this study is the first to show a displacive Jahn-Teller transition in any material using direct observations with local probe techniques.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi Liquid Behavior of the $t$-$J$ Model in the Strange Metal Phase: $U(1)$ Gauge Theory Consistent with Local Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03074v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the slave particle representation with $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, local constraints on physical states characterized by various mean field solutions belong to Dirac's second-class ones. Although constrained systems are extensively investigated, realistic methods to solve the gauge theory problem with second-class constraints are yet to be developed. We formulate a Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) quantization theory, called consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, that is consistent with both first- and second-class local constraints for strongly correlated condensed matter systems. In our consistent $U(1)$ gauge theory, the redundant gauge degrees of freedom are removed by proper gauge fixing conditions while the constraints are exactly retained and the gauge invariance is guaranteed by the BRST symmetry. Furthermore, the gauge fixing conditions endow the gauge field with dynamics. This turns the strongly correlated electron model into a weakly coupled slave boson model, so most of the system's physical properties can be calculated by the conventional quantum many-body perturbation method. We focus on the property of the strange metal phase in the $t$-$J$ model. The electron momentum distribution and the spectral function are calculated, and the non-Fermi liquid behavior agrees with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements for cuprate materials. We also study the electromagnetic responses of the strange metal state. The observed non-Fermi liquid anomalies are captured by our calculations. Especially, we find that the Hall resistivity decreases as temperature increases, and the sign of the Hall resistivity varies from negative to positive when the dopant concentration varies from optimal doping to underdoping in the strange metal regime.</description>

      <title>A simple linear algebra identity to optimize Large-Scale Neural Network Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural-network architectures have been increasingly used to represent quantum many-body wave functions. These networks require a large number of variational parameters and are challenging to optimize using traditional methods, as gradient descent. Stochastic Reconfiguration (SR) has been effective with a limited number of parameters, but becomes impractical beyond a few thousand parameters. Here, we leverage a simple linear algebra identity to show that SR can be employed even in the deep learning scenario. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by optimizing a Deep Transformer architecture with $3 \times 10^5$ parameters, achieving state-of-the-art ground-state energy in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model at $J_2/J_1=0.5$ on the $10\times10$ square lattice, a challenging benchmark in highly-frustrated magnetism. This work marks a significant step forward in the scalability and efficiency of SR for Neural-Network Quantum States, making them a promising method to investigate unknown quantum phases of matter, where other methods struggle.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of temperature-dependent magnetism in spin-orbit-coupled transition metal compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A few $4d$ and $5d$ transition metal compounds with various electron fillings were recently found to exhibit magnetic susceptibilities $\chi$ and magnetic moments that deviate from the well-established Kotani model. This model has been considered for decades to be the canonical expression to describe the temperature dependence of magnetism in systems with non-negligible spin-orbit coupling effects. In this work, we uncover the origin of such discrepancies and determine the applicability and limitations of the Kotani model by calculating the temperature dependence of the magnetic moments of a series of $4d$ (Ru-based) and $5d$ (W-based) systems at different electron fillings. For this purpose, we perform exact diagonalization of $ab~initio$-derived relativistic multiorbital Hubbard models on finite clusters and compute their magnetic susceptibilities. Comparison with experimentally measured magnetic properties indicates that contributions such as a temperature independent $\chi_0$ background, crystal field effects, Coulomb and Hund's couplings, and intersite interactions - not included in the Kotani model - are specially crucial to correctly describe the temperature dependence of $\chi$ and magnetic moments at various electron fillings in these systems. Based on our results, we propose a generalized approach to describe their magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict a general local spin-flip transition mechanism caused by magnetic quantum impurities in (partially) polarized phases of quantum magnets in the absence of conservation laws. This transition arises when a magnon bound state crosses zero energy as function of the magnetic field. As application, we study 2D van der Waals magnets described by the Kitaev-Heisenberg honeycomb model which applies to the transition metal trihalides CrI$_3$ and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We consider adatom and substitutional impurity positions, and show how spin-flip transitions can be detected in scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>Crystal-symmetry-paired spin-valley locking in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent theoretical efforts predicted a type of unconventional antiferromagnet characterized by the crystal symmetry C (rotation or mirror), which connects antiferromagnetic sublattices in real space and simultaneously couples spin and momentum in reciprocal space. This results in a unique C-paired spin-valley locking (SVL) and corresponding novel properties such as piezomagnetism and noncollinear spin current even without spin-orbit coupling. However, the unconventional antiferromagnets reported thus far are not layered materials, limiting their potential in spintronic applications. Additionally, they do not meet the necessary symmetry requirements for nonrelativistic spin current. Here, we report the realization of C-paired SVL in a layered room-temperature antiferromagnetic compound, Rb1-{\delta}V2Te2O. Spin resolved photoemission measurements directly demonstrate the opposite spin splitting between C-paired valleys. Quasi-particle interference patterns reveal the suppression of inter-valley scattering due to the spin selection rules, as a direct consequence of C-paired SVL. All these experiments are well consistent with the results obtained from first-principles calculations. Our observations represent the first realization of layered antiferromagnets with C-paired SVL, enabling both the advantages of layered materials and possible control through crystal symmetry manipulation. These results hold significant promise and broad implications for advancements in magnetism, electronics, and information technology.</description>

      <title>Topological Defect Lines in bosonized Parafermionic CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16555v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defect lines (TDLs) are extended line operators which act on the Hilbert space of two-dimensional CFTs and satisfy non-trivial fusion algebras when forming junctions. Among the most interesting fusion algebras are the so-called Tambara-Yamagami (TY) fusion categories which are realized in (bosonized) Parafermionic CFTs. The corresponding TY[$\mathbb{Z}_k$]-categories have been explicitly realized for the cases $k=2$, $k=3$, and $k=4$ together with the action of the defect lines on the Hilbert space of the corresponding CFTs. For each of the cases, different methods have been used in the previous literature. In the current paper, we present a unified framework for finding the TDLs in bosonized Parafermionic CFTs. Our approach relies on combining several previously used methods and the definition of an extended $S$ matrix. We apply the method to the cases $k=2$ to $k=5$ to extract corresponding TDL fusion algebras.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedups for quantum walks in random hierarchical graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are few known exponential speedups for quantum algorithms and these tend to fall into even fewer families. One speedup that has mostly resisted generalization is the use of quantum walks to traverse the welded-tree graph, due to Childs, Cleve, Deotto, Farhi, Gutmann, and Spielman. We show how to generalize this to a large class of hierarchical graphs in which the vertices are grouped into "supervertices" which are arranged according to a $d$-dimensional lattice. Supervertices can have different sizes, and edges between supervertices correspond to random connections between their constituent vertices.
  The hitting times of quantum walks on these graphs are related to the localization properties of zero modes in certain disordered tight binding Hamiltonians. The speedups range from superpolynomial to exponential, depending on the underlying dimension and the random graph model. We also provide concrete realizations of these hierarchical graphs, and introduce a general method for constructing graphs with efficient quantum traversal times using graph sparsification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore theoretically the generation of entangled two-photon pairs by Cooper pair recombination in a noncentrosymmetric [001]-quantum well superconductor, driven by a forward-biased p-n junction with a superconducting layer which exhibits admixture Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that the highest achievable purity of entangled photon pairs emerges within scenarios involving pure singlet Cooper pairs, specifically, the conventional $s$-wave gap function. Our results highlight the importance of minimizing the charge-carrier level concentration and balancing the magnitudes of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings to achieve entangled states with enhanced purity, which can be realized by reducing the amplitudes of antisymmetric spin-orbit couplings. In addition to purity concerns, to explore the distribution of two-photon states, we compare their population across entangled pairs for potential superconducting pairings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order parameters represent a fundamental resource to characterize quantum matter. We show that pair superfluids can be rigorously defined in terms of a nonlocal order parameter, named odd parity, which derivation is experimentally accessible by local density measurements. As a case of study, we first investigate a constrained Bose-Hubbard model at different densities, both in one and two spatial dimensions. Here, our analysis finds pair superfluidity for relatively strong attractive interactions. The odd parity operator acts as the unique order parameter for such phase irrespectively to the density of the system and its dimensionality. In order to enforce our finding, we confirm the generality of our approach also on a two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, which experimental realization represents a timely topic in ultracold atomic systems. Our results shed new light on the role of correlated density fluctuations in pair superfluids. In addition, they provide a powerful tool for the experimental detection of such exotic phases and the characterization of their transition to the atomic superfluid phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  The limit $q\to1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. At finite size, only the latter is U(1)-symmetric.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry (HS) chains, as well as the Inozemtsev chain and its recent q-deformation. We find that the two landscapes only share a single point: the rational HS chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the anti-periodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

      <title>Critical Fermions are Universal Embezzlers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal embezzlers are bipartite quantum systems from which any entangled state may be extracted to arbitrary precision using local operations while perturbing the state of the system arbitrarily little. Here, we show that universal embezzlers are ubiquitous in many-body physics: The ground state sector of every local, translation-invariant, and critical free-fermionic many-body system on a one-dimensional lattice is a universal embezzler if bi-partitioned into two half-chains. The same property holds in locally-interacting, dual spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Universal embezzlement manifests already for finite system sizes, not only in the thermodynamic limit: For any finite error and any targeted entangled state, a finite length of the chain is sufficient to embezzle said state within the given error. On a technical level, our main result establishes that the half-chain observable algebras associated with ground state sectors of the given models are type III$_1$ factors.</description>

      <title>Dissipationless topological quantum computation for Majorana objects in sparse-dense mixed encoding process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum computation based on Majorana objects is subject to a significant challenge because at least some of the two-qubit quantum gates rely on the fermion (either charge or spin) parity of the qubits. This dependency renders the quantum operations involving these gates probabilistic when attempting to advance quantum processes within the quantum circuit model. Such an approach leads to significant information loss whenever measurements yield the undesired fermion parity. To resolve the problem of wasting information, we devise topological operations that allow for the non-dissipative correction of information from undesired fermion parity to the desired one. We will use the sparse-dense mixed encoding process for the controlled-NOT gate as an example to explain how corrections can be implemented without affecting the quantum information carried by the computational qubits. This correction process can be applied {to} either the undesired input qubits or the fermion parity-dependent quantum gates, and it works for both Majorana-zero-mode-based and Majorana-edge-mode-based topological quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Magic transition in measurement-only circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magic, also known as nonstabilizerness, quantifies the distance of a quantum state to the set of stabilizer states, and it serves as a necessary resource for potential quantum advantage over classical computing. In this work, we study magic in a measurement-only quantum circuit with competing types of Clifford and non-Clifford measurements, where magic is injected through the non-Clifford measurements. This circuit can be mapped to a classical model that can be simulated efficiently, and the magic can be characterized using any magic measure that is additive for tensor product of single-qubit states. Leveraging this observation, we study the magic transition in this circuit in both one- and two-dimensional lattices using large-scale numerical simulations. Our results demonstrate the presence of a magic transition between two different phases with extensive magic scaling, separated by a critical point in which the mutual magic exhibits scaling behavior analogous to entanglement. We further show that these two distinct phases can be distinguished by the topological magic. In a different regime, with a vanishing rate of non-Clifford measurements, we find that the magic saturates in both phases. Our work sheds light on the behavior of magic and its linear combinations in quantum circuits, employing genuine magic measures.</description>

      <title>Minimal Quantum Circuits for Simulating Fibonacci Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fibonacci topological order is the prime candidate for the realization of universal topological quantum computation. We devise minimal quantum circuits to demonstrate the non-Abelian nature of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, as realized in the Levin-Wen string net model. Our circuits effectively initialize the ground state, create excitations, twist and braid them, all in the smallest lattices possible. We further design methods to determine the fusion amplitudes and braiding phases of multiple excitations by carrying out a single qubit measurement. We show that the fusion channels of the doubled Fibonacci model can be detected using only three qubits, twisting phases can be measured using five, and braiding can be demonstrated using nine qubits. These designs provide the simplest possible settings for demonstrating the properties of Fibonacci anyons and can be used as realistic blueprints for implementation on many modern quantum architectures.</description>
