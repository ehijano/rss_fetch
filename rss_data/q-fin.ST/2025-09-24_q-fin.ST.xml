      <title>Filtering amplitude dependence of correlation dynamics in complex systems: application to the cryptocurrency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the cryptocurrency market dynamics, this study presents a general methodology for analyzing evolving correlation structures in complex systems using the $q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient \rho(q,s). By extending traditional metrics, this approach captures correlations at varying fluctuation amplitudes and time scales. The method employs $q$-dependent minimum spanning trees ($q$MSTs) to visualize evolving network structures. Using minute-by-minute exchange rate data for 140 cryptocurrencies on Binance (Jan 2021-Oct 2024), a rolling window analysis reveals significant shifts in $q$MSTs, notably around April 2022 during the Terra/Luna crash. Initially centralized around Bitcoin (BTC), the network later decentralized, with Ethereum (ETH) and others gaining prominence. Spectral analysis confirms BTC's declining dominance and increased diversification among assets. A key finding is that medium-scale fluctuations exhibit stronger correlations than large-scale ones, with $q$MSTs based on the latter being more decentralized. Properly exploiting such facts may offer the possibility of a more flexible optimal portfolio construction. Distance metrics highlight that major disruptions amplify correlation differences, leading to fully decentralized structures during crashes. These results demonstrate $q$MSTs' effectiveness in uncovering fluctuation-dependent correlations, with potential applications beyond finance, including biology, social and other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis and Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17720v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1955 Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and Tsingou performed first numerical studies with the aim to obtain the thermalization in a chain of nonlinear oscillators from dynamical equations of motion. This model happend to have several specific features and the dynamical thermalization was established only later in other studies. In this work we study more generic models based on Random Matrix Theory and social networks with a nonlinear perturbation leading to dynamical thermalization above a certain chaos border. These systems have two integrals of motion being total energy and norm so that the theoretical Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution depends on temperature and chemical potential. We introduce the wealth thermalization hypothesis according to which the society wealth is associated with energy in the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution. At relatively small values of total wealth or energy there is a formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, well studied in physical systems such as multimode optical fibers. This condensation leads to a huge fraction of poor households at low wealth and a small oligarchic fraction which monopolizes a dominant fraction of total wealth thus generating a strong inequality in human society. We show that this thermalization gives a good description of real data of Lorenz curves of US, UK, the whole world and capitalization of companies at Stock Exchange of New York SE (NYSE), London and Hong Kong. It is also shown that above a chaos border the dynamical Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization takes place also in social networks with the Lorenz curves being similar to those of wealth distribution in world countries. Possible actions for inequality reduction are briefly discussed.</description>
