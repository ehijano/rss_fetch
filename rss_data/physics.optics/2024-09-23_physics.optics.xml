      <title>Machine Learning Model for Complete Reconstruction of Diagnostic Polarimetric Images from partial Mueller polarimetry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The translation of imaging Mueller polarimetry to clinical practice is often hindered by large footprint and relatively slow acquisition speed of the existing instruments. Using polarization-sensitive camera as a detector may reduce instrument dimensions and allow data streaming at video rate. However, only the first three rows of a complete 4x4 Mueller matrix can be measured. To overcome this hurdle we developed a machine learning approach using sequential neural network algorithm for the reconstruction of missing elements of a Mueller matrix from the measured elements of the first three rows. The algorithm was trained and tested on the dataset of polarimetric images of various excised human tissues (uterine cervix, colon, skin, brain) acquired with two different imaging Mueller polarimeters operating in either reflection (wide-field imaging system) or transmission (microscope) configurations at different wavelengths of 550 nm and 385 nm, respectively. The reconstruction performance was evaluated using various error metrics, all of which confirmed low error values. The execution time of the trained neural network algorithm was about 300 microseconds for a single image pixel. It suggests that a machine learning approach with parallel processing of all image pixels combined with the partial Mueller polarimeter operating at video rate can effectively substitute for the complete Mueller polarimeter and produce accurate maps of depolarization, linear retardance and orientation of the optical axis of biological tissues, which can be used for medical diagnosis in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Sparse Optimization of Two-Dimensional Terahertz Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional terahertz spectroscopy (2DTS) is a low-frequency analogue of two-dimensional optical spectroscopy that is rapidly maturing as a probe of a wide variety of condensed matter systems. However, a persistent problem of 2DTS is the long experimental acquisition times, preventing its broader adoption. A potential solution, requiring no increase in experimental complexity, is signal reconstruction via compressive sensing. In this work, we apply the sparse exponential mode analysis (SEMA) technique to 2DTS of a cuprate superconductor. We benchmark the performance of the algorithm in reconstructing the terahertz nonlinearities and find that SEMA reproduces the asymmetric photon echo lineshapes with as low as a 10% sampling rate and reaches the reconstruction noise floor with beyond 20-30% sampling rate. The success of SEMA in reproducing such subtle, asymmetric lineshapes confirms compressive sensing as a general method to accelerate 2DTS and multidimensional spectroscopies more broadly.</description>

      <title>Laser-written scalable sapphire integrated photonics platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate the integration of photonic devices on sapphire substrates using multi-layer depressed cladding waveguides at both 780 nm and 1550 nm. The devices are up to 10-cm long and written at depths down to 400 um. The propagation losses for single-mode guiding are ~ 0.6 dB/cm at 780 nm and ~ 0.7 dB/cm at 1550 nm. A number of structures have been fabricated with simultaneous single-mode and polarization independent operation: evanescently coupled waveguide arrays, Y-branch splitters, Mach-Zehnder interferometers, and a 2x2 directional-coupler. All the devices were fabricated using adaptive optics-assisted femtosecond laser direct writing with a customized laser writing algorithm. This work enables the integration of single-mode sapphire photonics devices in a scalable manner, enabling many applications in communications, imaging, computing, and sensing.</description>

      <title>Double-Helix Singularity and Vortex-Antivortex Annihilation in Space-Time Helical Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological structures reveal the hidden secrets and beauty in nature, such as the double helix in DNA, whilst, the manipula-tion of which in physical fields, especially in ultrafast struc-tured light, draw booming attention. Here we introduce a new family of spatiotemporal light fields, i.e. helical pulses, carry-ing sophisticated double-helix singularities in its electromag-netic topological structures. The helical pulses were solved from Maxwell's equation as chiral extensions of toroidal light pulses but with controlled angular momentum dependence. We unveil that the double helix singularities can maintain their topological invariance during propagation and the field exhibits paired generation and annihilation of vortices and antivortices in ultrafast space-time, so as to be potential information carriers beating previous conventional vortex structured light.</description>

      <title>Four-fold truncated double-nested anti-resonant hollow-core fibers with ultralow loss and ultrahigh mode purity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hollow-core fibers are inherently multimode, making it crucial to filter out higher-order modes within the shortest possible fiber length for applications such as high speed coherent communications and fiber optic gyroscopes. However, current HCF designs face the challenges of simultaneously achieving ultralow fundamental mode loss and ultrahigh HOM suppression. In this study, we present a novel four fold truncated double nested anti resonant hollow core fiber structure that addresses this challenge. Our 4T-DNANF enables greater control over phase-matching between core modes and air modes in the cladding, allowing for minimized FM loss and substantially increased HOM loss. Experimentally, we fabricated several HCFs: one with an FM loss of 0.1 dB/km and an HOM loss of 430 dB/km, and another with an FM loss of 0.13 dB/km with a HOM loss of 6500 dB/km, resulting in a higher-order mode extinction ratio of 50,000.</description>

      <title>Comparison of arm cavity optical losses for the two wavelengths of the Einstein Telescope gravitational wave detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new generation of gravitational wave detectors is currently being designed with the likely use of a different laser wavelength compared to current instruments. The estimation of the optical losses for this new wavelength is particularly relevant to derive the detector sensitivity and also to anticipate the optical performances of future instruments. In this article, we measured the absorption and angle-resolved scattering of several mirror samples in order to compare optical losses at a wavelength of 1064 and 1550\ nm. In addition, we have carried out simulations of the Einstein Telescope arm cavities at 1064 and 1550\ nm taking into account losses due to surface low-spatial frequency flatness. Our results suggest that optical losses as measured at 1064\ nm are about twice as large as those at 1550\ nm as predicted with a simple model.</description>

      <title>Quantum electrodynamics in high harmonic generation: multi-trajectory Ehrenfest and exact quantum analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a nonlinear process in which a material sample is irradiated by intense laser pulses, causing the emission of high harmonics of the incident light. HHG has historically been explained by theories employing a classical electromagnetic field, successfully capturing its spectral and temporal characteristics. However, recent research indicates that quantum-optical effects naturally exist, or can be artificially induced, in HHG. Even though the fundamental equations of motion for quantum electrodynamics (QED) are well-known, a unifying framework for solving them to explore HHG is missing. So far, numerical solutions employed a wide range of basis-sets and untested approximations. Based on methods originally developed for cavity polaritonics, here we formulate a numerically accurate QED model consisting of a single active electron and a single quantized photon mode. Our framework can in principle be extended to higher electronic dimensions and multiple photon modes to be employed in ab initio codes. We employ it as a model of an atom interacting with a photon mode and predict a characteristic minimum structure in the HHG yield vs. phase-squeezing. We find that this phenomenon, which can be used for novel ultrafast quantum spectroscopies, is partially captured by a multi-trajectory Ehrenfest dynamics approach, with the exact minima position sensitive to the level of theory. On the one hand, this motivates using multi-trajectory approaches as an alternative for costly exact calculations. On the other hand, it suggests an inherent limitation of the multi-trajectory formalism, indicating the presence of entanglement. Our work creates a road-map for a universal formalism of QED-HHG that can be employed for benchmarking approximate theories, predicting novel phenomena for advancing quantum applications, and for the measurements of entanglement and entropy.</description>

Abstract: The recently emerged Mie resonant metaphotonics (or Mietronics) provides novel opportunities for subwavelength optics. Mietronics employs resonances in isolated nanoparticles and structured surfaces. We present a brief summary of the key concepts underpinning this rapidly developing area of research, using the examples of isolated high-index dielectric subwavelength particles. We also discuss recent advances and future trends in designs of high-Q elements for efficient resonant spatial and temporal control of light.</description>

      <title>Optical training of large-scale Transformers and deep neural networks with direct feedback alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning relies nearly exclusively on dedicated electronic hardware accelerators. Photonic approaches, with low consumption and high operation speed, are increasingly considered for inference but, to date, remain mostly limited to relatively basic tasks. Simultaneously, the problem of training deep and complex neural networks, overwhelmingly performed through backpropagation, remains a significant limitation to the size and, consequently, the performance of current architectures and a major compute and energy bottleneck. Here, we experimentally implement a versatile and scalable training algorithm, called direct feedback alignment, on a hybrid electronic-photonic platform. An optical processing unit performs large-scale random matrix multiplications, which is the central operation of this algorithm, at speeds up to 1500 TeraOps. We perform optical training of one of the most recent deep learning architectures, including Transformers, with more than 1B parameters, and obtain good performances on both language and vision tasks. We study the compute scaling of our hybrid optical approach, and demonstrate a potential advantage for ultra-deep and wide neural networks, thus opening a promising route to sustain the exponential growth of modern artificial intelligence beyond traditional von Neumann approaches.</description>

      <title>Check-probe spectroscopy of lifetime-limited emitters in bulk-grown silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solid-state single-photon emitters provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum technologies such as optically connected quantum networks. A key challenge is to ensure optical coherence and spectral stability of the emitters. Here, we introduce a high-bandwidth `check-probe' scheme to quantitatively measure (laser-induced) spectral diffusion and ionisation rates, as well as homogeneous linewidths. We demonstrate these methods on single V2 centers in commercially available bulk-grown 4H-silicon carbide. Despite observing significant spectral diffusion under laser illumination ($\gtrsim$ GHz/s), the optical transitions are narrow ($\sim$35 MHz), and remain stable in the dark ($\gtrsim$1 s). Through Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg interferometry, we determine the optical coherence to be near-lifetime limited ($T_2 = 16.4(4)$ ns), hinting at the potential for using bulk-grown materials for developing quantum technologies. These results advance our understanding of spectral diffusion of quantum emitters in semiconductor materials, and may have applications for studying charge dynamics across other platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian glide-time symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems, going beyond conventional Hermitian systems, have brought in intriguing concepts such as exceptional points and complex spectral topology as well as exotic phenomena such as non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs). However, previous studies on non-Hermitian systems predominantly focus on the properties of eigenstates, with rather limited discussions on non-Hermitian dynamic phenomena. Here, inspired by the celebrated success of the parity-time symmetry in non-Hermitian physics, we theoretically study a one-dimensional non-Hermitian system with glide-time reversal (GT) symmetry. We discover that the GT symmetry leads to unique physical properties and enables rich dynamic phenomena in non-Hermitian systems. Remarkably, we reveal the dynamic NHSEs that exhibit diverse behaviors across distinct dynamic phases, elucidating the richness of non-Hermitian dynamics. We establish the theoretical frameworks for understanding the rich non-Hermitian dynamic phenomena. We further show that the rich dynamic phases in the GT-symmetric systems enable the remarkable tuning of the dynamics in the bulk as well as at the edge boundaries. These include the directional wave propagation and amplification in the bulk, as well as the wave trapping and the dynamic patterns at the edge boundaries. With both the development in the theoretical framework and the study of the rich non-Hermitian dynamic phases, this work serves as a stepstone for future studies on non-Hermitian dynamics with a special emphasize on the pivotal role of the lattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical approach to the eigenvalue spectrum of perturbed higher-order exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points are special degeneracy points in parameter space that can arise in (effective) non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing open quantum and wave systems. At an n-th order exceptional point, n eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce. These coalescing eigenvalues typically exhibit a strong response to small perturbations which can be useful for sensor applications. A so-called generic perturbation with strength $\epsilon$ changes the eigenvalues proportional to the n-th root of $\epsilon$. A different eigenvalue behavior under perturbation is called non-generic. An understanding of the behavior of the eigenvalues for various types of perturbations is desirable and also crucial for applications. We advocate a graph-theoretical perspective that contributes to the understanding of perturbative effects on the eigenvalue spectrum of higher-order exceptional points, i.e. n &gt; 2. To highlight the relevance of non-generic perturbations and to give an interpretation for their occurrence, we consider an illustrative example, a system of microrings coupled by a semi-infinite waveguide with an end mirror. Furthermore, the saturation effect occurring for cavity-selective sensing in such a system is naturally explained within the graph-theoretical picture.</description>

      <title>Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes has been experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wavefunction changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Ultra spectral sensitivity and non-local bi-impurity bound states from quasi-long-range non-hermitian skin modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics is that the energy spectrum of a quantum system shall remain stable against infinitesimally weak and spatially confined perturbations. In this article, we demonstrate that this principle of spectral stability fails in non-Hermitian systems at the thermodynamic limit. Consider, for instance, a non-interacting non-Hermitian system $H_0$ with a couple of point-like impurities, each of which introduces a local short-range potential $V_i$ with $i=1, \ldots, n$ labeling the impurities. If the impurity potentials are sufficiently weak, introducing a single impurity will not alter the spectrum; that is, $H_0$ and $H_0 + V_1$ have nearly identical energy spectra. However, if a second impurity is introduced, $H_0 + V_1 + V_2$, we find that no matter how weak these local potentials are, as long as the distance between them is sufficiently large, significant alterations in the energy spectrum can arise, directly contradicting the traditional expectation of a stable spectrum. Remarkably, this phenomenon is non-local, and the impact of the perturbations increases exponentially with the distance between the two impurities. In other words, although the Hamiltonian is entirely local, its energy spectrum, which is blind to the presence of a single infinitesimally weak impurity, is capable of detecting the presence of two infinitesimally weak impurities separated by a large distance in space. Using Green's function techniques, we uncover the origin of this spectral sensitivity, which arises from the formation of non-local bi-impurity bound states: non-local stationary states with wavepackets propagating back-and-forth between the two impurities. We provide an analytic theory to identify and characterize such spectral instabilities, showing perfect agreement with numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>On-chip pulse shaping of entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate spectral shaping of entangled photons with a six-channel microring-resonator-based silicon photonic pulse shaper. Through precise calibration of thermal phase shifters in a microresonator-based pulse shaper, we demonstrate line-by-line phase control on a 3~GHz grid for two frequency-bin-entangled qudits, corresponding to Hilbert spaces of up to $6\times 6$ ($3\times 3$) dimensions for shared (independent) signal-idler filters. The pulse shaper's fine spectral resolution enables control of nanosecond-scale temporal features, which are observed by direct coincidence detection of biphoton correlation functions that show excellent agreement with theory. This work marks, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of biphoton pulse shaping using an integrated spectral shaper and holds significant promise for applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Probing the position-dependent optical energy fluence rate in three-dimensional scattering samples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate determination of the position-dependent energy fluence rate of scattered light (which is proportional to the energy density) is crucial to the understanding of transport in anisotropically scattering and absorbing samples, such as biological tissue, seawater, atmospheric turbulent layers, and light-emitting diodes. While Monte Carlo simulations are precise, their long computation time is not desirable. Common analytical approximations to the radiative transfer equation (RTE) fail to predict light transport and could even give unphysical results. Therefore, we experimentally probe the position-dependent energy fluence rate of light inside scattering samples where the widely used P1 and P3 approximations to the RTE fail. The samples are three-dimensional (3D) aqueous suspensions of anisotropically scattering and both absorbing and non-absorbing spherical scatterers, namely, microspheres (r = 0.5 um) with and without absorbing dye. To probe the energy fluence rate, we detect the emission of quantum-dot reporter particles that are excited by the incident light and that are contained in a thin capillary. By scanning the capillary through the sample, we access the position dependence. We present a comprehensive discussion of experimental limitations and of both random and systematic errors. Our observations agree well with the Monte Carlo simulations and the P3 approximation of the RTE with a correction for forward scattering. In contrast, the P1 and the P3 approximations deviate increasingly from our observations, ultimately even predicting unphysical negative energies.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery for Robust Optimization of Semiconductor Nanowire Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active wavelength-scale optoelectronic components are widely used in photonic integrated circuitry, however coherent sources of light -- namely optical lasers -- remain the most challenging component to integrate. Semiconductor nanowire lasers represent a flexible class of light source where each nanowire is both gain material and cavity; however, strong coupling between these properties and the performance leads to inhomogeneity across the population. While this has been studied and optimized for individual material systems, no architecture-wide insight is available. Here, nine nanowire laser material systems are studied and compared using 55,516 nanowire lasers to provide statistically robust insight into performance. These results demonstrate that, while it may be important to optimise internal quantum efficiency for certain materials, cavity effects are always critical. Our study provides a roadmap to optimize the performance of nanowire lasers made from any material: this can be achieved by ensuring a narrow spread of lengths and end-facet reflectivities.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Optical Polarization at Deep Microscopic Scales in Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanophotonics, the study of light-matter interaction at scales smaller than the wavelength of radiation, has widespread applications in plasmonic waveguiding, topological photonic crystals, super-lensing, solar absorbers, and infrared imaging. The physical phenomena governing these effects can be described using a macroscopic homogenized refractive index. However, the lattice-level description of optical polarization in a crystalline material using a quantum theory has been unresolved. Inspired by the dynamics of electron waves and their corresponding band structure, we propose a microscopic optical band theory of solids specifically applicable to optical polarization. This framework reveals propagating waves hidden deep within a crystal lattice. These hidden waves arise from crystal-optical-indices, a family of quantum functions obeying crystal symmetries, and cannot be described by the conventional concept of refractive index. We present for the first time - the hidden waves and deep microscopic optical band structure of 14 distinct materials. We choose Si, Ge, InAs, GaAs, CdTe, and others from Group IV, III-V, and II-VI due to their technological relevance but our framework can be extended to a wide range of emerging 2D and 3D materials. In contrast to the macroscopic refractive index of these materials used widely today, this framework shows that hidden waves exist throughout the crystal lattice and have unique optical polarization texture and crowding. We also present an open-source software package, Purdue-Picomax, for the research community to discover hidden waves in new materials like hBN, graphene, and Moire materials. Our work establishes a foundational crystallographic feature to discover novel deep microscopic optical waves in light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>All-optical Fourier neural network using partially coherent light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical neural networks present distinct advantages over traditional electrical counterparts, such as accelerated data processing and reduced energy consumption. While coherent light is conventionally employed in optical neural networks, our study proposes harnessing spatially incoherent light in all-optical Fourier neural networks. Contrary to numerical predictions of declining target recognition accuracy with increased incoherence, our experimental results demonstrate a surprising outcome: improved accuracy with incoherent light. We attribute this unexpected enhancement to spatially incoherent light's ability to alleviate experimental errors like diffraction rings, laser speckle, and edge effects. Our controlled experiments introduced spatial incoherence by passing monochromatic light through a spatial light modulator featuring a dynamically changing random phase array. These findings underscore partially coherent light's potential to optimize optical neural networks, delivering dependable and efficient solutions for applications demanding consistent accuracy and robustness across diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Optical ionization effects in kHz laser wakefield acceleration with few-cycle pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present significant advances in Laser Wakefield Acceleration (LWFA) operating at a 1 kHz repetition rate, employing a sub-TW, few-femtosecond laser and a continuously flowing hydrogen gas target. We conducted the first comprehensive study assessing how the nature of the gas within the target influences accelerator performance. This work confirms and elucidates the superior performance of hydrogen in kHz LWFA. Our system generates quasi-monoenergetic electron bunches with energies up to 10 MeV, bunch charges of 2 pC, and angular divergences of 15 mrad. Notably, our novel scheme relying on differential pumping enables continuous operation at kHz repetition rates, contrasting with previous systems that operated in burst mode to achieve similar beam properties. Particle-in-cell simulations explain hydrogen's superior performances: the ionization effects in nitrogen and helium distort the laser pulse, negatively impacting accelerator performance. These effects are strongly mitigated in hydrogen plasma, thereby enhancing beam quality. This analysis represents a significant step forward in optimizing and understanding kHz LWFA. It underscores the critical role of hydrogen and the imperative need to develop hydrogen-compatible target systems capable of managing high repetition rates, as exemplified by our differential pumping system. These advances lay the groundwork for further developments in high-repetition-rate LWFA technology.</description>
