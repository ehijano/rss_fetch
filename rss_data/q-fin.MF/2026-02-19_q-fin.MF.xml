      <title>A Wiener Chaos Approach to Martingale Modelling and Implied Volatility Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calibration to a surface of option prices requires specifying a suitably flexible martingale model for the discounted asset price under a risk-neutral measure. Assuming Brownian noise and mean-square integrability, we construct an over-parameterized model based on the martingale representation theorem. In particular, we approximate the terminal value of the martingale via a truncated Wiener--chaos expansion and recover the intermediate dynamics by computing the corresponding conditional expectations. Using the Hermite-polynomial formulation of the Wiener chaos, we obtain easily implementable expressions that enable fast calibration to a target implied-volatility surface. We illustrate the flexibility and expressive power of the resulting model through numerical experiments on both simulated and real market data.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg Equilibria in Monopoly Insurance Markets with Probability Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Stackelberg Equilibria (Bowley optima) in a monopolistic centralized sequential-move insurance market, with a profit-maximizing insurer who sets premia using a distortion premium principle, and a single policyholder who seeks to minimize a distortion risk measure. We show that equilibria are characterized as follows: In equilibrium, the optimal indemnity function exhibits a layer-type structure, providing full insurance over any loss layer on which the policyholder is more pessimistic than the insurer's pricing functional about tail losses; and no insurance coverage over loss layers on which the policyholder is less pessimistic than the insurer's pricing functional about tail losses. In equilibrium, the optimal pricing distortion function is determined by the policyholder's degree of risk aversion, whereby prices never exceed the policyholder's marginal willingness to insure tail losses. Moreover, we show that both the insurance coverage and the insurer's expected profit increase with the policyholder's degree of risk aversion. Additionally, and echoing recent work in the literature, we show that equilibrium contracts are Pareto efficient, but they do not induce a welfare gain to the policyholder. Conversely, any Pareto-optimal contract that leaves no welfare gain to the policyholder can be obtained as an equilibrium contract. Finally, we consider a few examples of interest that recover some existing results in the literature as special cases of our analysis.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatic Risk-Reward Framework for Sustainable Investing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05866v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continued interest in sustainable investing calls for an axiomatic approach to measures of risk and reward that focus not only on financial returns, but also on measures of environmental and social sustainability, i.e. environmental, social, and governance (ESG) scores. We propose definitions for ESG-coherent risk measures and ESG reward-risk ratios based on functions of bivariate random variables that are applied to financial returns and real-time ESG scores, extending the traditional univariate measures to the ESG case. We provide examples and present an empirical analysis in which the ESG-coherent risk measures and ESG reward-risk ratios are used to rank stocks.</description>

      <title>Performative Market Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Financial models do not merely analyse markets, but actively shape them. This effect, known as performativity, describes how financial theories and the subsequent actions based on them influence market processes, by creating self-fulfilling prophecies. Although discussed in the literature on economic sociology, this deeply rooted phenomenon lacks mathematical formulation in financial markets. Our paper closes this gap by breaking down the canonical separation of diffusion processes between the description of the market environment and the financial model. We do that by embedding the model in the process itself, creating a closed feedback loop, and demonstrate how prices change towards greater conformity to the prevailing financial model used in the market. We further show, with closed-form solutions and machine learning, how a performative market maker can reverse engineer the current dominant strategies in the market and effectively arbitrage them while maintaining competitive quotes and superior P&amp;L.</description>
