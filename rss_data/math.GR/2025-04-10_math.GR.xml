      <title>On the Subgroup Distance Problem in Cyclic Permutation Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Subgroup distance problem regarding the Hamming distance, the Cayley distance, the $l_\infty$ distance, the $l_p$ distance (for all $p \geq 1$), the Lee distance, Kendall's tau distance and Ulam's distance is NP-complete when the input group is cyclic. When we restrict the $l_\infty$ distance to fixed values we show that it is NP-complete to decide whether there are numbers $z_1,z_2 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $l_\infty(\beta, \alpha_1^{z_1}\alpha_2^{z_2}) \leq 1$ for permutation $\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\beta \in S_n$ where $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ commute. However on the positive side we can show that it can be decided in NL whether there is a number $z \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $l_\infty(\beta, \alpha^z) \leq 1$ for permutations $\alpha,\beta \in S_n$. For the former we provide a tool, namely for all numbers $t_1,t_2,t \in \mathbb{N}$ where $t$ is required to be odd, $0 \leq t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; t$ and $t_1 \not\equiv t_2 \bmod q$ for all primes $q \mid t$ we give a constructive proof for the existence of permutations $\alpha,\beta \in S_t$ with $l_\infty(\beta, \alpha^{t_1}) \leq 1$ and $l_\infty(\beta, \alpha^{t_2}) \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Poisson Manifolds of Compact Types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Poisson and Dirac manifolds of compact types, a broad generalization in Poisson and Dirac geometry of compact Lie algebras and Lie groups. We establish key structural results, including local normal forms, canonical stratifications, and a Weyl type resolution, which provides a way to resolve the singularities of the original structure. These tools allow us to show that the leaf space of such manifolds is an integral affine orbifold and to define their Weyl group. This group is a Coxeter group acting on the orbifold universal cover of the leaf space by integral affine transformations, and one can associate to it Weyl chambers, reflection hyperplanes, etc. We further develop a Duistermaat-Heckman theory for Poisson manifolds of s-proper type, proving the linear variation of cohomology of leafwise symplectic form and establishing a Weyl integration formula. As an application, we show that every Poisson manifold of compact type is necessarily regular. We conclude the paper with a list of open problems.</description>

      <title>The affine group of a local field is Hermitian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether the group $\mathbb{Q}_p \rtimes \mathbb{Q}_p^*$ is Hermitian has been stated as an open question in multiple sources in the literature, even as recently as a paper by R. Palma published in 2015. In this note we confirm that this group is Hermitian by proving the following more general theorem: given any local field $\mathbb{K}$, the affine group $\mathbb{K} \rtimes \mathbb{K}^*$ is a Hermitian group. The proof is a simple consequence of results about Hermitian Banach $*$-algebras from the 1970's. In the case that $\mathbb{K}$ is a non-archimedean local field, this result produces examples of totally disconnected locally compact Hermitian groups with exponential growth, and as far as the author is aware, these are the first examples of groups satisfying these properties. This answers a second question of Palma about the existence of such groups.</description>

      <title>Classification of algebraic tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study algebraic tangles as fundamental components in knot theory, developing a systematic approach to classify and tabulate prime tangles using a novel canonical representation. The canonical representation enables us to distinguish mutant tangles, which fills the gaps in previous classifications. Moreover, we increase the classification of prime tangles up to 14 crossings and analyze tangle symmetry groups. We provide a database of our results: https://tangleinfo.cent.uw.edu.pl.</description>

      <title>On quadratic rational Frobenius groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and, for a given complex character $\chi$ of $G$, let ${\mathbb{Q}}(\chi)$ denote the field extension of ${\mathbb{Q}}$ obtained by adjoining all the values $\chi(g)$, for $g\in G$. The group $G$ is called quadratic rational if, for every irreducible complex character $\chi\in{\rm{Irr}}(G)$, the field ${\mathbb{Q}}(\chi)$ is an extension of ${\mathbb{Q}}$ of degree at most $2$. Quadratic rational groups have a nice characterization in terms of the structure of the group of central units in their integral group ring, and in fact they generalize the well-known concept of a cut group (i.e., a finite group whose integral group ring has a finite group of central units). In this paper we classify the Frobenius groups that are quadratic rational, a crucial step in the project of describing the Gruenberg-Kegel graphs associated to quadratic rational groups. It turns out that every Frobenius quadratic rational group is uniformly semi-rational, i.e., it satisfies the following property: all the generators of any cyclic subgroup of $G$ lie in at most two conjugacy classes of $G$, and these classes are permuted by the same element of the Galois group ${\rm{Gal}}({\mathbb{Q}}_{|G|}/{\mathbb{Q}})$ (in general, every cut group is uniformly semi-rational, and every uniformly semi-rational group is quadratic rational). We will also see that the class of groups here considered coincides with the one studied in [4], thus the main result of this paper also completes the analysis carried out in [4].</description>

      <title>The complex of cuts in a Stone space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stone's representation theorem asserts a duality between Boolean algebras on the one hand and Stone space, which are compact, Hausdorff, and totally disconnected, on the other. This duality implies a natural isomorphism between the homeomorphism group of the space and the automorphism group of the algebra. We introduce a complex of cuts on which these groups act, and prove that when the algebra is countable and the space has at least five points, that these groups are the full automorphism group of the complex.</description>

      <title>Coprime extensions of indecomposable solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a method to extend involutive nondegenerate set-theoretic solutions to the Yang--Baxter equation by means of equivariant mappings to graded modules, thus leading to the notion of a twisted extension. Furthermore, we define coprime extensions of solutions and prove that each coprime extension of indecomposable solutions can be obtained as a suitable twisted extension. We then apply our results to obtain a full description of indecomposable solutions of size $pqr$, where $p,q,r$ are different primes, from a structure theorem of Ced\'o and Okni\'nski. We close with some remarks on a cohomology theory for solutions developed by Lebed and Vendramin. We express our results in the language of cycle sets.</description>
