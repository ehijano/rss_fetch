      <title>Nonexistence of Courant-type nodal domain bounds for eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact manifold $\mathcal M$ with boundary of dimension $n\geq 3$ and any integers $K$ and $N$, we show that there exists a metric on $\mathcal M$ for which the first $K$ nonconstant eigenfunctions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on $\partial\mathcal M$ have at least $N$ nodal components. This provides a negative answer to the question of whether the number of nodal domains of Dirichlet-to-Neumann eigenfunctions satisfies a Courant-type bound, which has been featured in recent surveys by Girouard and Polterovich [21, Open problem 9] and by Colbois, Girouard, Gordon and Sher [9, Open question 10.14].</description>

      <title>Spectral decomposition and Siegel-Veech transforms for strata: The case of marked tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalizing the well-known construction of Eisenstein series on the modular curves, Siegel-Veech transforms provide a natural construction of square-integrable functions on strata of differentials on Riemannian surfaces. This space carries actions of the foliated Laplacian derived from the SL(2,R)-action as well as various differential operators related to relative period translations.
  In the paper we give spectral decompositions for the stratum of tori with two marked points. This is a homogeneous space for a special affine group, which is not reductive and thus does not fall into well-studied cases of the Langlands program, but still allows to employ techniques from representation theory and global analysis. Even for this simple stratum exhibiting all Siegel-Veech transforms requires novel configurations of saddle connections. We also show that the contiunuous spectrum of the foliated Laplacian is much larger than the space of Siegel-Veech transforms, as opposed to the case of the modular curve. This defect can be remedied by using instead a compound Laplacian involving relative period translations.</description>

      <title>A reverse Faber-Krahn inequality for the magnetic Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the first eigenvalue of the magnetic Laplacian in a bounded and simply connected planar domain, with uniform magnetic field and Neumann boundary conditions. We investigate the reverse Faber-Krahn inequality conjectured by S. Fournais and B. Helffer, stating that this eigenvalue is maximized by the disk for a given area. Using the method of level lines, we prove the conjecture for small enough values of the magnetic field (those for which the corresponding eigenfunction in the disk is radial).</description>

      <title>Spectrum of p-adic linear differential equations II: Variation of the spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to generalize the results of [arXiv:2111.03548] to the case of quasi-smooth Berkovich curves by establishing a connection between the spectrum and the radii of convergence. To achieve this, we investigate the continuity and variation of the spectrum of a p-adic linear differential equation. Our findings demonstrate that the spectrum can be governed by any controlling graph of the radii of convergence. Furthermore, by analyzing the shape of the spectrum, we prove that approximating the connection enables an accurate estimation of spectral radii of convergence. As a result, we obtain a decomposition theorem with respect to the spectrum for differential equations defined over a quasi-smooth curve at a generic point x. This decomposition refines the one provided by the spectral radii of convergence. Previous works [Dwork, Robba (Trans. Am. Math. Soc. 231.1 (1-46)); arXiv:1308.0859] have shown that decomposition with respect to the spectral radii can be extended to a neighborhood of x. We prove that this can also hold for the decomposition with respect to the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Kronecker Product of Tensors and Hypergraphs: Structure and Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03875v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs and tensors extend classic graph and matrix theory to account for multiway relationships, which are ubiquitous in engineering, biological, and social systems. While the Kronecker product is a potent tool for analyzing the coupling of systems in graph or matrix contexts, its effectiveness in capturing multiway interactions remains elusive. In this article, we present a comprehensive exploration of algebraic, structural, and spectral properties of the tensor Kronecker product. We express Tucker and tensor train decompositions and various tensor eigenvalues in terms of the tensor Kronecker product. Additionally, we utilize the tensor Kronecker product to form Kronecker hypergraphs, a tensor-based hypergraph product, and investigate the structure and stability of polynomial dynamics on Kronecker hypergraphs. Finally, we provide numerical examples to demonstrate the utility of the tensor Kronecker product in computing Z-eigenvectors, various tensor decompositions, and determining the stability of polynomial systems.</description>
