      <title>Progress in Artificial Intelligence and its Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study long-run progress in artificial intelligence in a quantitative way. Many measures, including traditional ones such as patents and publications, machine learning benchmarks, and a new Aggregate State of the Art in ML (or ASOTA) Index we have constructed from these, show exponential growth at roughly constant rates over long periods. Production of patents and publications doubles every ten years, by contrast with the growth of computing resources driven by Moore's Law, roughly a doubling every two years. We argue that the input of AI researchers is also crucial and its contribution can be objectively estimated. Consequently, we give a simple argument that explains the 5:1 relation between these two rates. We then discuss the application of this argument to different output measures and compare our analyses with predictions based on machine learning scaling laws proposed in existing literature. Our quantitative framework facilitates understanding, predicting, and modulating the development of these important technologies.</description>

      <title>What Proportion of Knowledge is Patented?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is part of a Living Literature Review exploring topics related to intellectual property, focusing on insights from the economic literature. Our aim is to provide a clear and non-technical introduction to patent rights, making them accessible to graduate students, legal scholars and practitioners, policymakers, and anyone curious about the subject.</description>

      <title>Is the panel fair? Evaluating panel compositions through network analysis. The case of research assessments in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research evaluation is usually governed by panels of peers. Procedural fairness refers to the principles that ensures decisions are made through a fair and transparent process. It requires that the composition of panels is fair. A fair panel is usually defined in terms of observable characteristics of scholars such as gender or affiliations. The formal adherence to these criteria is not sufficient to guarantee a fair composition in terms of scholarly thinking, background, or policy orientation. An empirical strategy for exploring the fairness in the intellectual composition of panels is proposed, based on the observation of links between panellists. The case study regards the three panels selected to evaluate research in economics, statistics and business during the Italian research assessment exercises. The first two panels were appointed directly by the governmental agency responsible for the evaluation, while the third was randomly selected. Hence the third panel can be considered as a control for evaluating about the fairness of the others. The fair representation is explored by comparing the networks of panellists based on their co-authorship relations, the networks based on journals in which they published and the networks based on their affiliated institutions (universities, research centres and newspapers). The results show that the members of the first two panels had connections much higher than the members of the control group. Hence the composition of the first two panels should be considered as unfair, as the results of the research assessments.</description>
