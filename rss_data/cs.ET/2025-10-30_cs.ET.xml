      <title>Structurally Valid Log Generation using FSM-GFlowNets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating structurally valid and behaviorally diverse synthetic event logs for interaction-aware models is a challenging yet crucial problem, particularly in settings with limited or privacy constrained user data. Existing methods such as heuristic simulations and LLM based generators often lack structural coherence or controllability, producing synthetic data that fails to accurately represent real world system interactions. This paper presents a framework that integrates Finite State Machines or FSMs with Generative Flow Networks or GFlowNets to generate structured, semantically valid, and diverse synthetic event logs. Our FSM-constrained GFlowNet ensures syntactic validity and behavioral variation through dynamic action masking and guided sampling. The FSM, derived from expert traces, encodes domain-specific rules, while the GFlowNet is trained using a flow matching objective with a hybrid reward balancing FSM compliance and statistical fidelity. We instantiate the framework in the context of UI interaction logs using the UIC HCI dataset, but the approach generalizes to any symbolic sequence domain. Experimental results based on distributional metrics show that our FSM GFlowNet produces realistic, structurally consistent logs, achieving, for instance, under the real user logs baseline, a KL divergence of 0.2769 and Chi squared distance of 0.3522, significantly outperforming GPT-4o's 2.5294/13.8020 and Gemini's 3.7233/63.0355, alongside a leading bigram overlap of 0.1214 vs. GPT 4o's 0.0028 and Gemini's 0.0007. A downstream use case intent classification demonstrates that classifiers trained solely on our synthetic logs produced from FSM-GFlowNet achieve competitive accuracy compared to real data.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised local learning based on voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity for resistive and ferroelectric synapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The deployment of AI on edge computing devices faces significant challenges related to energy consumption and functionality. These devices could greatly benefit from brain-inspired learning mechanisms, allowing for real-time adaptation while using low-power. In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$, HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The results demonstrated over 83% accuracy across all devices using 200 neurons. Additionally, we assessed the impact of device variability, such as switching thresholds and ratios between high and low resistance state levels, and proposed mitigation strategies to enhance robustness.</description>

      <title>AAGATE: A NIST AI RMF-Aligned Governance Platform for Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Agentic AI Governance Assurance &amp; Trust Engine (AAGATE), a Kubernetes-native control plane designed to address the unique security and governance challenges posed by autonomous, language-model-driven agents in production. Recognizing the limitations of traditional Application Security (AppSec) tooling for improvisational, machine-speed systems, AAGATE operationalizes the NIST AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF). It integrates specialized security frameworks for each RMF function: the Agentic AI Threat Modeling MAESTRO framework for Map, a hybrid of OWASP's AIVSS and SEI's SSVC for Measure, and the Cloud Security Alliance's Agentic AI Red Teaming Guide for Manage. By incorporating a zero-trust service mesh, an explainable policy engine, behavioral analytics, and decentralized accountability hooks, AAGATE provides a continuous, verifiable governance solution for agentic AI, enabling safe, accountable, and scalable deployment. The framework is further extended with DIRF for digital identity rights, LPCI defenses for logic-layer injection, and QSAF monitors for cognitive degradation, ensuring governance spans systemic, adversarial, and ethical risks.</description>

      <title>A Research Roadmap for Augmenting Software Engineering Processes and Software Products with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is rapidly transforming software engineering (SE) practices, influencing how SE processes are executed, as well as how software systems are developed, operated, and evolved. This paper applies design science research to build a roadmap for GenAI-augmented SE. The process consists of three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence, including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 "Software Engineering 2030" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for framing future research within this rapidly evolving area. Based on these findings, the article finally makes ten predictions for SE in the year 2030.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Challenges of Adding Pulse-level Support to a Heterogeneous HPCQC Software Stack: MQSS Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of adding native pulse-level control to heterogeneous High Performance Computing-Quantum Computing (HPCQC) software stacks, using the Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS) as a case study. The goal is to expand the capabilities of HPCQC environments by offering the ability for low-level access and control, currently typically not foreseen for such hybrid systems. For this, we need to establish new interfaces that integrate such pulse-level control into the lower layers of the software stack, including the need for proper representation.
  Pulse-level quantum programs can be fully described with only three low-level abstractions: ports (input/output channels), frames (reference signals), and waveforms (pulse envelopes). We identify four key challenges to represent those pulse abstractions at: the user-interface level, at the compiler level (including the Intermediate Representation (IR)), and at the backend-interface level (including the appropriate exchange format). For each challenge, we propose concrete solutions in the context of MQSS. These include introducing a compiled (C/C++) pulse Application Programming Interface (API) to overcome Python runtime overhead, extending its LLVM support to include pulse-related instructions, using its C-based backend interface to query relevant hardware constraints, and designing a portable exchange format for pulse sequences. Our integrated approach provides an end-to-end path for pulse-aware compilation and runtime execution in HPCQC environments. This work lays out the architectural blueprint for extending HPCQC integration to support pulse-level quantum operations without disrupting state-of-the-art classical workflows.</description>
