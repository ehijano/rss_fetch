      <title>Negative and positive anisotropic thermal expansion in 2D fullerene networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a design principle for tailoring thermal expansion properties in molecular networks. Using 2D fullerene networks as a representative system, we realize positive thermal expansion along intermolecular double bonds and negative thermal expansion along intermolecular single bonds by varying the structural frameworks of molecules. The microscopic mechanism originates from a combination of the framework's geometric flexibility and its transverse vibrational characteristics. Based on this insight, we find molecular networks beyond C$_{60}$ with tunable thermal expansion. These findings shed light on the fundamental mechanisms governing thermal expansion in molecular networks towards rational materials design.</description>

      <title>Frequency Dependent Magnetic Susceptibility and the $q^2$ effective conductivity tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a microscopic formalism for the calculation of material response properties to the problem of the generalization of a first-principles, i.e based on the energy spectrum and geometric properties of the Bloch functions, derivation of the AC magnetic susceptibility. We find that the AC susceptibility forms only a part of the $q^2$ -- where $q$ is the wavevector of the applied field -- effective conductivity tensor, and many additional response tensors characterizing both electric and magnetic multipole moments response to electromagnetic fields and their derivatives must be included to create the full gauge-invariant response. As was seen with the DC magnetic susceptibility and optical activity (characterized by the linear in $q$ contribution to the conductivity) one must be careful with the diagonal elements of the Berry connection. To our knowledge this is the only derivation of such a result general for crystalline insulators, with both `atomic like' contributions and `itinerant contributions' due to overlap of atomic orbitals and non-flat bands. Additionally, quantities familiar from quantum geometry like the Berry connection, curvature, and quantum metric appear extensively.</description>

      <title>In situ and real-time ultrafast spectroscopy of photoinduced reactions in perovskite nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing two synchronized mode-locked femtosecond lasers and interferometric detection of the pump-probe spectra -- referred to as asynchronous and interferometric transient absorption (AI-TA) -- we have developed a method for broad dynamic range and rapid data acquisition. Using AI-TA, we examined photochemical changes during femtosecond pump-probe experiments on all-inorganic cesium lead halide nanomaterials, including perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) and nanoplatelets (PeNPLs). The laser pulse train facilitates photoreactions while allowing real-time observation of charge carrier dynamics. In PeNCs undergoing halide anion photo-substitution, transient absorption spectra showed increasing bandgap energy and faster relaxation dynamics as the Cl/Br ratio increased. For colloidal PeNPLs, continuous observation revealed both spectral and kinetic changes during the light-induced coalescence of nanoplatelets, by analyzing temporal segments. This integrated technique not only deepens understanding of exciton dynamics and environmental influences in perovskite nanomaterials but also establishes AI-TA as a transformative tool for real-time observation of photochemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an all-electrical setup for achieving valley polarization in graphene. The setup consists of a finite graphene sheet connected to normal metal electrodes on both sides, with the junctions aligned along the zigzag edges while the armchair edges remain free. Each normal metal has two terminals, and when a bias is applied at one terminal while keeping the other three grounded, valley polarization arises due to transverse momentum matching between graphene and the normal metal. The valley polarization is maximized when the Fermi wave vector of the normal metal is approximately half the separation between the $K$ and $K'$ valleys in graphene. We analyze the dependence of conductance and valley polarization on system parameters such as the width and length of the graphene sheet, as well as the chemical potentials of graphene and the normal metal. The conductance through graphene increases with its width, while an increase in length initially reduces the conductance before leading to oscillatory behavior due to Fabry-P\'erot interference. The valley polarization efficiency decreases with increasing graphene length due to inter-valley mixing from back-and-forth reflections within the graphene region. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of disorder in graphene and find that while conductance near the Dirac point increases with disorder strength due to enhanced density of states, valley polarization efficiency decreases due to intervalley scattering. Our results provide insights into controlling valley polarization in graphene-based devices for valleytronic applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry protected topological wire in a topological vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian dislocation bound states and dislocation skin effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The confluence of Non-Hermitian (NH) topology and crystal defects has culminated significant interest, yet its experimental exploration has been limited due to the challenges involved in design and measurements. Here, we showcase experimental observation of NH dislocation bound states (NHDS) and the dislocation-induced NH skin effect in two-dimensional acoustic NH Chern lattices. By embedding edge dislocations in such acoustic lattices and implementing precision-controlled hopping and onsite gain/loss via active meta-atoms, we reveal robust defect-bound states localized at dislocation cores within the line gap of the complex energy spectrum. These NHDS survive against moderate NH perturbations but gradually delocalize and merge with the bulk (skin) states as the system arrives at the shore of fostering exceptional points in the Brillouin zone under periodic (open) boundary conditions. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that the dislocation core can feature weak NH skin effects when its direction is perpendicular to the Burgers vector in periodic systems. Our findings pave an experimental pathway for probing NH topology via lattice defects and open new avenues for defect-engineered topological devices.</description>

      <title>Braided Majorana qubits as a minimal setting for Topological Quantum Computation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I point out that a possible minimal setting to realize Kitaev's proposal of a Topological Quantum Computation which offers topological protection from decoherence could in principle be realized by braided Majorana qubits. Majorana qubits and their braiding were introduced in Nucl. Phys. B 980, 115834 (2022) and further analyzed in J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 435203 (2024). Braided Majorana qubits implement a Gentile-type parastatistics with at most $s-1$ excited states accommodated in a multiparticle sector (the integer $s=2,3,4,\ldots$ labels quantum group reps at roots of unity). It is argued that braided Majorana qubits could play, for topological quantum computers, the same role as standard bits for ordinary computers and as qubits for "ordinary" quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Optical and magnetic response by design in GaAs quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networking technologies use spin qubits and their interface to single photons as core components of a network node. This necessitates the ability to co-design the magnetic- and optical-dipole response of a quantum system. These properties are notoriously difficult to design in many solid-state systems, where spin-orbit coupling and the crystalline environment for each qubit create inhomogeneity of electronic g-factors and optically active states. Here, we show that GaAs quantum dots (QDs) obtained via the quasi-strain-free local droplet etching epitaxy growth method provide spin and optical properties predictable from assuming the highest possible QD symmetry. Our measurements of electron and hole g-tensors and of transition dipole moment orientations for charged excitons agree with our predictions from a multiband k.p simulation constrained only by a single atomic-force-microscopy reconstruction of QD morphology. This agreement is verified across multiple wavelength-specific growth runs at different facilities within the range of 730 nm to 790 nm for the exciton emission. Remarkably, our measurements and simulations track the in-plane electron g-factors through a zero-crossing from -0.1 to 0.3 and linear optical dipole moment orientations fully determined by an external magnetic field. The robustness of our results demonstrates the capability to design - prior to growth - the properties of a spin qubit and its tunable optical interface best adapted to a target magnetic and photonic environment with direct application for high-quality spin-photon entanglement.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity: stability and attractors in slip rate driven processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chains with strong coupling amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic many-particle systems with precisely tuned resonances and coupling strengths can exhibit emergent collective properties governed by universal principles. In one-dimensional chains with alternating couplings, known as Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) systems, this includes the formation of topologically protected mid-gap modes whose intensities localize at the chain's ends. This subwavelength localization at optical frequencies is crucial for achieving strong coupling of mid-gap modes to two-level systems under ambient conditions, extending topological protection to hybrid light-matter states. Here, we have fabricated SSH chains from plasmonic nanoslit resonators with strong inter-resonator coupling. The alternating distance between the nanoslit resonators is controlled with sub-nanometer precision, enabling accurate prediction and experimental observation of topologically protected mid-gap modes via photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). Our results open the path towards experimental realizations of two-dimensional photonic metasurfaces exhibiting higher-order topological modes that can be strongly coupled to single emitters and quantum materials at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Valley and Spin Polarized States in Bernal Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results for the evolution of the Fermi surfaces under variation of number density and displacement field for spin and valley-polarized states in Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) using a realistic form of the electronic dispersion with trigonal warping terms. Earlier studies without trigonal warping have found discrete half-metal and quarter-metal states with full spin and/or valley polarization and complete depletion of some of the Fermi surfaces. We show that when trigonal warping terms are included in the dispersion, partially polarized states with large but non-complete polarization and with both majority and minority carriers present, emerge at small doping, as seen in the experimental data. We show the results when the intervalley and intravalley interactions are equal as well as when they are unequal.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-interband hybridization and anomalous production of hot electrons in aluminum nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling typically occurs between two separate objects or between an object and its environment (such as an atom and a cavity). However, it can also occur between two different excitations within the same object, a situation that has been much less studied. In this study, we observe strong coupling between localized surface plasmon resonances and the interband transition in aluminum nanorods, as evidenced by optical spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, and corroborated with numerical simulations. Strong coupling is observed between the interband transition and multiple orders of the surface plasmon mode, including dark ones. We also obtain experimental maps of the hybrid modes at the nanoscale. In each case, the associated Rabi energy, which corresponds to the energy splitting between the two polaritonic branches, is obtained. Finally, a dedicated numerical model was employed to calculate the hot electron generation rate in the nanorods. The calculations demonstrate that efficient generation of hot electrons can be achieved in the near-infrared region, when the interband transition is strongly coupled with a plasmon resonance. This high generation rate stems from the hybrid nature of the mode, as its plasmonic component provides a high absorption cross-section, while the IT part ensures efficient conversion to hot electrons. Consequently, aluminum nanorods represent an efficient source of hot electrons in the visible and near-infrared regions, with potential applications in local photochemistry, photodetection, and solar energy harvesting.</description>

Abstract: We find that the behaviors of the voltage-current characteristics as one enters the low-density insulating state and integer quantum Hall insulating states in the ultra-clean two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are qualitatively different. The double-threshold voltage-current curves, representative of electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime, which does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.</description>

      <title>Anomalous vortex Hall effect in a ferromagnet/superconductor heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism is a fascinating and complex phenomenon in condensed matter physics, as these two states are typically mutually exclusive due to their competing spin configurations. However, the interplay between these two orders through the proximity effect has been a subject of intense research as it opens up possibilities for novel technological applications. Here, we report the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in superconducting {\delta}-TaN/ferromagnetic CoFeB heterostructures grown by facing-target sputtering. Superconducting states are comprehensively investigated, with evidence of strong correlation between the superconducting and ferromagnetic order parameters. In particular, we observed an anomalous Hall signal without the presence of the magnetic field in the mixed state of the superconducting transition near the critical temperature. Systematic characterizations of the Hall resistance under varying temperatures and magnetic fields attribute this behavior to the vortex Hall effect (VHE), whereby superconducting vortices in the mixed state undergo transverse motions near the critical temperature. Unlike previously reported VHEs in conventional type-II superconductors, the anomalous VHE in TaN is induced by the stray field in the underlying CoFeB layers. The concurrency of strong spin-orbit coupling, the superconductivity in the TaN layer, and the highly spin-polarized ferromagnetic ordering in the CoFeB layer offers new insights into proximity-induced vortex dynamics and the design of novel superconducting spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion on magnetic tunnel junction: weaving quantum transport with micro-magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11666v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last two decades, non-trivial magnetic textures, especially the magnetic skyrmion family, have been extensively explored out of fundamental interest and for diverse possible applications. Given the possible technological and scientific ramifications of skyrmion-texture on magnetic tunnel junctions (Sk-MTJs), in this work, we present a non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) based description of Sk-MTJs for both N\'eel and Bloch textures to capture the spin/charge current across different voltages, temperatures, and sizes. We predict the emergence of a textured spin current from the uniform layer of the Sk-MTJs, along with a radially varying, asymmetric voltage dependence of spin torque. We discuss the identification of N\'eel-type and Bloch-type skyrmions, including their helicity, based on local measurements of the spin current. We describe the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) roll-off in Sk-MTJs with lower cross-sectional areas and higher temperatures based on transmission spectra analysis. Additionally, considering the significant implications of MTJ scaling, we uncover the scaling effects in all skyrmion(AS)-MTJs, where both contacts host skyrmions. We demonstrate the impact of scaling on TMR, spin, and charge currents, providing a pathway for the Sk/AS-MTJs design optimization with miniaturization. We also introduce a computationally efficient, analytically grounded coupled spatio-eigen framework of NEGF, alleviating the sine qua non of the 3D-NEGF for systems that lack translational invariance in the transverse direction, such as Sk/AS-MTJs.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Drag in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An altermagnet is a newly discovered antiferromagnet, characterized by unique anisotropic spin-split energy bands. It has attracted tremendous interest, because of its promising potential in information storage and processing. However, measuring the distinctive spin-split energy bands arising from altermagnetism remains a challenge. Here, we propose to employ the Coulomb drag to probe altermagnetism. In the Coulomb drag, an electric current in an active layer of electron gases can induce currents in a close but well-isolated passive layer, due to interlayer Coulomb interactions. We find that the Coulomb drag effects in altermagnets are highly sensitive to the orientation of the spin-split Fermi surfaces. As a result, transverse currents can be dragged in the passive layer, leading to Hall drag effects even in absence of spin-orbit coupling, a feature quite different from all previous systems. More importantly, all the drag effects of altermagnets have unique angle dependence, which can be measured in a multi-terminal setup to serve as signatures for altermagnetism. This proposal will inspire increasing explorations on emergent magnetism.</description>

      <title>Non-renormalization of the fractional quantum Hall conductivity by interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) proposed a long time ago by Lopez and Fradkin \cite{Fradkin1991chern} to describe the principal Jain series. The magnetic fluxes of the statistical gauge field attached to electrons remain at rest in the reference frame moving together with the electron liquid. In the laboratory reference frame the electric field of the statistical gauge field forms and screens the external electric field. The fractional QHE conductivity appears as a consequence of this screening already on the mean field theory level. We consider a relativistic extension of the model, and propose an alternative description of the fractional QHE based on macroscopic motion of the electron liquid within the Zubarev statistical operator approach. It is this macroscopic motion of electrons which in this pattern gives rise to the fractional QHE. Within this approach we propose the proof to all orders of perturbation theory that the interaction corrections cannot change the above mentioned mean field theory result for the QHE conductivity.</description>

Abstract: Phonons are essential quasi-particles of all crystals and play a key role in fundamental properties such as thermal transport and superconductivity. In particular, acoustic phonons can be interpreted as Goldstone modes that emerge due to the spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry.In this article, we investigate the quantum geometric contribution to the phonon spectrum in the absence of Holstein phonons. Using graphene as a case study, we decompose the dynamical matrix into distinct terms that exhibit different dependencies on the electron energy and wavefunction. We then examine the role of quantum geometry in shaping the material's phonon spectrum.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electrical Properties of Selectively Grown In-Plane InAs Nanowires using InGaAs Buffer and Capping Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Nonlinear Dynamics for Time-Driven Berry Phase in Classical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phases arising from cyclic processes are fundamental in physics, bridging quantum and classical domains and providing deeper insights into the topology and dynamics of physical systems. This study investigates the accumulation of a time-driven Berry phase in a classical nonlinear system comprised of two spherical granules and introduces a method in which gauge variants naturally evolve over time without altering internal or external conditions. We develop a perturbation-based model to map the system's elastic characteristics to Bloch states and confirm the theoretical predictions of the frequency-dependent Berry phase through experiments. Our findings reveal that the Berry phase can exhibit trivial and nontrivial values, influenced by external driving forces and static precompression. Our results demonstrate a rich array of vibrational modes, capable of displaying identical Berry phase signatures across different frequencies-a significant departure from previous studies that identified a single topological resonance. Multiple nontrivial Berry phases emerge in highly nonlinear settings, whereas more linear regimes exhibit a singular nontrivial phase. Notably, the behavior of the Berry phase in our system mirrors fundamental quantum mechanics concepts, such as path-dependent state evolution. This study highlights the potential of classical mechanical systems to mimic quantum phenomena, opening new pathways for quantum-inspired topological computation and offering fresh perspectives on using time-driven Berry phase accumulation to investigate topological properties in nonlinear media.</description>

      <title>A numerical study of the localization transition of Aubry-Andr\'{e} type models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use tools based on the modern theory of polarization for a numerical study of the localization transition of the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model. In this model the spatial modulation of the potential, $\alpha$, is an irrational number, which we approximate as the ratio of Fibonacci numbers, $F_{n+1}/F_n$, where $F_n=L$ is also the system size. We calculate the phase diagram as a function of particle density (filling) and potential strength $W$. We calculate the geometric Binder cumulant and also apply a renormalization approach. At any given finite system size we find that at many densities the transition occurs at or near $W=2t$ ($t$ denotes the hopping). This is where single particle states are known to localize. However, we also find "spikes", densites at which the transition occurs in the range $0&lt;W&lt;2t$. These spikes occur for densities at which there are no partially filled bands. As the system size (and both $F_n$ and $F_{n+1}$ in $\alpha$) is increased the spikes tend towards zero, but the density at which they occur also changes slightly: they approach irrational numbers which can be written as Fibonacci ratios or sums thereof. For densities which are fixed ratios for all system sizes, the transition occurs at $W=2t$. We also study an extension of the original Aubry-Andr\'{e} model with second nearest neighbor hoppings. This model also exhibits a distorted phase diagram compared to the original one, with spikes which do not necessarily tend to zero, but to finite values of $W$, determined by the modifed gap structure.</description>

      <title>Manifestations of $(2+1)d$ chiral anomaly in a graphene plate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22843v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Dirac model model of graphene, we consider a $(2+1)$-dimensional fermionic system in which fermions are described by four-component spinors. These fermions are proposed to interact with an electromagnetic field originating from a four-dimensional setting, as the graphene plate is embedded in 4d Minkowski spacetime. In this framework, a chiral anomaly arises at the boundary of the plate, stemming from a non-local anomaly action that depends on both the electromagnetic and chiral gauge fields when the chiral transformation is localized. This results in boundary chiral and electric currents, and we explore potentially observable effects when external magnetic or electric fields are applied to the fermionic system.</description>

      <title>Topological Majorana zero modes and the superconducting diode effect driven by Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov pairing in a helical Shiba chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for the realization of Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) pairing in a helical Shiba chain subjected to an out-of-plane Zeeman field, analyzed through a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) mean-field formalism approach. A chain of magnetic adatoms with helical spin texture deposited on the surface of a common $s$-wave superconductor, has emerged as a pivotal platform for realizing topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Our study reveals the crucial role of finite momentum pairing of Cooper pairs in the form of FFLO state which also supports topological MZMs at the ends of the chain. Interestingly, we demonstrate that FFLO pairing facilitates non-reciprocal charge transport, giving rise to superconducting diode effect in our system where both time-reversal and inversion symmetries are broken. Such diode effect stems directly from the presence of finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO ground state. Our comprehensive analysis highlights the intricate interplay between the richness of helical Shiba chain, the out-of-plane Zeeman field, and FFLO pairing in the emergence of MZMs and driving the superconducting diode effect. These findings offer valuable insights into the design and realization of topological superconducting devices with diode-like properties, potentially advancing technological applications in quantum computing and superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01271v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</description>
