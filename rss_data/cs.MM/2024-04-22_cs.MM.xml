      <title>Deep Learning-based Text-in-Image Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel deep learning-based approach to text-in-image watermarking, a method that embeds and extracts textual information within images to enhance data security and integrity. Leveraging the capabilities of deep learning, specifically through the use of Transformer-based architectures for text processing and Vision Transformers for image feature extraction, our method sets new benchmarks in the domain. The proposed method represents the first application of deep learning in text-in-image watermarking that improves adaptivity, allowing the model to intelligently adjust to specific image characteristics and emerging threats. Through testing and evaluation, our method has demonstrated superior robustness compared to traditional watermarking techniques, achieving enhanced imperceptibility that ensures the watermark remains undetectable across various image contents.</description>

      <title>Towards Unified Representation of Multi-Modal Pre-training for 3D Understanding via Differentiable Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D models, which excel in recognition tasks, typically depend on large-scale datasets and well-defined category sets. Recent advances in multi-modal pre-training have demonstrated potential in learning 3D representations by aligning features from 3D shapes with their 2D RGB or depth counterparts. However, these existing frameworks often rely solely on either RGB or depth images, limiting their effectiveness in harnessing a comprehensive range of multi-modal data for 3D applications. To tackle this challenge, we present DR-Point, a tri-modal pre-training framework that learns a unified representation of RGB images, depth images, and 3D point clouds by pre-training with object triplets garnered from each modality. To address the scarcity of such triplets, DR-Point employs differentiable rendering to obtain various depth images. This approach not only augments the supply of depth images but also enhances the accuracy of reconstructed point clouds, thereby promoting the representative learning of the Transformer backbone. Subsequently, using a limited number of synthetically generated triplets, DR-Point effectively learns a 3D representation space that aligns seamlessly with the RGB-Depth image space. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that DR-Point outperforms existing self-supervised learning methods in a wide range of downstream tasks, including 3D object classification, part segmentation, point cloud completion, semantic segmentation, and detection. Additionally, our ablation studies validate the effectiveness of DR-Point in enhancing point cloud understanding.</description>

      <title>Beyond Alignment: Blind Video Face Restoration via Parsing-Guided Temporal-Coherent Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple complex degradations are coupled in low-quality video faces in the real world. Therefore, blind video face restoration is a highly challenging ill-posed problem, requiring not only hallucinating high-fidelity details but also enhancing temporal coherence across diverse pose variations. Restoring each frame independently in a naive manner inevitably introduces temporal incoherence and artifacts from pose changes and keypoint localization errors. To address this, we propose the first blind video face restoration approach with a novel parsing-guided temporal-coherent transformer (PGTFormer) without pre-alignment. PGTFormer leverages semantic parsing guidance to select optimal face priors for generating temporally coherent artifact-free results. Specifically, we pre-train a temporal-spatial vector quantized auto-encoder on high-quality video face datasets to extract expressive context-rich priors. Then, the temporal parse-guided codebook predictor (TPCP) restores faces in different poses based on face parsing context cues without performing face pre-alignment. This strategy reduces artifacts and mitigates jitter caused by cumulative errors from face pre-alignment. Finally, the temporal fidelity regulator (TFR) enhances fidelity through temporal feature interaction and improves video temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on face videos show that our method outperforms previous face restoration baselines. The code will be released on \href{https://github.com/kepengxu/PGTFormer}{https://github.com/kepengxu/PGTFormer}.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Reasoning Using Predicted Latent Personality Dimensions for Optimizing Persuasion Outcome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customizing persuasive conversations related to the outcome of interest for specific users achieves better persuasion results. However, existing persuasive conversation systems rely on persuasive strategies and encounter challenges in dynamically adjusting dialogues to suit the evolving states of individual users during interactions. This limitation restricts the system's ability to deliver flexible or dynamic conversations and achieve suboptimal persuasion outcomes. In this paper, we present a novel approach that tracks a user's latent personality dimensions (LPDs) during ongoing persuasion conversation and generates tailored counterfactual utterances based on these LPDs to optimize the overall persuasion outcome. In particular, our proposed method leverages a Bi-directional Generative Adversarial Network (BiCoGAN) in tandem with a Dialogue-based Personality Prediction Regression (DPPR) model to generate counterfactual data. This enables the system to formulate alternative persuasive utterances that are more suited to the user. Subsequently, we utilize the D3QN model to learn policies for optimized selection of system utterances on counterfactual data. Experimental results we obtained from using the PersuasionForGood dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the existing method, BiCoGAN. The cumulative rewards and Q-values produced by our method surpass ground truth benchmarks, showcasing the efficacy of employing counterfactual reasoning and LPDs to optimize reinforcement learning policy in online interactions.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Character Identification and Speaker Prediction in Comics via Iterative Multimodal Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recognizing characters and predicting speakers of dialogue are critical for comic processing tasks, such as voice generation or translation. However, because characters vary by comic title, supervised learning approaches like training character classifiers which require specific annotations for each comic title are infeasible. This motivates us to propose a novel zero-shot approach, allowing machines to identify characters and predict speaker names based solely on unannotated comic images. In spite of their importance in real-world applications, these task have largely remained unexplored due to challenges in story comprehension and multimodal integration. Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown great capability for text understanding and reasoning, while their application to multimodal content analysis is still an open problem. To address this problem, we propose an iterative multimodal framework, the first to employ multimodal information for both character identification and speaker prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, establishing a robust baseline for these tasks. Furthermore, since our method requires no training data or annotations, it can be used as-is on any comic series.</description>

      <title>Wills Aligner: A Robust Multi-Subject Brain Representation Learner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding visual information from human brain activity has seen remarkable advancements in recent research. However, due to the significant variability in cortical parcellation and cognition patterns across subjects, current approaches personalized deep models for each subject, constraining the practicality of this technology in real-world contexts. To tackle the challenges, we introduce Wills Aligner, a robust multi-subject brain representation learner. Our Wills Aligner initially aligns different subjects' brains at the anatomical level. Subsequently, it incorporates a mixture of brain experts to learn individual cognition patterns. Additionally, it decouples the multi-subject learning task into a two-stage training, propelling the deep model and its plugin network to learn inter-subject commonality knowledge and various cognition patterns, respectively. Wills Aligner enables us to overcome anatomical differences and to efficiently leverage a single model for multi-subject brain representation learning. We meticulously evaluate the performance of our approach across coarse-grained and fine-grained visual decoding tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that our Wills Aligner achieves state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Double Mixture: Towards Continual Event Detection from Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech event detection is crucial for multimedia retrieval, involving the tagging of both semantic and acoustic events. Traditional ASR systems often overlook the interplay between these events, focusing solely on content, even though the interpretation of dialogue can vary with environmental context. This paper tackles two primary challenges in speech event detection: the continual integration of new events without forgetting previous ones, and the disentanglement of semantic from acoustic events. We introduce a new task, continual event detection from speech, for which we also provide two benchmark datasets. To address the challenges of catastrophic forgetting and effective disentanglement, we propose a novel method, 'Double Mixture.' This method merges speech expertise with robust memory mechanisms to enhance adaptability and prevent forgetting. Our comprehensive experiments show that this task presents significant challenges that are not effectively addressed by current state-of-the-art methods in either computer vision or natural language processing. Our approach achieves the lowest rates of forgetting and the highest levels of generalization, proving robust across various continual learning sequences. Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/status/Continual-SpeechED-6461.</description>

      <title>FakeBench: Uncover the Achilles' Heels of Fake Images with Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, fake images generated by artificial intelligence (AI) models have become indistinguishable from the real, exerting new challenges for fake image detection models. To this extent, simple binary judgments of real or fake seem less convincing and credible due to the absence of human-understandable explanations. Fortunately, Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) bring possibilities to materialize the judgment process while their performance remains undetermined. Therefore, we propose FakeBench, the first-of-a-kind benchmark towards transparent defake, consisting of fake images with human language descriptions on forgery signs. FakeBench gropes for two open questions of LMMs: (1) can LMMs distinguish fake images generated by AI, and (2) how do LMMs distinguish fake images? In specific, we construct the FakeClass dataset with 6k diverse-sourced fake and real images, each equipped with a Question&amp;Answer pair concerning the authenticity of images, which are utilized to benchmark the detection ability. To examine the reasoning and interpretation abilities of LMMs, we present the FakeClue dataset, consisting of 15k pieces of descriptions on the telltale clues revealing the falsification of fake images. Besides, we construct the FakeQA to measure the LMMs' open-question answering ability on fine-grained authenticity-relevant aspects. Our experimental results discover that current LMMs possess moderate identification ability, preliminary interpretation and reasoning ability, and passable open-question answering ability for image defake. The FakeBench will be made publicly available soon.</description>

      <title>Movie101v2: Improved Movie Narration Benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic movie narration targets at creating video-aligned plot descriptions to assist visually impaired audiences. It differs from standard video captioning in that it requires not only describing key visual details but also inferring the plots developed across multiple movie shots, thus posing unique and ongoing challenges. To advance the development of automatic movie narrating systems, we first revisit the limitations of existing datasets and develop a large-scale, bilingual movie narration dataset, Movie101v2. Second, taking into account the essential difficulties in achieving applicable movie narration, we break the long-term goal into three progressive stages and tentatively focus on the initial stages featuring understanding within individual clips. We also introduce a new narration assessment to align with our staged task goals. Third, using our new dataset, we baseline several leading large vision-language models, including GPT-4V, and conduct in-depth investigations into the challenges current models face for movie narration generation. Our findings reveal that achieving applicable movie narration generation is a fascinating goal that requires thorough research.</description>

      <title>Attack on Scene Flow using Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in accurately estimating scene flow using point clouds, which is vital for many applications like video analysis, action recognition, and navigation. Robustness of these techniques, however, remains a concern, particularly in the face of adversarial attacks that have been proven to deceive state-of-the-art deep neural networks in many domains. Surprisingly, the robustness of scene flow networks against such attacks has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this problem, the proposed approach aims to bridge this gap by introducing adversarial white-box attacks specifically tailored for scene flow networks. Experimental results show that the generated adversarial examples obtain up to 33.7 relative degradation in average end-point error on the KITTI and FlyingThings3D datasets. The study also reveals the significant impact that attacks targeting point clouds in only one dimension or color channel have on average end-point error. Analyzing the success and failure of these attacks on the scene flow networks and their 2D optical flow network variants show a higher vulnerability for the optical flow networks.</description>

      <title>Mixture of LoRA Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LoRA has gained widespread acceptance in the fine-tuning of large pre-trained models to cater to a diverse array of downstream tasks, showcasing notable effectiveness and efficiency, thereby solidifying its position as one of the most prevalent fine-tuning techniques. Due to the modular nature of LoRA's plug-and-play plugins, researchers have delved into the amalgamation of multiple LoRAs to empower models to excel across various downstream tasks. Nonetheless, extant approaches for LoRA fusion grapple with inherent challenges. Direct arithmetic merging may result in the loss of the original pre-trained model's generative capabilities or the distinct identity of LoRAs, thereby yielding suboptimal outcomes. On the other hand, Reference tuning-based fusion exhibits limitations concerning the requisite flexibility for the effective combination of multiple LoRAs. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces the Mixture of LoRA Experts (MoLE) approach, which harnesses hierarchical control and unfettered branch selection. The MoLE approach not only achieves superior LoRA fusion performance in comparison to direct arithmetic merging but also retains the crucial flexibility for combining LoRAs effectively. Extensive experimental evaluations conducted in both the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Vision &amp; Language (V&amp;L) domains substantiate the efficacy of MoLE.</description>

      <title>Anchor-aware Deep Metric Learning for Audio-visual Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric learning minimizes the gap between similar (positive) pairs of data points and increases the separation of dissimilar (negative) pairs, aiming at capturing the underlying data structure and enhancing the performance of tasks like audio-visual cross-modal retrieval (AV-CMR). Recent works employ sampling methods to select impactful data points from the embedding space during training. However, the model training fails to fully explore the space due to the scarcity of training data points, resulting in an incomplete representation of the overall positive and negative distributions. In this paper, we propose an innovative Anchor-aware Deep Metric Learning (AADML) method to address this challenge by uncovering the underlying correlations among existing data points, which enhances the quality of the shared embedding space. Specifically, our method establishes a correlation graph-based manifold structure by considering the dependencies between each sample as the anchor and its semantically similar samples. Through dynamic weighting of the correlations within this underlying manifold structure using an attention-driven mechanism, Anchor Awareness (AA) scores are obtained for each anchor. These AA scores serve as data proxies to compute relative distances in metric learning approaches. Extensive experiments conducted on two audio-visual benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AADML method, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of AA proxies with various metric learning methods, further highlighting the efficacy of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold-start item recommendation is a long-standing challenge in recommendation systems. A common remedy is to use a content-based approach, but rich information from raw contents in various forms has not been fully utilized. In this paper, we propose a domain/data-agnostic item representation learning framework for cold-start recommendations, naturally equipped with multimodal alignment among various features by adopting a Transformer-based architecture. Our proposed model is end-to-end trainable completely free from classification labels, not just costly to collect but suboptimal for recommendation-purpose representation learning. From extensive experiments on real-world movie and news recommendation benchmarks, we verify that our approach better preserves fine-grained user taste than state-of-the-art baselines, universally applicable to multiple domains at large scale.</description>

      <title>Towards Better Text-to-Image Generation Alignment via Attention Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In text-to-image generation tasks, the advancements of diffusion models have facilitated the fidelity of generated results. However, these models encounter challenges when processing text prompts containing multiple entities and attributes. The uneven distribution of attention results in the issues of entity leakage and attribute misalignment. Training from scratch to address this issue requires numerous labeled data and is resource-consuming. Motivated by this, we propose an attribution-focusing mechanism, a training-free phase-wise mechanism by modulation of attention for diffusion model. One of our core ideas is to guide the model to concentrate on the corresponding syntactic components of the prompt at distinct timesteps. To achieve this, we incorporate a temperature control mechanism within the early phases of the self-attention modules to mitigate entity leakage issues. An object-focused masking scheme and a phase-wise dynamic weight control mechanism are integrated into the cross-attention modules, enabling the model to discern the affiliation of semantic information between entities more effectively. The experimental results in various alignment scenarios demonstrate that our model attain better image-text alignment with minimal additional computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of smart devices leads to an exponential increase in multimedia content. However, the rapid advancements in deep learning have given rise to sophisticated algorithms capable of manipulating or creating multimedia fake content, known as Deepfake. Audio Deepfakes pose a significant threat by producing highly realistic voices, thus facilitating the spread of misinformation. To address this issue, numerous audio anti-spoofing detection challenges have been organized to foster the development of anti-spoofing countermeasures. This survey paper presents a comprehensive review of every component within the detection pipeline, including algorithm architectures, optimization techniques, application generalizability, evaluation metrics, performance comparisons, available datasets, and open-source availability.

      <title>Gorgeous: Create Your Desired Character Facial Makeup from Any Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13944</link>

Abstract: Contemporary makeup transfer methods primarily focus on replicating makeup from one face to another, considerably limiting their use in creating diverse and creative character makeup essential for visual storytelling. Such methods typically fail to address the need for uniqueness and contextual relevance, specifically aligning with character and story settings as they depend heavily on existing facial makeup in reference images. This approach also presents a significant challenge when attempting to source a perfectly matched facial makeup style, further complicating the creation of makeup designs inspired by various story elements, such as theme, background, and props that do not necessarily feature faces. To address these limitations, we introduce $Gorgeous$, a novel diffusion-based makeup application method that goes beyond simple transfer by innovatively crafting unique and thematic facial makeup. Unlike traditional methods, $Gorgeous$ does not require the presence of a face in the reference images. Instead, it draws artistic inspiration from a minimal set of three to five images, which can be of any type, and transforms these elements into practical makeup applications directly on the face. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that $Gorgeous$ can effectively generate distinctive character facial makeup inspired by the chosen thematic reference images. This approach opens up new possibilities for integrating broader story elements into character makeup, thereby enhancing the narrative depth and visual impact in storytelling.</description>

      <title>GaussianTalker: Speaker-specific Talking Head Synthesis via 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works on audio-driven talking head synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results. However, due to inadequate pose and expression control caused by NeRF implicit representation, these methods still have some limitations, such as unsynchronized or unnatural lip movements, and visual jitter and artifacts. In this paper, we propose GaussianTalker, a novel method for audio-driven talking head synthesis based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. With the explicit representation property of 3D Gaussians, intuitive control of the facial motion is achieved by binding Gaussians to 3D facial models. GaussianTalker consists of two modules, Speaker-specific Motion Translator and Dynamic Gaussian Renderer. Speaker-specific Motion Translator achieves accurate lip movements specific to the target speaker through universalized audio feature extraction and customized lip motion generation. Dynamic Gaussian Renderer introduces Speaker-specific BlendShapes to enhance facial detail representation via a latent pose, delivering stable and realistic rendered videos. Extensive experimental results suggest that GaussianTalker outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in talking head synthesis, delivering precise lip synchronization and exceptional visual quality. Our method achieves rendering speeds of 130 FPS on NVIDIA RTX4090 GPU, significantly exceeding the threshold for real-time rendering performance, and can potentially be deployed on other hardware platforms.</description>

      <title>TAVGBench: Benchmarking Text to Audible-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Text to Audible-Video Generation (TAVG) task involves generating videos with accompanying audio based on text descriptions. Achieving this requires skillful alignment of both audio and video elements. To support research in this field, we have developed a comprehensive Text to Audible-Video Generation Benchmark (TAVGBench), which contains over 1.7 million clips with a total duration of 11.8 thousand hours. We propose an automatic annotation pipeline to ensure each audible video has detailed descriptions for both its audio and video contents. We also introduce the Audio-Visual Harmoni score (AVHScore) to provide a quantitative measure of the alignment between the generated audio and video modalities. Additionally, we present a baseline model for TAVG called TAVDiffusion, which uses a two-stream latent diffusion model to provide a fundamental starting point for further research in this area. We achieve the alignment of audio and video by employing cross-attention and contrastive learning. Through extensive experiments and evaluations on TAVGBench, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model under both conventional metrics and our proposed metrics.</description>

      <title>What's Wrong with the Bottom-up Methods in Arbitrary-shape Scene Text Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest trend in the bottom-up perspective for arbitrary-shape scene text detection is to reason the links between text segments using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Notwithstanding, the performance of the best performing bottom-up method is still inferior to that of the best performing top-down method even with the help of GCN. We argue that this is not mainly caused by the limited feature capturing ability of the text proposal backbone or GCN, but by their failure to make a full use of visual-relational features for suppressing false detection, as well as the sub-optimal route-finding mechanism used for grouping text segments. In this paper, we revitalize the classic text detection frameworks by aggregating the visual-relational features of text with two effective false positive/negative suppression mechanisms. First, dense overlapping text segments depicting the `characterness' and `streamline' of text are generated for further relational reasoning and weakly supervised segment classification. Here, relational graph features are used for suppressing false positives/negatives. Then, to fuse the relational features with visual features, a Location-Aware Transfer (LAT) module is designed to transfer text's relational features into visual compatible features with a Fuse Decoding (FD) module to enhance the representation of text regions for the second step suppression. Finally, a novel multiple-text-map-aware contour-approximation strategy is developed, instead of the widely-used route-finding process. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets, i.e., CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500, and MLT2017 demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance when being embedded in a classic text detection framework, which revitalises the superb strength of the bottom-up methods.</description>

      <title>Smart Fitting Room: A One-stop Framework for Matching-aware Virtual Try-on</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of virtual try-on has revolutionized online shopping by allowing customers to visualize themselves in various fashion items, thus extending the in-store try-on experience to the cyber space. Although virtual try-on has attracted considerable research initiatives, existing systems only focus on the quality of image generation, overlooking whether the fashion item is a good match to the given person and clothes. Recognizing this gap, we propose to design a one-stop Smart Fitting Room, with the novel formulation of matching-aware virtual try-on. Following this formulation, we design a Hybrid Matching-aware Virtual Try-On Framework (HMaVTON), which combines retrieval-based and generative methods to foster a more personalized virtual try-on experience. This framework integrates a hybrid mix-and-match module and an enhanced virtual try-on module. The former can recommend fashion items available on the platform to boost sales and generate clothes that meets the diverse tastes of consumers. The latter provides high-quality try-on effects, delivering a one-stop shopping service. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we enlist the expertise of fashion designers for a professional evaluation, assessing the rationality and diversity of the clothes combinations and conducting an evaluation matrix analysis. Our method significantly enhances the practicality of virtual try-on. The code is available at https://github.com/Yzcreator/HMaVTON.</description>

      <title>GestaltMML: Enhancing Rare Genetic Disease Diagnosis through Multimodal Machine Learning Combining Facial Images and Clinical Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Individuals with suspected rare genetic disorders often undergo multiple clinical evaluations, imaging studies, laboratory tests and genetic tests, to find a possible answer over a prolonged period of time. Addressing this "diagnostic odyssey" thus has substantial clinical, psychosocial, and economic benefits. Many rare genetic diseases have distinctive facial features, which can be used by artificial intelligence algorithms to facilitate clinical diagnosis, in prioritizing candidate diseases to be further examined by lab tests or genetic assays, or in helping the phenotype-driven reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data. Existing methods using frontal facial photos were built on conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), rely exclusively on facial images, and cannot capture non-facial phenotypic traits and demographic information essential for guiding accurate diagnoses. Here we introduce GestaltMML, a multimodal machine learning (MML) approach solely based on the Transformer architecture. It integrates facial images, demographic information (age, sex, ethnicity), and clinical notes (optionally, a list of Human Phenotype Ontology terms) to improve prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we also evaluated GestaltMML on a diverse range of datasets, including 528 diseases from the GestaltMatcher Database, several in-house datasets of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS, over-growth syndrome with distinct facial features), Sotos syndrome (overgrowth syndrome with overlapping features with BWS), NAA10-related neurodevelopmental syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome), and KBG syndrome (multiple malformation syndrome). Our results suggest that GestaltMML effectively incorporates multiple modalities of data, greatly narrowing candidate genetic diagnoses of rare diseases and may facilitate the reinterpretation of genome/exome sequencing data.</description>

      <title>Seeing Text in the Dark: Algorithm and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Localizing text in low-light environments is challenging due to visual degradations. Although a straightforward solution involves a two-stage pipeline with low-light image enhancement (LLE) as the initial step followed by detector, LLE is primarily designed for human vision instead of machine and can accumulate errors. In this work, we propose an efficient and effective single-stage approach for localizing text in dark that circumvents the need for LLE. We introduce a constrained learning module as an auxiliary mechanism during the training stage of the text detector. This module is designed to guide the text detector in preserving textual spatial features amidst feature map resizing, thus minimizing the loss of spatial information in texts under low-light visual degradations. Specifically, we incorporate spatial reconstruction and spatial semantic constraints within this module to ensure the text detector acquires essential positional and contextual range knowledge. Our approach enhances the original text detector's ability to identify text's local topological features using a dynamic snake feature pyramid network and adopts a bottom-up contour shaping strategy with a novel rectangular accumulation technique for accurate delineation of streamlined text features. In addition, we present a comprehensive low-light dataset for arbitrary-shaped text, encompassing diverse scenes and languages. Notably, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on this low-light dataset and exhibits comparable performance on standard normal light datasets. The code and dataset will be released.</description>
