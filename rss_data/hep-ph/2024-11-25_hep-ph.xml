      <title>Constraining Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet suppression and modification is a hallmark feature of heavy-ion collisions. This can be attributed to an accumulated set of effects, including radiative and elastic energy loss and reabsorption of thermalized energy within the jet cone, which are encoded in a quenching weight, determining the probability distribution for a shift of the $p_T$ (energy loss). We perform a data-driven analysis, based on Bayesian inference, to extract information about the energy-loss distribution experienced by propagating jets using generic and flexible parametrizations. We first establish the consistency between different data-sets and, thereby, provide evidence for the universality of the quark/gluon quenching weights for different observables. Furthermore, we extract that the color dependence of energy loss is slightly bigger than what expected from Casimir scaling, pointing to the importance of multi-parton quenching within high-$p_T$ jets at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Gluon Saturation Effects in Exclusive Heavy Vector Meson Photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study exclusive $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproduction for proton and Pb targets in the high-energy limit, with the energy dependence computed using the linear Balitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov and the nonlinear Balitsky-Kovchegov evolution equations. The difference between these two evolution equations can be directly attributed to gluon saturation physics. We find that for proton targets there is no difference between the two approaches at the energies of the currently available data, while for Pb targets in $J/\psi$ production the data shows a clear preference for the evolution with gluon saturation.</description>

      <title>Relative Hadron Yields in HRG With Medium Modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of a constituent quark mass model, the modified baryon masses are incorporated into the hadron resonance gas (HRG) based analysis of the like mass particle ratios in ultra relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions (URNNC) over a wide range of collision energy. In addition we have incorporated an essential feature of the hadronic interaction at short distance, i.e. the hard-core repulsion by using the standard excluded volume type approach. We have extracted the chemical freeze-out conditions. The resulting freeze-out line in our case is compared with those obtained earlier using different model approaches. The correlation between $k^{-}/k^{+}$ and $\bar p/p$ ratios is also studied.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Insights into Quark-Antiquark Interactions: Probing Field Distributions and String Tension in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14902v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interactions between quark-antiquark pairs is essential for elucidating quark confinement within the framework of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the field distribution patterns that arise between these pairs by employing advanced machine learning techniques, namely multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN), to analyze data obtained from lattice QCD simulations. The models developed through this training are then applied to calculate the string tension and width associated with chromo flux tubes, and these results are rigorously compared to those derived from lattice QCD. Moreover, we introduce a preliminary analytical expression that characterizes the field distribution as a function of quark separation, utilizing the KAN methodology. Our comprehensive quantitative analysis underscores the potential of integrating machine learning approaches into conventional QCD research.</description>

      <title>Jet Substructure Analysis for Distinguishing Left- and Right-Handed Couplings of Heavy Neutrino in $W'$ Decay at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for heavy $W'$ bosons in their decay modes to a lepton and a heavy neutrino offers a promising avenue for probing new physics beyond the Standard Model. This work focuses on such a signature with an energetic lepton plus a fat jet, originating from the heavy neutrino and containing a lepton. We have employed the jet substructure techniques to isolate the embedded lepton as a subjet of the fat jet. The Lepton Subjet Fraction ($LSF$) and Lepton Mass Drop ($LMD$) variables constructed from the lepton subjet help in separating the signal region from the background. We further study the polarization properties of the $W'$ coupling to the lepton and heavy neutrino through the decay products of the neutrino. Instead of relying on a specific model, we employ generic couplings and explore the discrimination power. Jet substructure-based angular variables $z_\ell$, $z_\theta$, and $z_k$ are combined to form BDT scores to obtain better separation power between left-chiral ($V-A$) and right-chiral ($V+A$) coupling configurations. By using $CL_s$ type profile likelihood estimator, we could achieve $\sim$ 2$\sigma$ $-$ 3$\sigma$ significance of excluding one coupling configuration in favour of the other.</description>

      <title>Effects of heavy quarks in the dipole cross section with the KLN model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dipole cross-section behavior for protons and nuclei is analyzed with and without considering the heavy quark masses in the Bjorken variable $x$ using the Kharzeev-Levin-Nardi (KLN) model of low $x$ gluon distributions. The Color Glass Condensate (CGC) effects in the color dipole model are influenced by the heavy quark masses in the Bjorken variable $x$ at $Q^2&lt;Q_{s}^2$. These non-linear saturation effects will be observable in the LHeC and EIC at very small $x$ values.</description>

      <title>Hyperons in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the effects induced by the potential presence of hyperons in hot and ultra-dense matter within the context of neutron star mergers. Specifically, we address their effect on the dominant post-merger frequency of the gravitational waves. By performing a simulation campaign with a large sample of hyperonic and nucleonic equations of state, we explicitly show that the unique thermal behavior of hyperonic equations of state results in a systematic shift of the dominant frequency with respect to the nucleonic reference level. The predicted shift has values of up to 150 Hz, and it could be detected with the newest generations of gravitational wave detectors. Thus this approach opens a new path for signaling the presence of hyperons in neutron star remnant matter.</description>

      <title>The two-loop coefficient functions for double deeply virtual Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Making use of conformal symmetry of large-$n_f$ QCD in $d=4-2\epsilon$ dimensions at the Wilson-Fischer fixed point, we calculate the two-loop coefficient functions in the operator product expansion of two electromagnetic currents in general kinematics with two different photon virtualities. This result is necessary for the description of the double deeply virtual Compton scattering to the next-to-next-to-leading order accuracy, but is also interesting for a range of other two-photon processes. We present analytic expression for the coefficient function in momentum fraction space in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme and study its numerical impact on the Compton form factors for a simple model of the generalized parton distributions. The calculated corrections turn out to be large and are significant for the kinematics of proposed experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Dark Matter Production in Supergravity $\alpha$-Attractor Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider gravitational particle production (GPP) of dark matter (DM) under supergravity framework, where $\alpha$-attractor inflation model is used. The particle spectrum is computed numerically and the dark matter number density is obtained. We show how the dark matter mass, gravitino mass and inflation model parameters modify the results, and find the corresponding reheating temperature which leads to sufficient DM production. In our setup, supergravity corrections suppress the efficiency of GPP, and make the isocurvature constraint much weaker compared with the normal case. With tensor to scalar ratio ranges from $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$, and dark matter mass from $10^{-2} m_\phi - m_\phi$, the required reheating temperature should be around $10^3 \textrm{GeV} - 10^7 \textrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Forward parton-nucleus scattering at next-to-eikonal accuracy in the CGC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the full next-to-eikonal (NEik) corrections to the gluon propagator from before to after traversing a highly boosted gluon background field, including corrections both beyond the shockwave limit and beyond the static limit in particular. After summarizing the results of the full NEik corrections to the before-to-after quark propagator computed in our earlier works, we also derive the before-to-inside, inside-to-inside and inside-to-after quark and gluon propagators, which are building blocks to calculate high-energy scattering processes at NEik order. Using these results and also including the NEik corrections that stem from interactions with the target via t-channel quark exchanges, we compute inclusive cross sections for quark and gluon production at forward rapidities in quark-nucleus and gluon-nucleus scatterings at NEik accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dark showers from sneaky dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal composite dark matter model, based on a $SU(N_d)$ dark sector with $n_f$ dark quarks and a heavy t-channel mediator. For $n_f\geq 4$, the dark flavor symmetry guarantees the stability of a subset of the dark pions, which serve as our dark matter candidates. Their relic abundance is determined by co-scattering or co-annihilation with the remaining dark pions, which are unstable and decay. Due to their degenerate masses, the annihilation cross section is suppressed at low temperatures, thereby avoiding stringent constraints from indirect detection and opening up the GeV mass window. The decaying dark pions are naturally long lived. We obtain limits on the model from semi-visible or emerging jet searches and estimate the reach of future probes.</description>

      <title>Thermalization effects on the dynamics of growing vacuum bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of growing vacuum bubbles. The bubble walls interact with the surrounding fluid and may, consequently, reach a terminal velocity. If the mean free path of the particles in the fluid is much shorter than the bubble wall thickness, the fluid is locally in thermal equilibrium and the wall's terminal velocity can be determined by entropy conservation. On the other hand, if local thermal equilibrium inside the wall cannot be maintained, the wall velocity can be estimated from the pressure impacted by ballistic particle dynamics at the wall. We find that the latter case leads to slightly slower bubble walls. Expectedly, we find the largest differences in the terminal velocity when the fluid is entirely ballistic. This observation indicates that the non-equilibrium effects inside walls are relevant. To study bubble evolution, we perform hydrodynamic lattice simulations in the case of local thermal equilibrium and $N$-body simulations in the ballistic case to investigate the dynamical effects during expansion. Both simulations show that even if a stationary solution exists in theory it may not be reached depending on the dynamics of the accelerating bubble walls.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-FIMP dark matter in presence of a SIMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pseudo-feebly Interacting Massive Particle (pFIMP) has been postulated in two component dark matter (DM) scenarios, where it has feeble interaction with the visible sector, but sizeable one with a thermal bath partner. In this work, we study the possibility and dynamics of pFIMP in presence of a Strongly Interacting Massive Particle (SIMP), which is well known to solve too-big-to-fail and core-vs-cusp problems. Our analysis is primarily model-independent via solving coupled Boltzmann equations, with negligible DM-DM conversion adhering to pure SIMP-FIMP limit, and then with larger DM-DM conversion rate pertaining to SIMP-pFIMP limit. We also illustrate the simplest model yielding pFIMP-SIMP set-up having two scalars stabilised under $\mathbb{Z}_2\otimes \mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, and explore the accessible parameter space after addressing relic density, unitarity, self interaction constraints etc. pFIMP detectability is limited in such circumstances, but possible via a thermal DM loop when the SIMP has a visible sector interaction via light mediator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study leptogenesis from the decay of the lightest sterile neutrino in the scotogenic model with a scalar dark matter candidate. Our analysis focuses on the possible exponential suppression of washouts for sizable values of the inert Higgs mass and the crucial role of some spectator processes for this to happen. We show that leptogenesis can be successful for TeV-scale masses of the lightest sterile neutrino for both, thermal and zero, initial abundances of the neutrinos. Moreover, leptogenesis is viable for Yukawa couplings of the heavier sterile neutrinos large enough to yield observable charged lepton flavor violation processes in current and planned experiments.</description>

      <title>Matrix moment approach to positivity bounds and UV reconstruction from IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positivity bounds in effective field theories (EFTs) can be extracted through the moment problem approach, utilizing well-established results from the mathematical literature. We generalize this formalism using the matrix moment approach to derive positivity bounds for theories with multiple field components. The sufficient conditions for obtaining optimal bounds are identified and applied to several example field theories, yielding results that match precisely the numerical bounds computed using other methods. The upper unitarity bounds can also be easily harnessed in the matrix case. Furthermore, the moment problem formulation also provides a means to reverse engineer the UV spectrum from the EFT coefficients, often uniquely, as explicitly demonstrated in examples such as string amplitudes and the $stu$ kink theory.</description>

      <title>Origin of cosmological neutrino mass bounds: background $\textit{versus}$ perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological upper bound on the total neutrino mass is the dominant limit on this fundamental parameter. Recent observations-soon to be improved-have strongly tightened it, approaching the lower limit set by oscillation data. Understanding its physical origin, robustness, and model-independence becomes pressing. Here, we explicitly separate for the first time the two distinct cosmological neutrino-mass effects: the impact on background evolution, related to the energy in neutrino masses; and the "kinematic" impact on perturbations, related to neutrino free-streaming. We scrutinize how they affect CMB anisotropies, introducing two effective masses enclosing $\textit{background}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Backg.}$) and $\textit{perturbations}$ ($\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$) effects. We analyze CMB data, finding that the neutrino-mass bound is mostly a background measurement, i.e., how the neutrino energy density evolves with time. The bound on the "kinematic" variable $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.}$ is largely relaxed, $\sum m_\nu^\mathrm{Pert.} &lt; 0.8\,\mathrm{eV}$. This work thus adds clarity to the physical origin of the cosmological neutrino-mass bound, which is mostly a measurement of the neutrino equation of state, providing also hints to evade such a bound.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue for the existence of bounds on the tensions of $p$-branes in de Sitter space in terms of the Hubble rate and the strength of a class of Chern-Simons-like couplings. The world-volume couplings involve Abelian 1-form gauge fields in the bulk and possibly field strengths intrinsic to the brane. In many cases these couplings are the D-brane Chern-Simons terms present in string theory, while in other cases they are the interactions of axion domain walls with $U(1)$ fields. Our arguments use the same logic and assumptions as the recent Festina Lente proposal (thus utilizing the properties of Nariai de Sitter black holes) and generalize it to extended objects, thereby providing a bottom-up set of constraints independent of any particular UV completion. We compare these bounds to the properties of (wrapped) D-branes in Type II string theory in the weak coupling limit, under the assumption that these properties are not modified significantly in de Sitter constructions. We find that all constraints are satisfied by D-branes, providing further evidence for the Festina Lente conjecture. For the particular case of 2-branes with Chern-Simons interactions we obtain a bound, which however can be evaded if the theory contains a light axion. Similarly, we find the bounds do not apply to axion domain walls due to the presence of the axion.</description>

      <title>Transverse and longitudinal spin alignment from color fields in heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spin alignment stemming from spin correlation of the quark and antiquark induced by background color fields in relativistic heavy ion collisions. The quark-coalescence equation relating the collision kernel of the vector-meson kinetic equation to spin alignment is expanded to the relativistic case. Focusing on the color-octet contribution, the spin alignment for $\phi$ mesons from glasma fields with momentum dependence is investigated, where the scenarios for different spin quantization axes are considered. Moreover, we qualitatively analyze the spin alignment from isotropic color fields in the quark gluon plasma phase for comparison. In particular, we propose that the experimental measurement of spin alignment along the beam direction, dubbed as the longitudinal spin alignment, could be useful to identify the dominance of longitudinal spin correlation potentially led by the glasma effect in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the deformed nuclear structure at small-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of high-energy JIMWLK evolution on the deformed structure or heavy (Uranium) and intermediate (Ruthenium) nuclei. The soft gluon emissions in the high-energy evolution are found to drive the initially deformed nuclei towards a more spherical shape, although the evolution is slow ,especially for the longest distance-scale quadrupole deformation. We confirm a linear relationship between the squared eccentricity $\varepsilon_n^2$ and the deformation parameter $\beta_n^2$ in central collisions across the energy range covered by the RHIC and LHC measurements. The applied JIMWLK evolution is found to leave visible signatures in the eccentricity evolution that can be observed if the same nuclei can be collided at RHIC and at the LHC, or in rapidity-dependent flow measurements. Our results demonstrate the importance of including the Bjorken-$x$ dependent nuclear geometry when comparing simulations of the Quark Gluon Plasma evolution with precise flow measurements at high collision energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14935v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic \textit{ab initio} study of the low-lying states in beryllium isotopes from $^7\text{Be}$ to $^{12}\text{Be}$ using nuclear lattice effective field theory with the N$^3$LO interaction. Our calculations achieve excellent agreement with experimental data for energies, radii, and electromagnetic properties. We introduce a novel, model-independent method to quantify nuclear shapes, uncovering a distinct pattern in the interplay between positive and negative parity states across the isotopic chain. Our geometrical analysis reveals prominent two-center cluster structures, the emergence of one-neutron halo, and complex nuclear molecular dynamics, underscoring the strong clustering features inherent to beryllium isotopes.</description>

      <title>Study of collective phenomena via the production of heavy quarks and quarkonia in hadronic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open heavy flavor and quarkonia have long been identified as ideal probes for understanding the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Heavy quarks are produced in the early stage of the heavy-ion collisions. Therefore they experience the evolution of the medium produced, providing an important tool to investigate the properties of the QGP. In particular, the magnitude of the elliptic flow measured at the LHC is interpreted as a signature of the charm-quark thermalization in the QGP. This is reflected in the azimuthal anisotropies of the final particles. In addition, the observation of collective-like effects in high-multiplicity pp and p--Pb collisions provides new insights on the evolution of QGP-related observables going from large to small collision systems. A better understanding of heavy-quark energy loss, quarkonium dissociation, and production mechanism can therefore be obtained with those system-size dependent observables. We present recent results of the $\mathrm{J}/\psi $ and open heavy-flavor hadrons flow in pp, p--Pb, and Pb--Pb collisions carried out by the ALICE collaboration.</description>

      <title>On the origin of mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, lattice simulations of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory revealed that rotating hot gluon matter in thermal equilibrium possesses a novel inhomogeneous phase consisting of the deconfinement phase located in the center region, which is spatially separated from the confinement phase in the periphery. This inhomogeneous two-phase structure is also expected to be produced by vorticity in quark-gluon plasma formed in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that its vortical properties are determined by two types of couplings of the angular velocity to the gluon fields: a linear coupling to the mechanical angular momentum of gluons and a quadratic ``magnetovortical'' coupling to a chromomagnetic component. We demonstrate numerically that the distinctive inhomogeneous structure of the vortical (quark-)gluon plasma is determined by the latter, while the former plays only a subleading role. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluonic action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also support our findings with Monte Carlo simulations of Yang-Mills plasma at the real-valued angular frequency, which take into account only the magnetic part of the action.</description>

      <title>Inelastic heavy quarkonium photoproduction in $p$-$p$ and $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.12153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inelastic charmonium ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$) and bottomonium ($\Upsilon(nS)$) photoproduction and fragmentation processes in $p$-$p$ and $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions at LHC energies, where the ultra-incoherent photon emission is included. In the framework of the NRQCD factorization approach, an exact treatment is developed which recovers Weizs\"{a}cker-Williams approximation (WWA) near the region $Q^{2}\sim0$, where the methods of Martin-Ryskin and BCCKL are used to avoid double counting. We calculate the $Q^{2}$, $y$, $z$, $\sqrt{s}$, $p_{T}$ dependent and the total cross sections. It turns out that the inelastic photoproduction and fragmentation processes provide valuable contributions to the heavy quarkonium production, especially in the large $p_{T}$ regions. While the relative contribution of ultra-incoherent photon channel is very important, which rapidly increases along with the growing quarkonium mass, and begins to dominate the photoproduction processes at large $p_{T}$ ranges. Moreover, we obtain the complete validity scopes of WWA in inelastic heavy quarkonium photoproduction in heavy-ion collisions. WWA has a much higher accuracy at high energies and in $Pb$-$Pb$ collisions. The existing photon spectra are generally derived beyond the applicable scopes of WWA, and the double counting exists when the different channels are considered simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dimensions via on-shell Methods: Operator Mixing and Leading Mass Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on the application of on-shell and unitarity-based methods for evaluating renormalization group coefficients, and generalize this framework to account for the mixing of operators with different dimensions and leading mass effects. We derive a master formula for anomalous dimensions stemming from the general structure of operator mixings, up to two-loop order, and show how the Higgs low-energy theorem can be exploited to include leading mass effects. A few applications on the renormalization properties of popular effective field theories showcase the strength of the proposed approach, which drastically reduces the complexity of standard loop calculations. Our results provide a powerful tool to interpret experimental measurements of low-energy observables, such as flavor violating processes or electric and magnetic dipole moments, as induced by new physics emerging above the electroweak scale.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Performance on Higgs-Pair Production Associated with Dark Matter at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Di-Higgs production at the LHC associated with missing transverse energy is explored in the context of simplified models that generically parameterize a large class of models with heavy scalars and dark matter candidates. Our aim is to figure out the improvement capability of machine-learning tools over traditional cut-based analyses. In particular, boosted decision trees and neural networks are implemented in order to determine the parameter space that can be tested at the LHC demanding four $b$-jets and large missing energy in the final state. We present a performance comparison between both machine-learning algorithms, based on the maximum significance reached, by feeding them with different sets of kinematic features corresponding to the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. Both algorithms present very similar performances and substantially improve traditional analyses, being sensitive to most of the parameter space considered for a total integrated luminosity of 1 ab$^{-1}$, with significances at the evidence level, and even at the discovery level, depending on the masses of the new heavy scalars. A more conservative approach with systematic uncertainties on the background of 30\% has also been contemplated, again providing very promising significances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the potential of future proton decay experiments on the exploration of the flavour space of grand unification. We focus on an economical $SU(5)$ grand unified model (GUT) with the fermion sector extended by including only one copy of 24-plet. Neutrino masses are generated via type-(I+III) seesaw mechanism with the lightest neutrino massless. Gauge unification requires masses of fermions in the 24-plet to be hierarchical, in particular, the electroweak singlet and triplet heavy leptons to be around the canonical seesaw scale and TeV scale, respectively. We address how extra parameters in the flavour space which cannot be touched in flavour measurements can be tested by a multi-channel analysis in future proton decay measurements.</description>

      <title>Hadron-ion collisions in Pythia and the vector-meson dominance model for photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension to the Pythia Monte Carlo event generator that enables simulations of collisions between a generic hadron beam on a nuclear target with energy variation in event-by-event basis. This builds upon Pythia's module for heavy ions, Angantyr, as well as previous work on simulating hadron-proton collisions. As such, the extensions in this work are largely technical, except for a rudimentary model for hadronic fluctuations. With hadron-ion simulations, we implement an explicit vector-meson dominance (VMD) model that can be used to simulate interactions of hadronic component of real photons in photo-nuclear collisions. Such processes can be studied in ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions and in the future also with the upcoming Electron-Ion Collider. Our work also has applications to hadronic showers, e.g. air showers initiated by high-energy cosmic rays. We first validate the VMD model by comparing to HERA photoproduction data on proton target. Then we apply this to generate events for ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions at the LHC and present the results corresponding to the event-selection criteria matching to a recent ATLAS analysis. We find that single-particle multiplicity and rapidity distributions are well in line with the measured ones. We also construct the Fourier coefficients from two-particle correlations for the simulated events and study whether the resulting azimuthal anisotropies are consistent with the ATLAS results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider top quark production and decay in the narrow width approximation and study if the polarisation effects, that manifest themselves in correlations of angular distributions of particles from top quark decays and final state jets in the production sub-process, are affected by linear power corrections. We find that, in general, the answer to this question is affirmative. We also discuss how these non-perturbative corrections affect polarisation observables used to study single top production at the LHC. Finally, we point out that generic kinematic distributions of leptons from top quark decays are affected by linear power corrections, which may have implications for proposals to extract the top quark mass from such leptonic observables. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the distribution of the ``out-of-collision-plane'' component of the positron momentum is free from linear power corrections, making it an interesting candidate for the top quark mass measurement.</description>

      <title>One Born$-$Oppenheimer Effective Theory to rule them all: hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons and quarkonium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of XYZ exotic states in the hadronic sector with two heavy quarks, represents a significant challenge in particle theory. Understanding and predicting their nature remains an open problem. In this work, we demonstrate how the Born$-$Oppenheimer (BO) effective field theory (BOEFT), derived from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) on the basis of scale separation and symmetries, can address XYZ exotics of any composition. We derive the Schr\"odinger coupled equations that describe hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons, and quarkonia at leading order, incorporating nonadiabatic terms, and present the predicted multiples. We define the static potentials in terms of the QCD static energies for all relevant cases. We provide the precise form of the nonperturbative low-energy gauge-invariant correlators required for the BOEFT: static energies, generalized Wilson loops, gluelumps, and adjoint mesons. These are to be calculated on the lattice and we calculate here their short-distance behavior. Furthermore, we outline how spin-dependent corrections and mixing terms can be incorporated using matching computations. Lastly, we discuss how static energies with the same BO quantum numbers mix at large distances leading to the phenomenon of avoided level crossing. This effect is crucial to understand the emergence of exotics with molecular characteristics, such as the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. With BOEFT both the tetraquark and the molecular picture appear as part of the same description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-leptonic puzzle of $B_{d(s)} \rightarrow K^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{(\ast)}$ decay in the $R$-parity violating minimal supersymmetric standard model (RPV-MSSM) extended with the inverse seesaw mechanism. In this model, the chiral flip of sneutrinos can contribute to the observables $L_{K\bar{K}}$ and $L_{K^{\ast}\bar{K}^{\ast}}$, that is benefit for explaining the relevant puzzle. We also find that this unique effect can engage in the $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ mixing. We utilize the scenario of complex $\lambda^\prime$ couplings to fulfill the recent stringent constraint of $B_s$-$\bar{B}_s$ mixing, and examine other related bounds of $B,K$-meson decays, lepton decays, neutrino data, $Z$-pole results, CP violations (CPV), etc. Besides, inspired by the new measurement of ${\cal B}(B^+ \rightarrow K^+\nu\bar{\nu})$ by Belle II, which shows about $2.7\sigma$ higher than the Standard Model (SM) prediction, we also investigate the New Physics (NP) enhancement to this observable.</description>

      <title>Predicting New Above-Threshold Molecular States Via Triangular Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering that the experimentally observed molecular states are significantly fewer than those predicted theoretically, and that these states are traditionally classified as lying below thresholds while several candidates are found above them, we propose to broaden the definition of molecular states to include those that exist just above the thresholds. Identifying resonance peaks in invariant mass distributions and scattering cross-sections is crucial for probing these states, yet the mechanisms responsible for such enhancements remain unclear, complicating our understanding of new particle production. While the peaks linked to triangular singularities do not correspond to true hadronic states, the associated production mechanisms may provide valuable insight into the search for genuine hadrons. In this work, we propose employing the triangular singularity mechanism to theoretically investigate yet-to-be-observed molecular states, particularly those that could test heavy quark symmetry. We argue that these states may have true masses surpassing the thresholds of their constituent components, rather than being predicted to be below them by theoretical models. Our findings suggest the possible existence of 18 predicted heavy quark molecular states, including $X(4014)$, $Z_{cs}(4123)$, $X_{c0}(4500)$, $X_{c1}(4685)$, $Y(4320)$, $Z(4430)$, and $\Upsilon(11020)$, which are posited to contain $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}$, $D^{*}\bar{D}^{*}_{s}$, \( D_{s1}^{+}D_{s}^{-} \),\( D_{s1}^{+}D_{s}^{*-} \), $D_1\bar{D}$, $D_1\bar{D}^{*}$, and $B_{1}(5721)\bar{B}$ constituents, respectively. The recognition of these states would substantiate heavy quark symmetry and enhance our understanding of hadronic dynamics and molecular states formation.</description>

      <title>Double Parton Scattering Effect on the Measurement of $W$-Boson Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double parton scattering (DPS) corresponds to events where two parton-parton scatterings occur in a single hadron-hadron collision. The DPS effects may arise from the spectator scatterings that are somewhat related to soft QCD activities. In this work, we investigate the DPS effects on the $W$-boson mass measurements. Especially, our analysis reveals that the DPS events contribute additional missing transverse momenta from spectator scatterings as well as relevant inclusive cross sections, potentially altering the distribution of total missing transverse momenta. Consequently, the DPS effects have the potential to cause an increase in the measured $W$-boson mass by the CDF detector, which helps to understand the deviation of the CDF-II measurements from other measurements and the predicted value in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Interpretations of the ATLAS measurements of Higgs boson production and decay rates and differential cross-sections in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements of the Higgs boson production times decay rates and differential cross-sections have recently been performed by the ATLAS experiment in several decay channels using up to 139 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded at the Large Hadron Collider. This paper presents multiple interpretations of these Higgs boson measurements. Measurements of production-mode cross-sections, simplified template cross-sections and fiducial differential cross-sections in different decay channels are reparameterised in terms of the impact of Standard Model effective field theory operators, and constraints are reported on the corresponding Wilson coefficients. Production and decay rate measurements are interpreted in UV-complete extensions of the Standard Model, namely the two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) near thealignment limit and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) for various MSSM benchmark scenarios. The constraints on the 2HDM parameters $(\cos(\beta-\alpha), \tan\beta)$ and the MSSM parameters $(m_A, \tan\beta)$ are complementary to those obtained from direct searches for additional Higgs bosons.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Observing High-redshift Radio-loud Quasars in the SKA Era: Paving the Way for 21-cm Forest Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest is a sensitive probe for the early heating process and small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization (EoR), to be realized with the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Its detection relies on the availability of radio-bright background sources, among which the radio-loud quasars are very promising, but their abundance during the EoR is still poorly constrained due to limited observations. Here, we use a physics-driven model to forecast future radio-loud quasar observations. We fit the parameters of the model using observational data of high-redshift quasars. Assuming Eddington accretion, the model yields an average lifetime of $t_{\rm q} \sim 10^{5.3}$yr for quasars at $z\sim6$, consistent with recent results obtained from quasar proximity zone pre-study. We show that if the radio-loud fraction of quasars evolves with redshift, it will significantly reduce the abundance of observable radio-loud quasars in the SKA era, making 21-cm forest studies challenging. With a constant radio-loud fraction, our model suggests that a one-year sky survey conducted with SKA-LOW has the capability to detect approximately 20 radio-loud quasars at $z\sim 9$, with sufficient sensitivity to resolve individual 21-cm forest lines.</description>

      <title>Weak rates in strongly coupled cold quark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rates of flavor-changing weak processes are crucial in determining the conditions of beta equilibrium in neutron stars and mergers, influencing the damping of oscillations, the stability of rotating pulsars, and the emission of gravitational waves. We derive a formula for these rates at nonzero temperature, to leading order in the Fermi coupling and exact in the QCD coupling. Utilizing a simple phenomenological holographic model dual to QCD, we study massless unpaired quark matter at high densities. We numerically compute the rate for small deviations from beta equilibrium and derive an analytic approximation for small temperatures. Our findings reveal that, compared to the perturbative result, the rate is suppressed by logarithmic factors of the temperature.</description>

      <title>Investigation of pion-nucleon contributions to nucleon matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate contributions of excited states to nucleon matrix elements computed in lattice QCD by employing, in addition to the standard nucleon interpolating operator, pion-nucleon ($\pi$-$N$) operators. We solve a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) to obtain an optimal interpolating operator that minimizes overlap with the $\pi$-$N$ states. We derive a variant of the standard application of the GEVP method, which allows for constructing 3-point correlation functions using the optimized interpolating operator without requiring the computationally demanding combination that includes $\pi$-$N$ operators in both sink and source. We extract nucleon matrix elements using two twisted mass fermion ensembles, one ensemble generated using pion mass of 346 MeV and one ensemble tuned to reproduce the physical value of the pion mass. Especially, we determine the isoscalar and isovector scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial, and tensor matrix elements. We include results obtained using a range of kinematic setups, including momentum in the sink. Our results using this variational approach are compared with previous results obtained using the same ensembles and multi-state fits without GEVP improvement. We find that for the physical mass point ensemble, the improvement, in terms of suppression of excited states using this method, is most significant for the case of the matrix elements of the isovector axial and pseudoscalar currents.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Time Variation of the Fine-structure Constant with Quasars Detected by LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The [O III] $\lambda\lambda\ 4960,5008$ emission lines in the optical spectra of galaxies and quasars have been widely used to investigate the possible variation of the fine-structure constant $\alpha$ over cosmic time. In this work, we utilize the Large Sky Area Multi-object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) quasar survey, for the first time, to measure the relative $\alpha$ variation $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ in time through the [O III] doublet method. From the LAMOST Data Release 9 quasar catalog, we refine a sample of 209 quasar spectra with strong and narrow [O III] emission lines over a redshift range of $0&lt;z&lt;0.8$. Analysis on all of the 209 spectra obtains $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = (0.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-4}$, which suggests that there is no evidence of varying $\alpha$ on the explored cosmological timescales. Assuming a linear variation, the mean rate of change in $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is limited to be $(-3.4 \pm 2.4)\times 10^{-13}$ $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ in the last 7.0 Gyr. While our LAMOST-based constraint on $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$ is not competitive with those of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasar observations, our analysis serves to corroborate the results of SDSS with another independent survey.</description>

      <title>From data to the analytic S-matrix: A Bootstrap fit of the pion scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to fit experimental data using a UV complete amplitude ansatz satisfying the constraints of Analyticity, Crossing, and Unitarity. We focus on $\pi\pi$ scattering combining both experimental and lattice data. The fit strategy requires using S-matrix Bootstrap methods and non-convex Particle Swarm Optimization techniques. Using this procedure, we numerically construct a full-fledged scattering amplitude that fits the data and contains the known QCD spectrum that couples to $\pi \pi$ states below $1.4$ GeV. The amplitude constructed agrees below the two-particle threshold with the two-loop $\chi$PT prediction. Moreover, we correctly predict the $D_2$ phase shift, the appearance of a spin three state, and the behavior of the high-energy total cross-section. Finally, we find a genuine tetraquark resonance around 2 GeV, which we argue might be detected by looking into the decays of B mesons.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative. The calculated time scales naturally lie in the attosecond range for relevant parameters, thereby linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>
