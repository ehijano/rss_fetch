      <title>Not-quite-primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism for the formation of seeds of supermassive black holes at early cosmic epochs. Enhanced density fluctuations with amplitudes that are not large enough to form primordial black holes post-inflation can still lead to collapsed dark matter halos at very early times. For halos forming prior to $1+z \approx 200$, the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is energetic enough to suppress the formation of molecular hydrogen, hence preventing cooling and fragmentation, as a consequence of which baryons falling into the potential well of the halo may undergo "direct collapse" into a black hole. We show using a few illustrative models how this mechanism may account for the abundance of high-redshift black holes inferred from observations by the James Webb Space Telescope while remaining consistent with current limits from CMB spectral distortions. Limits on the primordial power spectrum are also derived by requiring that the universe not reionize too early.</description>

      <title>Feature Intensity Mapping: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emission from All Galaxies Across Cosmic Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line intensity mapping (LIM) is an emerging technique for probing the aggregate emission of a spectral line from all sources, without requiring individual detections. Through the wavelength-redshift relation, one can map the line-of-sight evolution of the line emission that traces the underlying large-scale structure in a spectral-imaging survey. In this work, we present a new technique -- feature intensity mapping -- as an extension of the LIM formalism to map broad spectral features in 3D, rather than the narrow emission lines typically targeted by LIM. By accounting for the convolution of spectral features with the instrument's spectral response across redshift, our technique enables simultaneous constraints on the redshift-dependent emission from multiple features. This approach enables 3D intensity mapping with some of the brightest features in galaxies' infrared spectra: the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands. We forecast the detectability of PAH signals using feature intensity mapping with the ongoing SPHEREx mission in the near-infrared and the proposed PRIMA mission in the far-infrared. We find that $S/N$ of $\gtrsim 10$ per redshift bin of widths $\Delta z = 0.1$ and $0.5$ can be achieved at $z &lt; 0.5$ and $1 &lt; z &lt; 5$ with SPHEREx and PRIMA, respectively, for multiple PAH features, suggesting a promising prospect for mapping the aggregate PAH emission at cosmological distances with upcoming datasets.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT HI observations of Low Surface Brightness/Ultradiffuse Galaxy Candidates Projected around Two Southern Loose Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large catalogue of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) from the Dark Energy Survey showed significant clustering around nearby galaxy groups and clusters. Using the HIPASS survey, we tried to determine the redshift of a sub-sample of these LSBGs and determine whether they were members of the groups they were projected near, but this was hampered by HIPASS's high spectral rms. This letter reports on MeerKAT H I observations to determine the redshifts of 52 LSBG candidates projected in the vicinity of two groups from our previous HIPASS study. The main goal is to investigate and ascertain whether these LSBGs are genuine group members. H I was detected with MeerKAT and redshifts were determined for only five of the 52 candidates within a velocity range of $\pm$ 2500 km/s of their respective group velocities. All five H I detections were blue LSBGs and two of them were confirmed to be ultradiffuse galaxies (UDGs). Both these UDGs were group members, while the other three detections were either foreground or background galaxies. In this letter we explore scenarios that can explain the 90% non-detection. MeerKAT's excellent sensitivity allows us to conclude that the majority of the non-detected candidates, particularly the blue galaxies, are not group members but lie at higher redshifts. However, this still leaves the open question as why Tanoglidis LSBG candidates, in particular the red ones, appear to be clustered in projection around nearby groups.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.</description>

      <title>DESI results and Dark Energy from QCD topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physically motivated model of dark energy (DE) rooted in the topological structure of the Quantum ChromoDynamic (QCD) vacuum. In this framework, DE emerges as the Universe expands, from the difference in vacuum energy between the expanding Universe and Minkowski spacetime, driven by QCD vacuum topological sectors. This leads to a modification of the dark energy term in the Friedmann equation, which then scales with the Hubble parameter as $\rho_{\rm DE}(t) \propto H(t)$ when dark energy dominates the expansion of the Universe. The QCD scale, $\Lambda_{\rm QCD} \sim 100~{\rm MeV}$, naturally sets the energy density of DE and provides a compelling explanation for why its impact on cosmic expansion becomes significant only in the recent cosmological epoch. Importantly, the entire framework is grounded in Standard Model (SM) physics, involving no new fields or coupling constants. Key predictions of the model include: (a) A present-day DE equation of state $w_{\rm DE} &gt; -1$, asymptotically approaching the de Sitter limit $w_{\rm DE} = -1$ in the future, with the corresponding asymptotic Hubble constant $\overline{H}$ set by $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$. (b) At redshifts $z \ge 0$, $w_{\rm DE}$ can lie above or below $-1$ and may cross this boundary multiple times, behavior qualitatively consistent with recent DESI observations. (c) The solution to the Friedmann equation in this framework can deviate from the canonical $\Lambda$CDM form at $z \ge 0$. (d) If such deviation occurs, it can be tested using cosmological observations, CMB anisotropies, BAO, SNIa, and large-scale structure, which we propose to explore in future work. (e) Finally, we point out a potential connection between our framework and the observed $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Reverberation responses in light curves of the SBS1520+530 quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: We aim to investigate an accretion disk (AD) temperature profile of a doubly lensed quasar SBS 1520+530. Temperature profiles of accretion disks are known to be diagnostic of many of the physical properties of AGNs and quasars. Methods: Our approach involves application of the photometric reverberation mapping to the light curves of SBS 1520+530 obtained in the Johnson-Cousins V and R filters. The RM method implies that the time shift between the light curves taken in different spectral ranges determines the light travel time between the AD zones with different physical conditions. In determining the time shifts, we applied a method based on some useful properties of the orthogonal polynomials. Results: The variations in filter R lag those in filter V , with 1.25$\pm$ 0.63 days for the inter-band time shift averaged between the two image components and over the three seasons. The obtained time lag noticeably exceeds the value following for SBS 1520+530 from the classical model of optically thick geometrically thin AD. We considered two possible ways to resolve the discrepancy between the theory and observations. The first assumes an AD temperature profile flatter than the classical one. The second way is to consider an extended optically thick scattering envelope originated due to matter outflow from an AD interior. Conclusion: Both explanations may be consequences of the super-Eddington accretion in SBS 1520+530. Using bolometric luminosity estimates available for SBS 1520+530 from the literature, we obtained a value of $\approx$ 3.4 for the Eddington ratio, which indeed indicates a moderately super-Eddington accretion regime.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of background evolution and structure formation in phase space: a semi-cosmographic reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature, imprinted in the transverse and radial clustering of dark matter tracers, enables the simultaneous measurement of the angular diameter distance $D_A(z)$ and the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ at a given redshift. Further, measuring the redshift space anisotropy (RSD) allows us to measure the combination $f_8\equiv f\sigma_8(z)$. Motivated by this, we simultaneously study the dynamics of background evolution and structure formation in an abstract phase space of dynamical quantities $x=H_0 D_A/c$, $p = dx/dz$, and $f_8$. We adopt a semi-cosmographic approach, whereby we do not pre-assume any specific dark energy model to integrate the dynamical system. The Luminosity distance is expanded as a Pad\'e rational approximation in the variable $(1+z)^{1/2}$. The dynamical system is solved by using a semi-cosmographic equation of state, which incorporates the dark matter parameters along with the parameters of the Pad\'e expansion. The semi-cosmographic $D_A(z), H(z)$ and $f\sigma_8(z)$, thus obtained, are fitted with BAO and RSD data from the SDSS IV. The reconstructed phase trajectories in the $3D$ $(x,p,f_8)$ space are used to reconstruct some diagnostics of background cosmology and structure formation. At low redshifts, a discernible departure from the $\Lambda$CDM model is observed. The geometry of the phase trajectories in the projected spaces allows us to identify three key redshifts where future observations may be directed for a better understanding of cosmic tensions and anomalies.</description>

      <title>The power of SKA to Constrain cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds below the astrophysical foreground noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inspirals of supermaissive black hole binaries provide a convinced gravitational wave background in the nHz band, serving as the fiducial model of the recent gravitational wave signal reported by the PTA experiments. The uncertainties of the number of binaries contributing to each frequency bin introduce a foreground noise in the nHz and $\mu$Hz bands against the observation of the underlying gravitational wave backgrounds of the cosmological origin. In this work, we investigate a new method to constrain the cosmological gravitational wave strength under the astrophysical foreground. The energy density fluctuations from cosmological gravitational-wave sources can generally trigger the formation of compact subhalos of dark matter, and the upcoming Square Kilometer Array has the ability to constrain the abundance of the subhalos at the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ level. The cosmological gravitational wave energy spectra from various sources are expected to be constrained several orders of magnitude below the astrophysical foreground, providing more strict constraints on the parameter spaces of corresponding new physics models.</description>

      <title>Gas motion in the ICM of the Virgo cluster replica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the deep gravitational potential of galaxy clusters lies the intracluster medium (ICM). At the first order, it is considered to be at hydrostatic equilibrium within the potential well. However, evidence is growing that the ICM dynamics is non-negligible, is mostly turbulent in origin, and provides a non-thermal pressure support to the equilibrium. In this work, we intend to characterise the properties of the velocity field in the ICM of a simulated replica of the Virgo cluster. We first study the 3D and projected properties of the ICM velocity field by computing its probability density functions (PDFs) and its statistical moments. We then estimate the non-thermal pressure fraction from an effective turbulent Mach number, including the velocity dispersion. We finally compute the velocity structure function (VSF) from projected maps of the sightline velocity. We first show that the components of the 3D velocity field and the projected quantities along equivalent sightlines are anisotropic and affected by the accretion of gas from filaments. Then, we compare the mean statistical moments of the 3D velocity field to the mean properties of a hundred random projections. We show, in particular, an almost linear relation between the standard deviation estimated from direct simulation outputs and sightline velocity dispersion projections, comparable to the line broadening of X-ray atomic lines. However, this linear relation does not hold between the direct simulation outputs and the standard deviation of the sightline velocity projections, comparable to the line shift of X-ray atomic lines. We find a non-thermal pressure fraction around $6\%$ within $R_{500}$ and $9\%$ within $R_{vir}$ from sightline velocity dispersion, which is in good agreement with direct simulation outputs. Finally, we show that the VSF might probe the Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback turbulent injection scale.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Remapping for Efficient Generation of 21 cm Intensity Mapping Mocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel application of cosmological rescaling, or "remapping," to generate 21 cm intensity mapping mocks for different cosmologies. The remapping method allows for computationally efficient generation of N-body catalogs by rescaling existing simulations. In this work, we employ the remapping method to construct dark matter halo catalogs, starting from the Horizon Run 4 simulation with WMAP5 cosmology, and apply it to different target cosmologies, including WMAP7, Planck18 and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. These catalogs are then used to simulate 21 cm intensity maps. We use the halo occupation distribution (HOD) method to populate halos with neutral hydrogen (HI) and derive 21 cm brightness temperature maps. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the remapping approach in generating cosmological simulations for large-scale structure studies, offering an alternative for testing observational data pipelines and performing cosmological parameter forecasts without the need for computationally expensive full N-body simulations. We also analyze the precision and limitations of the remapping, in light of the rescaling parameters $s$ and $s_m$, as well as the effects of the halo mass and box size thresholds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many fundamental physics applications, transformers, as the state of the art in learning complex correlations, benefit from pretraining on quasi-out-of-domain data. The obvious question is whether we can exploit Large Language Models, requiring proper out-of-domain transfer learning. We show how the Qwen2.5 LLM can be used to analyze and generate SKA data, specifically 3D maps of the cosmological large-scale structure for a large part of the observable Universe. We combine the LLM with connector networks and show, for cosmological parameter regression and lightcone generation, that this Lightcone LLM (L3M) with Qwen2.5 weights outperforms standard initialization and compares favorably with dedicated networks of matching size.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the well-studied $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, we propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models that evolve from a negative cosmological constant, transitioning to a positive value at low redshifts. Specifically, we introduce a dark energy framework based on a generalised ladder-step function for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we present two additional models in which the cosmological constant undergoes a smooth sign change at a specified redshift. We provide a detailed discussion of the construction and theoretical properties of these models, analysing their background cosmological evolution using a cosmographic approach and the statefinder hierarchy parameters. Our results are compared with those obtained for the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM models. We also perform a careful analysis of the types of singularities that may arise in these models due to a sign change in the cosmological constant. Notably, we show that a continuous sign change removes the sudden singularity present in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, replacing it with a milder $w$-singularity.</description>

      <title>Cosmological effect of coherent oscillation of ultralight scalar fields in a multicomponent universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea that coherent oscillations of a scalar field, oscillating over a time period that is much shorter than the cosmological timescale, can exhibit cold dark matter (CDM) like behavior was previously established. In our work we first show that this equivalence between the oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector is exact only in a flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime in the absence of cosmological constant and any other possible matter components in the universe when the mass of the scalar field is very large compared to the Hubble parameter. Then we show how to generalize the equivalence between the coherently oscillating scalar field model and the CDM sector in a spatially curved universe with multiple matter components. Using our general method, we will show how a coherently oscillating scalar field model can represent the CDM sector in the presence of non-minimal coupling of the CDM sector with radiation. Our method is powerful enough to work out the dynamics of gravitational collapse in a closed FLRW spacetime where the coherently oscillating scalar field model represents the CDM sector. We have, for the first time, presented a consistent method which specifies how a coherently oscillating scalar field model, where the scalar field is ultralight, acts like the CDM sector in a multicomponent universe.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger FIMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-messenger frontier probe of non-thermal or freeze-in massive particle (FIMP) dark matter (DM) by considering an effective field theory (EFT) setup. Assuming leptophilic operators connecting DM with the standard model (SM) bath, we consider DM mass $m_{\rm DM}$ and the reheat temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ in a regime which prevents DM-SM thermalisation. Low $T_{\rm rh}$ allows sizeable DM-SM interactions even for non-thermal DM allowing the latter to be probed at direct, indirect detection frontiers as well as future electron-positron and muon colliders. An extended reheating period governed by monomial inflaton potential after its slow-roll phase not only generates the required abundance of non-thermal DM via ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in but also brings the scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments across a wide range of frequencies. While particle physics experiments can probe sub-GeV scale $T_{\rm rh}$ and FIMP with mass $m_{\rm DM} \lesssim O(10)$ GeV, future GW detectors are sensitive to a much wider parameter space.</description>

      <title>The fast, the slow and the merging: probes of evaporating memory burdened PBHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called memory-burden effect implies that evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) inevitably stabilize before complete decay. This stabilization opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter below $10^{15}\,$g. The transition to the memory-burdened phase is not instantaneous but unfolds over cosmological timescales, with some PBHs entering this phase in the present epoch. Additionally, a fraction of PBHs undergo mergers today, forming ''young'' semiclassical black holes that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. Both processes generate fluxes of stable astrophysical particles, which are constrained by current measurements of high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. Moreover, the steep increase in energy injection at higher redshifts perturbs the ionization history of the Universe, leading to complementary bounds from observations of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. We find that the reopened window enabled by the memory-burden effect is largely within reach of detection, both locally and across cosmological distances. We further describe how our findings restrict the values of the critical exponent characterizing the memory burden phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Freeze-In and Small-Scale Observables: Novel Mass Bounds and Viable Particle Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.</description>

      <title>Beyond diagonal approximations: improved covariance modeling for pulsar timing array data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) searches for nHz gravitational-wave backgrounds (GWBs) typically model time-correlated noise by assuming a diagonal covariance in Fourier space, neglecting inter-frequency correlations introduced by the finite observation window. We show that this diagonal approximation can lead to biased estimates of spectral parameters, especially for the common red process that represents the GWB. To address these limitations, we present a method that (i) computes the time-domain autocorrelation on a coarse grid using a fast Fourier transform (FFT), (ii) interpolates it accurately to the unevenly sampled observation times, and (iii) incorporates it into a low-rank likelihood via the Sherman--Morrison--Woodbury identity. Using both analytic covariance comparisons and end-to-end simulations inspired by the NANOGrav 15-year dataset, we demonstrate that our method captures frequency correlations faithfully, avoids Gibbs ringing, and recovers unbiased spectral parameters with modest computational cost. As PTA datasets increase in sensitivity and complexity, our approach offers a practical and scalable path to fully accurate covariance modeling for current and future analyses.</description>

      <title>Extreme AGN feedback in the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole feedback is the currently favoured mechanism to regulate the star formation rate of galaxies and prevent the formation of ultra-massive galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{12}M_\odot$). However, the mechanism through which the outflowing energy is transferred to the surrounding medium strongly varies from one galaxy evolution model to another, such that a unified model for AGN feedback does not currently exist. The hot atmospheres of galaxy groups are highly sensitive laboratories of the feedback process, as the injected black hole energy is comparable to the binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we report multi-wavelength observations of the fossil galaxy group SDSSTG 4436. The hot atmosphere of this system exhibits a highly relaxed morphology centred on the giant elliptical galaxy NGC~3298. The X-ray emission from the system features a compact core ($&lt;$10 kpc) and a steep increase in the entropy and cooling time of the gas, with the cooling time reaching the age of the Universe $\sim15$ kpc from the centre of the galaxy. The observed entropy profile implies a total injected energy of $\sim1.5\times10^{61}$ ergs, which given the high level of relaxation could not have been injected by a recent merging event. Star formation in the central galaxy NGC~3298 is strongly quenched and its stellar population is very old ($\sim$10.6 Gyr). The currently detected radio jets have low power and are confined within the central compact core. All the available evidence implies that this system was affected by giant AGN outbursts which excessively heated the neighbouring gas and prevented the formation of a self-regulated feedback cycle. Our findings imply that AGN outbursts can be energetic enough to unbind gas particles and lead to the disruption of cool cores.</description>

      <title>The DORCHA suite: nature, nurture, and the phase space distribution of the Milky Way's high redshift progenitors today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Where in the present-day Milky Way should we search for the remnants of its earliest stars? We address this question using the DORCHA (Gaelic for Dark; DUR-uh-khuh) suite: a set of 25 high-resolution, dark-matter-only cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way analogue (MWA) haloes evolved to $z=0$. Of these, 15 are isolated and the rest are in pairs, similar to the MW and M31. By identifying and tagging the most bound material in high-redshift ($z\geq5$) progenitor haloes -- those likely to host early star formation -- we track the present-day phase-space distribution of this ancient component. We find that this material is highly centrally concentrated at $z=0$, with 90 - 100 per cent residing within $r \lesssim 15\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}$. It exhibits steep density profiles ($\rho\propto\,r^{-4}$), low velocity dispersions ($\sigma_r / \sigma_{\rm max} \lesssim 0.6$), and radially biased orbits ($\beta \gtrsim 0.5$ for $r \gtrsim 0.1\,R_{200}$), consistent with a relaxed, centrally embedded population. These results hold across haloes with diverse formation histories and environments, suggesting that the dynamical signature of early progenitors is robust to later mergers and interactions. Our findings imply that the fossil record of the first generations of stars -- including Population III and extremely metal-poor stars -- should be sought in the innermost regions of the Milky Way, where they retain distinctive kinematic imprints. While these stellar populations may overlap, we caution that low metallicity does not uniquely identify ancient stars, nor vice versa. The DORCHA suite thus provides a physically motivated baseline for interpreting observations from Galactic Archaeology surveys targeting the bulge and inner halo.</description>

      <title>Precise Hubble constant measurement from quasi-periodic eruptions as electromagnetic counterparts to extreme mass ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) accompanied by electromagnetic (EM) counterparts provide a novel methodology to measure the Hubble constant ($H_0$), known as bright sirens. However, the rarity of such multi-messenger events limits the precision of the $H_0$ constraint. Recently, the newly-discovered quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) show intriguing evidence of a stellar-mass companion captured by a supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI), which is the most promising sources of the space-based GW detectors, such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Here we study the secular orbital evolution of QPE systems under different theoretical frameworks, and assess their GWs detectability by LISA. We find that LISA can detect the EMRI signals of two or three known QPE systems with a four-year observation. One EMRI event can measure the $H_0$ with an uncertainty of $3\%-8\%$ at a 68.3 percent confidence level, while a few events will reduce it below $2\%$. The EMRI events surpass current bright siren limitations and offer an independent pathway to resolve the Hubble constant tension.</description>

      <title>A measurement of Galactic synchrotron emission using MWA drift scan observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (hereafter, DGSE) at arc-minute angular scale is important to remove the foregrounds for the cosmological 21-cm observations. Statistical measurements of the large-scale DGSE can also be used to constrain the magnetic field and the cosmic ray electron density of our Galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM). Here, we have used the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) drift scan observations at $154.2 \, {\rm MHz}$ to measure the angular power spectrum $({\cal C}_{\ell})$ of the DGSE of a region of the sky from right ascension (RA) $349^{\circ}$ to $70.3^{\circ}$ at the fixed declination $-26.7^{\circ}$. In this RA range, we have chosen 24 pointing centers (PCs), for which we have removed all the bright point sources above $\sim430 \, {\rm mJy}\,(3\sigma)$, and applied the Tapered Gridded Estimator (TGE) on residual data to estimate the ${\cal C}_{\ell}$. We use the angular multipole range $65 \le \ell \le 650$ to fit the data with a model, ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}=A\times \left(\frac{1000}{\ell}\right)^{\beta}+C$, where we interpret the model as the combination of a power law $(\propto \ell^{-\beta})$ nature of the DGSE and a constant part due to the Poisson fluctuations of the residual point sources. We are able to fit the model ${\cal C}^M_{\ell}$ for six PCs centered at $\alpha=352.5^{\circ}, 353^{\circ}, 357^{\circ}, 4.5^{\circ}, 4^{\circ}$ and $1^{\circ}$. We run the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) ensemble sampler to get the best-fit values of the parameters $A, \beta$ and $C$ for these PCs. We see that the values of $A$ vary in the range $155$ to $400$ mK$^{2}$, whereas the $\beta$ varies in the range $0.9$ to $1.7$. We find that the value of $\beta$ is consistent at $2-\sigma$ level with the earlier measurement of the DGSE at similar frequency and angular scales.</description>

Abstract: Black holes gradually settle into their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, whose amplitude diminish over time according to a power-law decay at fixed spatial locations. We show that the nonlinear tails in the presence of a quadratic source, which have been recently found to potentially dominate over the linear ones, can be simply derived from the AdS$_2$$\times$S$^2$ spacetime perspective with their amplitudes being related to the Aretakis constants.</description>

      <title>Chemical Signatures of Population III Stars in Damped Lyman-$\alpha$ Absorption Systems at $z \approx 6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Sodini et al. (2024) presented a sample of OI damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorption system (DLA) analogs at $z\sim6$ that contain possible chemical signatures of Population III (Pop III) stars. In this paper, we use an N-body simulation-based semi-analytic model of the first stars and galaxies to predict the impact of Pop III stars on high-redshift DLAs. These Pop III DLA predictions are the first to include a number of important physical effects such as Lyman-Werner (LW) feedback, reionization, and external metal enrichment (all of which account for three-dimensional spatial fluctuations caused by halo clustering). We predict the abundance of DLAs as a function of their carbon-to-oxygen ratios ([C/O]). We find that our fiducial model is strongly ruled out by the data as it contains too few high-[C/O] DLAs, which have metals primarily from Pop III stars. However, increasing the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation due to supernovae feedback leads to better agreement with the data. Our results suggest that DLA analogs at $z\sim6$ are a promising probe of Pop III star formation for two key reasons. First, for reasonable parameter choices there are significant numbers of DLAs with metals primarily originating from Pop III stars. Second, we find that the number of DLAs with substantial Pop III contributions depends strongly on the Pop III star formation efficiency and the delay time between Pop III and metal-enriched star formation.</description>

Abstract: The heating of a molecular cloud by photons emitted by a primary black hole (PBH) located inside the cloud is considered. For graphite and silicate dust particles, the dependence of dust temperature on the distance from PBH is derived, along with the emission spectrum of dust particles. The obtained spectrum is compared with the sensitivity of the Millimetron Space Observatory for various values of concentration and size of dust particles and different PBH masses.</description>

Abstract: In preparation for cosmological analyses of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC) has created a 300 deg$^2$ simulated survey as part of an effort called Data Challenge 2 (DC2). The DC2 simulated sky survey, in six optical bands with observations following a reference LSST observing cadence, was processed with the LSST Science Pipelines (19.0.0). In this Note, we describe the public data release of the resulting object catalogs for the coadded images of five years of simulated observations along with associated truth catalogs. We include a brief description of the major features of the available data sets. To enable convenient access to the data products, we have developed a web portal connected to Globus data services. We describe how to access the data and provide example Jupyter Notebooks in Python to aid first interactions with the data. We welcome feedback and questions about the data release via a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Model-independent measurement of the Hubble Constant and the absolute magnitude of Type Ia Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.05897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a cosmological model-independent and non-local method to constrain the Hubble Constant $H_0$. Inspired by the quasi cosmological model-independent and $H_0$-free properties of the `shifted' Hubble diagram of HII galaxies (HIIGx) defined by Wei et al. (2016), we joint analyze it with the parametric type Ia supernova (SN Ia) Hubble diagram (e.g. the joint-lightcurves-analysis sample, JLA) and get a Bayesian Inference of Hubble constant, $H_0 = 71 \pm 20\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$. Although with large uncertainty, we find that $H_0$ is only strongly degenerate with the B-band absolute magnitude ($M_B$) of SN Ia but almost independent on other nuisance parameters. Therefore the accuracy can be simultaneously improved by a tight constraint of $M_B$ through a cosmological and $H_0$ independent way. This method can be extended further to get more-literally non-local results of $H_0$ by using other Hubble diagrams at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Beyond Planck? Constraints from multiple CMB probes, DESI BAO and Type-Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, when combined with Planck satellite Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and Type Ia Supernovae, suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) at a significance level ranging from $2.8\sigma$ to $4.2\sigma$. In this work, I test whether, and to what extent, this preference is supported by CMB experiments other than Planck. I analyze the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) temperature, polarization, and lensing spectra at small scales, eventually combining them with Planck or WMAP 9-year observations at large angular scales. My analysis shows that ACT and WMAP data, when combined with DESI BAO and Pantheon-plus Supernovae, yield independent constraints with a precision comparable to Planck. Notably, in this case, the cosmological constant value is recovered within two standard deviations. A preference for DDE reappears when Pantheon-plus is replaced with distance moduli measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DESy5). However, it remains less pronounced compared to the Planck-based results. When considering SPT data, no clear preference for DDE is found in combinations involving Pantheon-plus Supernovae, and the preference is significantly weaker in combinations involving DESy5. Overall, CMB experiments other than Planck generally weaken the evidence for DDE. I argue that the subsets of Planck data that strengthen the shift toward DDE are the temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropy measurements at large angular scales $\ell \lesssim 30$.</description>

      <title>Selection of high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies from broadband and wide photometric surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the possibility of selecting high-redshift Lyman-Break Galaxies (LBG) using current and future broadband wide photometric surveys, such as UNIONS or the Vera C. Rubin LSST. This work is conducted in the context of DESI-II, the next phase of DESI, which will start around 2029. We use deep imaging data from HSC and CLAUDS on the COSMOS and XMM-LSS fields. To predict the selection performance of LBGs with image quality similar to UNIONS, we degrade the $u, g, r, i$ and $z$ bands to UNIONS depth. The Random Forest algorithm is trained with the $u,g,r,i$ and $z$ bands to classify LBGs in the $2.5 &lt; z &lt; 3.5$ range. We find that fixing a target density budget of $1,100$ deg$^{-2}$, the Random Forest approach gives a density of $z&gt;2$ targets of $873$ deg$^{-2}$, and a density of $493$ deg$^{-2}$ of confirmed LBGs after spectroscopic confirmation with DESI. This UNIONS-like selection was tested in a dedicated spectroscopic observation campaign of 1,000 targets with DESI on the COSMOS field, providing a safe spectroscopic sample with a mean redshift of 3. This sample is used to derive forecasts for DESI-II, assuming a sky coverage of 5,000 deg$^2$. We predict uncertainties on Alcock-Paczynski parameters $\alpha_\perp$ and $\alpha_{\parallel}$ to be 0.7$\%$ and 1$\%$ for $2.6&lt;z&lt;3.2$, resulting in a potential 2$\%$ measurement of the dark energy fraction at high redshift. Additionally, we estimate the uncertainty in local non-Gaussianity and predict $\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}}\approx 7$, which would be comparable to the current best precision achieved by \textit{Planck}. The latter forecast suggests that achieving the precision required to place stringent constraints on inflationary models ($\sigma_{f_{\rm NL}} \approx 1$) using spectroscopic galaxy surveys necessitates the development of a next-generation (Stage V) spectroscopic survey.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Disruption of Axion Minihalos by Multiple Stellar Encounters in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If QCD axion dark matter formed post-inflation, axion miniclusters emerged from isocurvature fluctuations and later merged hierarchically into minihalos. These minihalos, potentially disrupted by stellar encounters in the Milky Way, affect axion detectability. We extend prior analyses by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential.
  Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30\%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60\%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for.
  The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This work highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear reconstruction of 21cm global signal from 21cm power spectrum with artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel method to recover the 21cm global signal from the 21cm power spectrum using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The 21cm global signal is crucial for understanding cosmic evolution from the Dark Ages through the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). While interferometers like LOFAR, MWA, HERA, and SKA focus on detecting the 21cm power spectrum, single-dish experiments such as EDGES target the global signal. Our method utilizes ANNs to establish a connection between these two observables, providing a means to cross-validate independent 21cm line observations. This capability is significant as it allows different observational approaches to verify each other's results, ensuring greater reliability in 21cm cosmology. We demonstrate that our ANN-based approach can accurately recover the 21cm global signal across a wide redshift range (z=7.5-35) from simulated data, even when realistic thermal noise levels, such as those expected from SKA-1, are considered. This cross-validation process strengthens the robustness of 21cm signal analysis, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Illustrating the consequences of a misuse of $\sigma_8$ in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The parameter $\sigma_8$ is the rms mass fluctuations on a scale of $R_8=8h^{-1}$ Mpc and is used to quantify the amplitude of matter fluctuations at linear scales. However, the dependence of $R_8$ on $h$ complicates direct comparisons of $\sigma_8$ values obtained under different assumptions about $H_0$, since $\sigma_8$ in such cases characterizes the amount of structure at different physical scales. This issue arises both when comparing $\sigma_8$ values from fitting analyses of cosmological models with differing $H_0$ posteriors, and when contrasting constraints from galaxy clustering experiments with different priors on $H_0$. As first noted by Ariel G. S\'anchez in PRD 102, 123511 (2020), quantifying the growth tension using $\sigma_8$ can introduce substantial biases and couple the growth and Hubble tensions in an intricate way. To address these challenges, S\'anchez proposed an alternative parameter, $\sigma_{12}$, defined as the rms mass fluctuations at $12$ Mpc, which is independent of $h$. Although S\'anchez's work was published five years ago and other authors have since highlighted the limitations of $\sigma_8$, much of the cosmological community -- including large collaborations -- continues to rely on this parameter rather than adopting $\sigma_{12}$, seemingly due only to historical considerations. In this work, we illustrate the biases introduced by $\sigma_8$ through some clear examples, aiming to motivate the community to transition from $\sigma_8$ to $\sigma_{12}$. We show that the bias found in models with large values of $H_0$ is more prominent, artificially complicating the search for a model that can efficiently resolve the Hubble tension without exacerbating the growth tension inferred from galaxy clustering measurements. We argue that the worsening of the growth tension in these models is much less pronounced than previously thought or may even be nonexistent.</description>

      <title>Impact of Galactic non-Gaussian foregrounds on CMB lensing measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB has been established as a robust and powerful observable for precision cosmology. However, the impact of Galactic foregrounds, which has been studied less extensively than many other potential systematics, could in principle pose a problem for CMB lensing measurements. These foregrounds are inherently non-Gaussian and hence might mimic the characteristic signal that lensing estimators are designed to measure. We present an analysis that quantifies the level of contamination from Galactic dust in lensing measurements, focusing particularly on measurements with the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the Simons Observatory. We employ a whole suite of foreground models and study the contamination of lensing measurements with both individual frequency channels and multifrequency combinations. We test the sensitivity of different estimators to the level of foreground non-Gaussianity, and the dependence on sky fraction and multipole range used. We find that Galactic foregrounds do not present a problem for the Atacama Cosmology Telescope experiment (the bias in the inferred CMB lensing power spectrum amplitude remains below $0.3\sigma$). For Simons Observatory, not all foreground models remain below this threshold. Although our results are conservative upper limits, they suggest that further work on characterizing dust biases and determining the impact of mitigation methods is well motivated, especially for the largest sky fractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of primordial black holes or other dark matter relics from amplified density fluctuations in the early universe may also generate scalar-induced gravitational waves (GW), carrying vital information about the primordial power spectrum and the early expansion history of our universe. We present a Bayesian approach aimed at reconstructing both the shape of the scalar power spectrum and the universe's equation of state from GW observations, using interpolating splines to flexibly capture features in the GW data. The optimal number of spline nodes is chosen via Bayesian evidence, aiming at balancing complexity of the model and the fidelity of the reconstruction. We test our method using both representative mock data and recent Pulsar Timing Array measurements, demonstrating that it can accurately reconstruct the curvature power spectrum as well as the underlying equation of state, if different from radiation.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Dark Energy Prior to its Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a review and statistical analysis of the evidence supporting the existence of a cosmological constant in the early 1990s, before its discovery made with distant supernovae in 1998. The earlier evidence was derived from newly precise measurements of the Universe, including its mass density, the Hubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, the filamentary large-scale structure, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. These measurements created tension for models assuming the cosmological constant was zero. This tension was alleviated by several insightful papers published before 1996, which proposed a cosmological constant that increased the expansion rate. Statistical analysis here shows that the probability of the cosmological constant being zero was demonstrably less than a few percent. Some models identified a best-fit value close to the modern estimate of Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that it is possible to simulate realistic inhomogeneities during cosmological inflation with high precision using numerical relativity. Stochastic initial conditions are set in line with the Bunch-Davies vaccuum and satisfy the Hamiltonian and Momentum constraints of General Relativity to leading order in perturbation theory. The subsequent fully non-linear dynamical evolution is formulated within a family of geodesic gauges but can in principle be adapted to any choice of coordinates. We present 3 examples of inflationary dynamics: a simple quadratic potential, a potential with an inflection point and a strong resonance model. When perturbations are small, we recover standard predictions of cosmological perturbation theory, and we quantify strongly non-linear inhomogeneities when non-perturbative configurations emerge, such as in the strong resonance model. Our results pave the way towards the first realistic non-perturbative, and fully non-linear Numerical Relativity simulations of the early inflationary universe.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$~eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>

      <title>Determination of Hubble constant from Megamaser Cosmology Project using Profile Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Megamaser Cosmology Project inferred a value for the Hubble constant given by $H_0=73.9 \pm 3.0 $ km/sec/Mpc. This value was obtained using Bayesian inference by marginalizing over six nuisance parameters, corresponding to the velocities of the megamaser galaxy systems. We obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant with the same data using frequentist inference. For this purpose, we use profile likelihood to dispense with the aforementioned nuisance parameters. The frequentist estimate of the Hubble constant is given by $H_0=73.5^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km/sec/Mpc and agrees with the Bayesian estimate to within $0.2\sigma$, and both approaches also produce consistent confidence/credible intervals. Therefore, this analysis provides a proof-of-principle application of profile likelihood in dealing with nuisance parameters in cosmology, which is complementary to Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity, in which the effective gravitational constant is parametrized as $G(\epsilon) = G_{N} /[1 + \tilde{\omega} (G_{N}^{2} \epsilon)^{\alpha}]$, where $G_{N}$ and $\epsilon$ denote Newton's gravitational constant and the energy density of the matter field, respectively, with two dimensionless model parameters, $\tilde{\omega}$ and $\alpha$. Within this framework, we investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid and find that singularity is completely resolved for $\alpha &gt; 1$ but not for $1/2 \le \alpha \le 1$. The case of $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$ is inconsistent with asymptotic safety. Moreover, we note that although the singularity cannot be fully resolved for $\alpha = 1$, it is significantly weakened by quantum gravity effects. Furthermore, we successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes in an asymptotically flat spacetime. The resulting regular black hole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric fully expressible in terms of the Lerch transcendent for general cases and in elementary functions for certain values of $\alpha$, including $\alpha = 2$. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black holes.</description>

      <title>Detecting Cosmological Phase Transitions with Taiji: Sensitivity Analysis and Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the capability of the Taiji space-based gravitational wave observatory to detect stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds produced by first-order phase transitions in the early universe. Using a comprehensive simulation framework that incorporates realistic instrumental noise, galactic double white dwarf confusion noise, and extragalactic compact binary backgrounds, we systematically analyze Taiji's sensitivity across a range of signal parameters. Our Bayesian analysis demonstrates that Taiji can robustly detect and characterize phase transition signals with energy densities exceeding $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.4 \times 10^{-11}$ across most of its frequency band, with particularly strong sensitivity around $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$ Hz. For signals with amplitudes above $\Omega_{\text{PT}} \gtrsim 1.1 \times 10^{-10}$, Taiji can determine the peak frequency with relative precision better than $10\%$. These detection capabilities would enable Taiji to probe electroweak-scale phase transitions in various beyond-Standard-Model scenarios, potentially revealing new physics connected to baryogenesis and dark matter production. We quantify detection confidence using both Bayes factors and the Deviance Information Criterion, finding consistent results that validate our statistical methodology.</description>

      <title>Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an axionlike inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard interaction $\phi G \tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to rigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters compatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI.</description>
