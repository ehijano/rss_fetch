      <title>PianoBART: Symbolic Piano Music Generation and Understanding with Large-Scale Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning musical structures and composition patterns is necessary for both music generation and understanding, but current methods do not make uniform use of learned features to generate and comprehend music simultaneously. In this paper, we propose PianoBART, a pre-trained model that uses BART for both symbolic piano music generation and understanding. We devise a multi-level object selection strategy for different pre-training tasks of PianoBART, which can prevent information leakage or loss and enhance learning ability. The musical semantics captured in pre-training are fine-tuned for music generation and understanding tasks. Experiments demonstrate that PianoBART efficiently learns musical patterns and achieves outstanding performance in generating high-quality coherent pieces and comprehending music. Our code and supplementary material are available at https://github.com/RS2002/PianoBart.</description>

      <title>Advanced Framework for Animal Sound Classification With Features Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automatic classification of animal sounds presents an enduring challenge in bioacoustics, owing to the diverse statistical properties of sound signals, variations in recording equipment, and prevalent low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) conditions. Deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) have excelled in human speech recognition but have not been effectively tailored to the intricate nature of animal sounds, which exhibit substantial diversity even within the same domain. We propose an automated classification framework applicable to general animal sound classification. Our approach first optimizes audio features from Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) including feature rearrangement and feature reduction. It then uses the optimized features for the deep learning model, i.e., an attention-based Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), to extract deep semantic features for sound classification. We also contribute an animal sound benchmark dataset encompassing oceanic animals and birds1. Extensive experimentation with real-world datasets demonstrates that our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods by over 25% in precision, recall, and accuracy, promising advancements in animal sound classification.</description>

      <title>Prosody-Driven Privacy-Preserving Dementia Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speaker embeddings extracted from voice recordings have been proven valuable for dementia detection. However, by their nature, these embeddings contain identifiable information which raises privacy concerns. In this work, we aim to anonymize embeddings while preserving the diagnostic utility for dementia detection. Previous studies rely on adversarial learning and models trained on the target attribute and struggle in limited-resource settings. We propose a novel approach that leverages domain knowledge to disentangle prosody features relevant to dementia from speaker embeddings without relying on a dementia classifier. Our experiments show the effectiveness of our approach in preserving speaker privacy (speaker recognition F1-score .01%) while maintaining high dementia detection score F1-score of 74% on the ADReSS dataset. Our results are also on par with a more constrained classifier-dependent system on ADReSSo (.01% and .66%), and have no impact on synthesized speech naturalness.</description>

      <title>Towards Attention-based Contrastive Learning for Audio Spoof Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision transformers (ViT) have made substantial progress for classification tasks in computer vision. Recently, Gong et. al. '21, introduced attention-based modeling for several audio tasks. However, relatively unexplored is the use of a ViT for audio spoof detection task. We bridge this gap and introduce ViTs for this task. A vanilla baseline built on fine-tuning the SSAST (Gong et. al. '22) audio ViT model achieves sub-optimal equal error rates (EERs). To improve performance, we propose a novel attention-based contrastive learning framework (SSAST-CL) that uses cross-attention to aid the representation learning. Experiments show that our framework successfully disentangles the bonafide and spoof classes and helps learn better classifiers for the task. With appropriate data augmentations policy, a model trained on our framework achieves competitive performance on the ASVSpoof 2021 challenge. We provide comparisons and ablation studies to justify our claim.</description>

      <title>Semantic Grouping Network for Audio Source Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, audio-visual separation approaches have taken advantage of the natural synchronization between the two modalities to boost audio source separation performance. They extracted high-level semantics from visual inputs as the guidance to help disentangle sound representation for individual sources. Can we directly learn to disentangle the individual semantics from the sound itself? The dilemma is that multiple sound sources are mixed together in the original space. To tackle the difficulty, in this paper, we present a novel Semantic Grouping Network, termed as SGN, that can directly disentangle sound representations and extract high-level semantic information for each source from input audio mixture. Specifically, SGN aggregates category-wise source features through learnable class tokens of sounds. Then, the aggregated semantic features can be used as the guidance to separate the corresponding audio sources from the mixture. We conducted extensive experiments on music-only and universal sound separation benchmarks: MUSIC, FUSS, MUSDB18, and VGG-Sound. The results demonstrate that our SGN significantly outperforms previous audio-only methods and audio-visual models without utilizing additional visual cues.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised speech enhancement with spectral kurtosis and double deep priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an unsupervised DNN-based speech enhancement approach founded on deep priors (DPs). Here, DP signifies that DNNs are more inclined to produce clean speech signals than noises. Conventional methods based on DP typically involve training on a noisy speech signal using a random noise feature as input, stopping training only a clean speech signal is generated. However, such conventional approaches encounter challenges in determining the optimal stop timing, experience performance degradation due to environmental background noise, and suffer a trade-off between distortion of the clean speech signal and noise reduction performance. To address these challenges, we utilize two DNNs: one to generate a clean speech signal and the other to generate noise. The combined output of these networks closely approximates the noisy speech signal, with a loss term based on spectral kurtosis utilized to separate the noisy speech signal into a clean speech signal and noise. The key advantage of this method lies in its ability to circumvent trade-offs and early stopping problems, as the signal is decomposed by enough steps. Through evaluation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional methods in the case of white Gaussian and environmental noise while effectively mitigating early stopping problems.</description>

      <title>On the Effectiveness of Acoustic BPE in Decoder-Only TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discretizing speech into tokens and generating them by a decoder-only model have been a promising direction for text-to-speech (TTS) and spoken language modeling (SLM). To shorten the sequence length of speech tokens, acoustic byte-pair encoding (BPE) has emerged in SLM that treats speech tokens from self-supervised semantic representations as characters to further compress the token sequence. But the gain in TTS has not been fully investigated, and the proper choice of acoustic BPE remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study on various settings of acoustic BPE to explore its effectiveness in decoder-only TTS models with semantic speech tokens. Experiments on LibriTTS verify that acoustic BPE uniformly increases the intelligibility and diversity of synthesized speech, while showing different features across BPE settings. Hence, acoustic BPE is a favorable tool for decoder-only TTS.</description>

      <title>Serialized Output Training by Learned Dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serialized Output Training (SOT) has showcased state-of-the-art performance in multi-talker speech recognition by sequentially decoding the speech of individual speakers. To address the challenging label-permutation issue, prior methods have relied on either the Permutation Invariant Training (PIT) or the time-based First-In-First-Out (FIFO) rule. This study presents a model-based serialization strategy that incorporates an auxiliary module into the Attention Encoder-Decoder architecture, autonomously identifying the crucial factors to order the output sequence of the speech components in multi-talker speech. Experiments conducted on the LibriSpeech and LibriMix databases reveal that our approach significantly outperforms the PIT and FIFO baselines in both 2-mix and 3-mix scenarios. Further analysis shows that the serialization module identifies dominant speech components in a mixture by factors including loudness and gender, and orders speech components based on the dominance score.</description>

      <title>FunAudioLLM: Voice Understanding and Generation Foundation Models for Natural Interaction Between Humans and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report introduces FunAudioLLM, a model family designed to enhance natural voice interactions between humans and large language models (LLMs). At its core are two innovative models: SenseVoice, which handles multilingual speech recognition, emotion recognition, and audio event detection; and CosyVoice, which facilitates natural speech generation with control over multiple languages, timbre, speaking style, and speaker identity. SenseVoice-Small delivers exceptionally low-latency ASR for 5 languages, and SenseVoice-Large supports high-precision ASR for over 50 languages, while CosyVoice excels in multi-lingual voice generation, zero-shot in-context learning, cross-lingual voice cloning, and instruction-following capabilities. The models related to SenseVoice and CosyVoice have been open-sourced on Modelscope and Huggingface, along with the corresponding training, inference, and fine-tuning codes released on GitHub. By integrating these models with LLMs, FunAudioLLM enables applications such as speech-to-speech translation, emotional voice chat, interactive podcasts, and expressive audiobook narration, thereby pushing the boundaries of voice interaction technology. Demos are available at https://fun-audio-llm.github.io, and the code can be accessed at https://github.com/FunAudioLLM.</description>

      <title>MuseBarControl: Enhancing Fine-Grained Control in Symbolic Music Generation through Pre-Training and Counterfactual Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatically generating symbolic music-music scores tailored to specific human needs-can be highly beneficial for musicians and enthusiasts. Recent studies have shown promising results using extensive datasets and advanced transformer architectures. However, these state-of-the-art models generally offer only basic control over aspects like tempo and style for the entire composition, lacking the ability to manage finer details, such as control at the level of individual bars. While fine-tuning a pre-trained symbolic music generation model might seem like a straightforward method for achieving this finer control, our research indicates challenges in this approach. The model often fails to respond adequately to new, fine-grained bar-level control signals. To address this, we propose two innovative solutions. First, we introduce a pre-training task designed to link control signals directly with corresponding musical tokens, which helps in achieving a more effective initialization for subsequent fine-tuning. Second, we implement a novel counterfactual loss that promotes better alignment between the generated music and the control prompts. Together, these techniques significantly enhance our ability to control music generation at the bar level, showing a 13.06\% improvement over conventional methods. Our subjective evaluations also confirm that this enhanced control does not compromise the musical quality of the original pre-trained generative model.</description>

      <title>PAGURI: a user experience study of creative interaction with text-to-music models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, text-to-music models have been the biggest breakthrough in automatic music generation. While they are unquestionably a showcase of technological progress, it is not clear yet how they can be realistically integrated into the artistic practice of musicians and music practitioners. This paper aims to address this question via Prompt Audio Generation User Research Investigation (PAGURI), a user experience study where we leverage recent text-to-music developments to study how musicians and practitioners interact with these systems, evaluating their satisfaction levels. We developed an online tool through which users can generate music samples and/or apply recently proposed personalization techniques, based on fine-tuning, to make the text-to-music model generate sounds closer to their needs and preferences. Using questionnaires, we analyzed how participants interacted with the proposed tool, to understand the effectiveness of text-to-music models in enhancing users' creativity. Results show that even if the audio samples generated and their quality may not always meet user expectations, the majority of the participants would incorporate the tool in their creative process. Furthermore, they provided insights into potential enhancements for the system and its integration into their music practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mapping strategy for interacting with the latent spaces of generative AI models. Our approach involves using unsupervised feature learning to encode a human control space and mapping it to an audio synthesis model's latent space. To demonstrate how this mapping strategy can turn high-dimensional sensor data into control mechanisms of a deep generative model, we present a proof-of-concept system that uses visual sketches to control an audio synthesis model. We draw on emerging discourses in XAIxArts to discuss how this approach can contribute to XAI in artistic and creative contexts, we also discuss its current limitations and propose future research directions.</description>

      <title>Improving Audio Generation with Visual Enhanced Caption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have shown significant achievements in audio generation tasks. However, existing models struggle with complex and detailed prompts, leading to potential performance degradation. We hypothesize that this problem stems from the low quality and relatively small quantity of training data. In this work, we aim to create a large-scale audio dataset with rich captions for improving audio generation models. We develop an automated pipeline to generate detailed captions for audio-visual datasets by transforming predicted visual captions, audio captions, and tagging labels into comprehensive descriptions using a Large Language Model (LLM). We introduce Sound-VECaps, a dataset comprising 1.66M high-quality audio-caption pairs with enriched details including audio event orders, occurred places and environment information. We demonstrate that training with Sound-VECaps significantly enhances the capability of text-to-audio generation models to comprehend and generate audio from complex input prompts, improving overall system performance. Furthermore, we conduct ablation studies of Sound-VECaps across several audio-language tasks, suggesting its potential in advancing audio-text representation learning. Our dataset and models are available online.</description>

      <title>Controlling Whisper: Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks to Control Speech Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech enabled foundation models, either in the form of flexible speech recognition based systems or audio-prompted large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly popular. One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.</description>

      <title>Real-time Timbre Remapping with Differentiable DSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timbre is a primary mode of expression in diverse musical contexts. However, prevalent audio-driven synthesis methods predominantly rely on pitch and loudness envelopes, effectively flattening timbral expression from the input. Our approach draws on the concept of timbre analogies and investigates how timbral expression from an input signal can be mapped onto controls for a synthesizer. Leveraging differentiable digital signal processing, our method facilitates direct optimization of synthesizer parameters through a novel feature difference loss. This loss function, designed to learn relative timbral differences between musical events, prioritizes the subtleties of graded timbre modulations within phrases, allowing for meaningful translations in a timbre space. Using snare drum performances as a case study, where timbral expression is central, we demonstrate real-time timbre remapping from acoustic snare drums to a differentiable synthesizer modeled after the Roland TR-808.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Speech Quality Prediction through Quantization Aware Training and Binary Activation Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As speech processing systems in mobile and edge devices become more commonplace, the demand for unintrusive speech quality monitoring increases. Deep learning methods provide high-quality estimates of objective and subjective speech quality metrics. However, their significant computational requirements are often prohibitive on resource-constrained devices. To address this issue, we investigated binary activation maps (BAMs) for speech quality prediction on a convolutional architecture based on DNSMOS. We show that the binary activation model with quantization aware training matches the predictive performance of the baseline model. It further allows using other compression techniques. Combined with 8-bit weight quantization, our approach results in a 25-fold memory reduction during inference, while replacing almost all dot products with summations. Our findings show a path toward substantial resource savings by supporting mixed-precision binary multiplication in hard- and software.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning Optimizations for Auto-regressive Decoder of Multilingual ASR systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) involves fine-tuning pre-trained models with new data while maintaining the performance on the pre-trained data. This is particularly relevant for expanding multilingual ASR (MASR) capabilities. However, existing CL methods, mainly designed for computer vision and reinforcement learning tasks, often yield sub-optimal results when directly applied to MASR. We hypothesise that this is because CL of the auto-regressive decoder in the MASR model is difficult. To verify this, we propose four optimizations on the decoder. They include decoder-layer gradient surgery, freezing unused token embeddings, suppressing output of newly added tokens, and learning rate re-scaling. Our experiments on adapting Whisper to 10 unseen languages from the Common Voice dataset demonstrate that these optimizations reduce the Average Word Error Rate (AWER) of pretrained languages from 14.2% to 12.4% compared with Experience Replay, without compromising the AWER of new languages.</description>

      <title>High Fidelity Text-Guided Music Generation and Editing via Single-Stage Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient text-controllable high-fidelity music generation and editing model. It operates on sequences of continuous latent representations from a low frame rate 48 kHz stereo variational auto encoder codec that eliminates the information loss drawback of discrete representations. Based on a diffusion transformer architecture trained on a flow-matching objective the model can generate and edit diverse high quality stereo samples of variable duration, with simple text descriptions. We also explore a new regularized latent inversion method for zero-shot test-time text-guided editing and demonstrate its superior performance over naive denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) inversion for variety of music editing prompts. Evaluations are conducted on both objective and subjective metrics and demonstrate that the proposed model is not only competitive to the evaluated baselines on a standard text-to-music benchmark - quality and efficiency-wise - but also outperforms previous state of the art for music editing when combined with our proposed latent inversion. Samples are available at https://melodyflow.github.io.</description>

      <title>WildDESED: An LLM-Powered Dataset for Wild Domestic Environment Sound Event Detection System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to advance sound event detection (SED) research by presenting a new large language model (LLM)-powered dataset namely wild domestic environment sound event detection (WildDESED). It is crafted as an extension to the original DESED dataset to reflect diverse acoustic variability and complex noises in home settings. We leveraged LLMs to generate eight different domestic scenarios based on target sound categories of the DESED dataset. Then we enriched the scenarios with a carefully tailored mixture of noises selected from AudioSet and ensured no overlap with target sound. We consider widely popular convolutional neural recurrent network to study WildDESED dataset, which depicts its challenging nature. We then apply curriculum learning by gradually increasing noise complexity to enhance the model's generalization capabilities across various noise levels. Our results with this approach show improvements within the noisy environment, validating the effectiveness on the WildDESED dataset promoting noise-robust SED advancements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores class-incremental learning (CIL) for sound event detection (SED), advancing adaptability towards real-world scenarios. CIL's success in domains like computer vision inspired our SED-tailored method, addressing the unique challenges of diverse and complex audio environments. Our approach employs an independent unsupervised learning framework with a distillation loss function to integrate new sound classes while preserving the SED model consistency across incremental tasks. We further enhance this framework with a sample selection strategy for unlabeled data and a balanced exemplar update mechanism, ensuring varied and illustrative sound representations. Evaluating various continual learning methods on the DCASE 2023 Task 4 dataset, we find that our research offers insights into each method's applicability for real-world SED systems that can have newly added sound classes. The findings also delineate future directions of CIL in dynamic audio settings.</description>

      <title>Configurable DOA Estimation using Incremental Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a progressive neural network (PNN) model for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, DOA-PNN, addressing the challenge due to catastrophic forgetting in adapting dynamic acoustic environments. While traditional methods such as GCC, MUSIC, and SRP-PHAT are effective in static settings, they perform worse in noisy, reverberant conditions. Deep learning models, particularly CNNs, offer improvements but struggle with a mismatch configuration between the training and inference phases. The proposed DOA-PNN overcomes these limitations by incorporating task incremental learning of continual learning, allowing for adaptation across varying acoustic scenarios with less forgetting of previously learned knowledge. Featuring task-specific sub-networks and a scaling mechanism, DOA-PNN efficiently manages parameter growth, ensuring high performance across incremental microphone configurations. We study DOA-PNN on a simulated data under various mic distance based microphone settings. The studies reveal its capability to maintain performance with minimal parameter increase, presenting an efficient solution for DOA estimation.</description>

      <title>Multi-Convformer: Extending Conformer with Multiple Convolution Kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convolutions have become essential in state-of-the-art end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition~(ASR) systems due to their efficient modelling of local context. Notably, its use in Conformers has led to superior performance compared to vanilla Transformer-based ASR systems. While components other than the convolution module in the Conformer have been reexamined, altering the convolution module itself has been far less explored. Towards this, we introduce Multi-Convformer that uses multiple convolution kernels within the convolution module of the Conformer in conjunction with gating. This helps in improved modeling of local dependencies at varying granularities. Our model rivals existing Conformer variants such as CgMLP and E-Branchformer in performance, while being more parameter efficient. We empirically compare our approach with Conformer and its variants across four different datasets and three different modelling paradigms and show up to 8% relative word error rate~(WER) improvements.</description>

Abstract: Speech accents present a serious challenge to the performance of state-of-the-art end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Even with self-supervised learning and pre-training of ASR models, accent invariance is seldom achieved. In this work, we propose an accent-aware adaptation technique for self-supervised learning that introduces a trainable set of accent-specific codebooks to the self-supervised architecture. These learnable codebooks enable the model to capture accent specific information during pre-training, that is further refined during ASR finetuning. On the Mozilla Common Voice dataset, our proposed approach outperforms all other accent-adaptation approaches on both seen and unseen English accents, with up to 9% relative reduction in word error rate (WER).</description>

      <title>Improving Accented Speech Recognition using Data Augmentation based on Unsupervised Text-to-Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the use of unsupervised text-to-speech synthesis (TTS) as a data augmentation method to improve accented speech recognition. TTS systems are trained with a small amount of accented speech training data and their pseudo-labels rather than manual transcriptions, and hence unsupervised. This approach enables the use of accented speech data without manual transcriptions to perform data augmentation for accented speech recognition. Synthetic accented speech data, generated from text prompts by using the TTS systems, are then combined with available non-accented speech data to train automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. ASR experiments are performed in a self-supervised learning framework using a Wav2vec2.0 model which was pre-trained on large amount of unsupervised accented speech data. The accented speech data for training the unsupervised TTS are read speech, selected from L2-ARCTIC and British Isles corpora, while spontaneous conversational speech from the Edinburgh international accents of English corpus are used as the evaluation data. Experimental results show that Wav2vec2.0 models which are fine-tuned to downstream ASR task with synthetic accented speech data, generated by the unsupervised TTS, yield up to 6.1% relative word error rate reductions compared to a Wav2vec2.0 baseline which is fine-tuned with the non-accented speech data from Librispeech corpus.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces CocoNut-Humoresque, an open-source large-scale speech likability corpus that includes speech segments and their per-listener likability scores. Evaluating voice likability is essential to designing preferable voices for speech systems, such as dialogue or announcement systems. In this study, we let 885 listeners rate 1800 speech segments of a wide range of speakers regarding their likability. When constructing the corpus, we also collected the multiple speaker attributes: genders, ages, and favorite YouTube videos. Therefore, the corpus enables the large-scale statistical analysis of voice likability regarding both speaker and listener factors. This paper describes the construction methodology and preliminary data analysis to reveal the gender and age biases in voice likability. In addition, the relationship between the likability and two acoustic features, the fundamental frequencies and the x-vectors of given utterances, is also investigated.</description>

Abstract: In the Emotion Recognition in Conversation task, recent investigations have utilized attention mechanisms exploring relationships among utterances from intra- and inter-speakers for modeling emotional interaction between them. However, attributes such as speaker personality traits remain unexplored and present challenges in terms of their applicability to other tasks or compatibility with diverse model architectures. Therefore, this work introduces a novel framework named BiosERC, which investigates speaker characteristics in a conversation. By employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we extract the "biographical information" of the speaker within a conversation as supplementary knowledge injected into the model to classify emotional labels for each utterance. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on three famous benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, MELD, and EmoryNLP, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our model and showcasing its potential for adaptation to various conversation analysis tasks.

      <description>arXiv:2407.04280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prevalent ungrammatical expressions and disfluencies in spontaneous speech from second language (L2) learners pose unique challenges to Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. However, few datasets are tailored to L2 learner speech. We publicly release LearnerVoice, a dataset consisting of 50.04 hours of audio and transcriptions of L2 learners' spontaneous speech. Our linguistic analysis reveals that transcriptions in our dataset contain L2S (L2 learner's Spontaneous speech) features, consisting of ungrammatical expressions and disfluencies (e.g., filler words, word repetitions, self-repairs, false starts), significantly more than native speech datasets. Fine-tuning whisper-small.en with LearnerVoice achieves a WER of 10.26%, 44.2% lower than vanilla whisper-small.en. Furthermore, our qualitative analysis indicates that 54.2% of errors from the vanilla model on LearnerVoice are attributable to L2S features, with 48.1% of them being reduced in the fine-tuned model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, different online speaker diarization systems are evaluated on the same hardware with the same test data with regard to their latency. The latency is the time span from audio input to the output of the corresponding speaker label. As part of the evaluation, various model combinations within the DIART framework, a diarization system based on the online clustering algorithm UIS-RNN-SML, and the end-to-end online diarization system FS-EEND are compared. The lowest latency is achieved for the DIART-pipeline with the embedding model pyannote/embedding and the segmentation model pyannote/segmentation. The FS-EEND system shows a similarly good latency. In general there is currently no published research that compares several online diarization systems in terms of their latency. This makes this work even more relevant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce romanization encoding for script-heavy languages to optimize multilingual and code-switching Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. By adopting romanization encoding alongside a balanced concatenated tokenizer within a FastConformer-RNNT framework equipped with a Roman2Char module, we significantly reduce vocabulary and output dimensions, enabling larger training batches and reduced memory consumption. Our method decouples acoustic modeling and language modeling, enhancing the flexibility and adaptability of the system. In our study, applying this method to Mandarin-English ASR resulted in a remarkable 63.51% vocabulary reduction and notable performance gains of 13.72% and 15.03% on SEAME code-switching benchmarks. Ablation studies on Mandarin-Korean and Mandarin-Japanese highlight our method's strong capability to address the complexities of other script-heavy languages, paving the way for more versatile and effective multilingual ASR systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional conversational intelligence from speech, a cascaded pipeline is used, involving tasks such as voice activity detection, diarization, transcription, and subsequent processing with different NLP models for tasks like semantic endpointing and named entity recognition (NER). Our paper introduces TokenVerse, a single Transducer-based model designed to handle multiple tasks. This is achieved by integrating task-specific tokens into the reference text during ASR model training, streamlining the inference and eliminating the need for separate NLP models. In addition to ASR, we conduct experiments on 3 different tasks: speaker change detection, endpointing, and NER. Our experiments on a public and a private dataset show that the proposed method improves ASR by up to 7.7% in relative WER while outperforming the cascaded pipeline approach in individual task performance. Additionally, we present task transfer learning to a new task within an existing TokenVerse.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Speech Encoders for Low-Resource SLU and ASR in Tunisian Dialect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech encoders pretrained through self-supervised learning (SSL) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various downstream tasks, including Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). For instance, fine-tuning SSL models for such tasks has shown significant potential, leading to improvements in the SOTA performance across challenging datasets. In contrast to existing research, this paper contributes by comparing the effectiveness of SSL approaches in the context of (i) the low-resource spoken Tunisian Arabic dialect and (ii) its combination with a low-resource SLU and ASR scenario, where only a few semantic annotations are available for fine-tuning. We conduct experiments using many SSL speech encoders on the TARIC-SLU dataset. We use speech encoders that were pre-trained on either monolingual or multilingual speech data. Some of them have also been refined without in-domain nor Tunisian data through multimodal supervised teacher-student paradigm. This study yields numerous significant findings that we are discussing in this paper.</description>

      <title>Seed-ASR: Understanding Diverse Speech and Contexts with LLM-based Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern automatic speech recognition (ASR) model is required to accurately transcribe diverse speech signals (from different domains, languages, accents, etc) given the specific contextual information in various application scenarios. Classic end-to-end models fused with extra language models perform well, but mainly in data matching scenarios and are gradually approaching a bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Seed-ASR, a large language model (LLM) based speech recognition model. Seed-ASR is developed based on the framework of audio conditioned LLM (AcLLM), leveraging the capabilities of LLMs by inputting continuous speech representations together with contextual information into the LLM. Through stage-wise large-scale training and the elicitation of context-aware capabilities in LLM, Seed-ASR demonstrates significant improvement over end-to-end models on comprehensive evaluation sets, including multiple domains, accents/dialects and languages. Additionally, Seed-ASR can be further deployed to support specific needs in various scenarios without requiring extra language models. Compared to recently released large ASR models, Seed-ASR achieves 10%-40% reduction in word (or character, for Chinese) error rates on Chinese and English public test sets, further demonstrating its powerful performance.</description>

      <title>Joint Multi-scale Cross-lingual Speaking Style Transfer with Bidirectional Attention Mechanism for Automatic Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05203</link>

Abstract: Automatic dubbing, which generates a corresponding version of the input speech in another language, could be widely utilized in many real-world scenarios such as video and game localization. In addition to synthesizing the translated scripts, automatic dubbing needs to further transfer the speaking style in the original language to the dubbed speeches to give audiences the impression that the characters are speaking in their native tongue. However, state-of-the-art automatic dubbing systems only model the transfer on duration and speaking rate, neglecting the other aspects in speaking style such as emotion, intonation and emphasis which are also crucial to fully perform the characters and speech understanding. In this paper, we propose a joint multi-scale cross-lingual speaking style transfer framework to simultaneously model the bidirectional speaking style transfer between languages at both global (i.e. utterance level) and local (i.e. word level) scales. The global and local speaking styles in each language are extracted and utilized to predicted the global and local speaking styles in the other language with an encoder-decoder framework for each direction and a shared bidirectional attention mechanism for both directions. A multi-scale speaking style enhanced FastSpeech 2 is then utilized to synthesize the predicted the global and local speaking styles to speech for each language. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, which outperforms a baseline with only duration transfer in both objective and subjective evaluations.</description>

      <title>Tango 2: Aligning Diffusion-based Text-to-Audio Generations through Direct Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09956</link>

Abstract: Generative multimodal content is increasingly prevalent in much of the content creation arena, as it has the potential to allow artists and media personnel to create pre-production mockups by quickly bringing their ideas to life. The generation of audio from text prompts is an important aspect of such processes in the music and film industry. Many of the recent diffusion-based text-to-audio models focus on training increasingly sophisticated diffusion models on a large set of datasets of prompt-audio pairs. These models do not explicitly focus on the presence of concepts or events and their temporal ordering in the output audio with respect to the input prompt. Our hypothesis is focusing on how these aspects of audio generation could improve audio generation performance in the presence of limited data. As such, in this work, using an existing text-to-audio model Tango, we synthetically create a preference dataset where each prompt has a winner audio output and some loser audio outputs for the diffusion model to learn from. The loser outputs, in theory, have some concepts from the prompt missing or in an incorrect order. We fine-tune the publicly available Tango text-to-audio model using diffusion-DPO (direct preference optimization) loss on our preference dataset and show that it leads to improved audio output over Tango and AudioLDM2, in terms of both automatic- and manual-evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Towards Audio Codec-based Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent improvements in neural audio codec (NAC) models have generated interest in adopting pre-trained codecs for a variety of speech processing applications to take advantage of the efficiencies gained from high compression, but these have yet been applied to the speech separation (SS) task. SS can benefit from high compression because the compute required for traditional SS models makes them impractical for many edge computing use cases. However, SS is a waveform-masking task where compression tends to introduce distortions that severely impact performance. Here we propose a novel task of Audio Codec-based SS, where SS is performed within the embedding space of a NAC, and propose a new model, Codecformer, to address this task. At inference, Codecformer achieves a 52x reduction in MAC while producing separation performance comparable to a cloud deployment of Sepformer. This method charts a new direction for performing efficient SS in practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>SAVE: Segment Audio-Visual Easy way using Segment Anything Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary aim of Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) is to precisely identify and locate auditory elements within visual scenes by accurately predicting segmentation masks at the pixel level. Achieving this involves comprehensively considering data and model aspects to address this task effectively. This study presents a lightweight approach, SAVE, which efficiently adapts the pre-trained segment anything model (SAM) to the AVS task. By incorporating an image encoder adapter into the transformer blocks to better capture the distinct dataset information and proposing a residual audio encoder adapter to encode the audio features as a sparse prompt, our proposed model achieves effective audio-visual fusion and interaction during the encoding stage. Our proposed method accelerates the training and inference speed by reducing the input resolution from 1024 to 256 pixels while achieving higher performance compared with the previous SOTA. Extensive experimentation validates our approach, demonstrating that our proposed model outperforms other SOTA methods significantly. Moreover, leveraging the pre-trained model on synthetic data enhances performance on real AVSBench data, achieving 84.59 mIoU on the S4 (V1S) subset and 70.28 mIoU on the MS3 (V1M) set with only 256 pixels for input images. This increases up to 86.16 mIoU on the S4 (V1S) and 70.83 mIoU on the MS3 (V1M) with inputs of 1024 pixels.</description>
