      <title>A Network Simulation of OTC Markets with Multiple Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel agent-based approach to simulating an over-the-counter (OTC) financial market in which trades are intermediated solely by market makers and agent visibility is constrained to a network topology. Dynamics, such as changes in price, result from agent-level interactions that ubiquitously occur via market maker agents acting as liquidity providers. Two additional agents are considered: trend investors use a deep convolutional neural network paired with a deep Q-learning framework to inform trading decisions by analysing price history; and value investors use a static price-target to determine their trade directions and sizes. We demonstrate that our novel inclusion of a network topology with market makers facilitates explorations into various market structures. First, we present the model and an overview of its mechanics. Second, we validate our findings via comparison to the real-world: we demonstrate a fat-tailed distribution of price changes, auto-correlated volatility, a skew negatively correlated to market maker positioning, predictable price-history patterns and more. Finally, we demonstrate that our network-based model can lend insights into the effect of market-structure on price-action. For example, we show that markets with sparsely connected intermediaries can have a critical point of fragmentation, beyond which the market forms distinct clusters and arbitrage becomes rapidly possible between the prices of different market makers. A discussion is provided on future work that would be beneficial.</description>

      <title>Tuning parameter selection in econometrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review some of the main methods for selecting tuning parameters in nonparametric and $\ell_1$-penalized estimation. For the nonparametric estimation, I consider the methods of Mallows, Stein, Lepski, cross-validation, penalization, and aggregation in the context of series estimation. For the $\ell_1$-penalized estimation, I consider the methods based on the theory of self-normalized moderate deviations, bootstrap, Stein's unbiased risk estimation, and cross-validation in the context of Lasso estimation. I explain the intuition behind each of the methods and discuss their comparative advantages. I also give some extensions.</description>

      <title>Inference in Predictive Quantile Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies inference in predictive quantile regressions when the predictive regressor has a near-unit root. We derive asymptotic distributions for the quantile regression estimator and its heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) t-statistic in terms of functionals of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We then propose a switching-fully modified (FM) predictive test for quantile predictability. The proposed test employs an FM style correction with a Bonferroni bound for the local-to-unity parameter when the predictor has a near unit root. It switches to a standard predictive quantile regression test with a slightly conservative critical value when the largest root of the predictor lies in the stationary range. Simulations indicate that the test has a reliable size in small samples and good power. We employ this new methodology to test the ability of three commonly employed, highly persistent and endogenous lagged valuation regressors - the dividend price ratio, earnings price ratio, and book-to-market ratio - to predict the median, shoulders, and tails of the stock return distribution.</description>

      <title>Estimating Counterfactual Matrix Means with Short Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new, spectral approach for identifying and estimating average counterfactual outcomes under a low-rank factor model with short panel data and general outcome missingness patterns. Applications include event studies and studies of outcomes of "matches" between agents of two types, e.g. workers and firms, typically conducted under less-flexible Two-Way-Fixed-Effects (TWFE) models of outcomes. Given an infinite population of units and a finite number of outcomes, we show our approach identifies all counterfactual outcome means, including those not estimable by existing methods, if a particular graph constructed based on overlaps in observed outcomes between subpopulations is connected. Our analogous, computationally efficient estimation procedure yields consistent, asymptotically normal estimates of counterfactual outcome means under fixed-$T$ (number of outcomes), large-$N$ (sample size) asymptotics. In a semi-synthetic simulation study based on matched employer-employee data, our estimator has lower bias and only slightly higher variance than a TWFE-model-based estimator when estimating average log-wages.</description>

      <title>Partial Identification of Individual-Level Parameters Using Aggregate Data in a Nonparametric Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07236v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the relationship between variables at the individual level can be different from the relationship between those same variables aggregated over individuals. In this paper, I develop a methodology to partially identify linear combinations of conditional mean outcomes for individual-level outcomes of interest without imposing parametric assumptions when the researcher only has access to aggregate data. I construct identified sets using an optimization program that allows for researchers to impose additional shape and data restrictions. I also provide consistency results and construct an inference procedure that is valid with data that only provides marginal information about each variable. I apply the methodology to simulated and real-world data sets and find that the estimated identified sets are too wide to be useful, but become narrower as more assumptions are imposed and data aggregated at a finer level is available.</description>

      <title>The Role of Carbon Pricing in Food Inflation: Evidence from Canadian Provinces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In search of political-economic tools for mitigating emissions, carbon pricing, which includes carbon tax and cap-and-trade, is praised by many governments. However, the inflating food prices in carbon-pricing countries, such as Canada, have led many to believe such policies harm food affordability. This study aims to identify changes in food prices induced by carbon pricing using the case of Canadian provinces. Using the staggered difference-in-difference (DiD) approach, we find an overall minimal and deflationary effect of carbon pricing on food (measured by monthly provincial food CPI). The average reductions in food CPI compared to before carbon pricing are merely 2% and 4% within and beyond two years of implementation. Our subsequent analyses find that the deflationary effects are partially driven by lower consumption, while farm input costs show no significant changes. Evidence from this paper suggests that the current food inflation in Canada is the result of something else rather than carbon pricing, and the food affordability argument gives little support to the growing voice against carbon pricing policies.</description>

      <title>On the Asymmetric Volatility Connectedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connectedness measures the degree at which a time-series variable spills over volatility to other variables compared to the rate that it is receiving. The idea is based on the percentage of variance decomposition from one variable to the others, which is estimated by making use of a VAR model. Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2014) suggested estimating this simple and useful measure of percentage risk spillover impact. Their method is symmetric by nature, however. The current paper offers an alternative asymmetric approach for measuring the volatility spillover direction, which is based on estimating the asymmetric variance decompositions introduced by Hatemi-J (2011, 2014). This approach accounts explicitly for the asymmetric property in the estimations, which accords better with reality. An application is provided to capture the potential asymmetric volatility spillover impacts between the three largest financial markets in the world.</description>

      <title>Percentage Coefficient (bp) -- Effect Size Analysis (Theory Paper 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Percentage coefficient (bp) has emerged in recent publications as an additional and alternative estimator of effect size for regression analysis. This paper retraces the theory behind the estimator. It's posited that an estimator must first serve the fundamental function of enabling researchers and readers to comprehend an estimand, the target of estimation. It may then serve the instrumental function of enabling researchers and readers to compare two or more estimands. Defined as the regression coefficient when dependent variable (DV) and independent variable (IV) are both on conceptual 0-1 percentage scales, percentage coefficients (bp) feature 1) clearly comprehendible interpretation and 2) equitable scales for comparison. The coefficient (bp) serves the two functions effectively and efficiently. It thus serves needs unserved by other indicators, such as raw coefficient (bw) and standardized beta.
  Another premise of the functionalist theory is that "effect" is not a monolithic concept. Rather, it is a collection of concepts, each of which measures a component of the conglomerate called "effect", thereby serving a subfunction. Regression coefficient (b), for example, indicates the unit change in DV associated with a one-unit increase in IV, thereby measuring one aspect called unit effect, aka efficiency. Percentage coefficient (bp) indicates the percentage change in DV associated with a whole scale increase in IV. It is not meant to be an all-encompassing indicator of an all-encompassing concept, but rather a comprehendible and comparable indicator of efficiency, a key aspect of effect.</description>
