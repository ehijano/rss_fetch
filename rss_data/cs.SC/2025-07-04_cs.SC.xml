      <title>Constraint-Guided Symbolic Regression for Data-Efficient Kinetic Model Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The industrialization of catalytic processes hinges on the availability of reliable kinetic models for design, optimization, and control. Traditional mechanistic models demand extensive domain expertise, while many data-driven approaches often lack interpretability and fail to enforce physical consistency. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Automated Discovery of Kinetics (PI-ADoK) framework. By integrating physical constraints directly into a symbolic regression approach, PI-ADoK narrows the search space and substantially reduces the number of experiments required for model convergence. Additionally, the framework incorporates a robust uncertainty quantification strategy via the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, which propagates parameter uncertainty to yield credible prediction intervals. Benchmarking our method against conventional approaches across several catalytic case studies demonstrates that PI-ADoK not only enhances model fidelity but also lowers the experimental burden, highlighting its potential for efficient and reliable kinetic model discovery in chemical reaction engineering.</description>

      <title>Generalized ODE reduction algorithm for bounded degree transformation</title>

Abstract: The integrability problem of rational first-order ODEs $y^{\prime}=\frac{M(x,y)}{N(x,y)}$, where $M,N \in \mathbb{R}[x,y]$ is a long-term research focus in the area of dynamical systems, physics, etc. Although the computer algebra system such as Mathematica, Maple has developed standard algorithms to tackle its first integral expressed by Liouvillian or special function, this problem is quite difficult and the general method requires specifying a tight degree bound for the Darboux polynomial. Computing the bounded degree first integral, in general, is very expensive for a computer algebra system\cite{duarte2021efficient}\cite{cheze2020symbolic} and becomes impractical for ODE of large size. In \cite{huang2025algorithm}, we have proposed an algorithm to find the inverse of a local rational transformation $y \to \frac{A(x,y)}{B(x,y)}$ that transforms a rational ODE to a simpler and more tractable structure $y^{\prime}=\sum_{i=0}^nf_i(x)y^i$, whose integrability under linear transformation $\left\{x \to F(x),y \to P(x)y+Q(x)\right\}$ can be detected by Maple efficiently \cite{CHEBTERRAB2000204}\cite{cheb2000first}. In that paper we have also mentioned when $M(x,y),N(x,y)$ of the reducible structure are not coprime, canceling the common factors in $y$ will alter the structure which makes that algorithm fail. In this paper, we consider this issue. We conclude that with the exact tight degree bound for the polynomial $A(x,y)$ given, we have an efficient algorithm to compute such transformation and the reduced ODE for "quite a lot of" cases where $M,N$ are not coprime. We have also implemented this algorithm in Maple and the code is available in researchgate.</description>
