      <title>Seeing Forests Through Clouds: Comment on "Recent global temperature surge amplified by record-low planetary albedo" (arXiv:2405.19986)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goessling et al. (1) link the record-breaking warming anomaly of 2023 to a global albedo decline due to reduced low-level cloud cover. What caused the reduction remains unclear. Goessling et al. considered several geophysical mechanisms, including ocean surface warming and declining aerosol emissions, but did not discuss the biosphere. We propose that disruption of global biospheric functioning could be a cause, as supported by three lines of evidence that have not yet been jointly considered.</description>

      <title>Long-term prediction of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation using reservoir computing with data-driven realtime filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the application of machine learning approaches to time-series forecasting of climate dynamical phenomena has become increasingly active. It is known that applying a band-pass filter to a time-series data is a key to obtaining a high-quality data-driven model. Here, to obtain longer-term predictability of machine learning models, we introduce a new type of band-pass filter. It can be applied to realtime operational prediction workflows since it relies solely on past time series. We combine the filter with reservoir computing, which is a machine-learning technique that employs a data-driven dynamical system. As an application, we predict the multi-year dynamics of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation with the prediction horizon of 24 months using only past time series.</description>

      <title>Winter Noctilucent Clouds Following Sudden Stratospheric Warming: First Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mesospheric structures identical to summer noctilucent clouds were observed during the nights of December 17-19, 2024 in Siberian Russia. Basing on the available photo data, the mean altitude of the clouds 70.1+-1.5 km was measured by umbral colorimetric method. This coincided spatially and temporary with deep temperature minimum below 160K in mesosphere, followed the polar vortex displacement and warming of stratosphere below the clouds. The satellite data on temperature and water vapor is used to study the nature of this unexpected event.</description>

      <title>Improving AI weather prediction models using global mass and energy conservation schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05648v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction (AIWP) models are powerful tools for medium-range forecasts but often lack physical consistency, leading to outputs that violate conservation laws. This study introduces a set of novel physics-based schemes designed to enforce the conservation of global dry air mass, moisture budget, and total atmospheric energy in AIWP models. The schemes are highly modular, allowing for seamless integration into a wide range of AI model architectures. Forecast experiments are conducted to demonstrate the benefit of conservation schemes using FuXi, an example AIWP model, modified and adapted for 1.0-degree grid spacing. Verification results show that the conservation schemes can guide the model in producing forecasts that obey conservation laws. The forecast skills of upper-air and surface variables are also improved, with longer forecast lead times receiving larger benefits. Notably, large performance gains are found in the total precipitation forecasts, owing to the reduction of drizzle bias. The proposed conservation schemes establish a foundation for implementing other physics-based schemes in the future. They also provide a new way to integrate atmospheric domain knowledge into the design and refinement of AIWP models.</description>
