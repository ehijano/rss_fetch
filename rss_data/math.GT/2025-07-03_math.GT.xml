      <title>Handlebodies, Outer space, and tropical geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space of graphs $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ is a polyhedral object that mimics the behavior of the moduli spaces $M_{g,n}$, $\overline{M}_{g,n}$ of (stable) Riemann surfaces; this relationship has been made precise in several different ways, which collectively identify $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ as the "tropicalization" of $M_{g,n}$. We describe how this relationship lifts to some objects that live over $M_{g,n}$ (like Teichm\"uller space) and that live over $M_{g,n}^{\mathrm{trop}}$ (like the Culler-Vogtmann space $CV_{g,n}^*$). We introduce the notion of a stable complex handlebody, and show that $CV_{g,n}^*$ can be viewed as the tropicalization of a certain complex manifold $hT(V_{g,n})$ that parametrizes complex handlebodies. An important ingredient is our construction of a partial compactification $\overline{hT}(V_{g,n})\supset hT(V_{g,n})$, which we prove is a complex manifold with simple normal crossings boundary. When $n=0$, $hT(V_{g,n})$ coincides with the moduli space of Schottky groups, $\overline{hT}(V_{g,n})$ coincides with Gerritzen-Herrlich's extended Schottky space, and $CV_{g,0}^*$ is the simplicial completion of the original Outer space. The resulting picture fits together many familiar objects from geometric group theory and surface topology, including Harvey's curve complex, mapping class groups of surfaces and handlebodies, and augmented Teichm\"uller space. Many of the relationships between the objects that we see in this picture already exist in the literature, but we add some new ones, and generalize several existing relationships to include a number $n&gt;0$ of punctures/leaves.</description>

      <title>An effective proof of finiteness for Kauffman bracket skein modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a version of the finiteness conjecture for Kauffman bracket skein modules of $3$-manifolds with boundary, which was introduced by the second author in \cite{Det21}. In particular our methods, which are constructive, give an alternative proof of Witten's finiteness conjecture for the Kauffman bracket skein modules of closed $3$-manifolds, which was originally proved in \cite{GJS19}. Moreover, as a corollary we show that the peripheral ideal of any link is non-empty, answering a question of Frohman, Gelca and Lofaro \cite{FGL02}.</description>

      <title>Maximal stretch and Lipschitz maps on Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his seminal work on Teichm\"uller spaces (\cite{Th98}), Thurston introduced the maximal stretch for a pair of hyperbolic metrics on a closed surface of genus $\geq 2$ and showed that the logarithm of this quantity induces an asymmetric metric in the Teichm\"uller space. He also showed that the subset of the surface on which the maximal stretch is attained is a geodesic lamination. In this paper, we define the maximal stretch analogously for closed manifolds equipped with Riemannian metrics of variable negative curvature and investigate the structure of the related Mather set on the unit tangent bundle. In contrast to the Teichm\"uller space, the Mather set may not be lifts of geodesic laminations in this broader setting. However, in our paper, we will discuss similar features shared by the Mather set with geodesic laminations. We also connect the study of the Mather set with the theory of best Lipschitz maps.</description>

      <title>Surgery exact triangles in involutive Heegaard Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.00113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a surgery exact triangle for involutive Heegaard Floer homology by using a doubling model of the involution. We use this exact triangle to give an involutive version of Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o's mapping cone formula for knot surgery. As an application, we use this surgery formula to give examples of integer homology spheres that are not homology cobordant to any linear combination of Seifert fibered spaces.</description>

      <title>Naturality and functoriality in involutive Heegaard Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove first-order naturality of involutive Heegaard Floer homology, and furthermore construct well-defined maps on involutive Heegaard Floer homology associated to cobordisms between three-manifolds. We also prove analogous naturality and functoriality results for involutive Floer theory for knots and links. The proof relies on the doubling model for the involution, as well as several variations.</description>

      <title>The band connected sum and the second Kirby move for higher-dimensional links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ be a link (i.e. an embedding).
  How does (the isotopy class of) the knot $S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the components of $f$ depend on $f$?
  Define a link $\sigma f:S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ as follows. The first component of $\sigma f$ is the `standardly shifted' first component of $f$. The second component of $\sigma f$ is the embedded connected sum of the components of $f$. How does (the isotopy class of) $\sigma f$ depend on $f$?
  How does (the isotopy class of) the link $S^q\sqcup S^q\to S^m$ obtained by embedded connected sum of the last two components of a link $g:S^q_1\sqcup S^q_2\sqcup S^q_3\to S^m$ depend on $g$?
  We give the answers for the `first non-trivial case' $q=4k-1$ and $m=6k$. The first answer was used by S. Avvakumov for classification of linked 3-manifolds in $S^6$.</description>

      <title>Links in the spherical 3-manifold obtained from the quaternion group and their lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there are infinitely many triples of non-isotopic hyperbolic links in the lens space $L(4,1)$ such that the three lifts of each triple in $S^{3}$ are isotopic. They are obtained as the lifts of links in $S^{3} / Q_{8}$ by double covers, where $Q_{8}$ is the quaternion group. To construct specific examples, we introduce a diagram of a link in $S^{3} / Q_{8}$ obtained by projecting to a square. The diagrams of isotopic links are connected by Reidemeister-type moves.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin, and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three, and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds -- thereby categorifying the aforementioned Floer homology of three-manifolds -- and its novel Atiyah-Floer type correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

      <title>Topological Gauge Theories with Sixteen Supercharges: Higher $A_\infty$-categorification of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20067v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. In the 8d case, one can also derive higher $A_{\infty}$-categories, such as a novel Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-3-category that 3-categorifies the Haydys-Witten Floer homology of four-manifolds via a 4d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the theory. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], our work furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3], Doan-Rezchikov [4], and Cao [5].</description>

      <title>Covering instability for the existence of positive scalar curvature metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a closed non-orientable $3$-manifold admits a positive scalar curvature metric if and only if its orientation double cover does; however, for each $4\le n\le 7$, there exist infinitely many smooth non-orientable $n$-manifolds $M$ that are mutually non-homotopy equivalent, such that the orientation double cover of $M$ admits positive scalar curvature metrics, but every closed smooth manifold that is homotopy equivalent to $M$ cannot admit positive scalar curvature metrics. These examples were first introduced by Alpert-Balitskiy-Guth in the study of Urysohn widths.
  To prove the nonexistence result, we extend the Schoen-Yau inductive descent approach to non-orientable manifolds. We also discuss band width estimates and the notion of enlargeability for non-orientable PSC manifolds.</description>
