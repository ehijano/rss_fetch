      <title>Influence of an external static magnetic field on prebreakdown electron emission and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High magnetic fields can increase the occurrence of vacuum arcing, suggesting that both electric and magnetic fields can play a role in the vacuum arcing process. The mechanism of vacuum arcing in high magnetic fields is believed to involve both the cathode and the anode, with the cathode serving as the originator of field-emitting nanoprotrusions or tips, while the anode serves a secondary role. Significant heating of the anode surface can be achieved by magnetic focusing of the emitted electron beam, leading to increased heat flux due to greater current density. We simulated the emitted electron beam in different configurations of the electric and magnetic fields using the particle-in-cell (PIC) and finite element methods (FEM). The heating caused by the impacting electron beam was simulated for magnetic fields ranging from 0 T to 30 T. The directions of the electric and magnetic fields were found to play a major role in the focusing of the electron beam. We found that a sufficient temperature increase on the anode surface for evaporation can be reached at magnetic fields on the order of 10-30 T, suggesting the possibility of plasma initiation on the anode side.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multi-Scale Homogeneous H-Phi Thin-Shell Model for Efficient Simulations of Stacked HTS Coils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of large-scale high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets is a computational challenge due to the multiple spatial scales involved, from the magnet to the detailed turn-to-turn geometry. To reduce the computational cost associated with finite-element (FE) simulations of insulated HTS coils, the simultaneous multi-scale homogeneous (SMSH) method can be considered. It combines a macroscopic-scale homogenized magnet model with multiple single-tape models and solves both scales monolithically. In this work, the SMSH method is reformulated using the $h$-$\phi$ thin-shell (TS) approximation, where analyzed tapes are collapsed into thin surfaces, simplifying mesh generation. Moreover, the magnetic field is expressed as the gradient of the magnetic scalar potential outside the analyzed tapes. The discretized field is then described with nodal functions, further reducing the size of the FE problem compared to standard $h$ formulations. The proposed $h$-$\phi$ SMSH-TS method is verified against state-of-the-art homogenization methods on a 2-D benchmark problem of stacks of HTS tapes. The results show good agreement in terms of AC losses, turn voltage and local current density, with a significant reduction in simulation time compared to reference models. All models are open-source.</description>

      <title>Implementation and Deployment of an Injection Tuning Tool Using Bayesian Optimization at the SuperKEKB Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As of July 2025, the SuperKEKB accelerator, which collides 7 GeV electrons with 4 GeV positrons to abundantly produce particles such as B mesons and tau leptons, holds the world record for the highest instantaneous luminosity. Continuous operation and upgrades are underway to achieve even higher luminosities. Maintaining a high instantaneous luminosity requires sustaining high beam currents in the storage rings, which in turn demands efficient beam injection from the injector. In particular, a high injection efficiency, defined as the ratio of the beam current successfully accumulated in the ring to the current delivered from the beam transport line, must be ensured. In the present study, we developed a tool to automate the injection tuning process using Bayesian optimization, a machine-learning-based technique, in order to improve the injection efficiency. During test operations conducted in November-December 2024, this tool successfully enhanced the injection efficiency by up to 32%.</description>

      <title>Crab-waist interaction region design and integration for the Super Tau-Charm Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) is a new-generation $e^+e^-$ collider proposed in China, designed to operate in the center-of-mass (CoM) energy range of 2-7 GeV. To achieve the design luminosity exceeding 5*10^34 cm^-2s^-1 at the optimal CoM energy of 4 GeV, a large crossing angle combined with the crab-waist correction scheme is adopted. However, this scheme introduces strong nonlinearities in the interaction region (IR) due to the extremely low vertical beta function of beta_y* &lt;=1 mm, which significantly limits dynamic and momentum apertures of the collider ring. This paper presents a comprehensive modular optics design that addresses these challenges through several key features: 1) local chromaticity correction up to third order to enhance momentum bandwidth; 2) exact -I transformation between chromatic sextupole pairs for nonlinear cancellation; 3) minimization of the dispersion invariant along the IR to improve local momentum acceptance; 4) optimized beta functions at crab sextupole locations to reduce strength requirements and associated nonlinearities. Resonance driving terms analysis confirms effective suppression of geometric aberrations while preserving the intended crab-waist effects. When integrated into the collider ring, the design achieves a Touschek lifetime exceeding 300 s at beam energy of 2 GeV, meeting STCF requirements. The impact of fringe fields from superconducting quadrupoles is mitigated using octupole correctors, and detector solenoid effects are fully suppressed via local anti-solenoid compensation. Furthermore, the defined machine-detector interface layout ensures minimal synchrotron radiation background at the IP beryllium chamber, while ultra-high vacuum conditions are required to suppress beam-gas background. This IR design represents the current optimal solution for STCF and has been incorporated into the project's conceptual design report.</description>

      <title>A Living Review Pipeline for AI/ML Applications in Accelerator Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09376v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an open-source pipeline for generating a \emph{living review} of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications in accelerator physics and technologies. Traditional review articles provide static snapshots that are quickly outdated by the rapid pace of research. The presented system automatically harvests publications from multiple bibliographic sources (arXiv, InspireHEP, HAL, OpenAlex, Crossref, and Springer), deduplicates entries, applies semantic filtering to ensure accelerator and ML relevance, and classifies papers into thematic categories. The resulting curated dataset was exported in JSON, HTML, PDF, and Bib\TeX formats, enabling continuous updates and integration with web frameworks. We describe the methodology, including semantic similarity filtering using sentence-transformer embeddings, threshold calibration, and expert-informed classification. The results demonstrate the robust filtering of $\sim$12000 raw papers/month into a focused corpus of $\sim$2\% relevant works. The pipeline provides the basis for an evolving community-driven review of AI/ML in accelerator science.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Spallation Induced Transmutation Rates For Long Lived Fission Products via Proton Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long lived fission products represent a major challenge in nuclear waste management due to persistent radiotoxicity over very long timescales. This study focuses on six of these fission products: Se-79, Zr-93, Tc-99, Sn-126, I-127, Cs-135. This study investigates the feasibility of spallation driven transmutation, in which a high energy proton beam strikes a heavy spallation target to generate neutrons that induce transmutation in the fission products surrounding the target. Lead and depleted uranium are identified as the principal spallation target candidates, reflecting contrasting trade offs in neutron yield, secondary reactions, and heat generation. Simulations assess nuclide specific behavior under reactor scale inventories and practical geometric constraints. Results demonstrate that technetium, iodine, and selenium are strong candidates for transmutation using this pathway, while tin shows partial resistance but benefits from thermal flux. By contrast, zirconium is neutron transparent and inefficient to transmute, and cesium suffers from low net reduction due to competition with lighter isotopes. Cost effectiveness is highly isotope dependent: technetium is most favorable, whereas cesium and zirconium remain expensive. These findings highlight the advantages and limitations of spallation driven systems and motivate strategies with optimized target-blanket designs.</description>
