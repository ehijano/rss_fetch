      <title>DeepEvidence: Empowering Biomedical Discovery with Deep Knowledge Graph Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) encode vast, heterogeneous information spanning literature, genes, pathways, drugs, diseases, and clinical trials, but leveraging them collectively for scientific discovery remains difficult. Their structural differences, continual evolution, and limited cross-resource alignment require substantial manual integration, limiting the depth and scale of knowledge exploration. We introduce DeepEvidence, an AI-agent framework designed to perform Deep Research across various heterogeneous biomedical KGs. Unlike generic Deep Research systems that rely primarily on internet-scale text, DeepEvidence incorporates specialized knowledge-graph tooling and coordinated exploration strategies to systematically bridge heterogeneous resources. At its core is an orchestrator that directs two complementary agents: Breadth-First ReSearch (BFRS) for broad, multi-graph entity search, and Depth-First ReSearch (DFRS) for multi-hop, evidence-focused reasoning. An internal, incrementally built evidence graph provides a structured record of retrieved entities, relations, and supporting evidence. To operate at scale, DeepEvidence includes unified interfaces for querying diverse biomedical APIs and an execution sandbox that enables programmatic data retrieval, extraction, and analysis. Across established deep-reasoning benchmarks and four key stages of the biomedical discovery lifecycle: drug discovery, pre-clinical experimentation, clinical trial development, and evidence-based medicine, DeepEvidence demonstrates substantial gains in systematic exploration and evidence synthesis. These results highlight the potential of knowledge-graph-driven Deep Research to accelerate biomedical discovery.</description>

      <title>Utilizing Metadata for Better Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems depend on retrieving semantically relevant document chunks to support accurate, grounded outputs from large language models. In structured and repetitive corpora such as regulatory filings, chunk similarity alone often fails to distinguish between documents with overlapping language. Practitioners often flatten metadata into input text as a heuristic, but the impact and trade-offs of this practice remain poorly understood. We present a systematic study of metadata-aware retrieval strategies, comparing plain-text baselines with approaches that embed metadata directly. Our evaluation spans metadata-as-text (prefix and suffix), a dual-encoder unified embedding that fuses metadata and content in a single index, dual-encoder late-fusion retrieval, and metadata-aware query reformulation. Across multiple retrieval metrics and question types, we find that prefixing and unified embeddings consistently outperform plain-text baselines, with the unified at times exceeding prefixing while being easier to maintain. Beyond empirical comparisons, we analyze embedding space, showing that metadata integration improves effectiveness by increasing intra-document cohesion, reducing inter-document confusion, and widening the separation between relevant and irrelevant chunks. Field-level ablations show that structural cues provide strong disambiguating signals. Our code, evaluation framework, and the RAGMATE-10K dataset are publicly hosted.</description>

      <title>Cultural Analytics for Good: Building Inclusive Evaluation Frameworks for Historical IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work bridges the fields of information retrieval and cultural analytics to support equitable access to historical knowledge. Using the British Library BL19 digital collection (more than 35,000 works from 1700-1899), we construct a benchmark for studying changes in language, terminology and retrieval in the 19th-century fiction and non-fiction. Our approach combines expert-driven query design, paragraph-level relevance annotation, and Large Language Model (LLM) assistance to create a scalable evaluation framework grounded in human expertise. We focus on knowledge transfer from fiction to non-fiction, investigating how narrative understanding and semantic richness in fiction can improve retrieval for scholarly and factual materials. This interdisciplinary framework not only improves retrieval accuracy but also fosters interpretability, transparency, and cultural inclusivity in digital archives. Our work provides both practical evaluation resources and a methodological paradigm for developing retrieval systems that support richer, historically aware engagement with digital archives, ultimately working towards more emancipatory knowledge infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Agentic-R: Learning to Retrieve for Agentic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agentic search has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm, where an agent interleaves multi-step reasoning with on-demand retrieval to solve complex questions. Despite its success, how to design a retriever for agentic search remains largely underexplored. Existing search agents typically rely on similarity-based retrievers, while similar passages are not always useful for final answer generation. In this paper, we propose a novel retriever training framework tailored for agentic search. Unlike retrievers designed for single-turn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that only rely on local passage utility, we propose to use both local query-passage relevance and global answer correctness to measure passage utility in a multi-turn agentic search. We further introduce an iterative training strategy, where the search agent and the retriever are optimized bidirectionally and iteratively. Different from RAG retrievers that are only trained once with fixed questions, our retriever is continuously improved using evolving and higher-quality queries from the agent. Extensive experiments on seven single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that our retriever, termed \ours{}, consistently outperforms strong baselines across different search agents. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/8421BCD/Agentic-R.</description>

      <title>Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model with Text-Enhanced Pre-training for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems excel at capturing users' dynamic preferences by leveraging their interaction histories. Most existing SR systems assign a single embedding vector to each item to represent its features, adopting various models to combine these embeddings into a sequence representation that captures user intent. However, we argue that this representation alone is insufficient to capture an item's multi-faceted nature (e.g., movie genres, starring actors). Furthermore, users often exhibit complex and varied preferences within these facets (e.g., liking both action and musical films within the genre facet), which are challenging to fully represent with static identifiers. To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture titled Facet-Aware Multi-Head Mixture-of-Experts Model for Sequential Recommendation (FAME). We leverage sub-embeddings from each head in the final multi-head attention layer to predict the next item separately, effectively capturing distinct item facets. A gating mechanism then integrates these predictions by dynamically determining their importance. Additionally, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network within each attention head to disentangle varied user preferences within each facet, utilizing a learnable router network to aggregate expert outputs based on context. Complementing this architecture, we design a Text-Enhanced Facet-Aware Pre-training module to overcome the limitations of randomly initialized embeddings. By utilizing a pre-trained text encoder and employing an alternating supervised contrastive learning objective, we explicitly disentangle facet-specific features from textual metadata (e.g., descriptions) before sequential training begins. This ensures that the item embeddings are semantically robust and aligned with the downstream multi-facet framework.</description>

      <title>Information Farming: From Berry Picking to Berry Growing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic paradigms of Berry Picking and Information Foraging Theory have framed users as gatherers, opportunistically searching across distributed sources to satisfy evolving information needs. However, the rise of GenAI is driving a fundamental transformation in how people produce, structure, and reuse information - one that these paradigms no longer fully capture. This transformation is analogous to the Neolithic Revolution, when societies shifted from hunting and gathering to cultivation. Generative technologies empower users to "farm" information by planting seeds in the form of prompts, cultivating workflows over time, and harvesting richly structured, relevant yields within their own plots, rather than foraging across others people's patches. In this perspectives paper, we introduce the notion of Information Farming as a conceptual framework and argue that it represents a natural evolution in how people engage with information. Drawing on historical analogy and empirical evidence, we examine the benefits and opportunities of information farming, its implications for design and evaluation, and the accompanying risks posed by this transition. We hypothesize that as GenAI technologies proliferate, cultivating information will increasingly supplant transient, patch-based foraging as a dominant mode of engagement, marking a broader shift in human-information interaction and its study.</description>

      <title>HyFormer: Revisiting the Roles of Sequence Modeling and Feature Interaction in CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial large-scale recommendation models (LRMs) face the challenge of jointly modeling long-range user behavior sequences and heterogeneous non-sequential features under strict efficiency constraints. However, most existing architectures employ a decoupled pipeline: long sequences are first compressed with a query-token based sequence compressor like LONGER, followed by fusion with dense features through token-mixing modules like RankMixer, which thereby limits both the representation capacity and the interaction flexibility. This paper presents HyFormer, a unified hybrid transformer architecture that tightly integrates long-sequence modeling and feature interaction into a single backbone. From the perspective of sequence modeling, we revisit and redesign query tokens in LRMs, and frame the LRM modeling task as an alternating optimization process that integrates two core components: Query Decoding which expands non-sequential features into Global Tokens and performs long sequence decoding over layer-wise key-value representations of long behavioral sequences; and Query Boosting which enhances cross-query and cross-sequence heterogeneous interactions via efficient token mixing. The two complementary mechanisms are performed iteratively to refine semantic representations across layers. Extensive experiments on billion-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that HyFormer consistently outperforms strong LONGER and RankMixer baselines under comparable parameter and FLOPs budgets, while exhibiting superior scaling behavior with increasing parameters and FLOPs. Large-scale online A/B tests in high-traffic production systems further validate its effectiveness, showing significant gains over deployed state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the practicality and scalability of HyFormer as a unified modeling framework for industrial LRMs.</description>

      <title>The Unfairness of Multifactorial Bias in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popularity bias and positivity bias are two prominent sources of bias in recommender systems. Both arise from input data, propagate through recommendation models, and lead to unfair or suboptimal outcomes. Popularity bias occurs when a small subset of items receives most interactions, while positivity bias stems from the over-representation of high rating values. Although each bias has been studied independently, their combined effect, to which we refer to as multifactorial bias, remains underexplored. In this work, we examine how multifactorial bias influences item-side fairness, focusing on exposure bias, which reflects the unequal visibility of items in recommendation outputs. Through simulation studies, we find that positivity bias is disproportionately concentrated on popular items, further amplifying their over-exposure. Motivated by this insight, we adapt a percentile-based rating transformation as a pre-processing strategy to mitigate multifactorial bias. Experiments using six recommendation algorithms across four public datasets show that this approach improves exposure fairness with negligible accuracy loss. We also demonstrate that integrating this pre-processing step into post-processing fairness pipelines enhances their effectiveness and efficiency, enabling comparable or better fairness with reduced computational cost. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multifactorial bias and demonstrate the practical value of simple, data-driven pre-processing methods for improving fairness in recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Rules, Resources, and Restrictions: A Taxonomy of Task-Based Information Request Intents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and classifying query intents can improve retrieval effectiveness by helping align search results with the motivations behind user queries. However, existing intent taxonomies are typically derived from system log data and capture mostly isolated information needs, while the broader task context often remains unaddressed. This limitation becomes increasingly relevant as interactions with Large Language Models (LLMs) expand user expectations from simple query answering toward comprehensive task support, for example, with purchasing decisions or in travel planning. At the same time, current LLMs still struggle to fully interpret complex and multifaceted tasks. To address this gap, we argue for a stronger task-based perspective on query intent. Drawing on a grounded-theory-based interview study with airport information clerks, we present a taxonomy of task-based information request intents that bridges the gap between traditional query-focused approaches and the emerging demands of AI-driven task-oriented search.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Q&amp;A Nuggets into Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAGE systems integrate ideas from automatic evaluation (E) into Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG). As one such example, we present Crucible, a Nugget-Augmented Generation System that preserves explicit citation provenance by constructing a bank of Q&amp;A nuggets from retrieved documents and uses them to guide extraction, selection, and report generation. Reasoning on nuggets avoids repeated information through clear and interpretable Q&amp;A semantics - instead of opaque cluster abstractions - while maintaining citation provenance throughout the entire generation process. Evaluated on the TREC NeuCLIR 2024 collection, our Crucible system substantially outperforms Ginger, a recent nugget-based RAG system, in nugget recall, density, and citation grounding.</description>

      <title>Insider Knowledge: How Much Can RAG Systems Gain from Evaluation Secrets?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAG systems are increasingly evaluated and optimized using LLM judges, an approach that is rapidly becoming the dominant paradigm for system assessment. Nugget-based approaches in particular are now embedded not only in evaluation frameworks but also in the architectures of RAG systems themselves. While this integration can lead to genuine improvements, it also creates a risk of faulty measurements due to circularity. In this paper, we investigate this risk through comparative experiments with nugget-based RAG systems, including Ginger and Crucible, against strong baselines such as GPT-Researcher. By deliberately modifying Crucible to generate outputs optimized for an LLM judge, we show that near-perfect evaluation scores can be achieved when elements of the evaluation - such as prompt templates or gold nuggets - are leaked or can be predicted. Our results highlight the importance of blind evaluation settings and methodological diversity to guard against mistaking metric overfitting for genuine system progress.</description>

      <title>Integrating Vision-Centric Text Understanding for Conversational Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) have attracted growing attention for their ability to deliver personalized recommendations through natural language interactions. To more accurately infer user preferences from multi-turn conversations, recent works increasingly expand conversational context (e.g., by incorporating diverse entity information or retrieving related dialogues). While such context enrichment can assist preference modeling, it also introduces longer and more heterogeneous inputs, leading to practical issues such as input length constraints, text style inconsistency, and irrelevant textual noise, thereby raising the demand for stronger language understanding ability. In this paper, we propose STARCRS, a Screen-Text-AwaRe Conversational Recommender System that integrates two complementary text understanding modes: (1) a screen-reading pathway that encodes auxiliary textual information as visual tokens, mimicking skim reading on a screen, and (2) an LLM-based textual pathway that focuses on a limited set of critical content for fine-grained reasoning. We design a knowledge-anchored fusion framework that combines contrastive alignment, cross-attention interaction, and adaptive gating to integrate the two modes for improved preference modeling and response generation. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that STARCRS consistently improves both recommendation accuracy and generated response quality.</description>

      <title>More Than Efficiency: Embedding Compression Improves Domain Adaptation in Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense retrievers powered by pretrained embeddings are widely used for document retrieval but struggle in specialized domains due to the mismatches between the training and target domain distributions. Domain adaptation typically requires costly annotation and retraining of query-document pairs. In this work, we revisit an overlooked alternative: applying PCA to domain embeddings to derive lower-dimensional representations that preserve domain-relevant features while discarding non-discriminative components. Though traditionally used for efficiency, we demonstrate that this simple embedding compression can effectively improve retrieval performance. Evaluated across 9 retrievers and 14 MTEB datasets, PCA applied solely to query embeddings improves NDCG@10 in 75.4% of model-dataset pairs, offering a simple and lightweight method for domain adaptation.</description>

For the success of these platforms, it is crucial to design reciprocal recommender systems (RRSs) that not only increase the total number of matches but also avoid creating unfairness among users. In this paper, we investigate the fairness of RRSs on matching platforms. From the perspective of fair division, we define the users' opportunities to be recommended and establish the fairness concept of envy-freeness in the allocation of these opportunities. We first introduce the Social Welfare (SW) method, which approximately maximizes the number of matches, and show that it leads to significant unfairness in recommendation opportunities, illustrating the trade-off between fairness and match rates. To address this challenge, we propose the Nash Social Welfare (NSW) method, which alternately optimizes two NSW functions and achieves nearly envy-free recommendations. We further generalize the SW and NSW method to the $\alpha$-SW method, which balances the trade-off between fairness and high match rates. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient approximation algorithm for the SW/NSW/$\alpha$-SW methods based on the Sinkhorn algorithm. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>QKVQA: Question-Focused Filtering for Knowledge-based VQA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13856v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) aims to answer questions by integrating images with external knowledge. Effective knowledge filtering is crucial for improving accuracy. Typical filtering methods use similarity metrics to locate relevant article sections from one article, leading to information selection errors at the article and intra-article levels. Although recent explorations of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based filtering methods demonstrate superior semantic understanding and cross-article filtering capabilities, their high computational cost limits practical application. To address these issues, this paper proposes a question-focused filtering method. This approach can perform question-focused, cross-article filtering, efficiently obtaining high-quality filtered knowledge while keeping computational costs comparable to typical methods. Specifically, we design a trainable Question-Focused Filter (QFF) and a Chunk-based Dynamic Multi-Article Selection (CDA) module, which collectively alleviate information selection errors at both the article and intra-article levels. Experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art models by 4.9% on E-VQA and 3.8% on InfoSeek, validating its effectiveness.

      <title>IF-GEO: Conflict-Aware Instruction Fusion for Multi-Query Generative Engine Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As Generative Engines revolutionize information retrieval by synthesizing direct answers from retrieved sources, ensuring source visibility becomes a significant challenge. Improving it through targeted content revisions is a practical strategy termed Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). However, optimizing a document for diverse queries presents a constrained optimization challenge where heterogeneous queries often impose conflicting and competing revision requirements under a limited content budget. To address this challenge, we propose IF-GEO, a "diverge-then-converge" framework comprising two phases: (i) mining distinct optimization preferences from representative latent queries; (ii) synthesizing a Global Revision Blueprint for guided editing by coordinating preferences via conflict-aware instruction fusion. To explicitly quantify IF-GEO's objective of cross-query stability, we introduce risk-aware stability metrics. Experiments on multi-query benchmarks demonstrate that IF-GEO achieves substantial performance gains while maintaining robustness across diverse retrieval scenarios.</description>

      <title>Auditory Brain Passage Retrieval: Cross-Sensory EEG Training for Neural Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Query formulation from internal information needs remains fundamentally challenging across all Information Retrieval paradigms due to cognitive complexity and physical impairments. Brain Passage Retrieval (BPR) addresses this by directly mapping EEG signals to passage representations without intermediate text translation. However, existing BPR research exclusively uses visual stimuli, leaving critical questions unanswered: Can auditory EEG enable effective retrieval for voice-based interfaces and visually impaired users? Can training on combined EEG datasets from different sensory modalities improve performance despite severe data scarcity? We present the first systematic investigation of auditory EEG for BPR and evaluate cross-sensory training benefits. Using dual encoder architectures with four pooling strategies (CLS, mean, max, multi-vector), we conduct controlled experiments comparing auditory-only, visual-only, and combined training on the Alice (auditory) and Nieuwland (visual) datasets. Results demonstrate that auditory EEG consistently outperforms visual EEG, and cross-sensory training with CLS pooling achieves substantial improvements over individual training: 31% in MRR (0.474), 43% in Hit@1 (0.314), and 28% in Hit@10 (0.858). Critically, combined auditory EEG models surpass BM25 text baselines (MRR: 0.474 vs 0.428), establishing neural queries as competitive with traditional retrieval whilst enabling accessible interfaces. These findings validate auditory neural interfaces for IR tasks and demonstrate that cross-sensory training addresses data scarcity whilst outperforming single-modality approaches Code: https://github.com/NiallMcguire/Audio_BPR</description>

      <title>Rerank Before You Reason: Analyzing Reranking Tradeoffs through Effective Token Cost in Deep Search Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep research agents rely on iterative retrieval and reasoning to answer complex queries, but scaling test-time computation raises significant efficiency concerns. We study how to allocate reasoning budget in deep search pipelines, focusing on the role of listwise reranking. Using the BrowseComp-Plus benchmark, we analyze tradeoffs between model scale, reasoning effort, reranking depth, and total token cost via a novel effective token cost (ETC) metric. Our results show that reranking consistently improves retrieval and end-to-end accuracy, and that moderate reranking often yields larger gains than increasing search-time reasoning, achieving comparable accuracy at substantially lower cost.

      <title>XR: Cross-Modal Agents for Composed Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval is being redefined by agentic AI, demanding multimodal reasoning beyond conventional similarity-based paradigms. Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) exemplifies this shift as each query combines a reference image with textual modifications, requiring compositional understanding across modalities. While embedding-based CIR methods have achieved progress, they remain narrow in perspective, capturing limited cross-modal cues and lacking semantic reasoning. To address these limitations, we introduce XR, a training-free multi-agent framework that reframes retrieval as a progressively coordinated reasoning process. It orchestrates three specialized types of agents: imagination agents synthesize target representations through cross-modal generation, similarity agents perform coarse filtering via hybrid matching, and question agents verify factual consistency through targeted reasoning for fine filtering. Through progressive multi-agent coordination, XR iteratively refines retrieval to meet both semantic and visual query constraints, achieving up to a 38% gain over strong training-free and training-based baselines on FashionIQ, CIRR, and CIRCO, while ablations show each agent is essential.

      <title>From HNSW to Information-Theoretic Binarization: Rethinking the Architecture of Scalable Vector Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems rely predominantly on in-memory approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) indexes over high-precision floating-point vectors, resulting in escalating operational cost and inherent trade-offs between latency, throughput, and retrieval accuracy. This paper analyzes the architectural limitations of the dominant "HNSW + float32 + cosine similarity" stack and evaluates existing cost-reduction strategies, including storage disaggregation and lossy vector quantization, which inevitably sacrifice either performance or accuracy. We introduce and empirically evaluate an alternative information-theoretic architecture based on maximally informative binarization (MIB), efficient bitwise distance metrics, and an information-theoretic scoring (ITS) mechanism. Unlike conventional ANN systems, this approach enables exhaustive search over compact binary representations, allowing deterministic retrieval and eliminating accuracy degradation under high query concurrency. Using the MAIR benchmark across 14 datasets and 10,038 queries, we compare this architecture against Elasticsearch, Pinecone, PGVector, and Qdrant. Results demonstrate retrieval quality comparable to full-precision systems, while achieving substantially lower latency and maintaining constant throughput at high request rates. We show that this architectural shift enables a truly serverless, cost-per-query deployment model, challenging the necessity of large in-memory ANN indexes for high-quality semantic search.</description>

      <title>RAC: Retrieval-Augmented Clarification for Faithful Conversational Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clarification questions help conversational search systems resolve ambiguous or underspecified user queries. While prior work has focused on fluency and alignment with user intent, especially through facet extraction, much less attention has been paid to grounding clarifications in the underlying corpus. Without such grounding, systems risk asking questions that cannot be answered from the available documents. We introduce RAC (Retrieval-Augmented Clarification), a framework for generating corpus-faithful clarification questions. After comparing several indexing strategies for retrieval, we fine-tune a large language model to make optimal use of research context and to encourage the generation of evidence-based question. We then apply contrastive preference optimization to favor questions supported by retrieved passages over ungrounded alternatives. Evaluated on four benchmarks, RAC demonstrate significant improvements over baselines. In addition to LLM-as-Judge assessments, we introduce novel metrics derived from NLI and data-to-text to assess how well questions are anchored in the context, and we demonstrate that our approach consistently enhances faithfulness.</description>

      <title>GPU-Resident Inverted File Index for Streaming Vector Databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector search has emerged as the computational backbone of modern AI infrastructure, powering critical systems ranging from Vector Databases to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). While the GPU-accelerated Inverted File (IVF) index acts as one of the most widely used techniques for these large-scale workloads due to its memory efficiency, its traditional architecture remains fundamentally static. Existing designs rely on rigid and contiguous memory layouts that lack native support for in-place mutation, creating a severe bottleneck for streaming scenarios. In applications requiring real-time knowledge updates, such as live recommendation engines or dynamic RAG systems, maintaining index freshness necessitates expensive CPU-GPU roundtrips that cause system latency to spike from milliseconds to seconds. In this paper, we propose SIVF (Streaming Inverted File), a new GPU-native architecture designed to empower vector databases with high-velocity data ingestion and deletion capabilities. SIVF replaces the static memory layout with a slab-based allocation system and a validity bitmap, enabling lock-free and in-place mutation directly in VRAM. We further introduce a GPU-resident address translation table (ATT) to resolve the overhead of locating vectors, providing $O(1)$ access to physical storage slots. We evaluate SIVF against the industry-standard GPU IVF implementation on the SIFT1M and GIST1M datasets. Microbenchmarks demonstrate that SIVF reduces deletion latency by up to $13,300\times$ (from 11.8 seconds to 0.89 ms on GIST1M) and improves ingestion throughput by $36\times$ to $105\times$. In end-to-end sliding window scenarios, SIVF eliminates system freezes and achieves a $161\times$ to $266\times$ speedup with single-digit millisecond latency. Notably, this performance incurs negligible storage penalty, maintaining less than 0.8\% memory overhead compared to static indices.</description>

      <title>AI Co-Scientist for Knowledge Synthesis in Medical Contexts: A Proof of Concept</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research waste in biomedical science is driven by redundant studies, incomplete reporting, and the limited scalability of traditional evidence synthesis workflows. We present an AI co-scientist for scalable and transparent knowledge synthesis based on explicit formalization of Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome, and Study design (PICOS). The platform integrates relational storage, vector-based semantic retrieval, and a Neo4j knowledge graph. Evaluation was conducted on dementia-sport and non-communicable disease corpora. Automated PICOS compliance and study design classification from titles and abstracts were performed using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory baseline and a transformer-based multi-task classifier fine-tuned from PubMedBERT. Full-text synthesis employed retrieval-augmented generation with hybrid vector and graph retrieval, while BERTopic was used to identify thematic structure, redundancy, and evidence gaps. The transformer model achieved 95.7% accuracy for study design classification with strong agreement against expert annotations, while the Bi-LSTM achieved 87% accuracy for PICOS compliance detection. Retrieval-augmented generation outperformed non-retrieval generation for queries requiring structured constraints, cross-study integration, and graph-based reasoning, whereas non-retrieval approaches remained competitive for high-level summaries. Topic modeling revealed substantial thematic redundancy and identified underexplored research areas. These results demonstrate that PICOS-aware and explainable natural language processing can improve the scalability, transparency, and efficiency of evidence synthesis. The proposed architecture is domain-agnostic and offers a practical framework for reducing research waste across biomedical disciplines.</description>

      <title>Learning Audio-Visual Embeddings with Inferred Latent Interaction Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning robust audio-visual embeddings requires bringing genuinely related audio and visual signals together while filtering out incidental co-occurrences - background noise, unrelated elements, or unannotated events. Most contrastive and triplet-loss methods use sparse annotated labels per clip and treat any co-occurrence as semantic similarity. For example, a video labeled "train" might also contain motorcycle audio and visual, because "motorcycle" is not the chosen annotation; standard methods treat these co-occurrences as negatives to true motorcycle anchors elsewhere, creating false negatives and missing true cross-modal dependencies. We propose a framework that leverages soft-label predictions and inferred latent interactions to address these issues: (1) Audio-Visual Semantic Alignment Loss (AV-SAL) trains a teacher network to produce aligned soft-label distributions across modalities, assigning nonzero probability to co-occurring but unannotated events and enriching the supervision signal. (2) Inferred Latent Interaction Graph (ILI) applies the GRaSP algorithm to teacher soft labels to infer a sparse, directed dependency graph among classes. This graph highlights directional dependencies (e.g., "Train (visual)" -&gt; "Motorcycle (audio)") that expose likely semantic or conditional relationships between classes; these are interpreted as estimated dependency patterns. (3) Latent Interaction Regularizer (LIR): A student network is trained with both metric loss and a regularizer guided by the ILI graph, pulling together embeddings of dependency-linked but unlabeled pairs in proportion to their soft-label probabilities. Experiments on AVE and VEGAS benchmarks show consistent improvements in mean average precision (mAP), demonstrating that integrating inferred latent interactions into embedding learning enhances robustness and semantic coherence.</description>

      <title>Don't Start Over: A Cost-Effective Framework for Migrating Personalized Prompts Between LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalization in Large Language Models (LLMs) often relies on user-specific soft prompts. However, these prompts become obsolete when the foundation model is upgraded, necessitating costly, full-scale retraining. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Prompt-level User Migration Adapter (PUMA), a lightweight framework to efficiently migrate personalized prompts across incompatible models. PUMA utilizes a parameter-efficient adapter to bridge the semantic gap, combined with a group-based user selection strategy to significantly reduce training costs. Experiments on three large-scale datasets show our method matches or even surpasses the performance of retraining from scratch, reducing computational cost by up to 98%. The framework demonstrates strong generalization across diverse model architectures and robustness in advanced scenarios like chained and aggregated migrations, offering a practical path for the sustainable evolution of personalized AI by decoupling user assets from the underlying models.</description>

      <title>Optimizing User Profiles via Contextual Bandits for Retrieval-Augmented LLM Personalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at general-purpose tasks, yet adapting their responses to individual users remains challenging. Retrieval augmentation provides a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning by conditioning LLMs on user history records, and existing approaches typically select these records based on semantic relevance. We argue that relevance serves as an unreliable proxy for utility: a record may be semantically similar to a query yet fail to improve generation quality or even degrade it due to redundancy or conflicting information. To bridge this gap, we propose PURPLE, a contextual bandit framework that oPtimizes UseR Profiles for Llm pErsonalization. In contrast to a greedy selection of the most relevant records, PURPLE treats profile construction as a set generation process and utilizes a Plackett-Luce ranking model to capture complex inter-record dependencies. By training with dense feedback provided by the likelihood of the reference response, our method aligns retrieval directly with generation quality. Extensive experiments on nine personalization tasks demonstrate that PURPLE consistently outperforms strong heuristic and retrieval-augmented baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, establishing a principled and scalable solution for optimizing user profiles.</description>

      <title>Improved Bug Localization with AI Agents Leveraging Hypothesis and Dynamic Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software bugs cost technology providers (e.g., AT&amp;T) billions annually and cause developers to spend roughly 50% of their time on bug resolution. Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance.</description>

      <title>BioPulse-QA: A Dynamic Biomedical Question-Answering Benchmark for Evaluating Factuality, Robustness, and Bias in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in biomedical settings, and existing benchmark datasets have played an important role in supporting model development and evaluation. However, these benchmarks often have limitations. Many rely on static or outdated datasets that fail to capture the dynamic, context-rich, and high-stakes nature of biomedical knowledge. They also carry increasing risk of data leakage due to overlap with model pretraining corpora and often overlook critical dimensions such as robustness to linguistic variation and potential demographic biases.
  Materials and Methods: To address these gaps, we introduce BioPulse-QA, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on answering questions from newly published biomedical documents including drug labels, trial protocols, and clinical guidelines. BioPulse-QA includes 2,280 expert-verified question answering (QA) pairs and perturbed variants, covering both extractive and abstractive formats. We evaluate four LLMs - GPT-4o, GPT-o1, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and LLaMA-3.1 8B Instruct - released prior to the publication dates of the benchmark documents.
  Results: GPT-o1 achieves the highest relaxed F1 score (0.92), followed by Gemini-2.0-Flash (0.90) on drug labels. Clinical trials are the most challenging source, with extractive F1 scores as low as 0.36.
  Discussion and Conclusion: Performance differences are larger for paraphrasing than for typographical errors, while bias testing shows negligible differences. BioPulse-QA provides a scalable and clinically relevant framework for evaluating biomedical LLMs.</description>

      <title>CORE-T: COherent REtrieval of Tables for Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic text-to-SQL workflows often require joining multiple tables. As a result, accurately retrieving the relevant set of tables becomes a key bottleneck for end-to-end performance. We study an open-book setting where queries must be answered over large, heterogeneous table collections pooled from many sources, without clean scoping signals such as database identifiers. Here, dense retrieval (DR) achieves high recall but returns many distractors, while join-aware alternatives often rely on extra assumptions and/or incur high inference overhead. We propose CORE-T, a scalable, training-free framework that enriches tables with LLM-generated purpose metadata and pre-computes a lightweight table-compatibility cache. At inference time, DR returns top-K candidates; a single LLM call selects a coherent, joinable subset, and a simple additive adjustment step restores strongly compatible tables. Across Bird, Spider, and MMQA, CORE-T improves table-selection F1 by up to 22.7 points while retrieving up to 42% fewer tables, improving multi-table execution accuracy by up to 5.0 points on Bird and 6.9 points on MMQA, and using 4-5x fewer tokens than LLM-intensive baselines.</description>

      <title>Agentic Conversational Search with Contextualized Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a popular interface for human-AI interaction, supporting information seeking and task assistance through natural, multi-turn dialogue. To respond to users within multi-turn dialogues, the context-dependent user intent evolves across interactions, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation, and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Existing studies usually follow static rewrite, retrieve, and generate pipelines, which optimize different procedures separately and overlook the mixed-initiative action optimization simultaneously. Although the recent developments in deep search agents demonstrate the effectiveness in jointly optimizing retrieval and generation via reasoning, these approaches focus on single-turn scenarios, which might lack the ability to handle multi-turn interactions. We introduce a conversational agent that interleaves search and reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned through reinforcement learning (RL) training with tailored rewards towards evolving user goals. The experimental results across four widely used conversational benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by surpassing several existing strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Long Video Understanding with Audiovisual Entity Cohesion and Agentic Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long video understanding presents significant challenges for vision-language models due to extremely long context windows. Existing solutions relying on naive chunking strategies with retrieval-augmented generation, typically suffer from information fragmentation and a loss of global coherence. We present HAVEN, a unified framework for long-video understanding that enables coherent and comprehensive reasoning by integrating audiovisual entity cohesion and hierarchical video indexing with agentic search. First, we preserve semantic consistency by integrating entity-level representations across visual and auditory streams, while organizing content into a structured hierarchy spanning global summary, scene, segment, and entity levels. Then we employ an agentic search mechanism to enable dynamic retrieval and reasoning across these layers, facilitating coherent narrative reconstruction and fine-grained entity tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves good temporal coherence, entity consistency, and retrieval efficiency, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an overall accuracy of 84.1% on LVBench. Notably, it achieves outstanding performance in the challenging reasoning category, reaching 80.1%. These results highlight the effectiveness of structured, multimodal reasoning for comprehensive and context-consistent understanding of long-form videos.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Negation Modeling in Joint Audio-Text Models for Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint audio-text models are widely used for music retrieval, yet they struggle with semantic phenomena such as negation. Negation is fundamental for distinguishing the absence (or presence) of musical elements (e.g., "with vocals" vs. "without vocals"), but current systems fail to represent this reliably. In this work, we investigate and mitigate this limitation by training CLAP models from scratch on the Million Song Dataset with LP-MusicCaps-MSD captions. We introduce negation through text augmentation and a dissimilarity-based contrastive loss, designed to explicitly separate original and negated captions in the joint embedding space. To evaluate progress, we propose two protocols that frame negation modeling as retrieval and binary classification tasks. Experiments demonstrate that both methods, individually and combined, improve negation handling while largely preserving retrieval performance.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Knowledge Graph Exploration with Adaptive Breadth-Depth Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieving evidence for language model queries from knowledge graphs requires balancing broad search across the graph with multi-hop traversal to follow relational links. Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Analysis of Chunking Strategies for Reliable Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how document chunking choices impact the reliability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in industry. While practice often relies on heuristics, our end-to-end evaluation on Natural Questions systematically varies chunking method (token, sentence, semantic, code), chunk size, overlap, and context length. We use a standard industrial setup: SPLADE retrieval and a Mistral-8B generator. We derive actionable lessons for cost-efficient deployment: (i) overlap provides no measurable benefit and increases indexing cost; (ii) sentence chunking is the most cost-effective method, matching semantic chunking up to ~5k tokens; (iii) a "context cliff" reduces quality beyond ~2.5k tokens; and (iv) optimal context depends on the goal (semantic quality peaks at small contexts; exact match at larger ones).</description>

      <title>ReSearch: A Multi-Stage Machine Learning Framework for Earth Science Data Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Earth Science data from satellite observations, reanalysis products, and numerical simulations has created a critical bottleneck in scientific discovery, namely identifying relevant datasets for a given research objective.
  Existing discovery systems are primarily retrieval-centric and struggle to bridge the gap between high-level scientific intent and heterogeneous metadata at scale.
  We introduce \textbf{ReSearch}, a multi-stage, reasoning-enhanced search framework that formulates Earth Science data discovery as an iterative process of intent interpretation, high-recall retrieval, and context-aware ranking.
  ReSearch integrates lexical search, semantic embeddings, abbreviation expansion, and large language model reranking within a unified architecture that explicitly separates recall and precision objectives.
  To enable realistic evaluation, we construct a literature-grounded benchmark by aligning natural language intent with datasets cited in peer-reviewed Earth Science studies.
  Experiments demonstrate that ReSearch consistently improves recall and ranking performance over baseline methods, particularly for task-based queries expressing abstract scientific goals.
  These results underscore the importance of intent-aware, multi-stage search as a foundational capability for reproducible and scalable Earth Science research.</description>

      <title>Integrating Large Language Models into Recommendation via Mutual Augmentation and Adaptive Aggregation</title>

Abstract: Conventional recommendation methods have achieved notable advancements by harnessing collaborative or sequential information from user behavior. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence for their capabilities in understanding and reasoning over textual semantics, and have found utility in various domains, including recommendation. Conventional recommendation methods and LLMs each have their strengths and weaknesses. While conventional methods excel at mining collaborative information and modeling sequential behavior, they struggle with data sparsity and the long-tail problem. LLMs, on the other hand, are proficient at utilizing rich textual contexts but face challenges in mining collaborative or sequential information. Despite their individual successes, there is a significant gap in leveraging their combined potential to enhance recommendation performance.
  In this paper, we introduce a general and model-agnostic framework known as \textbf{L}arge \textbf{la}nguage model with \textbf{m}utual augmentation and \textbf{a}daptive aggregation for \textbf{Rec}ommendation (\textbf{Llama4Rec}). Llama4Rec synergistically combines conventional and LLM-based recommendation models. Llama4Rec proposes data augmentation and prompt augmentation strategies tailored to enhance the conventional model and LLM respectively. An adaptive aggregation module is adopted to combine the predictions of both kinds of models to refine the final recommendation results. Empirical studies on three real-world datasets validate the superiority of Llama4Rec, demonstrating its consistent outperformance of baseline methods and significant improvements in recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>Unveiling and Mitigating Bias in Large Language Model Recommendations: A Path to Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based recommendation systems excel in delivering comprehensive suggestions by deeply analyzing content and user behavior. However, they often inherit biases from skewed training data, favoring mainstream content while underrepresenting diverse or non-traditional options. This study explores the interplay between bias and LLM-based recommendation systems, focusing on music, song, and book recommendations across diverse demographic and cultural groups. This paper analyzes bias in LLM-based recommendation systems across multiple models (GPT, LLaMA, and Gemini), revealing its deep and pervasive impact on outcomes. Intersecting identities and contextual factors, like socioeconomic status, further amplify biases, complicating fair recommendations across diverse groups. Our findings reveal that bias in these systems is deeply ingrained, yet even simple interventions like prompt engineering can significantly reduce it. We further propose a retrieval-augmented generation strategy to mitigate bias more effectively. Numerical experiments validate these strategies, demonstrating both the pervasive nature of bias and the impact of the proposed solutions.</description>

      <title>LLM-based relevance assessment still can't replace human relevance assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for relevance assessment in information retrieval has gained significant attention, with recent studies suggesting that LLM-based judgments provide comparable evaluations to human judgments. Notably, based on TREC 2024 data, Upadhyay et al make a bold claim that LLM-based relevance assessments, such as those generated by the Umbrela system, can fully replace traditional human relevance assessments in TREC-style evaluations. This paper critically examines this claim, highlighting practical and theoretical limitations that undermine the validity of this conclusion.
  First, we question whether the evidence provided by Upadhyay et al. genuinely supports their claim, particularly when the test collection is intended to serve as a benchmark for future research innovations.Second, we submit a system deliberately crafted to exploit automatic evaluation metrics, demonstrating that it can achieve artificially inflated scores without truly improving retrieval quality. Third, we simulate the consequences of circularity by analyzing Kendall's tau correlations under the hypothetical scenario in which all systems adopt Umbrela as a final-stage re-ranker, illustrating how reliance on LLM-based assessments can distort system rankings. Theoretical challenges - including the inherent narcissism of LLMs, the risk of overfitting to LLM-based metrics, and the potential degradation of future LLM performance - that must be addressed before LLM-based relevance assessments can be considered a viable replacement for human judgments.</description>

      <title>Hard Negative Sampling via Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hard negative sampling improves recommendation performance by accelerating convergence and sharpening the decision boundary. However, most existing methods rely on heuristic strategies, selecting negatives from a fixed candidate pool. Lacking semantic awareness, these methods often misclassify items that align with users' semantic interests as negatives, resulting in False Hard Negative Samples (FHNS). Such FHNS inject noisy supervision and hinder the model's optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose HNLMRec, a generative semantic negative sampling framework. Leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), HNLMRec directly generates negative samples that are behaviorally distinct yet semantically relevant with respect to user preferences. Furthermore, we integrate collaborative filtering signals into the LLM via supervised fine-tuning, guiding the model to synthesize more reliable and informative hard negatives. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that HNLMRec significantly outperforms traditional methods and LLM-enhanced baselines, while effectively mitigating popularity bias and data sparsity, thereby improving generalization.</description>

      <title>On the Costs and Benefits of Learned Indexing for Dynamic High-Dimensional Data: Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main challenges within the growing research area of learned indexing is the lack of adaptability to dynamically expanding datasets. This paper explores the dynamization of a static learned index for complex data through operations such as node splitting and broadening, enabling efficient adaptation to new data. Furthermore, we evaluate the trade-offs between static and dynamic approaches by introducing an amortized cost model to assess query performance in tandem with the build costs of the index structure, enabling experimental determination of when a dynamic learned index outperforms its static counterpart. We apply the dynamization method to a static learned index and demonstrate that its superior scaling quickly surpasses the static implementation in terms of overall costs as the database grows. This is an extended version of the paper presented at DAWAK 2025.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization for LLM-based User Simulators in Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12645v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled realistic user simulators for developing and evaluating recommender systems (RSs). However, existing LLM-based simulators for RSs face two major limitations: (1) static and single-step prompt-based inference that leads to inaccurate and incomplete user profile construction; (2) unrealistic and single-round recommendation-feedback interaction pattern that fails to capture real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose DGDPO (Diagnostic-Guided Dynamic Profile Optimization), a novel framework that constructs user profile through a dynamic and iterative optimization process to enhance the simulation fidelity. Specifically, DGDPO incorporates two core modules within each optimization loop: firstly, a specialized LLM-based diagnostic module, calibrated through our novel training strategy, accurately identifies specific defects in the user profile. Subsequently, a generalized LLM-based treatment module analyzes the diagnosed defect and generates targeted suggestions to refine the profile. Furthermore, unlike existing LLM-based user simulators that are limited to single-round interactions, we are the first to integrate DGDPO with sequential recommenders, enabling a bidirectional evolution where user profiles and recommendation strategies adapt to each other over multi-round interactions. Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>LIME: Link-based user-item Interaction Modeling with decoupled xor attention for Efficient test time scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling large recommendation systems requires advancing three major frontiers: processing longer user histories, expanding candidate sets, and increasing model capacity. While promising, transformers' computational cost scales quadratically with the user sequence length and linearly with the number of candidates. This trade-off makes it prohibitively expensive to expand candidate sets or increase sequence length at inference, despite the significant performance improvements.
  We introduce \textbf{LIME}, a novel architecture that resolves this trade-off. Through two key innovations, LIME fundamentally reduces computational complexity. First, low-rank ``link embeddings" enable pre-computation of attention weights by decoupling user and candidate interactions, making the inference cost nearly independent of candidate set size. Second, a linear attention mechanism, \textbf{LIME-XOR}, reduces the complexity with respect to user sequence length from quadratic ($O(N^2)$) to linear ($O(N)$).
  Experiments on public and industrial datasets show LIME achieves near-parity with state-of-the-art transformers but with a 10$\times$ inference speedup on large candidate sets or long sequence lengths. When tested on a major recommendation platform, LIME improved user engagement while maintaining minimal inference costs with respect to candidate set size and user history length, establishing a new paradigm for efficient and expressive recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Deep Neural Networks for Modern Recommendation Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a requirement-oriented benchmark of seven deep neural architectures, CNN, RNN, GNN, Autoencoder, Transformer, Neural Collaborative Filtering, and Siamese Networks, across three real-world datasets: Retail E-commerce, Amazon Products, and Netflix Prize. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison aligned with the evolving demands of modern recommendation systems, we adopt a Requirement-Oriented Benchmarking (ROB) framework that structures evaluation around predictive accuracy, recommendation diversity, relational awareness, temporal dynamics, and computational efficiency. Under a unified evaluation protocol, models are assessed using standard accuracy-oriented metrics alongside diversity and efficiency indicators. Experimental results show that different architectures exhibit complementary strengths across requirements, motivating the use of hybrid and ensemble designs. The findings provide practical guidance for selecting and combining neural architectures to better satisfy multi-objective recommendation system requirements.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization of Hierarchical Identifiers for Generative Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SEATER is a generative retrieval model that improves recommendation inference efficiency and retrieval quality by utilizing balanced tree-structured item identifiers and contrastive training objectives. We reproduce and validate SEATER's reported improvements in retrieval quality over strong baselines across all datasets from the original work, and extend the evaluation to Yambda, a large-scale music recommendation dataset. Our experiments verify SEATER's strong performance, but show that its tree construction step during training becomes a major bottleneck as the number of items grows. To address this, we implement and evaluate two alternative construction algorithms: a greedy method optimized for minimal build time, and a hybrid method that combines greedy clustering at high levels with more precise grouping at lower levels. The greedy method reduces tree construction time to less than 2% of the original with only a minor drop in quality on the dataset with the largest item collection. The hybrid method achieves retrieval quality on par with the original, and even improves on the largest dataset, while cutting construction time to just 5-8%. All data and code are publicly available for full reproducibility at https://github.com/joshrosie/re-seater.</description>

      <title>OpenNovelty: An LLM-powered Agentic System for Verifiable Scholarly Novelty Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evaluating novelty is critical yet challenging in peer review, as reviewers must assess submissions against a vast, rapidly evolving literature. This report presents OpenNovelty, an LLM-powered agentic system for transparent, evidence-based novelty analysis. The system operates through four phases: (1) extracting the core task and contribution claims to generate retrieval queries; (2) retrieving relevant prior work based on extracted queries via semantic search engine; (3) constructing a hierarchical taxonomy of core-task-related work and performing contribution-level full-text comparisons against each contribution; and (4) synthesizing all analyses into a structured novelty report with explicit citations and evidence snippets. Unlike naive LLM-based approaches, \textsc{OpenNovelty} grounds all assessments in retrieved real papers, ensuring verifiable judgments. We deploy our system on 500+ ICLR 2026 submissions with all reports publicly available on our website, and preliminary analysis suggests it can identify relevant prior work, including closely related papers that authors may overlook. OpenNovelty aims to empower the research community with a scalable tool that promotes fair, consistent, and evidence-backed peer review.</description>

      <title>MemRec: Collaborative Memory-Augmented Agentic Recommender System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of recommender systems has shifted preference storage from rating matrices and dense embeddings to semantic memory in the agentic era. Yet existing agents rely on isolated memory, overlooking crucial collaborative signals. Bridging this gap is hindered by the dual challenges of distilling vast graph contexts without overwhelming reasoning agents with cognitive load, and evolving the collaborative memory efficiently without incurring prohibitive computational costs. To address this, we propose MemRec, a framework that architecturally decouples reasoning from memory management to enable efficient collaborative augmentation. MemRec introduces a dedicated, cost-effective LM_Mem to manage a dynamic collaborative memory graph, serving synthesized, high-signal context to a downstream LLM_Rec. The framework operates via a practical pipeline featuring efficient retrieval and cost-effective asynchronous graph propagation that evolves memory in the background. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that MemRec achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, architectural analysis confirms its flexibility, establishing a new Pareto frontier that balances reasoning quality, cost, and privacy through support for diverse deployments, including local open-source models.

      <title>LLMs Meet Isolation Kernel: Lightweight, Learning-free Binary Embeddings for Fast Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently enabled remarkable progress in text representation. However, their embeddings are typically high-dimensional, leading to substantial storage and retrieval overhead. Although recent approaches such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) and Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) alleviate these issues to some extent, they still suffer from retrieval accuracy degradation. This paper proposes \emph{Isolation Kernel Embedding} or IKE, a learning-free method that transforms an LLM embedding into a binary embedding using Isolation Kernel (IK). IKE is an ensemble of diverse (random) partitions, enabling robust estimation of ideal kernel in the LLM embedding space, thus reducing retrieval accuracy loss as the ensemble grows. Lightweight and based on binary encoding, it offers low memory footprint and fast bitwise computation, lowering retrieval latency. Experiments on multiple text retrieval datasets demonstrate that IKE offers up to 16.7x faster retrieval and 16x lower memory usage than LLM embeddings, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. Compared to CSR and other compression methods, IKE consistently achieves the best balance between retrieval efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Bridging Semantic Understanding and Popularity Bias with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic understanding of popularity bias is a crucial yet underexplored challenge in recommender systems, where popular items are often favored at the expense of niche content. Most existing debiasing methods treat the semantic understanding of popularity bias as a matter of diversity enhancement or long-tail coverage, neglecting the deeper semantic layer that embodies the causal origins of the bias itself. Consequently, such shallow interpretations limit both their debiasing effectiveness and recommendation accuracy. In this paper, we propose FairLRM, a novel framework that bridges the gap in the semantic understanding of popularity bias with Recommendation via Large Language Model (RecLLM). FairLRM decomposes popularity bias into item-side and user-side components, using structured instruction-based prompts to enhance the model's comprehension of both global item distributions and individual user preferences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on surface-level features such as "diversity" or "debiasing", FairLRM improves the model's ability to semantically interpret and address the underlying bias. Through empirical evaluation, we show that FairLRM significantly enhances both fairness and recommendation accuracy, providing a more semantically aware and trustworthy approach to enhance the semantic understanding of popularity bias. The implementation is available at https://github.com/LuoRenqiang/FairLRM.</description>

      <title>Deep GraphRAG: A Balanced Approach to Hierarchical Retrieval and Adaptive Integration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) frameworks face a trade-off between the comprehensiveness of global search and the efficiency of local search. Existing methods are often challenged by navigating large-scale hierarchical graphs, optimizing retrieval paths, and balancing exploration-exploitation dynamics, frequently lacking robust multi-stage re-ranking. To overcome these deficits, we propose Deep GraphRAG, a framework designed for a balanced approach to hierarchical retrieval and adaptive integration. It introduces a hierarchical global-to-local retrieval strategy that integrates macroscopic inter-community and microscopic intra-community contextual relations. This strategy employs a three-stage process: (1) inter-community filtering, which prunes the search space using local context; (2) community-level refinement, which prioritizes relevant subgraphs via entity-interaction analysis; and (3) entity-level fine-grained search within target communities. A beam search-optimized dynamic re-ranking module guides this process, continuously filtering candidates to balance efficiency and global comprehensiveness. Deep GraphRAG also features a Knowledge Integration Module leveraging a compact LLM, trained with Dynamic Weighting Reward GRPO (DW-GRPO). This novel reinforcement learning approach dynamically adjusts reward weights to balance three key objectives: relevance, faithfulness, and conciseness. This training enables compact models (1.5B) to approach the performance of large models (70B) in the integration task. Evaluations on Natural Questions and HotpotQA demonstrate that Deep GraphRAG significantly outperforms baseline graph retrieval methods in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Graceful forgetting: Memory as a process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11105v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rational framework is proposed to explain how we accommodate unbounded sensory input within bounded memory. According to this framework, memory is stored as a statistic-like representation that is repeatedly summarized and compressed to make room for new input. Summarization of sensory input must be rapid; that of abstract trace might be slower and more deliberative, drawing on elaborative processes some of which might occasionally reach consciousness (as in mind-wandering). Short-term sensory traces are summarized as simple statistics organized into structures such as a time series, graph or dictionary, and longer-term abstract traces as more complex statistic-like structures. Summarization at multiple time scales requires an intensive process of memory curation which might account for the high metabolic consumption of the brain at rest. Summarization may be guided by heuristics to help choose which statistics to apply at each step, so that the trace is useful for a wide range of future needs, the objective being to "represent the past" rather than tune for a specific task. However, the choice of statistics (or of heuristics to guide that choice) is a potential target for learning, possibly over long-term scales of development or evolution. The framework is intended as an aid to make sense of our extensive empirical and theoretical knowledge of memory and bring us closer to understanding it in functional and mechanistic terms.</description>

      <title>Worse than Zero-shot? A Fact-Checking Dataset for Evaluating the Robustness of RAG Against Misleading Retrievals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16101v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has shown impressive capabilities in mitigating hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs struggle to maintain consistent reasoning when exposed to misleading or conflicting evidence, especially in real-world domains such as politics, where information is polarized or selectively framed. Mainstream RAG benchmarks evaluate models under clean retrieval settings, where systems generate answers from gold-standard documents, or under synthetically perturbed settings, where documents are artificially injected with noise. These assumptions fail to reflect real-world conditions, often leading to an overestimation of RAG system performance. To address this gap, we introduce RAGuard, the first benchmark to evaluate the robustness of RAG systems against misleading retrievals. Unlike prior benchmarks that rely on synthetic noise, our fact-checking dataset captures naturally occurring misinformation by constructing its retrieval corpus from Reddit discussions. It categorizes retrieved evidence into three types: supporting, misleading, and unrelated, providing a realistic and challenging testbed for assessing how well RAG systems navigate different types of evidence. Our experiments reveal that, when exposed to potentially misleading retrievals, all tested LLM-powered RAG systems perform worse than their zero-shot baselines (i.e., no retrieval at all), while human annotators consistently perform better, highlighting LLMs' susceptibility to noisy environments. To our knowledge, RAGuard is the first benchmark to systematically assess the robustness of the RAG against misleading evidence. We expect this benchmark to drive future research toward improving RAG systems beyond idealized datasets, making them more reliable for real-world applications. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/UCSC-IRKM/RAGuard.</description>

      <title>Missing vs. Unused Knowledge Hypothesis for Language Model Bottlenecks in Patent Understanding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12452v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall, the real challenge lies in knowledge application. A gap persists between their ability to answer complex questions and their effectiveness in performing tasks that require that knowledge. We investigate this gap using a patent classification problem that requires deep conceptual understanding to distinguish semantically similar but objectively different patents written in dense, strategic technical language. We find that LLMs often struggle with this distinction. To diagnose the source of these failures, we introduce a framework that decomposes model errors into two categories: missing knowledge and unused knowledge. Our method prompts models to generate clarifying questions and compares three settings -- raw performance, self-answered questions that activate internal knowledge, and externally provided answers that supply missing knowledge (if any). We show that most errors stem from failures to deploy existing knowledge rather than from true knowledge gaps. We also examine how models differ in constructing task-specific question-answer databases. Smaller models tend to generate simpler questions that they, and other models, can retrieve and use effectively, whereas larger models produce more complex questions that are less effective, suggesting complementary strengths across model scales. Together, our findings highlight that shifting evaluation from static fact recall to dynamic knowledge application offers a more informative view of model capabilities.</description>

      <title>PersonalAI: A Systematic Comparison of Knowledge Graph Storage and Retrieval Approaches for Personalized LLM agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17001v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalizing language models that effectively incorporating user interaction history remains a central challenge in development of adaptive AI systems. While large language models (LLMs), combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), have improved factual accuracy, they often lack structured memory and fail to scale in complex, long-term interactions. To address this, we propose a flexible external memory framework based on knowledge graph, which construct and update memory model automatically by LLM itself. Building upon the AriGraph architecture, we introduce a novel hybrid graph design that supports both standard edges and two types of hyper-edges, enabling rich and dynamic semantic and temporal representations. Our framework also supports diverse retrieval mechanisms, including A*, water-circle traversal, beam search and hybrid methods, making it adaptable to different datasets and LLM capacities. We evaluate our system on three benchmarks: TriviaQA, HotpotQA, DiaASQ and demonstrate that different memory and retrieval configurations yield optimal performance depending on the task. Additionally, we extend the DiaASQ benchmark with temporal annotations and internally contradictory statements, showing that our system remains robust and effective in managing temporal dependencies and context-aware reasoning.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Verification-Centric Framework for Mitigating Hallucination in Multi-Modal RAG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the technical solution developed by team CRUISE for the KDD Cup 2025 Meta Comprehensive RAG Benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-turn (CRAG-MM) challenge. The challenge aims to address a critical limitation of modern Vision Language Models (VLMs): their propensity to hallucinate, especially when faced with egocentric imagery, long-tail entities, and complex, multi-hop questions. This issue is particularly problematic in real-world applications where users pose fact-seeking queries that demand high factual accuracy across diverse modalities. To tackle this, we propose a robust, multi-stage framework that prioritizes factual accuracy and truthfulness over completeness. Our solution integrates a lightweight query router for efficiency, a query-aware retrieval and summarization pipeline, a dual-pathways generation and a post-hoc verification. This conservative strategy is designed to minimize hallucinations, which incur a severe penalty in the competition's scoring metric. Our approach achieved 3rd place in Task 1, demonstrating the effectiveness of prioritizing answer reliability in complex multi-modal RAG systems.

      <title>Conversations over Clicks: Impact of Chatbots on Information Search in Interdisciplinary Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on the learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize the information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to navigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further compounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied prior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences information search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a GenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do learners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an autoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to support orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was counterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information sources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when applied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized through the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These findings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with caution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.</description>

      <title>Knowing When Not to Answer: Lightweight KB-Aligned OOD Detection for Safe RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains, where safety depends not only on how a system answers, but also on whether a query should be answered given a knowledge base (KB). Out-of-domain (OOD) queries can cause dense retrieval to surface weakly related context and lead the generator to produce fluent but unjustified responses. We study lightweight, KB-aligned OOD detection as an always-on gate for RAG systems. Our approach applies PCA to KB embeddings and scores queries in a compact subspace selected either by explained-variance retention (EVR) or by a separability-driven t-test ranking. We evaluate geometric semantic-search rules and lightweight classifiers across 16 domains, including high-stakes COVID-19 and Substance Use KBs, and stress-test robustness using both LLM-generated attacks and an in-the-wild 4chan attack. We find that low-dimensional detectors achieve competitive OOD performance while being faster, cheaper, and more interpretable than prompted LLM-based judges. Finally, human and LLM-based evaluations show that OOD queries primarily degrade the relevance of RAG outputs, showing the need for efficient external OOD detection to maintain safe, in-scope behavior.</description>

      <title>SurGE: A Benchmark and Evaluation Framework for Scientific Survey Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15658v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of academic literature makes the manual creation of scientific surveys increasingly infeasible. While large language models show promise for automating this process, progress in this area is hindered by the absence of standardized benchmarks and evaluation protocols. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce SurGE (Survey Generation Evaluation), a new benchmark for scientific survey generation in computer science. SurGE consists of (1) a collection of test instances, each including a topic description, an expert-written survey, and its full set of cited references, and (2) a large-scale academic corpus of over one million papers. In addition, we propose an automated evaluation framework that measures the quality of generated surveys across four dimensions: comprehensiveness, citation accuracy, structural organization, and content quality. Our evaluation of diverse LLM-based methods demonstrates a significant performance gap, revealing that even advanced agentic frameworks struggle with the complexities of survey generation and highlighting the need for future research in this area. We have open-sourced all the code, data, and models at: https://github.com/oneal2000/SurGE</description>

      <title>Unveiling Unicode's Unseen Underpinnings in Undermining Authorship Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When using a public communication channel--whether formal or informal, such as commenting or posting on social media--end users have no expectation of privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence--using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and fingerprinting--one obvious element still lingers: the message itself. Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The content of their message--necessarily open for public consumption--exposes an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode steganography.</description>

      <title>Principled Context Engineering for RAG: Statistical Guarantees via Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.</description>

      <title>Tuning for TraceTarnish: Techniques, Trends, and Testing Tangible Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we more rigorously evaluated our attack script $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, which leverages adversarial stylometry principles to anonymize the authorship of text-based messages. To ensure the efficacy and utility of our attack, we sourced, processed, and analyzed Reddit comments -- comments that were later alchemized into $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data -- to gain valuable insights. The transformed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data was then further augmented by $\textit{StyloMetrix}$ to manufacture stylometric features -- features that were culled using the Information Gain criterion, leaving only the most informative, predictive, and discriminative ones. Our results found that function words and function word types ($L\_FUNC\_A$ $\&amp;$ $L\_FUNC\_T$); content words and content word types ($L\_CONT\_A$ $\&amp;$ $L\_CONT\_T$); and the Type-Token Ratio ($ST\_TYPE\_TOKEN\_RATIO\_LEMMAS$) yielded significant Information-Gain readings. The identified stylometric cues -- function-word frequencies, content-word distributions, and the Type-Token Ratio -- serve as reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs), revealing when a text has been deliberately altered to mask its true author. Similarly, these features could function as forensic beacons, alerting defenders to the presence of an adversarial stylometry attack; granted, in the absence of the original message, this signal may go largely unnoticed, as it appears to depend on a pre- and post-transformation comparison. "In trying to erase a trace, you often imprint a larger one." Armed with this understanding, we framed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$'s operations and outputs around these five isolated features, using them to conceptualize and implement enhancements that further strengthen the attack.</description>

      <title>StegoStylo: Squelching Stylometric Scrutiny through Steganographic Stitching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stylometry--the identification of an author through analysis of a text's style (i.e., authorship attribution)--serves many constructive purposes: it supports copyright and plagiarism investigations, aids detection of harmful content, offers exploratory cues for certain medical conditions (e.g., early signs of dementia or depression), provides historical context for literary works, and helps uncover misinformation and disinformation. In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\textit{TraceTarnish}$.</description>
