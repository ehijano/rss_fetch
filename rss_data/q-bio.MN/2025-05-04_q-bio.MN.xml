      <title>The Emergence of Chirality from Metabolism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular chirality is critical to biochemical function, but it is unknown when chiral selectivity first became important in the evolutionary transition from geochemistry to biochemistry during the emergence of life. Here, we identify key transitions in the selection of chiral molecules in metabolic evolution, showing how achiral molecules (lacking chiral centers) may have given rise to specific and abundant chiral molecules in the elaboration of metabolic networks from geochemically available precursor molecules. Simulated expansions of biosphere-scale metabolism suggest new hypotheses about the evolution of chiral molecules within biochemistry, including a prominent role for both achiral and chiral compounds as nucleation sites of early metabolic network growth, an increasing enrichment of molecules with more chiral centers as these networks expand, and conservation of broken chiral symmetries along reaction pathways as a general organizing principle. We also find an unexpected enrichment in large, non-polymeric achiral molecules. Leveraging metabolic data of 40,023 genomes and metagenomes, we analyzed the statistics of chiral and achiral molecules in the large-scale organization of metabolism, revealing a chiral-enriched phase of network organization evidenced by system-size dependent chiral scaling laws that differ for individuals and ecosystems. By uncovering how metabolic networks could lead to chiral selection, our findings open new avenues for bridging metabolism and genetics-first approaches to the origin of chirality, allowing tools for better timing of major transitions in molecular organization during the emergence of life, understanding the role of chirality in extant and synthetic metabolisms, and informing targets for chirality-based biosignatures.</description>

      <title>Energy Transduction in Complex Networks with Multiple Resources: The Chemistry Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the traditional framework of steady state energy transduction -- typically characterized by a single input and output -- to multi-resource transduction in open chemical reaction networks (CRNs). Transduction occurs when stoichiometrically balanced processes are driven against their spontaneous directions by coupling them with thermodynamically favorable ones. However, when multiple processes (resources) interact through a shared CRN, identifying the relevant set of processes for analyzing transduction becomes a critical and complex challenge. To address this, we introduce a systematic procedure based on elementary processes, which cannot be further decomposed into subprocesses. Our theory generalizes the methodology used to define transduction efficiency in thermal engines operating between multiple heat baths. By selecting a reference equilibrium environment, it explicitly reveals the inherently relative nature of transduction efficiency and ties its definition to exergy. This framework also allows one to exclude unusable outputs from efficiency calculations. We further extend the concept of chemical gears to multi-process transduction, demonstrating their versatility as an analytical tool in complex settings. Finally, we apply our framework to central metabolic pathways, uncovering deep insights into their operation and highlighting the crucial difference between thermodynamic efficiencies and stoichiometric yields.</description>
