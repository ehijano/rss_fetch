      <title>DeepAries: Adaptive Rebalancing Interval Selection for Enhanced Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose DeepAries , a novel deep reinforcement learning framework for dynamic portfolio management that jointly optimizes the timing and allocation of rebalancing decisions. Unlike prior reinforcement learning methods that employ fixed rebalancing intervals regardless of market conditions, DeepAries adaptively selects optimal rebalancing intervals along with portfolio weights to reduce unnecessary transaction costs and maximize risk-adjusted returns. Our framework integrates a Transformer-based state encoder, which effectively captures complex long-term market dependencies, with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to generate simultaneous discrete (rebalancing intervals) and continuous (asset allocations) actions. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world financial markets demonstrate that DeepAries significantly outperforms traditional fixed-frequency and full-rebalancing strategies in terms of risk-adjusted returns, transaction costs, and drawdowns. Additionally, we provide a live demo of DeepAries at https://deep-aries.github.io/, along with the source code and dataset at https://github.com/dmis-lab/DeepAries, illustrating DeepAries' capability to produce interpretable rebalancing and allocation decisions aligned with shifting market regimes. Overall, DeepAries introduces an innovative paradigm for adaptive and practical portfolio management by integrating both timing and allocation into a unified decision-making process.</description>

      <title>RegimeFolio: A Regime Aware ML System for Sectoral Portfolio Optimization in Dynamic Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial markets are inherently non-stationary, with shifting volatility regimes that alter asset co-movements and return distributions. Standard portfolio optimization methods, typically built on stationarity or regime-agnostic assumptions, struggle to adapt to such changes. To address these challenges, we propose RegimeFolio, a novel regime-aware and sector-specialized framework that, unlike existing regime-agnostic models such as DeepVol and DRL optimizers, integrates explicit volatility regime segmentation with sector-specific ensemble forecasting and adaptive mean-variance allocation. This modular architecture ensures forecasts and portfolio decisions remain aligned with current market conditions, enhancing robustness and interpretability in dynamic markets. RegimeFolio combines three components: (i) an interpretable VIX-based classifier for market regime detection; (ii) regime and sector-specific ensemble learners (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to capture conditional return structures; and (iii) a dynamic mean-variance optimizer with shrinkage-regularized covariance estimates for regime-aware allocation. We evaluate RegimeFolio on 34 large cap U.S. equities from 2020 to 2024. The framework achieves a cumulative return of 137 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.17, a 12 percent lower maximum drawdown, and a 15 to 20 percent improvement in forecast accuracy compared to conventional and advanced machine learning benchmarks. These results show that explicitly modeling volatility regimes in predictive learning and portfolio allocation enhances robustness and leads to more dependable decision-making in real markets.</description>

      <title>Selection Confidence Sets for Equally Weighted Portfolios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a universe of N assets, investors often form equally weighted portfolios (EWPs) by selecting subsets of assets. EWPs are simple, robust, and competitive out-of-sample, yet the uncertainty about which subset truly performs best is largely ignored. Traditional approaches typically rely on a single selected portfolio, but this fails to consider alternative investment strategies that may perform just as well when accounting for statistical uncertainty. To address this selection uncertainty, we introduce the Selection Confidence Set (SCS) for EWPs: the set of all portfolios that, under a given loss function and at a specified confidence level, contains the unknown set of optimal portfolios under repeated sampling. The SCS quantifies selection uncertainty by identifying a range of plausible portfolios, challenging the idea of a uniquely optimal choice. Like a confidence set, its size reflects uncertainty -- growing with noisy or limited data, and shrinking as the sample size increases. Theoretically, we establish that the SCS covers the unknown optimal selection with high probability and characterize how its size grows with underlying uncertainty, corroborating these results through Monte Carlo experiments. Applications to the French 17-Industry Portfolios and Layer-1 cryptocurrencies underscore the importance of accounting for selection uncertainty when comparing equally weighted strategies.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Optimization of Indonesian Banking Stocks Using Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of investors in the Indonesia Stock Exchange has steadily increased, emphasizing the importance of portfolio optimization in balancing risk and return. The classical mean-variance optimization model, while widely applied, depends on historical return and risk estimates that are uncertain and may result in suboptimal portfolios. To address this limitation, robust optimization incorporates uncertainty sets to improve portfolio reliability under market fluctuations. This study constructs such sets using moving-window and bootstrapping methods and applies them to Indonesian banking stock data with varying risk-aversion parameters. The results show that robust optimization with the moving-window method, particularly with a smaller risk-aversion parameter, provides a better risk-return trade-off compared to the bootstrapping approach. These findings highlight the potential of the moving-window method to generate more effective portfolio strategies for risk-tolerant investors.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimization in Causal Models and G-Causal Normalizing Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that interventionally robust optimization problems in causal models are continuous under the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance, but may be discontinuous under the standard Wasserstein distance. This highlights the importance of using generative models that respect the causal structure when augmenting data for such tasks. To this end, we propose a new normalizing flow architecture that satisfies a universal approximation property for causal structural models and can be efficiently trained to minimize the $G$-causal Wasserstein distance. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model outperforms standard (non-causal) generative models in data augmentation for causal regression and mean-variance portfolio optimization in causal factor models.</description>

      <title>Portfolio Analysis in High Dimensions with TE and Weight Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the statistical properties of forming constrained optimal portfolios within a high-dimensional set of assets. We examine portfolios with tracking error constraints, those with simultaneous tracking error and weight restrictions, and portfolios constrained solely by weight. Tracking error measures portfolio performance against a benchmark (typically an index), while weight constraints determine asset allocation based on regulatory requirements or fund prospectuses. Our approach employs a novel statistical learning technique that integrates factor models with nodewise regression, named the Constrained Residual Nodewise Optimal Weight Regression (CROWN) method. We demonstrate its estimation consistency in large dimensions, even when assets outnumber the portfolio's time span. Convergence rate results for constrained portfolio weights, risk, and Sharpe Ratio are provided, and simulation and empirical evidence highlight the method's outstanding performance.</description>

      <title>Your AI, Not Your View: The Bias of LLMs in Investment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20957v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In finance, Large Language Models (LLMs) face frequent knowledge conflicts arising from discrepancies between their pre-trained parametric knowledge and real-time market data. These conflicts are especially problematic in real-world investment services, where a model's inherent biases can misalign with institutional objectives, leading to unreliable recommendations. Despite this risk, the intrinsic investment biases of LLMs remain underexplored. We propose an experimental framework to investigate emergent behaviors in such conflict scenarios, offering a quantitative analysis of bias in LLM-based investment analysis. Using hypothetical scenarios with balanced and imbalanced arguments, we extract the latent biases of models and measure their persistence. Our analysis, centered on sector, size, and momentum, reveals distinct, model-specific biases. Across most models, a tendency to prefer technology stocks, large-cap stocks, and contrarian strategies is observed. These foundational biases often escalate into confirmation bias, causing models to cling to initial judgments even when faced with increasing counter-evidence. A public leaderboard benchmarking bias across a broader set of models is available at https://linqalpha.com/leaderboard</description>
