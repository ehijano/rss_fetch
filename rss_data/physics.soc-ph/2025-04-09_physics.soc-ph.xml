      <title>Uncovering influence of football players' behaviour on team performance in ball possession through dynamical modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quest for uncovering influence of behaviour on team performance involves understanding individual behaviour, interactions with others and environment, variations across groups, and effects of interventions. Although insights into each of these areas have accumulated in sports science literature on football, it remains unclear how one can enhance team performance. We analyse influence of football players' behaviour on team performance in three-versus-one ball possession game by constructing and analysing a dynamical model. We developed a model for the motion of the players and the ball, which mathematically represented our hypotheses on players' behaviour and interactions. The model's plausibility was examined by comparing simulated outcomes with our experimental result. Possible influences of interventions were analysed through sensitivity analysis, where causal effects of several aspects of behaviour such as pass speed and accuracy were found. Our research highlights the potential of dynamical modelling for uncovering influence of behaviour on team effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Novel Nonlinear Fertility Catastrophe Model Based on Thom's Differential Equations of Morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel fertility model based on Thom's nonlinear differential equations of morphogenesis is presented, utilizing a three-dimensional catastrophe surface to capture the interaction between latent non-catastrophic fertility factors and catastrophic shocks. The model incorporates key socioeconomic and environmental variables and is applicable at macro-, meso-, and micro-demographic levels, addressing global fertility declines, regional population disparities, and micro-level phenomena such as teenage pregnancies. This approach enables a comprehensive analysis of reproductive health at aggregate, sub-national, and age-group-specific levels. An agent-based model for teenage pregnancy is described to illustrate how latent factors -- such as education, contraceptive use, and parental guidance -- interact with catastrophic shocks like socioeconomic deprivation, violence, and substance abuse. The bifurcation set analysis shows how minor shifts in socioeconomic conditions can lead to significant changes in fertility rates, revealing critical points in fertility transitions. By integrating Thom's morphogenesis equations with traditional fertility theory, this paper proposes a groundbreaking approach to understanding fertility dynamics, offering valuable insights for the development of public health policies that address both stable fertility patterns and abrupt demographic shifts.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of continuous public goods games in structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, many works have studied the evolutionary dynamics of continuous games. However, previous works have primarily focused on two-player games with pairwise interactions. Indeed, group interactions rather than pairwise interactions are usually found in real situations. The public goods game serves as a paradigm of multi-player interactions. Notably, various types of benefit functions are typically considered in public goods games, including linear, saturating, and sigmoid functions. Thus far, the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation in continuous public goods games with these benefit functions remain unknown in structured populations. In this paper, we consider the continuous public goods game in structured populations. By employing the pair approximation approach, we derive the analytical expressions for invasion fitness. Furthermore, we explore the adaptive dynamics of cooperative investments in the game with various benefit functions. First, for the linear public goods game, we find that there is no singular strategy, and the cooperative investments evolve to either the maximum or minimum depending on the benefit-to-cost ratio. Subsequently, we examine the game with saturating benefit functions and demonstrate the potential existence of an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS). Additionally, for the game with the sigmoid benefit function, we observe that the evolutionary outcomes are closely related to the threshold value. When the threshold is small, a unique ESS emerges. For intermediate threshold values, both the ESS and repellor singular strategies can coexist. When the threshold value is large, a unique repellor displays. Finally, we perform individual-based simulations to validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Green building blocks reveal the complex anatomy of climate change mitigation technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate-change mitigating innovation is considered essential for the world's transition toward a sustainable global economy. To guide this transition, integrated assessment models map sectoral emissions reduction targets into long-term trajectories towards carbon neutrality at the macro-level, while detailed engineering studies at the micro-level develop concrete carbon-mitigation technologies tailored to individual industries. However, we lack a meso-level understanding of how solutions connect across technological domains. Building on the notion that innovating often entails combining existing technologies in new ways, we identify Green Building Blocks (GBBs): modules of technologies that can be added to nongreen technologies to mitigate their climate-change impact. Using natural language processing and dimensionality reduction techniques, we show how GBBs can be extracted from large-scale patent data. Next, we describe the anatomy of the green transition as a network that connects nongreen technologies to GBBs. This network has a nontrivial structure: whereas some nongreen technologies can connect to various GBBs, opening up a variety of ways to mitigate their impact on the global climate, other nongreen technologies only connect to a single GBB. Similarly, some GBBs are general purpose technologies that can reduce green house gases in a vast range of applications, whereas others are tailored to specific use cases. Furthermore, GBBs prove predictive of the green technologies that firms develop, allowing us to map the green capabilities of firms not in terms of the specific green technological solutions they invent, but in terms of their capacity to develop broader classes of solutions with the GBBs they possess.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of critical cascades in interdependent networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collapse of interdependent networks, as well as similar avalanche phenomena, is driven by cascading failures. At the critical point, the cascade begins as a critical branching process, where each failing node (element) triggers, on average, the failure of one other node. As nodes continue to fail, the network becomes increasingly fragile and the branching factor grows. If the failure process does not reach extinction during its critical phase, the network undergoes an abrupt collapse. Here, we implement the analogy between this dynamic and birth-death processes to derive new analytical results and significantly optimize numerical calculations. Using this approach, we analyze three key aspects of the dynamics: the probability of collapse, the duration of avalanches, and the length of the cascading plateau phase preceding a collapse. This analysis quantifies how system size and the intensity of the initial triggering event influence these characteristics.</description>

      <title>Market, power, gift, and concession economies: Comparison using four-mode primitive network models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing wealth inequality is a global challenge, and the problems of capitalism stem from the enclosure of the commons and the breakdown of the community. According to previous studies by Polanyi, Karatani, and Graeber, economic modes can be divided into capitalist market economy (enclosure and exchange), power economy (de-enclosure and redistribution), gift economy (obligation to return and reciprocity), and concession economy (de-obligation to return). The concession economy reflects Graeber's baseline communism (from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs) and Deguchi's We-turn philosophy (the "I" as an individual has a "fundamental incapability" and the subject of physical action, responsibility, and freedom is "We" as a multi-agent system, including the "I"). In this study, we constructed novel network models for these four modes and compared their properties (cluster coefficient, graph density, reciprocity, assortativity, centrality, and Gini coefficient). From the calculation results, it became clear that the market economy leads to inequality; the power economy mitigates inequality but cannot eliminate it; the gift and concession economies lead to a healthy and equal economy; and the concession economy, free from the ties of obligation to return, is possible without guaranteeing reciprocity. We intend to promote the transformation from a capitalist economy to a concession economy through activities that disseminate baseline communism and the We-turn philosophy that promotes concession, that is, developing a cooperative platform to support concession through information technology and empirical research through fieldwork.</description>

      <title>FJ-MM: The Friedkin-Johnsen Opinion Dynamics Model with Memory and Higher-Order Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model has been extensively explored and validated, spanning applications in social science, systems and control, game theory, and algorithmic research. In this paper, we introduce an advanced generalization of the FJ model, termed FJ-MM which incorporates both memory effects and multi-hop (higher-order neighbor) influence. This formulation allows agents to naturally incorporate both current and previous opinions at each iteration stage. Our numerical results demonstrate that incorporating memory and multi-hop influence significantly reshapes the opinion landscape; for example, the final opinion profile can exhibit reduced polarization. We analyze the stability and equilibrium properties of the FJ-MM model, showing that these properties can be reduced to those of a comparison model--namely, the standard FJ model with a modified influence matrix. This reduction enables us to leverage established stability results from FJ dynamics. Additionally, we examine the convergence rate of the FJ-MM model and demonstrate that, as can be expected, the time lags introduced by memory and higher-order neighbor influences result in slower convergence.</description>

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. A number of decisions require a qualified majority, the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution -- based on the Shapley--Shubik index -- and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with about 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The decisiveness index decreases if the population criterion is above 68% or the states criterion is at least 17. Some quota combinations contradict the principles of double majority. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley--Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable in evaluating any proposal for reforming the qualified majority voting system.</description>

      <title>Know your footprint -- Evaluation of the professional carbon footprint for individual researchers in high energy physics and related fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the climate crisis intensifies, understanding the environmental impact of professional activities is paramount, especially in sectors with historically significant resource utilisation. This includes High Energy Physics (HEP) and related fields, which investigate the fundamental laws of our universe. As members of the young High Energy Physicists (yHEP) association, we investigate the CO$_2$-equivalent emissions generated by HEP-related research on a personalised per-researcher level, for four distinct categories: Experiments, tied to collaborations with substantial infrastructure; Institutional, representing the resource consumption of research institutes and universities; Computing, focussing on simulations and data analysis; and Travel, covering professional trips to conferences, etc. The findings are integrated into a tool for self-evaluation, the Know-your-footprint (Kyf) calculator, allowing the assessment of the personal and professional footprint and optionally sharing the data with the yHEP association. The study aims to heighten awareness, foster sustainability, and inspire the community to adopt more environmentally responsible research practices urgently.</description>

      <title>Mutual benefits of social learning and algorithmic mediation for cumulative culture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The remarkable ecological success of humans is often attributed to our ability to develop complex cultural artefacts that enable us to cope with environmental challenges. The evolution of complex culture (cumulative cultural evolution) is usually modelled as a collective process in which individuals invent new artefacts (innovation) and copy information from others (social learning). This classic picture overlooks the growing role of intelligent algorithms in the digital age (e.g. search engines, recommender systems and large language models) in mediating information between humans, with potential consequences for cumulative cultural evolution. Building on a previous model, we investigate the combined effects of network-based social learning and a simplistic version of algorithmic mediation on cultural accumulation. We find that algorithmic mediation significantly impacts cultural accumulation and that this impact grows as social networks become less densely connected. Cultural accumulation is most effective when social learning and algorithmic mediation are combined, and the optimal ratio depends on the network's density. This work is an initial step towards formalizing the impact of intelligent algorithms on cumulative cultural evolution within an established framework. Models like ours provide insights into mechanisms of human-machine interaction in cultural contexts, guiding hypotheses for future experimental testing.</description>

      <title>A spatial hypergraph model to smoothly interpolate between pairwise graphs and hypergraphs to study higher-order structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a spatial graph and hypergraph model that smoothly interpolates between a graph with purely pairwise edges and a graph where all connections are in large hyperedges. The key component is a spatial clustering resolution parameter that varies between assigning all the vertices in a spatial region to individual clusters, resulting in the pairwise case, to assigning all the vertices in a spatial region to a single cluster, which results in the large hyperedge case. An important outcome of this model is that the spatial structure is invariant to the choice of hyperedges. Consequently, this model enables us to study clustering coefficients, graph diffusion, and epidemic spread and how their behavior changes as a function of the higher-order structure in the network with a fixed spatial substrate. We hope that our model will find future uses to distill or explain other behaviors in higher-order networks.</description>
