      <title>Early-Warning Signals of Political Risk in Stablecoin Markets: Human and Algorithmic Behavior Around the 2024 U.S. Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the 2024 U.S. presidential election, viewed as a major political risk event, affected cryptocurrency markets by distinguishing human-driven peer-to-peer stablecoin transactions from automated algorithmic activity. Using structural break analysis, we find that human-driven Ethereum Request for Comment 20 (ERC-20) transactions shifted on November 3, two days before the election, while exchange trading volumes reacted only on Election Day. Automated smart-contract activity adjusted much later, with structural breaks appearing in January 2025. We validate these shifts using surrogate-based robustness tests. Complementary energy-spectrum analysis of Bitcoin and Ethereum identifies pronounced post-election turbulence, and a structural vector autoregression confirms a regime shift in stablecoin dynamics. Overall, human-driven stablecoin flows act as early-warning indicators of political stress, preceding both exchange behavior and algorithmic responses.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Distributions in Non-Stationary Complex Systems I: Random Matrix Model and Formulae for Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk assessment for rare events is essential for understanding systemic stability in complex systems. As rare events are typically highly correlated, it is important to study heavy-tailed multivariate distributions of the relevant variables, especially in the presence of non-stationarity. We use a generalized scalar product between correlation matrices to clearly demonstrate this non-stationarity. Further, we present a model that we recently put forward, which captures how the non-stationary fluctuations of correlations make the tails of multivariate distributions heavier. Here, we provide the resulting formulae including Gaussian or Algebraic features. Compared to our previous results, we manage to remove in the Algebraic cases one out of the two, respectively three, fit parameters which considerably facilitates applications. We demonstrate the usefulness of these results by deriving joint distributions for linear combinations of amplitudes and validating them with financial data. Furthermore, we explicitly work out the moments of our model distributions. In a forthcoming paper we apply the model to financial markets.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Distributions in Non-Stationary Complex Systems II: Empirical Results for Correlated Stock Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate Distributions are needed to capture the correlation structure of complex systems. In previous works, we developed a Random Matrix Model for such correlated multivariate joint probability density functions that accounts for the non-stationarity typically found in complex systems. Here, we apply these results to the returns measured in correlated stock markets. Only the knowledge of the multivariate return distributions allows for a full-fledged risk assessment. We analyze intraday data of 479 US stocks included in the S&amp;P500 index during the trading year of 2014. We focus particularly on the tails which are algebraic and heavy. The non-stationary fluctuations of the correlations make the tails heavier. With the few-parameter formulae of our Random Matrix Model we can describe and quantify how the empirical distributions change for varying time resolution and in the presence of non-stationarity.</description>

      <title>Statistical modeling of SOFR term structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SOFR derivatives market remains illiquid and incomplete so it is not amenable to classical risk-neutral term structure models which are based on the assumption of perfect liquidity and completeness. This paper develops a statistical SOFR term structure model that is well-suited for risk management and derivatives pricing within the incomplete markets paradigm. The model incorporates relevant macroeconomic factors that drive central bank policy rates which, in turn, cause jumps often observed in the SOFR rates. The model is easy to calibrate to historical data, current market quotes, and the user's views concerning the future development of the relevant macroeconomic factors. The model is well suited for large-scale simulations often required in risk management, portfolio optimization and indifference pricing of interest rate derivatives.</description>
