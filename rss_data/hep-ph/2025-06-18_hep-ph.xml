      <title>Two Higgs Doublet Solutions to the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the strong CP problem in a broad class of two Higgs doublet theories that will be probed at the Large Hadron Collider and at future colliders.These theories feature CP and Abelian flavor symmetries, both broken softly in the scalar potential, that yield realistic quark masses and mixings. The flavor symmetry charges are chosen so that $\bar{\theta}=0$ at tree level for all values of the Yukawa and quartic couplings of the theory. We prove that in all such theories the 1-loop contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ also vanishes, independently of the mass scale of the second Higgs doublet. We study two illustrative models with flavor group $\mathbb{Z}_3$. The direct contributions to the neutron electric dipole moment are negligible in both models. While the 2-loop contribution to $\bar{\theta}$ is less than $10^{-12}$ in one model, it can be as large as $10^{-10}$ in the other, yielding the prospect of a signal in planned experiments. Even with Abelian flavor symmetries, CP violation in neutral kaon mixing is generally expected to yield naturalness bounds on the masses of additional Higgs doublets of order 20 TeV. We prove that for all models in our class, where the flavor symmetry forces $\bar{\theta}$ to vanish at tree-level, the flavor-changing neutral currents are CP-conserving, yielding model-dependent bounds from neutral meson mixing near 1 TeV. Mixing of the two CP-even scalars gives corrections to the couplings of the 125 GeV Higgs state to $\bar{t}t, \bar{b}b, \bar{c}c, \bar{\tau}\tau$ and $\bar{\mu} \mu$, giving possible signals at high luminosity runs at LHC and at future colliders. Furthermore, distinctive correlations between corrections in the various channels can probe the underlying flavor symmetry.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger FIMP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a multi-messenger frontier probe of non-thermal or freeze-in massive particle (FIMP) dark matter (DM) by considering an effective field theory (EFT) setup. Assuming leptophilic operators connecting DM with the standard model (SM) bath, we consider DM mass $m_{\rm DM}$ and the reheat temperature of the Universe $T_{\rm rh}$ in a regime which prevents DM-SM thermalisation. Low $T_{\rm rh}$ allows sizeable DM-SM interactions even for non-thermal DM allowing the latter to be probed at direct, indirect detection frontiers as well as future electron-positron and muon colliders. An extended reheating period governed by monomial inflaton potential after its slow-roll phase not only generates the required abundance of non-thermal DM via ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in but also brings the scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves (GW) within reach of near future experiments across a wide range of frequencies. While particle physics experiments can probe sub-GeV scale $T_{\rm rh}$ and FIMP with mass $m_{\rm DM} \lesssim O(10)$ GeV, future GW detectors are sensitive to a much wider parameter space.</description>

      <title>The fast, the slow and the merging: probes of evaporating memory burdened PBHs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The so-called memory-burden effect implies that evaporating Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) inevitably stabilize before complete decay. This stabilization opens a new mass window for PBH Dark Matter below $10^{15}\,$g. The transition to the memory-burdened phase is not instantaneous but unfolds over cosmological timescales, with some PBHs entering this phase in the present epoch. Additionally, a fraction of PBHs undergo mergers today, forming ''young'' semiclassical black holes that evaporate at unsuppressed rates. Both processes generate fluxes of stable astrophysical particles, which are constrained by current measurements of high-energy $\gamma$-rays and neutrinos. Moreover, the steep increase in energy injection at higher redshifts perturbs the ionization history of the Universe, leading to complementary bounds from observations of the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies. We find that the reopened window enabled by the memory-burden effect is largely within reach of detection, both locally and across cosmological distances. We further describe how our findings restrict the values of the critical exponent characterizing the memory burden phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Freeze-In and Small-Scale Observables: Novel Mass Bounds and Viable Particle Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The suppression of cosmological structure at small scales is a key signature of dark matter (DM) produced via freeze-in in the low-mass regime. We present a comprehensive analysis of its impact, incorporating recent constraints from Milky Way satellite counts, strong gravitational lensing with JWST data, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. We adopt a general strategy to translate existing warm dark matter (WDM) bounds into lower mass limits for a broad class of DM candidates characterized by quasi-thermal phase space distributions. The benefits of this approach include computational efficiency and the ability to explore a wide range of models. We derive model-independent bounds for DM produced via two-body decays, scatterings, and three-body decays, and apply the framework to concrete scenarios such as the Higgs portal, sterile neutrinos, axion-like particles, and the dark photon portal. Results from specific models confirm the validity of the model-independent analysis.</description>

      <title>A Determination of $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ at aN$^3$LO$_{\bf QCD}\otimes {\bf NLO}_{\bf QED}$ Accuracy from a Global PDF Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a determination of the strong coupling $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ from a global dataset including both fixed-target and collider data from deep-inelastic scattering and a variety of hadronic processes, with a simultaneous determination of parton distribution functions (PDFs) based on the NNPDF4.0 methodology. This determination is performed at NNLO and approximate N$^3$LO (aN$^3$LO) perturbative QCD accuracy, including QED corrections and a photon PDF up to NLO accuracy. We extract $\alpha_s$ using two independent methodologies, both of which take into account the cross-correlation between $\alpha_s$ and the PDFs. The two methodologies are validated by closure tests that allow us to detect and remove or correct for several sources of bias, and lead to mutually consistent results. We account for all correlated experimental uncertainties, as well as correlated theoretical uncertainties related to missing higher order perturbative corrections (MHOUs). We study the perturbative convergence of our results and the impact of QED corrections. We assess individual sources of uncertainty, specifically MHOUs and the value of the top quark mass. We provide a detailed appraisal of methodological choices, including the choice of input dataset, the form of solution of evolution equation, the treatment of the experimental covariance matrix, and the details of Monte Carlo data generation. We find $\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1194^{+0.0007}_{-0.0014}$ at aN$^3$LO$_{\rm QCD}\otimes {\rm NLO}_{\rm QED}$ accuracy, consistent with the latest PDG average and with recent lattice results.</description>

      <title>Theory Uncertainties in the Extraction of $\alpha_s$ from Drell-Yan at Small Transverse Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed pseudodata study to estimate the expected theory uncertainty in the extraction of the strong coupling constant, $\alpha_s(m_Z)$, from a fit to the measured Drell-Yan transverse momentum ($q_T$) spectrum at small $q_T \ll m_Z$. We consider two approaches to estimate the dominant perturbative uncertainties. We first discuss that the traditional approach based on varying unphysical scales is insufficient here because it cannot correctly account for bin-by-bin theory correlations in the $q_T$ spectrum, which are critically important in this case. We then use this case as a nontrivial application of a new approach based on theory nuisance parameters (TNPs), which encodes the correct theory correlations by construction. Moreover, the TNPs can be profiled in the fit thereby allowing the data to constrain the theory uncertainties in a consistent manner. We furthermore discuss the interplay with nonperturbative effects in the peak region $q_T \lesssim 10$ GeV, from where most of the $\alpha_s$ sensitivity originates. The associated nonperturbative uncertainties on $\alpha_s$ when fitting only the $q_T$ spectrum are large. They can in principle be reduced by including additional constraints on the nonperturbative Collins-Soper kernel from lattice QCD calculations. We find that these improvements in the treatment of perturbative and nonperturbative uncertainties and their correlations will enable a competitive $\alpha_s$ extraction from Drell-Yan data at small $q_T$. We also discuss the implications of our findings, calling into question a recent $\alpha_s$ extraction from the $Z$ $q_T$ spectrum by the ATLAS experiment.</description>

      <title>Deep-Inelastic Scattering at TeV Energies with LHC Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHC far-forward experiments FASER and SND@LHC have pioneered the detection of TeV-energy neutrinos produced in hard-scattering proton-proton collisions at the LHC. In addition to neutrinos, an intense flux of TeV-energy muons reaches these detectors, representing a dominant background for both neutrino studies and beyond the Standard Model searches. Here we demonstrate that this forward muon flux enables a comprehensive neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) program at FASER with a strong kinematical overlap with the Electron Ion Collider. For the Run 3 luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{\rm pp}=250$~fb$^{-1}$, more than $10^5$ inclusive muon DIS events, of which up to $10^4$ for charm production, are expected at FASER$\nu$. As a representative application, we demonstrate the sensitivity of muon DIS at FASER$\nu$ to probe the (intrinsic) charm content of the proton at large-$x$. We also provide predictions for event yields of muon DIS for future FASER runs and for the proposed Forward Physics Facility.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of axial anomaly effects in hot two-color QCD: FRG approach in the linear sigma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal properties of hadrons in two-color quantum chromodynamics (QC$_2$D) using the functional renormalization group (FRG) method, with particular focus on modifications of the $U(1)$ axial anomaly effects. The hadrons are described by a linear sigma model (LSM) based on the Pauli-G\"{u}rsey $SU(4)$ symmetry, which incorporates both low-lying $0^\pm$ mesons and diquark baryons. We find that all quartic couplings are comparably suppressed when physical values of the pion mass and decay constant are taken as inputs, for which a reasonably smooth chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature is reproduced. Consequently, mass differences among chiral partners remain small. Despite these tiny mass differences, mass degeneracies of chiral partners in the hot medium are clearly demonstrated, consistent with chiral symmetry restoration. Moreover, we find that the couplings responsible for the $U(1)$ axial anomaly are enhanced upon entering the finite temperature regime. Baryonic fluctuations also provide sizable contributions to these enhancements. Finally, the fate of the topological susceptibility in the hot QC$_2$D medium is examined.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter signals in solar neutrinos fluxes as probe of non-linear symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) particles gravitationally captured by the Sun can accumulate in its core and subsequently annihilate, producing neutrino fluxes that may be detectable on Earth. The intensity of these fluxes is highly sensitive to the properties of the underlying DM model, especially when the DM candidate is a scalar particle originating from spontaneous or non-linear symmetry breaking mechanisms. In this work, we explore the potential of solar neutrino fluxes to distinguish between the Standard Model extended by a scalar singlet and the non-linear Higgs portal scenarios in the context of a future DM discovery. We compute the expected neutrino fluxes within the regions of parameter space consistent with both relic density and current direct detection limits. Our results show that the non-linear model predicts neutrino fluxes that are systematically larger than those of the linear case, typically by at least one order of magnitude, and up to six orders of magnitude for DM masses around 1 TeV. These findings suggest that solar neutrino observations could provide a valuable probe to discriminate between these competing dark matter frameworks.</description>

      <title>Identification of $D^*_2(3000)$ as the $D_2^*(2^3P_2)$ and exploring potential of undiscovered $2^+$ mesons via $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the discovery of the $D^*_2(3000)$, its mass and full width have been extensively studied. Yet its nature remains undetermined to date. Since it was discovered through nonleptonic decay of $B$ meson and the corresponding cascade process, we therefore in this paper investigate the nonleptonic and semileptonic decays of $B$ meson to $J^P = 2^+$ charmed mesons using the Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Our calculations on nonleptonic $B$ decays reveal that the unconfirmed resonance $D^*_2(3000)$ aligns well with $D^*_2(2^3P_2)$ predictions. Other candidates, including $D^*_2(1^3F_2)$, $D^*_2(3^3P_2)$, and $D^*_2(2^3F_2)$, are excluded due to their very small branching ratios in $B$ decays. Considering that the $D^*_2(1F)$, $D^*_2(3P)$, and $D^*_2(2F)$ have not yet been experimentally observed, we investigate the feasibility of their detection in $B$-meson decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the fixed-order distribution of the non-global hemisphere mass observable in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation up to four loops for various sequential recombination jet algorithms. In particular, we focus on the $k_t$ and Cambridge/Aachen algorithms. Using eikonal theory and strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons, we determine the complete structure of both abelian (clustering) and non-abelian non-global logarithms through four loops in perturbation theory. We compare the resulting resummed expressions for both jet algorithms with the standard Sudakov form factor and demonstrate that neglecting these logarithms leads to unreliable phenomenological predictions for the observable's distribution.</description>

      <title>Study of the beyond standard model interaction using Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phenomenological studies are carried out to find the potential reach of a detector to constraints on possible beyond the standard model general neutrino interactions in the neutrino-quark sector, for the proposed Indian Coherent Neutrino-nucleus Scattering Experiment (ICNSE) at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in India. Reactors of different core configuration and power are used as sources of electron antineutrinos. The study has been carried out considering a target mass of 10 kg and an exposure of one year. It has been found that the ICNSE detector has a significant capacity to limit the majority of the Non-standard Interaction(NSI) parameter space. It has also been observed that a combination of results from two different types of detectors such as sapphire and high-purity germanium can significantly improve sensitivity by reducing the degeneracies between some pairs of NSI parameters to a smaller region.</description>

      <title>MATRIX HAWAII: PineAPPL interpolation grids with MATRIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interface between PineAPPL and Matrix, which allows fully differential cross sections to be calculated in the form of interpolation grids, accurate at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD and next-to-leading order in electroweak (EW) theory. This interface is the first publicly available tool to calculate interpolation grids at NNLO QCD accuracy for a wide set of processes. Interpolation grids provide the functionality to compute predictions for arbitrary parton distribution functions (PDFs) as well as PDF uncertainties without the need to repeat the actual calculation. Another important application of the these grids is to perform global analyses of PDFs using exact NNLO calculations instead of $K$-factors, which have several drawbacks. This exact treatment of NNLO corrections is also an important prerequisite for fitting PDFs at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order level with reliable uncertainties. The new version of the Matrix code interfaced to PineAPPL, as well as the grids produced for this publication, are available on the Matrix website and on PloughShare, respectively.</description>

      <title>Scalar Triple-Heavy Tetraquark States With Quark Content $cc\bar{c}\bar{s}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the scalar triple-heavy tetraquark states with quark content $cc\bar{c}\bar{s}$, $\eta_{c}D_{s}$ molecular state and $[cc]_{A(T)}[\bar{c}\bar{s}]_{A(T)}$ compact tetraquark states, by the QCD sum rule method. First, we construct the needed interpolating currents, $J^{M}(x)$, $J^{T_{1}}(x)$, and $J^{T_{2}}(x)$. Then, we derive the sum rules for the masses and the current coupling constants. Finally, we numerically analyze these sum rules, and find $m_{M}=4.9392^{+0.0851}_{-0.0817}~\mbox{GeV}$, and $\lambda_{M}=2.8857^{+0.5729}_{-0.4928}\times10^{-2}~\mbox{GeV}^{5}$ for the mass and the current coupling constant of the $\eta_{c}D_{s}$ molecular state, $m_{T_{1}}=5.0774^{+0.0708}_{-0.0641}~\mbox{GeV}$, and $\lambda_{T_{1}}=1.0436^{+0.1862}_{-0.1573}\times10^{-1}~\mbox{GeV}^{5}$ for the mass and the current coupling constant of the $[cc]_{A}[\bar{c}\bar{s}]_{A}$ compact tetraquark state, $m_{T_{2}}=5.0679^{+0.0839}_{-0.0721}~\mbox{GeV}$, and $\lambda_{T_{2}}=2.0316^{+0.4119}_{-0.3119}\times10^{-1}~\mbox{GeV}^{5}$ for the mass and the current coupling constant of the $[cc]_{T}[\bar{c}\bar{s}]_{T}$ compact tetraquark state.</description>

      <title>Toponia at the HL-LHC, CEPC, and FCC-ee</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of a pseudoscalar toponium state at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) opens a new avenue for the study of a novel class of QCD bound states with comparable formation and decay times. Compared to charmonium and bottomonium, toponium is a more loosely bound state, resembling a hydrogen atom of the strong interactions, although it appears as a broader resonance. We compute the masses and annihilation decay widths of the lowest $S$-wave ($\eta_t$, $\psi_t$) and $P$-wave ($\chi_{t0}$, $\chi_{t1}$) toponium states, and assess their discovery prospects at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and future lepton colliders such as the Circular Electron-Positron Collider (CEPC) and $e^+e^-$ stage of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). Detecting the vector $\psi_t$ state at the HL-LHC is hindered by the Landau-Yang theorem and the collider's gluon-dominated nature, while lepton colliders offer discoverable sensitivity through both constituent and two-body decays. A more precise measurement of $\eta_t$ mass (approximately equal to that of $\psi_t$) at the LHC could help determine the optimal $t\bar{t}$ threshold center-of-mass energy for CEPC and FCC-ee. $P$-wave states remain challenging to observe at both the HL-LHC and future lepton colliders. We also discuss how we can use toponium measurements to probe top quark properties and to conduct indirect searches for new physics, including light scalars coupling to the top quark.</description>

      <title>The QCD scalar susceptibility and thermal scalar resonances in chiral symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon recent results on the role of thermal resonances in chiral symmetry restoration, we show that a description of the QCD scalar susceptibility at finite temperature $T$ saturated by the thermal properties of the lightest scalar resonance, the $f_0(500)$, is compatible both with lattice QCD data at nonzero $T$ and with the $T=0$ light resonance properties coming from experimental data. The thermal $f_0(500)$ is generated within the framework of Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory. This method allows us to achieve a good description of lattice QCD results with a reliable pion mass dependence. In particular, we perform direct fits to the chiral susceptibility measured in lattice data at different pion masses and temperatures, obtaining a remarkable agreement for the susceptibility and for mass differences of the light quark condensate. In addition, the fitted low-energy constants are compatible with $T=0$ phenomenology. Our results confirm the role of unitarized approaches and thermal resonances in the dynamics of the QCD transition.</description>

      <title>Inflation in the Scale Symmetric Standard Model and Weyl geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the possibility of inflation in a scale-symmetric extension of the Standard Model Higgs sector, where the Higgs field $\phi_1$ is coupled to a singlet scalar, the dilaton $\phi_0$. The two-scalar theory is formulated within Weyl geometry, which modifies the Einstein frame form of the resulting single-field inflationary potential. We extend the analysis to include quantum corrections, incorporating curvature effects in the one-loop effective potential. We find that the resulting spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.002}$ can be consistent with the Planck 2018 observational constraints. The predicted value $r_{0.002} \lesssim 10^{-6}$ remains too small to yield a detectable gravitational wave signal. In the regime with a strong hierarchy between the non-minimal couplings, $\xi_1\ll\xi_0$, the unitarity cutoff in the large-field background, $\Lambda_{UV}\sim M_P/\sqrt{\xi_1}$, lies below the energy scales relevant during inflation.</description>

      <title>Axion-like particle limits from multi-messenger sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy neutrino observation from the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 offers new insights into the non-thermal processes of active galactic nuclei. Simultaneous gamma-rays emitted by such sources can possibly oscillate into axion-like particles (ALPs) when propagating through astrophysical magnetic fields, potentially modifying the observed spectrum. To probe for ALP-induced signals, a robust understanding of the emission processes at the source is necessary. In this work, we perform a dedicated multi-messenger analysis by modeling a jet in the innermost vicinity of the central supermassive black hole of NGC 1068. We model in particular the neutrino and gamma-ray emission originating in lepto-hadronic collisions between jet accelerated particles and background particles from the corona, reproducing both the Fermi-LAT and IceCube data. These source models serve as a baseline for ALP searches, and we derive limits on the ALP-photon coupling by marginalizing over motivated ranges of astrophysical parameters. We find $g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 7 \times 10^{-11}$GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-9}$ eV. These limits may be weaker than existing constraints, but they demonstrate the potential of multi-messenger observations to probe new physics. We conclude by discussing how additional upcoming multi-messenger sources and improved observational precision can enhance ALP sensitivity.</description>

      <title>An extension of the SM with vector-like quarks and hypothetical heavy bosons: model independent parametrisation at NLO order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model independent parameterization of an extension of the Standard Model including vector-like quarks, new heavy gauge bosons and an extra scalar, involving a minimal number of free parameters, is introduced. Theoretical constraints on the model couplings and hypothetical particle masses are established by making use of perturbative unitarity. The production of heavy charged and neutral gauge bosons which subsequently decay to vector-like quarks at the LHC are investigated at both leading-order and next-to-leading order. The predictions of the model are obtained by using 3 approaches: the narrow-width-approximation, the complex mass scheme and a mix of both, where the advantages and weaknesses of each method are emphasized. This study demonstrates that, for certain configurations, off-shell effects remain significant even when the width-to-mass ratios of the unstable particles are sufficiently small, rendering the narrow-width approximation unreliable and necessitating the use of the complex mass scheme. The predictions are compared with CMS {\tt run II} data, where lower bounds on the charged heavy gauge boson mass are set as function of the free parameter normalizing their coupling to quarks.</description>

      <title>Analysis of three-body charmed $B$ meson decays $B \to {D}(V^* \to){V P}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically analyze the decays $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} (V^* \to)\, V\, P$, where $V^*$ represents a vector resonance ($\rho, \, \omega$ or $K^*$), and $V P$ denotes the final-state meson pairs $ \omega\, \pi$, $ \rho\, \pi$ and $ \rho \, K$. The intermediate subprocesses $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} V^*$ are calculated in the factorization-assisted topological-amplitude approach, while the intermediate resonant states $V^*$ are modeled using a relativistic Breit-Wigner distribution, subsequently decaying into $VP$ through strong interactions. We predict the off-shell effects of the ground-state resonances ($\rho,\, \omega, \, K^*$) in $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} (V^* \to )V P$. Our results show that the virtual contributions from $\rho \to \omega \, \pi$, $\omega \to \rho\, \pi$, and $K^* \to \rho\, K$ are crucial for these three-body decays, $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} V\, P$. In particular, the branching fractions arising from the $\rho$ and $\omega$ virtual effects can be comparable to the total decay rates of $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} \omega\, \pi$ and $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} \rho\, \pi$, respectively. Decays with branching fractions of order $10^{-6}-10^{-4}$ are expected to be measurable at Belle II and LHCb. Compared with previous perturbative QCD predictions for $B_{(s)} \to D_{(s)} (\rho \to)\, \omega\, \pi$, our results are consistent but exhibit higher precision.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <title>Microphysical Origins of Gravitational Potentials in Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most astrophysical systems (except for very compact objects such as, e.g., black holes and neutron stars) in our universe are characterized by shallow gravitational potentials, with dimensionless compactness parameter. While the existence and characteristic scales of such virialized systems depend on gravity, we demonstrate that the value of the compactness -- and thus the non-relativistic nature of most astrophysical objects -- arises from microphysical parameters, specifically the fine structure constant and the electron-to-proton mass ratio, and is fundamentally independent of the gravitational constant G. It then follows that large-scale astrophysical velocities and escape velocities associated with virialized systems are determined by electromagnetic and atomic physics, not by gravitation, and that the compactness is always set by microphysical scales -- even for the most compact objects, such as neutron stars, where the compactness is determined by quantities like the pion-to-proton mass ratio. This observation, largely overlooked in the literature, explains why the universe is not dominated by relativistic, compact objects and connects the low entropy of the observable universe to underlying microphysics. Our results emphasize the central but underappreciated role played by dimensionless microphysical constants in shaping the macroscopic gravitational landscape of the universe. In particular, we clarify that this independence of compactness from G applies specifically to entire, virialized, naturally formed astrophysical systems -- such as stars, galaxies, and planets -- that have reached equilibrium through self-gravity and microphysical processes. In contrast, arbitrary non-virialized subsystems (e.g., a piece cut from a planet) do not exhibit this property.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Geometry of the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum structure of a quantum field theory is a crucial property. In theories with extended symmetries, such as supersymmetric gauge theories, the vacuum is typically a continuous manifold, called the vacuum moduli space, parametrized by the expectation values of scalar fields. Starting from the R-parity preserving superpotential at renormalizable order, we use Gr\"obner bases to determine the explicit structure, as an algebraic variety, of the vacuum geometry of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. Gr\"obner bases have doubly exponential computational complexity (for this case, $7^{2^{1023}}$ operations); we exploit symmetry and multigrading to render the computation tractable. This geometry has three irreducible components of complex dimensions $1$, $15$, and $29$, each being a so-called rational variety. The defining equations of the components express the solutions to F-terms and D-terms in terms of the gauge invariant operators and are interpreted in terms of classical geometric constructions.</description>

      <title>The Vacuum Moduli Space of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A starting point in the study of the minimal supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) is the vacuum moduli space, which is a highly complicated algebraic variety: it is the image of an affine variety $X \subset \mathbb{C}^{49}$ under a symplectic quotient map $\phi$ to $\mathbb{C}^{973}$. Previous work computed the vacuum moduli space of the electroweak sector; geometrically this corresponds to studying a restriction of $\phi$: $\mathbb{C}^{13} \stackrel{\phi^{\texttt{res}}}{\longrightarrow} \mathbb{C}^{22}$. We analyze the geometry of the full vacuum moduli space for superpotentials $W_{\rm minimal}$ (without neutrinos) and $W_{\rm MSSM}$ (with neutrinos) in $\mathbb{C}^{973}$. In both cases, we prove that $X$ consists of three irreducible components $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$, and determine the images $M_i$ of the $X_i$ under $\phi$. For $W_{\rm minimal}$ we show they have, respectively, dimensions $1$, $15$, and $29$, and prove that each of the $M_i$ is a rational variety, while for $W_{\rm MSSM}$ we show that $M_3$ is the only component. Restricting the $M_i$ to the electroweak sector, we recover known results. We describe the components of the vacuum moduli space geometrically in terms of incidence varieties to a product of Segre varieties.</description>

      <title>Particle Spectra in the Integrated HydroKinetic Model at RHIC BES Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the description and prediction of particle production in Au+Au collisions at various center-of-mass energies ($\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}} = 7.7, 11.5, 14.5, 19.6, 27.0, \text{ and } 39.0$ GeV), using the Integrated HydroKinetic model (iHKM). The iHKM, initially created for the description of ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, has been extended to cover intermediate and low relativistic energies, ranging from 2.5 to 50 GeV per colliding nucleon pair, and in cases where this distinction is needed, we refer to the modified version as iHKMe. The study explores the sensitivity of model predictions to variations in key parameters, including the relaxation time and thermalization degree during the prethermal stage, as well as the nature of the equation of state transition in the hydrodynamic phase. The iHKM successfully reproduces experimental results from the STAR experiment within the RHIC Beam Energy Scan program, with particular emphasis on midrapidity ($|y| &lt; 0.1$) observables such as particle multiplicity densities ($dN/dy$), average transverse momenta ($\langle p_T \rangle$), and particle yield ratios. In addition, the paper examines the evolution of chemical and kinetic freeze-out across different collision energies and centrality classes. These results offer a consistent description of the collective properties of strongly interacting matter formed in heavy-ion collisions, spanning a wide range of energies and baryon chemical potentials at RHIC.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation Signatures from Primordial Black Holes Transiting the Inner Solar System: Prospects for Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) arise from the collapse of density perturbations in the early universe and serve as a dark matter (DM) candidate and a probe of fundamental physics. There remains an unconstrained ``asteroid-mass'' window where PBHs of masses $10^{17} {\rm g} \lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} {\rm g}$ could comprise up to $100\%$ of the dark matter. Current $e^{\pm}$ Hawking radiation constraints on the DM fraction of PBHs are set by comparing observed spatial- and time-integrated cosmic ray flux measurements with predicted Hawking emission fluxes from the galactic DM halo. These constraints depend on cosmic ray production and propagation models, the galactic DM density distribution, and the PBH mass function. We propose to mitigate these model dependencies by developing a new local, time-dependent Hawking radiation signature to detect low-mass PBHs transiting through the inner Solar System. We calculate transit rates for PBHs that form with initial masses $M \lesssim 5\times10^{17}\text{g}$. We then simulate time-dependent positron signals from individual PBH flybys as measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) experiment in low-Earth orbit. We find that AMS is sensitive to PBHs with masses $M\lesssim 2\times10^{14} \, {\rm g}$ due to its lower energy threshold of $500 \, {\rm MeV}$. We demonstrate that a dataset of daily positron fluxes over the energy range $5-500 \, {\rm MeV}$, with similar levels of precision to the existing AMS data, would enable detection of PBHs drawn from present-day distributions that peak within the asteroid-mass window. Our simulations yield ${\cal O} (1)$ detectable PBH transits per year across wide regions of parameter space, which may be used to constrain PBH mass functions. This technique could be extended to detect $\gamma$-ray and X-ray Hawking emission to probe further into the asteroid-mass window.</description>

      <title>Enhancing photon-axion conversion probability with squeezed coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In particle physics, axions and axion-like particles are ubiquitous. Remarkably, ultra-light axions could constitute dark matter or dark energy. Therefore, it is important to detect axions experimentally. In the presence of a magnetic field, a photon can be converted into an axion, and vice versa. Utilizing the conversion phenomenon, several methods for detecting axions have been proposed. To improve detectability, it is desirable to use quantum sensing. However, since the conversion process is usually treated as classical wave dynamics, it is unclear how to incorporate quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we formulate the photon-axion conversion in a quantum field theoretical manner. As a result, we succeed in evaluating the conversion probability from a photon quantum state to an axion quantum state. In particular, it turns out that squeezed coherent states with N photons added can significantly enhance the conversion probability.</description>

      <title>The power of SKA to Constrain cosmological gravitational-wave backgrounds below the astrophysical foreground noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inspirals of supermaissive black hole binaries provide a convinced gravitational wave background in the nHz band, serving as the fiducial model of the recent gravitational wave signal reported by the PTA experiments. The uncertainties of the number of binaries contributing to each frequency bin introduce a foreground noise in the nHz and $\mu$Hz bands against the observation of the underlying gravitational wave backgrounds of the cosmological origin. In this work, we investigate a new method to constrain the cosmological gravitational wave strength under the astrophysical foreground. The energy density fluctuations from cosmological gravitational-wave sources can generally trigger the formation of compact subhalos of dark matter, and the upcoming Square Kilometer Array has the ability to constrain the abundance of the subhalos at the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ level. The cosmological gravitational wave energy spectra from various sources are expected to be constrained several orders of magnitude below the astrophysical foreground, providing more strict constraints on the parameter spaces of corresponding new physics models.</description>

      <title>The AdS Perspective on the Nonlinear Tails in Black Hole Ringdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes gradually settle into their static configuration by emitting gravitational waves, whose amplitude diminish over time according to a power-law decay at fixed spatial locations. We show that the nonlinear tails in the presence of a quadratic source, which have been recently found to potentially dominate over the linear ones, can be simply derived from the AdS$_2$$\times$S$^2$ spacetime perspective with their amplitudes being related to the Aretakis constants.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models -- the Future of Fundamental Physics?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For many fundamental physics applications, transformers, as the state of the art in learning complex correlations, benefit from pretraining on quasi-out-of-domain data. The obvious question is whether we can exploit Large Language Models, requiring proper out-of-domain transfer learning. We show how the Qwen2.5 LLM can be used to analyze and generate SKA data, specifically 3D maps of the cosmological large-scale structure for a large part of the observable Universe. We combine the LLM with connector networks and show, for cosmological parameter regression and lightcone generation, that this Lightcone LLM (L3M) with Qwen2.5 weights outperforms standard initialization and compares favorably with dedicated networks of matching size.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of the neutrino transmission coefficient at high energies to the Earth's density profile</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flux of atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos measured in UHE neutrino detectors is strongly dependent on the description of the propagation and absorption of the neutrinos during the passage through Earth to the detector. In particular, the attenuation of the incident neutrino flux depends on the details of the matter structure between the source and the detector. In this paper, we will investigate the impact of different descriptions for the density profile of Earth on the transmission coefficient, defined as the ratio between the flux measured in the detector and the incoming neutrino flux. We will consider five different models for the Earth's density profile and estimate how these different models modify the target column density and transmission coefficients for different flavors. The results are derived by solving the cascade equations taking into account the NC interactions and tau regeneration. A comparison with approximated solutions is also presented. Our results indicated that the predictions are sensitive to the model considered for the density profile, with the simplified three layer model providing a satisfactory description when compared with the PREM results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a mechanism by which a misaligned ALP can be dynamically converted into a dark photon in the presence of a background magnetic field. An abundance of non-relativistic ALPs will convert to dark photons with momentum of order the inhomogeneities in the background field; therefore a highly homogeneous field will produce non-relativistic dark photons without relying on any redshifting of their momenta. Taking hidden sector magnetic fields produced by a first order phase transition, the mechanism can reproduce the relic abundance of dark matter for a wide range of dark photon masses down to $10^{-13}$ eV.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the mixed $Z/ \gamma$ PDF at muon colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the role of the $Z/\gamma$-interference parton distribution function (PDF) in high-energy muon colliders. We review how this PDF emerges when electroweak interactions are applied to the collinear splitting process and show that the leading-order approximation is significantly suppressed due to an accidental cancellation. However, this suppression does not appear in the leading-logarithm resummed numerical result, where the $Z/\gamma$ PDF is instead comparable to those of other electroweak gauge bosons. By extending the analytical approximation to next-to-leading order, we show the mechanism by which the suppression is lifted and provide a more accurate approximation to the numerical result. Furthermore, we explore the impact of the $Z/\gamma$ PDF in several processes at future muon colliders. High-energy Compton scattering is identified as a promising process for observing experimentally this peculiar electroweak effect with high precision. We also quantify the impact of the $Z/\gamma$ PDF on Higgs physics and, as a new physics example, in resonant single-production of axion-like particles (ALP).</description>

      <title>Evidence of Dark Energy Prior to its Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a review and statistical analysis of the evidence supporting the existence of a cosmological constant in the early 1990s, before its discovery made with distant supernovae in 1998. The earlier evidence was derived from newly precise measurements of the Universe, including its mass density, the Hubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, the filamentary large-scale structure, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. These measurements created tension for models assuming the cosmological constant was zero. This tension was alleviated by several insightful papers published before 1996, which proposed a cosmological constant that increased the expansion rate. Statistical analysis here shows that the probability of the cosmological constant being zero was demonstrably less than a few percent. Some models identified a best-fit value close to the modern estimate of Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19348v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce an explicit P-wave to construct the diquarks $[qc]_{\widehat{V}}$, then construct the local four-quark currents to explore the hidden-charm tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$, $1^{+-}$ and $2^{++}$ in the framework of the QCD sum rules at length. Our calculations indicate that the light-flavor $SU(3)$ breaking effects on the tetraquark masses are tiny. The predictions support assigning the $X(4475)$ and $X(4500)$ as the $[uc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{uc}]_{\widehat{V}}-[dc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{dc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ and $[sc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{sc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=0^{++}$ respectively, and assigning the $Z_{c}(4600)$ and $Z_{\bar{c}\bar{s}}(4600)$ as the $[uc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{dc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ and $[qc]_{\widehat{V}}[\overline{sc}]_{\widehat{V}}$ tetraquark states with the $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$ respectively. On the other hand, there is no room for the $X(4710)$ and $X(4700)$. Combined with previous works, the $X(4475)$, $X(4500)$, $Z_{c}(4600)$ and $Z_{\bar{c}\bar{s}}(4600)$ might have other important Fock components besides the $\widehat{V}\widehat{V}$ type components.</description>

Abstract: We compute the leading clustering (abelian non-global) logarithms, which arise in the distribution of non-global QCD observables when final-state partons are clustered using the $k_t$ jet algorithm, up to six loops in perturbation theory. Our calculations are based on the recently introduced formula for the analytic structure of $k_t$ clustering [1]. These logarithms exhibit a pattern of exponentiation and are subsequently resummed into an exponential form. We compare this resummed result with all-orders numerical calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions in the low-energy effective field theory (LEFT): the effects at dimension five in the power counting. Our calculation is performed in a basis with generic mass matrices, we employ the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, and we correct for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects by including the appropriate finite counterterms. We also provide results for the $CP$-even sector in a scheme that coincides with naive dimensional regularization. We discuss two methods to avoid the explicit construction of gauge-variant operators, which in principle are needed for the cancellation of sub-divergences, even in the background-field method. The two methods are consistent with each other and with existing partial results. Our work is a further step towards a complete EFT framework for physics beyond the Standard Model at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the large-$N_c$ structure of the baryon-baryon potential derived in the framework of SU(3) chiral perturbation theory up to next-to-leading order including contact interactions as well as one-meson and two-meson exchange diagrams. Moreover, we assess the impact of SU(3) symmetry breaking from a large-$N_c$ perspective and show that the leading order results can successfully be applied to the hyperon-nucleon potential. Our results include a reduction of the number of relevant low-energy constants of the leading order contact interaction from fifteen to three, and we show that consistency is preserved if the $F/D$ ratio is given by $2/3$ and the $C/D$ ratio for the baryon decuplet-to-octet coupling is given by 2.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixings and charged lepton flavor violation in a 3-3-1 model with inverse seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18550v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a extension of the 3-3-1 gauge model supplemented by an $A_4$ flavor symmetry and cyclic discrete symmetries, including $Z_2$, $Z_2'$, $Z_3$, $Z_4$, $Z_7$ and $Z_{10}$. The model successfully reproduces the observed SM fermion mass hierarchies and mixing patterns in quark and lepton sectors. The smallness of the active neutrino masses is explained through an inverse seesaw mechanism, enabled by the introduction of right-handed and sterile Majorana neutrinos. In the quark sector, flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) arise at tree level exclusively for up-type quarks via the new heavy neutral gauge boson exchange, leading to strong constraints from $D^0$ - $\bar{D}^0$ mixing. The charged lepton sector exhibits sizeable flavor-violating effects, especially in the $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ decay, mediated by loops involving heavy neutrinos, new charged gauge bosons as well as charged scalars. We perform a detailed numerical fit of fermion masses and mixing parameters and identify viable regions of parameter space consistent with experimental data on CKM and PMNS mixing matrices. The model predicts branching ratios for charged lepton flavor violating decays and $\mu$-$e$ conversion rates within the sensitivity of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Fermion Masses and Mixing in Pati-Salam Unification with $S_3$ Modular Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular invariance has recently paved new promising directions in flavor model building. Motivated by this development, we present in this work the first implementation of the $S_3$ modular symmetry within the Pati-Salam unification framework, addressing the flavor structure of quarks and leptons. Assigning left- and right-handed matter fields as $S_3$ doublets or singlets, we propose three benchmark models that achieve compelling fits to sixteen observables including charged fermion mass ratios and flavor mixing parameters. Light neutrino masses arise via the type-I seesaw mechanism, and neutrino oscillation parameters are explored in light of the latest NuFIT-6.0 results. All models favor a normal neutrino mass ordering, with the atmospheric mixing angle lie in the lower octant. For models I and III, the effective Majorana mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ is within the reach of upcoming neutrinoless double-beta decay experiments, while it is too small to be detected in model II. Predicted leptonic CP-violating phases, the sum of active neutrino masses, and Majorana phases span wide but distinctive ranges, enabling future experiments to test and differentiate the proposed models.</description>

Abstract: We study the pole trajectory of the recently established subthreshold negative parity nucleon pole, namely the $N^*(920)$, with varying pion masses, in the scheme of linear $\sigma$ model with nucleons using the $N/D$ unitarization method. We find that as the pion mass increases, the pole moves toward the real axis. For larger pion masses, at tree level, the pole falls to a specific point on $u$-channel cut and crosses to the adjacent Riemann sheet defined by the logarithmic $u$ channel cut. At one-loop level, the pole does not meet the $u$-cut up to $m_\pi=0.36$GeV. We also re-examined the $\sigma$ pole trajectory and find it in good agreement with Roy equation analysis result.</description>

      <title>Probing triple-gauge couplings in anomalous gauge theories at hadron and lepton colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge anomalous quantum field theories are inconsistent as full UV theories since they lead to the breaking of Lorentz invariance or Unitarity, as well as non-renormalizability. It is well known, however, that they can be interpreted as effective field theories (EFT) with a cut-off. The latter cannot be made arbitrarily large and it is related to the energy scale at which additional fermions with suitable gauge charges enter, rendering the full model anomaly-free. A nondecoupling effect that remains in the EFT is the appearance of anomalous loop-induced triple-gauge couplings, encapsulating information from the full UV theory. In this work we take as an example an Abelian gauge symmetry $U(1)'_\mu$ under which $2^{nd}$-generation leptons are axially charged, leading to an EFT that consists of the Standard Model (SM) with an additional massive $Z'$ gauge boson. As a consequence, there are triple gauge couplings involving the $Z'$ and Electroweak SM gauge bosons via mixed gauge anomalies. We study the possibility of probing these loop suppressed anomalous couplings at hadron and lepton colliders, with $Z'$-lepton couplings allowed by current experimental bounds, finding that due to the large SM backgrounds and small signal, the HL-LHC is incapable of this task. The 100 TeV $pp$ collider at $\mathcal{L}=20~\mathrm {ab}^{-1}$ on the other hand could probe anomalous couplings for $m_{Z'}\in[150,800]~\mathrm{GeV}$ and obtain discovery significances for $m_{Z'}\in[230,330]~\mathrm{GeV}$. Lepton colliders are also well suited for probing these anomalous couplings. In particular we show that a muon collider running at the $Z'$-resonance and an electron-positron collider such as CLIC with $\sqrt{s}=3~{\rm TeV}$ can be complimentary in probing the anomalous couplings for $m_{Z'}\in[100,700]~{\rm GeV}$, with CLIC sensitive to discovery for $m_{Z'}\in[125,225]~{\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study six-dimensional $SU(n)$ gauge models with rank-reducing discrete boundary conditions on the orbifold $T^2/{\mathbb Z}_4$, without and with continuous Wilson line phases. For the latter case, we find that a minimal model can describe the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry based on an $SU(6)$ gauge group. This model possesses excellent features that two Higgs doublets come from the zero modes of the extra-dimensional gauge field, and the quarks in each generation can be unified into one multiplet, without exotic quarks, as the zero modes of a bulk field in the $\boldsymbol{15}$ representation of $SU(6)$. There exists a vacuum where the electroweak symmetry is slightly broken by the Hosotani mechanism, with the addition of suitable bulk fields. %adding suitable bulk fields, and Interestingly, quadratic divergences are not reintroduced into the Higgs masses from the tadpole terms of the field strength localized on fixed points, not only at one-loop level but also at higher orders.</description>

      <title>Multimessenger Astronomy Beyond the Standard Model: New Window from Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight bosonic (ULB) fields with mass $m_{\phi} \ll 1$~eV often arise in theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such fields exist, violent astrophysical events that result in emission of gravitational wave, photon, or neutrino signals could also produce bursts of high-density relativistic ULB fields. Detection of such ULB fields in terrestrial or space-based laboratories correlated with other signals from transient astrophysical events opens a novel avenue for multimessenger astronomy. We show that quantum sensors are particularly well-suited to observe emitted scalar and pseudoscalar axion-like ULB fields coupled to SM. We demonstrate that multimessenger astronomy with ULB fields is possible even when accounting for matter screening effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known since the 1950's that an unstable particle is associated with a complex pole in the propagator. This had to be rediscovered twice: in the early 1970's in the context of hadronic resonances, and in the early 1990's in the context of the $Z$ boson. The physical mass of the particle is the real part of the pole in the complex energy plane. In hadronic physics, this replaced the ``Breit-Wigner mass,'' which was found to depend on the parameterization of the ``energy-dependent width.'' In $Z$ physics, it replaced the ``on-shell'' mass, which was found to be gauge dependent. Although the mass defined from the complex pole position has been widely discussed in the literature, it has not yet made its way into quantum field theory textbooks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As in previous decades, a comprehensive understanding of the intricate internal configuration of hadrons continues to be a central objective within both experimental and theoretical hadron physics. This pursuit plays a pivotal role in advancing our knowledge of QCD and critically evaluating the robustness and accuracy of the theoretical models developed to date. Furthermore, deciphering the underlying mechanisms of exotic states, both those currently observed and those anticipated in future experiments, remains a pressing and unresolved challenge. Motivated by this, in the present study, we investigate the electromagnetic properties of the $D \bar D_1(2420)$ and $D^* \bar D^*(2400)$ molecular tetraquark states with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 1^{--}$, using the QCD light-cone sum rule method. These states are analyzed within a hadronic molecular framework, where their magnetic and quadrupole moments are computed to probe internal structure and geometric deformation. Our results reveal distinct electromagnetic signatures, with the magnetic moments primarily dominated by light-quark contributions, and the quadrupole moments suggesting an oblate charge distribution. The findings are compared with prior studies assuming compact tetraquark configurations, emphasizing the sensitivity of electromagnetic observables to the underlying hadronic structure. This analysis provides critical insights into the nature of exotic hadrons and contributes to the broader understanding of QCD dynamics in the non-perturbative regime.</description>

      <title>Viability of warm inflation with standard model interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal warm inflation scenario proposed in Ref. [1] -- featuring an axionlike inflaton coupled to Standard Model (SM) gluons via the standard interaction $\phi G \tilde G$ -- offers a compelling bridge between inflationary dynamics and SM particle content. While the model retains only the inflaton as a beyond-SM field, its original analysis relied on some approximate treatments of warm inflation's (WI) dynamics. Here, we revisit this scenario using WI2easy, a precision computational tool for WI dynamics [2], to rigorously evaluate the model's viability and full range of model's parameters compatible with the observational parameters. Overall, we find that the results of Ref. [1] hold, but with significant differences in the weak and strong dissipative regimes of WI.</description>

      <title>A topological contribution to Bogoliubov coefficient for cosmological particle production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle production in cosmology is often efficiently computed in terms of Bogoliubov transforms. Restricting to a particular class of dispersion relationships, we identify a map between the number of particles produced in a special kinematic limit and a Stokes phenomena related topology of analytic continuation of the Bogoliubov coefficient functions. Intuitively, this kinematic limit corresponds to the long wavelength limit although a more precise description depends on the nature of the curved spacetime. To identify the topology, we reformulate the usual Bogoliubov computations as a type of SU(1,1) gauged differential equation and utilize a special gauge together with a discrete symmetry that naturally characterizes the dispersion relationship. Using a dark matter model and a nonzero constant spatial curvature model, we estimate how such topological contributions will arise in physical applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Beyond Planck? Constraints from multiple CMB probes, DESI BAO and Type-Ia Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration, when combined with Planck satellite Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data and Type Ia Supernovae, suggest a preference for Dynamical Dark Energy (DDE) at a significance level ranging from $2.8\sigma$ to $4.2\sigma$. In this work, I test whether, and to what extent, this preference is supported by CMB experiments other than Planck. I analyze the latest Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and South Pole Telescope (SPT) temperature, polarization, and lensing spectra at small scales, eventually combining them with Planck or WMAP 9-year observations at large angular scales. My analysis shows that ACT and WMAP data, when combined with DESI BAO and Pantheon-plus Supernovae, yield independent constraints with a precision comparable to Planck. Notably, in this case, the cosmological constant value is recovered within two standard deviations. A preference for DDE reappears when Pantheon-plus is replaced with distance moduli measurements from the Dark Energy Survey Supernova program (DESy5). However, it remains less pronounced compared to the Planck-based results. When considering SPT data, no clear preference for DDE is found in combinations involving Pantheon-plus Supernovae, and the preference is significantly weaker in combinations involving DESy5. Overall, CMB experiments other than Planck generally weaken the evidence for DDE. I argue that the subsets of Planck data that strengthen the shift toward DDE are the temperature and E-mode polarization anisotropy measurements at large angular scales $\ell \lesssim 30$.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Disruption of Axion Minihalos by Multiple Stellar Encounters in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If QCD axion dark matter formed post-inflation, axion miniclusters emerged from isocurvature fluctuations and later merged hierarchically into minihalos. These minihalos, potentially disrupted by stellar encounters in the Milky Way, affect axion detectability. We extend prior analyses by more accurately incorporating multiple stellar encounters and dynamical relaxation timescales, simulating minihalo orbits in the Galactic potential.
  Our results show stellar interactions are more destructive than previously estimated, reducing minihalo mass retention at the solar system to ~30\%, compared to earlier estimates of ~60\%. This enhanced loss arises from cumulative energy injections when relaxation periods between stellar encounters are accounted for.
  The altered minihalo mass function implies a larger fraction of axion dark matter occupies inter-minihalo space, potentially increasing the local axion density and improving haloscope detection prospects. This work highlights the significance of detailed modeling of stellar disruptions in shaping the axion dark matter distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modes with zero longitudinal light-front momentum (zero modes) do have roles to play in the analysis of light-front field theories. These range from improvements in convergence for numerical calculations to implications for the light-front vacuum and beyond to fundamental issues in the connection with equal-time quantization. In particular, the discrepancy in values of the critical coupling for $\phi^4_{1+1}$ theory, between equal-time and light-front quantizations, would appear to be resolvable with the proper treatment of zero modes and near-zero modes. We provide a survey of these issues and point to open questions.</description>

      <title>Singularity resolution and regular black hole formation in gravitational collapse in asymptotically safe gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We adopt an effective action inspired by asymptotically safe gravity, in which the effective gravitational constant is parametrized as $G(\epsilon) = G_{N} /[1 + \tilde{\omega} (G_{N}^{2} \epsilon)^{\alpha}]$, where $G_{N}$ and $\epsilon$ denote Newton's gravitational constant and the energy density of the matter field, respectively, with two dimensionless model parameters, $\tilde{\omega}$ and $\alpha$. Within this framework, we investigate the complete gravitational collapse of a homogeneous ball of perfect fluid and find that singularity is completely resolved for $\alpha &gt; 1$ but not for $1/2 \le \alpha \le 1$. The case of $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1/2$ is inconsistent with asymptotic safety. Moreover, we note that although the singularity cannot be fully resolved for $\alpha = 1$, it is significantly weakened by quantum gravity effects. Furthermore, we successfully construct a static exterior metric which, together with the interior solution, describes the dynamical formation of regular black holes in an asymptotically flat spacetime. The resulting regular black hole, obtained as the final static state, contains a de Sitter core and admits a static metric fully expressible in terms of the Lerch transcendent for general cases and in elementary functions for certain values of $\alpha$, including $\alpha = 2$. We also discuss the formation of gravastars and the late-time evaporation process of the regular black holes.</description>

      <title>LEP3: A High-Luminosity e+e- Higgs and ElectroweakFactory in the LHC Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As stated in the 2019 European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP), it is of the utmost importance that the HL-LHC upgrade of the accelerator and the experiments be successfully completed in a timely manner. All necessary efforts should be devoted to achieving this goal. We also recall two of the principal recommendations of the 2019 ESPP for future accelerator initiatives, namely that 1) An electron-positron Higgs factory is the highest priority for the next collider (Rec. c). 2) Europe, together with its international partners, should investigate the technical and financial feasibility of a future hadron collider at CERN with a centre-of-mass energy of at least 100 TeV and with an electron-positron Higgs and electroweak factory as a possible first stage (Rec. e). A major objective in particle physics is always to operate an accelerator that allows a leap of an order of magnitude in the constituent centre-of-mass energy with respect to the previous one. We support FCC-ee and FCC-hh as the preferred option for CERN future, as it addresses both of the above recommendations.
  The guidance for the 2025 ESPP requests, in addition to the preferred option, the inclusion of ``prioritised alternatives to be pursued if the chosen preferred option turns out not to be feasible or competitive''. Proposed alternatives to the preferred FCC option include linear, muon colliders and LHeC accelerators. In response to this request we propose reusing the existing LHC tunnel for an electron-positron collider, called LEP3, as a back-up alternative if the FCC cannot proceed. LEP3 leverages much of the R\&amp;D conducted for FCC-ee, offers high-precision studies of Z, W, and Higgs bosons below the tt threshold, and offers potential physics performance comparable or superior to other fallback options at a lower cost while supporting continued R\&amp;D towards a next-generation energy frontier machine.</description>

      <title>Glueball mass spectrum at finite temperature revisited: Constant contribution in glueball correlators in the deconfinement phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the glueball properties at finite temperature from the temporal correlation in $SU(3)$ Yang-Mills theory using anisotropic lattice QCD. Although the existence of a constant contribution to the meson correlation function appearing in the deconfinement phase is known, its effect on the glueball correlation function at finite temperature has not been considered in previous studies. The present study reveals that the constant contribution to the glueball correlation function actually occurs in the three lowest-lying glueball states, corresponding to the $0^{++}$, $2^{++}$, and $0^{-+}$ glueballs, from near the critical temperature of the deconfinement phase transition $T_C$ to the high temperature side. If the existence of constant terms is taken into account in the standard pole-mass analysis, it is observed that the pole-mass of the glueball ground state remains unchanged below $T_c$ and then increases with temperature above $T_C$. The result indicates that the true temperature dependence of the glueball mass above $T_C$ is opposite to the results of the previous studies.</description>
