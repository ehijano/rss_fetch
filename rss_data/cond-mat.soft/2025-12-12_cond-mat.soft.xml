      <title>Relaxation in Polymer Networks under Uniaxial Extension and Biaxial Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the time and temperature dependent behavior of polymer networks under complex loading is essential for the design of advanced elastomeric materials. Many practical applications involve combinations of deformation modes, such as uniaxial extension and biaxial compression, yet a unified description of their mechanical response remains challenging. In this study, we apply a consistent theoretical framework to describe both uniaxial and biaxial deformation modes, using the same constitutive formalism based on van der Waals network theory. The time dependence of the material response in both cases is governed by a substance specific relaxation spectrum, introduced through irreversible thermodynamics as a linear coupling to the quasi static reference state of the permanent network. The temperature dependence of the relaxation times is well described by the Williams Landel Ferry (WLF) equation in the high temperature or low strain rate regime, demonstrating that the same physical mechanisms underlie time dependent behavior across different loading geometries. Experimental results are presented for cross linked poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and polyvinyl acetate (PVAc), validating the theoretical model across both materials and deformation modes.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics study of surface-directed spinodal decomposition on a chemically patterned amorphous substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a molecular dynamics (MD) study to explore pattern selection in binary fluid mixtures ($AB$) undergoing surface-directed spinodal decomposition on a chemically patterned amorphous substrate. We chose a checkerboard pattern with chemically distinct square patches of a side $M$, with neighboring patches preferring different particle types. We report the efficient transposition of the substrate's pattern as a \emph{registry} to the fluid cross sections in its vicinity when the pattern's periodicity $\lambda/\sigma \simeq 2M$ ($\sigma$ being the fluid particle size) is larger than the mixture's spinodal length scale $\lambda_c/\sigma \simeq 2\pi/\xi_B$ ($\xi_B$ being the bulk correlation length). Our correlation analysis between the surface field and the surface-\emph{registries} in the substrate's normal direction shows that the associated decay length, $L_{\perp}(t)$, increases with decreasing pattern periodicity ($\lambda$). $L_{\perp}(t)$ also exhibits diffusive growth with time $\sim t^{1/3}$, similar to wetting-layer growth for chemically homogeneous walls. Our MD results also show the emergence of composition waves parallel to the substrate, whose wavelength exhibits dynamical scaling with a power-law growth in time $L_{||}(z,t)\sim t^{\alpha}$. $L_{||}(z,t)$ shows dynamical crossovers from a transient \emph{surface-registry} regime to universal \emph{phase-separation} regimes for cross-sections with \emph{registries}. We also give an account of the scaling of \emph{registry's} formation and melting times with patch sizes.</description>

      <title>Friction modifies the quasistatic mechanical response of a confined, poroelastic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical response of elastic porous media confined within rigid geometries is central to a wide range of industrial, geological, and biomedical systems. However, current models for these problems typically overlook the role of wall friction, and particularly its interaction with confinement. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to describe the interplay between the mechanics of the medium and Coulomb friction at the confining walls for slow, quasistatic deformations in response to two canonical uniaxial forcings: piston-driven loading and fluid-driven loading, followed by unloading. We find that, during compression, the stress field evolves according to a quasistatic advection-diffusion equation, extending classical poroelasticity results. The magnitude of friction is controlled by a single dimensionless number proportional to the friction coefficient and the aspect ratio of the confining geometry. During decompression, a portion of the solid matrix remains stuck due to friction, leading to hysteresis and to the propagation of a slip front. In piston-driven loading, the frictional stress is directly coupled to the solid effective stress, leading to exponential damping of the loading and striking changes to the displacement field. However, this coupling limits the energy dissipated by friction. In fluid-driven loading, the pressure gradient locally adds energy, decoupling the frictional stress from the effective stress. The displacement remains qualitatively unchanged but is quantitatively reduced due to large energy dissipation. In both cases, friction can have a substantial impact on the apparent mechanical properties of the medium.</description>

      <title>Generation of Perfectly Achromatic Optical Vortices Using a Compensated Tandem Twisted Nematic Cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of white optical vortices is currently constrained by intrinsic trade-offs between spectral bandwidth, conversion efficiency, and temporal pulse integrity in conventional diffractive and geometric-phase approaches. In this work, we theoretically investigate a compensated tandem crossed twisted nematic (TN) liquid crystal architecture that overcomes these fundamental limitations. By developing a rigorous Jones matrix model and defining specific figures of merit for chromatic fidelity, we analyze the impact of manufacturing imperfections and non-adiabatic waveguiding (deviations from the Mauguin regime) on the device performance. We propose and evaluate three distinct compensation strategies, ranging from optimized passive designs for specific manufacturing tolerances to a robust active compensation scheme utilizing a tunable retarder. Our analysis demonstrates that the active approach effectively nullifies parasitic amplitude modulation, enabling the generation of perfectly achromatic vortices with high phase purity across an arbitrary bandwidth. This establishes the compensated tandem TN cell as a superior and versatile platform for high-fidelity white-light singular optics.</description>

      <title>Convection can enhance the capacitive charging of porous electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge transport in porous electrodes is foundational for modern energy storage technologies like supercapacitors, fuel cells, and batteries. Supercapacitors in particular rely solely on storing energy in charged pores. Here, we simulate the charging of a single electrolyte-filled pore using the modified Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. We find that electroconvection can substantially speed up the charging dynamics. We uncover the fundamental mechanism of electroconvection during pore charging through an analytical model that predicts the induced flow field and the electric current arising due to convection. Our findings suggest that convection is especially important in the limit of slender pores with thin electric double layers, and becomes significant beyond a certain threshold voltage that is an inherent electrolyte property.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Avalanche Relaxation and Yielding Rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The yielding transition in amorphous materials, whether driven passively (simple shear) or actively, remains a fundamental open question in soft matter physics. While avalanche statistics at the critical point have been extensively studied, the emergence of the dynamic regime at yielding and the steady-state flow properties remain poorly understood. In particular, the significant variability observed in flow curves across different systems lacks a clear explanation. We determine, for the first time, the relationship between avalanche duration and size across the yielding transition, revealing how it evolves from quasistatic to dynamic flow regimes. This precise measurement is made using the Controlled Relaxation Time Model (CRTM), a new simulation framework that treats the relaxation time as a tunable parameter. CRTM reproduces known results in both limits and enables a direct analysis of the change of regime between them. Applying the model to different microscopic dynamics, we find that the existing scaling relation connecting critical exponents under flow holds for passive systems. However, active systems exhibit significant deviations, suggesting a missing ingredient in the current understanding of yielding.</description>

      <title>Jammed disks of two sizes in a channel: segregation driven by steric forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disks of two sizes are confined to a long and narrow channel. The axis and the plane of the channel are horizontal. The channel is closed off by pistons that freeze jammed microstates out of loose disk configurations, agitated randomly at calibrated intensity and subject to moderate pressure. Disk sizes and channel width are such that under jamming no disks remain loose and all disks touch one wall. The protocol permits disks to move past each other prior to jamming, which facilitates randomness in the sequence of large and small disks. We present exact results for the characterization of jammed macrostates including volume and entropy for given fractions of small and large disks as functions of energy parameters which depend on the jamming protocol. Our analysis divides the disk sequence of jammed microstates into overlapping tiles out of which we construct 17 species of statistically interacting quasiparticles. Jammed macrostates then depend on the fractions of small and large disks and on a dimensionless control parameter inferred from measures for expansion work against the pistons and intensity of random agitations. Two models are introduced for comparison of key technical aspects: one model emphasizes symmetry and the other mechanical stability. We distinguish regimes for the energy parameters that either enhance or suppress mixing of disk sizes in jammed macrostates. The latter case, if realizable, is a manifestation of grain segregation driven by steric forces alone, without directional bias.</description>

      <title>A catastrophic approach to designing interacting hysterons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for analyzing collections of interacting hysterons through the lens of catastrophe theory. By modeling hysteron dynamics as a gradient system, we show how to construct hysteron transition graphs by characterizing the fold bifurcations of the dynamical system. Transition graphs represent the sequence of hysterons switching states, providing critical insights into the collective behavior of driven disordered media. Extending this analysis to higher codimension bifurcations, such as cusp bifurcations and crossings of fold curves, allows us to map out how the topology of transition graphs changes with variations in system parameters. This approach can suggest strategies for designing metamaterials capable of encoding targeted memory and computational functionalities, but it also highlights the rapid increase of design complexity with system size, further underscoring the computational challenges of controlling large hysteretic systems.</description>

      <title>Impacting spheres: from liquid drops to elastic beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A liquid drop impacting a non-wetting rigid substrate laterally spreads, then retracts, and finally jumps off again. An elastic solid, by contrast, undergoes a slight deformation, contacts briefly, and bounces. The impact force on the substrate - crucial for engineering and natural processes - is classically described by Wagner's (liquids) and Hertz's (solids) theories. This work bridges these limits by considering a generic viscoelastic medium. Using direct numerical simulations, we study a viscoelastic sphere impacting a rigid, non-contacting surface and quantify how the elasticity number ($El$, dimensionless elastic modulus) and the Weissenberg number ($Wi$, dimensionless relaxation time) dictate the impact force. We recover the Newtonian liquid response as either $El \to 0$ or $Wi \to 0$, and obtain elastic-solid behavior in the limit $Wi \to \infty$ and $El \ne 0$. In this elastic-memory limit, three regimes emerge - capillary-dominated, Wagner scaling, and Hertz scaling - with a smooth transition from the Wagner to the Hertz regime. Sweeping $Wi$ from 0 to $\infty$ reveals a continuous shift from materials with no memory to materials with permanent memory of deformation, providing an alternate, controlled route from liquid drops to elastic beads. The study unifies liquid and solid impact processes and offers a general framework for the liquid-to-elastic transition relevant across systems and applications.</description>

      <title>Deformation and organization of droplet-encapsulated soft beads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological, culinary, and engineering processes lead to the co-encapsulation of several soft particles within a liquid interface. In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.</description>

Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08684, arXiv:2512.09421, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce pertinent composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works arXiv:2512.09421, arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08682.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic theory of wetting by active particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accumulation of self-propelled particles on repulsive barriers is a widely observed feature in active matter. Despite being implicated in a broad range of biological processes, from biofilm formation to cytoskeletal movement, wetting of surfaces by active particles remains poorly understood. In this work, we study this active wetting by considering a model comprising an active lattice gas, interacting with a permeable barrier under periodic boundary conditions, for which an exact hydrodynamic description is possible. We consider a hydrodynamic scaling limit that eliminates dynamical noise while retaining microscopic interpretability, enabling a precise characterisation of steady-states and their transitions. We demonstrate that the accumulation of active particles has remarkable similarities to equilibrium wetting, and that active wetting transitions display all the salient characteristics of the equilibrium critical wetting transition -- despite fundamental differences in underlying microscopic dynamics. However, our framework also enables the investigation of subtle but important nonequilibrium effects in active wetting, including a spontaneous ratchet effect which leads to a global steady-state current, departure of bulk densities from their binodal values, and a novel dynamical transition pathway. Our results provide an intrinsically nonequilibrium framework in which to study active wetting, precisely demonstrating the connection to passive wetting while clarifying the nonequilibrium consequences of activity.</description>

      <title>On the First Quantum Correction to the Second Virial Coefficient of a Generalized Lennard-Jones Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an explicit analytic expression for the first quantum correction to the second virial coefficient of a $d$-dimensional fluid whose particles interact via the generalized Lennard-Jones $(2n,n)$ potential. By introducing an appropriate change of variable, the correction term is reduced to a single integral that can be evaluated in closed form in terms of parabolic cylinder or generalized Hermite functions. The resulting expression compactly incorporates both dimensionality and stiffness, providing direct access to the low- and high-temperature asymptotic regimes. In the special case of the standard Lennard-Jones fluid ($d=3$, $n=6$), the formula obtained is considerably more compact than previously reported representations based on hypergeometric functions. The knowledge of this correction allows us to determine the first quantum contribution to the Boyle temperature, whose dependence on dimensionality and stiffness is explicitly analyzed, and enables quantitative assessment of quantum effects in noble gases such as helium, neon, and argon. Moreover, the same methodology can be systematically extended to obtain higher-order quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Towards probing velocity distributions in dense granular matter: Utilizing Fiber Bragg Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Granular gases are commonly characterized through their velocity distribution, which provides access to the granular temperature. In experiments, velocity distributions are typically obtained by particle tracking, which however becomes limited at moderate and high particle densities. As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle densities.The FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique.</description>
