      <title>Extreme events at the onset of epileptic-like chimeras in small-world networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of complex networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable oscillators, focusing on the impact of coupling strength, network size, and randomness on their collective dynamics. Considering Watts-Strogatz small-world network connectivities, the system exhibits three distinct dynamical phases: chaotic, intermittent, and synchronized, with the intermittent phase displaying transient, epileptic-like chimera states. We analyse the transition to synchronisation by means of the master stability function, and show that peaks in the proportion of extreme events of synchronisation, which correlate with the behaviour of the largest Lyapunov exponent of the system, precede the transitions between the distinct dynamical regimes and mark the onset of epileptic-like chimera states. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of synchronisation in excitable systems real neural networks and offer insights into the conditions that may lead to pathological epileptic-like states. Furthermore, we discus the potential use of extreme events to study real neural data.</description>

      <title>Kardar-Parisi-Zhang fluctuations in the synchronization dynamics of limit-cycle oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The time-dependent process whereby one-dimensional systems of self-sustained oscillators synchronize is shown to display scale invariance in space and time, akin to that found in the dynamics of equilibrium critical phenomena. Remarkably, the process is largely independent of system details, sharing with a class of nonequilibrium surface kinetic roughening the universal scaling behavior of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation with columnar noise, and featuring phase fluctuations that follow a Tracy-Widom probability distribution. This is revealed by a numerical exploration of rings of Stuart-Landau oscillators (the universal representation of an oscillating system close to a Hopf bifurcation) and rings of van der Pol oscillators, both paradigmatically supporting self-sustained oscillations. The critical behavior is very well defined for limit-cycle oscillations near bifurcation, and still dominates comparatively far from it. In particular, the Tracy-Widom fluctuation distribution seems to be an extremely robust feature of the synchronization process. The nonequilibrium criticality here described appears to transcend the details of the coupled dynamical systems that synchronize, making plausible its experimental observation.</description>

      <title>Models of Animal Behavior as Active Particle Systems with Nonreciprocal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active particle systems of interacting self-propelled particles offer a versatile framework for modeling complex systems. When employed to describe aspects of animal behavior, the complexity of animal movement and decision-making often requires the use of unique types of effective interactions between the particles -- notably nonreciprocal effective forces that do not obey the usual conservation laws of Newtonian mechanics. Here we review two recent empirically-motivated models, of two very different types of animal behavior, where the behavior is described in terms of active particles which interact through nonreciprocal effective forces. The first model describes the dynamics of animal contests, wherein typically two rivals fight over a localized resource. The uniquely shaped effective potentials between the model's 'contestant particles' manifest the adversarial nature of contest interactions and capture the dynamical essence of contest behavior in space and time. The second model describes the stabilization of cohesive swarms through long-range and adaptive gravity-like attraction. This 'adaptive gravity' model explains the observed mass and velocity profiles of laboratory midge swarms. These examples demonstrate that theoretical models that use the framework of active particles to describe animal behavior can expand the scope of active-particle research, as well as explain complex phenomena in animal behavior.</description>

      <title>Back to the Continuous Attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous attractors offer a unique class of solutions for storing continuous-valued variables in recurrent system states for indefinitely long time intervals. Unfortunately, continuous attractors suffer from severe structural instability in general--they are destroyed by most infinitesimal changes of the dynamical law that defines them. This fragility limits their utility especially in biological systems as their recurrent dynamics are subject to constant perturbations. We observe that the bifurcations from continuous attractors in theoretical neuroscience models display various structurally stable forms. Although their asymptotic behaviors to maintain memory are categorically distinct, their finite-time behaviors are similar. We build on the persistent manifold theory to explain the commonalities between bifurcations from and approximations of continuous attractors. Fast-slow decomposition analysis uncovers the persistent manifold that survives the seemingly destructive bifurcation. Moreover, recurrent neural networks trained on analog memory tasks display approximate continuous attractors with predicted slow manifold structures. Therefore, continuous attractors are functionally robust and remain useful as a universal analogy for understanding analog memory.</description>
