      <title>Harmonic $1$-forms on real loci of Calabi-Yau manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study whether there exist nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-forms on the real locus of some carefully constructed examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds, which would then give rise to potentially new examples of $G_2$-manifolds and an explicit description of their metrics. We do this in two steps: first, we use a neural network to compute an approximate Calabi-Yau metric on each manifold. Second, we use another neural network to compute an approximately harmonic $1$-form with respect to the approximate metric, and then inspect the found solution. On two manifolds existence of a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form can be ruled out using differential geometry. The real locus of a third manifold is diffeomorphic to $S^1 \times S^2$, and our numerics suggest that when the Calabi-Yau metric is close to a singular limit, then it admits a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form. We explain how such an approximate solution could potentially be used in a numerically verified proof for the fact that our example manifold must admit a nowhere vanishing harmonic $1$-form.</description>

      <title>Caustics of a Paraboloid and Apollonius Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study caustics of an elliptical paraboloid and the history of their various representations from 3D models in XIX century to the recent computer graphics. In the paper two ways of generating the surface, one with cartesian coordinates using formula for principal curvatures, and the other one with parabolic coordinates using Seidel's formula were demonstrated. By finding the intersection curves of these caustics with the paraboloid we extend the solution of F. Caspari for classical Apollonius problem about the number of concurrent normals to the points of the paraboloid itself. A complete classification of all possible cases of intersections of these caustics with their paraboloid is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We pose the isospectral problem for the $p$-widths: Is a riemannian manifold $(M^n, g)$ uniquely determined by its $p$-widths, $\{\omega_p(M,g)\}_{p=1}^{\infty}$? We construct many counterexamples on $S^2$ using Zoll metrics and the fact that geodesic $p$-widths are given by unions of immersed geodesics.</description>

      <title>Llarull's theorem on punctured sphere with $L^\infty$ metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Llarull theorem states that a smooth metric on $n$-sphere cannot have scalar curvature no less than $n(n-1)$ and dominate the standard spherical metric at the same time unless it is the standard spherical metric. In this work, we prove that Llarull's rigidity theorem holds for $L^{\infty}$ metrics on spheres with finitely many points punctured. This is related to a question of Gromov.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes an interesting connection between the family of CMC surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E_1^3$ and some specific families of elliptic curves. As a consequence of this connection, we show in the class of spacelike CMC surfaces of revolution in the $\mathbb E_1^3$, only spacelike cylinders and standard hyperboloids are algebraic. We also show that a similar connection exists between CMC surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E^3$ and elliptic curves. Further, we use this to reestablish the fact that the only CMC algebraic surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb E^3$ are spheres and right circular cylinders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantitative metric inequalities for manifolds with positive isotropic curvature (PIC). Our results include upper bounds on the bandwidth and focal radius of hypersurfaces in PIC manifolds, contingent on boundary convexities and Betti numbers. The proof is based on exploiting the spectral properties of a twisted de Rham-Hodge operator on manifolds with boundary.</description>

      <title>A theory of stratification learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given i.i.d. sample from a stratified mixture of immersed manifolds of different dimensions, we study the minimax estimation of the underlying stratified structure. We provide a constructive algorithm allowing to estimate each mixture component at its optimal dimension-specific rate adaptively. The method is based on an ascending hierarchical co-detection of points belonging to different layers, which also identifies the number of layers and their dimensions, assigns each data point to a layer accurately, and estimates tangent spaces optimally. These results hold regardless of any ambient assumption on the manifolds or on their intersection configurations. They open the way to a broad clustering framework, where each mixture component models a cluster emanating from a specific nonlinear correlation phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional approximations of the conditional law of Volterra processes: a non-positive curvature approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the conditional evolution of Volterra processes with stochastic volatility is a crucial challenge in mathematical finance. While deep neural network models offer promise in approximating the conditional law of such processes, their effectiveness is hindered by the curse of dimensionality caused by the infinite dimensionality and non-smooth nature of these problems. To address this, we propose a two-step solution. Firstly, we develop a stable dimension reduction technique, projecting the law of a reasonably broad class of Volterra process onto a low-dimensional statistical manifold of non-positive sectional curvature. Next, we introduce a sequentially deep learning model tailored to the manifold's geometry, which we show can approximate the projected conditional law of the Volterra process. Our model leverages an auxiliary hypernetwork to dynamically update its internal parameters, allowing it to encode non-stationary dynamics of the Volterra process, and it can be interpreted as a gating mechanism in a mixture of expert models where each expert is specialized at a specific point in time. Our hypernetwork further allows us to achieve approximation rates that would seemingly only be possible with very large networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{k}$ be a nontrivial finite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields on a manifold M, and consider the family of Lorentzian metrics on M whose Killing algebra contains $\mathfrak{k}$. We show that scalar relative differential invariants, with respect to a Lie algebra of vector fields on M preserving $\mathfrak{k}$, can be used to detect the horizons of several well-known black holes. In particular, using the Lie algebra structure of $\mathfrak{k}$, we construct a general relative differential invariant of order 0 that always vanishes on $\mathfrak{k}$-invariant Killing horizons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an abstract approach to Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff distance and convergence, and an alternative approach to Lorentzian length spaces that does not use auxiliary ``positive signature'' metrics or other unobserved fields. We begin by defining a notion of (abstract) bounded Lorentzian-metric space which is sufficiently general to comprise compact causally convex subsets of globally hyperbolic spacetimes and causets. We define the Gromov-Hausdorff distance and show that two bounded Lorentzian-metric spaces at zero GH distance are indeed both isometric and homeomorphic. Then we show how to define from the Lorentzian distance, beside topology, the causal relation and the causal curves for these spaces, obtaining useful limit curve theorems. Next, we define Lorentzian (length) prelength spaces via suitable (maximal) chronal connectedness properties. These definitions are proved to be stable under GH limits. Furthermore, we define bounds on sectional curvature for our Lorentzian length spaces and prove that they are also stable under GH limits. We conclude with a (pre)compactness theorem.</description>

      <title>A conformal Hopf-Rinow theorem for semi-Riemannian spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Hopf-Rinow Theorem states, amongst others, that a Riemannian manifold is metrically complete if and only if it is geodesically complete. The Clifton-Pohl torus fails to be geodesically complete proving that this theorem cannot be generalized to compact Lorentzian manifolds. On the other hand, Hopf and Rinow characterized metric completeness also by properness. Garc\'ia-Heveling and the author recently obtained a Lorentzian completeness-compactness result for open manifolds with a similar flavor. In this manuscript, we extend the null distance used in this approach and our theorem to proper cone structures and to a new class of semi-Riemannian manifolds, dubbed $(n-\nu,\nu)$-spacetimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that our result implies, and hence generalizes, the metric part of the Hopf-Rinow Theorem.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the existence of a $Z$-positive and $Z$-critical Hermitian metric on a rank 2 holomorphic vector bundle over a compact K\"ahler surface implies that the bundle is $Z$-stable. As particular cases, we obtain stability results for the deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills equation and the almost Hermite-Einstein equation for rank 2 bundles over surfaces. We show examples of $Z$-unstable bundles and $Z$-critical metrics away from the large volume limit.</description>

      <title>Topological-Holomorphic ${\mathcal N} =4$ Gauge Theory: From Langlands Duality of Holomorphic Invariants to Mirror Symmetry of Quasi-topological Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a topological-holomorphic twist of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory on a four-manifold of the form $M_4=\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2$ with Riemann surfaces $\Sigma_{1,2}$, and unravel the mathematical implications of its physics. In particular, we consider different linear combinations of the resulting scalar supercharges under $S$-duality, where this will allow us to derive novel topological and holomorphic invariants of $M_4$ and their Langlands duals. As the twisted theory can be topological along $\Sigma_1$ whence we can dimensionally reduce it to 2d, via the effective sigma-model on $\Sigma_2$, we can also relate these 4d invariants and their Langlands duals to the mirror symmetry of Higgs bundles and that of quasi-topological strings described by the sheaf of chiral differential operators. As an offshoot, we would be able to obtain a fundamental understanding from 4d gauge theory, why chiral differential operators are purely perturbative objects.</description>

      <title>Weyl's law in Liouville quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05407v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Can you hear the shape of Liouville quantum gravity? We obtain a Weyl law for the eigenvalues of Liouville Brownian motion: the $n$-th eigenvalue grows linearly with $n$, with the proportionality constant given by the Liouville area of the domain and a certain deterministic constant $c_\gamma$ depending on $\gamma \in (0, 2)$. The constant $c_\gamma$, initially a complicated function of Sheffield's quantum cone, can be evaluated explicitly and is strictly greater than the equivalent Riemannian constant.
  At the heart of the proof we obtain sharp asymptotics of independent interest for the small-time behaviour of the on-diagonal heat kernel. Interestingly, we show that the scaled heat kernel displays nontrivial pointwise fluctuations. Fortunately, at the level of the heat trace these pointwise fluctuations cancel each other, which leads to the result.
  We complement these results with a number of conjectures on the spectral geometry of Liouville quantum gravity, notably suggesting a connection with quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Topological 5d $\mathcal {N} = 2$ Gauge Theory: Novel Floer Homologies, their Dualities, and an $A_\infty$-category of Three-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how one can define novel gauge-theoretic Floer homologies of four, three and two-manifolds from the physics of a certain topologically-twisted 5d ${\cal N}=2$ gauge theory via its supersymmetric quantum mechanics interpretation. They are associated with Vafa-Witten, Hitchin and $G_{\mathbb{C}}$-BF configurations on the four, three and two-manifolds, respectively. We also show how one can define novel symplectic Floer homologies of Hitchin spaces, which in turn will allow us to derive novel Atiyah-Floer correspondences that relate our gauge-theoretic Floer homologies to symplectic intersection Floer homologies of Higgs bundles. Furthermore, topological invariance and 5d "S-duality" suggest a web of relations and a Langlands duality amongst these novel Floer homologies and their loop/toroidal group generalizations. Last but not least, via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the 5d theory, we derive, from the soliton string theory that it defines and the 5d partition function, a Fukaya-Seidel type $A_\infty$-category of Hitchin configurations on three-manifolds and its novel Atiyah-Floer correspondence. Our work therefore furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures of Haydys [1], Abouzaid-Manolescu [2], and Bousseau [3], and more.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the Cheeger inequality, a lower bound on the first nontrivial eigenvalue of a Laplacian, to the case of geometric sub-Laplacians on rank-varying Carnot-Carath\'eodory spaces and we describe a concrete method to lower bound the Cheeger constant. The proof is geometric, and works for Dirichlet, Neumann and mixed boundary conditions. One of the main technical tools in the proof is a generalization of Courant's nodal domain theorem, which is proven from scratch for Neumann and mixed boundary conditions. Carnot groups and the Baouendi-Grushin cylinder are treated as examples.</description>

Abstract: Toric Ricci--flat metrics in dimension four correspond to certain holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space. We construct these bundles explicitly, by exhibiting and characterising their patching matrices, for the five--parameter family of Riemannian ALF metrics constructed by Chen and Teo. The Chen--Teo family contains a two--parameter family of asymptotically flat gravitational instantons. The patching matrices for these instantons take a simple rational form.</description>
