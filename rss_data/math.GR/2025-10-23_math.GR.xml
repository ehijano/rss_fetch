      <title>Isometry groups and countable groups with the L\'{e}vy property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological group $G$ is said to have the L\'evy property if it admits a dense subgroup which is decomposed as the union of an increasing sequence of compact subgroups $\mathcal{G}=\{G_i:i\in\mathbb{N}\}$ of $G$ which exhibits concentration of measure in the sense of Gromov and Milman. We say that $G$ has the strong L\'evy property whenever the sequence $\mathcal{G}$ is comprised of finite subgroups. In this paper we give several new classes of isometry groups and countable topological groups with the strong L\'evy property. We prove that if $\Delta$ is a countable distance value set with arbitrarily small values, then $\mbox{Iso}(\mathbb{U}_\Delta)$, the isometry group of the Urysohn $\Delta$-metric space equipped with the pointwise convergence topology, where $\mathbb{U}_\Delta$ is equipped with the metric topology, has the strong L\'evy property. We also prove that if $\mathcal{L}$ is a Lipschitz continuous signature, then $\mbox{Iso}(\mathbb{U}_{\mathcal{L}})$, the isometry group of the unique separable Urysohn $\mathcal{L}$-structure, has the strong L\'evy property. In addition, our approach shows that any countable omnigenous locally finite group can be given a topology with the L\'evy property. As a consequence to our results, we obtain at least continuum many pairwise nonisomorphic countable topological groups or isometry groups with the strong L\'evy property.</description>

      <title>Twisted commutativity and conjugacy ratio in groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the degree of twisted commutativity and the twisted conjugacy ratio of a finitely generated group $G$. The degree of twisted commutativity $\mathrm{tdc}_X(\varphi, G)$ generalises the degree of commutativity of $G$, by measuring the density of pairs of elements with trivial twisted commutators in the ball of radius $n$ of $G$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, where the twisting is done with respect to an endomorphism $\varphi$ of $G$. We compute $\mathrm{tdc}_X(\varphi, G)$ for several classes of groups, including virtually abelian groups, groups of subexponential growth, and free groups.
  We then study the twisted conjugacy ratio $\mathrm{tcr}_{X}(\varphi, G)$, which is the limit at infinity of the quotient of the twisted conjugacy and standard growth functions. We compute $\mathrm{tcr}_{X}(\varphi, G)$ for virtually abelian groups, and give examples of groups of exponential growth such that $\mathrm{tcr}_{X}(\varphi, G) = 0$.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory Beyond Reductivity: Hilbert and Schwarz Theorems for Discrete Lorentz and Cocompact Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical invariant theory provides a complete framework for reductive and compact Lie groups, but the non-reductive and non-compact cases are significantly more complex and less completely understood. This work investigates two distinct regimes: discrete subgroups of the Lorentz group $O(n,1)$ acting on $\mathbb{R}^{n,1}$, and cocompact actions of discrete groups on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We prove that for discrete Lorentz groups, the ring of polynomial invariants remains finitely generated, yet the classical Schwarz Theorem, stating that smooth invariants are generated by polynomial ones, fails. Conversely, for cocompact actions, the polynomial invariant ring collapses to constants, but a persistent structure of smooth invariants persists and is finitely generated over the smooth functions on the quotient. These results reveal a fourfold classification of invariant-theoretic regimes, extending the classical framework and delineating the boundaries of the Hilbert-Weyl and Schwarz theorems.</description>

      <title>String graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every countable string graph $S$, there is a planar graph $G$ with $V(G)=V(S)$ such that \[ \frac{1}{23660800}d_S(u,v) \le d_G(u,v) \le 162 d_S(u,v) \] for all $u,v\in V(S)$, where $d_S(u,v)$, $d_G(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $S$ and $G$ respectively. In other words, string graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs.
  This theorem lifts a number of theorems from planar graphs to string graphs, we give some examples. String graphs have Assouad-Nagata (and asymptotic dimension) at most 2. Connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive string graphs are accessible. A finitely generated group $\Gamma$ is virtually a free product of free and surface groups if and only if $\Gamma$ is quasi-isometric to a string graph.
  Two further corollaries are that countable planar metric graphs and complete Riemannian planes are also quasi-isometric to planar graphs, which answers a question of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. For finite string graphs and planar metric graphs, our proofs yield polynomial time (for string graphs, this is in terms of the size of a representation given in the input) algorithms for generating such quasi-isometric planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Identifying the simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras over $\mathbb{C}$ by means of simple sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel method of determining which Dynkin diagrams represent simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras over $\mathbb{C}$ is presented. It is based on a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a suitably defined Cartan matrix to be expressible by scalar products in a Euclidean vector space. The sufficiency of this condition makes unnecessary subsequent verification of the existence of a Lie algebra or root system corresponding to each Dynkin diagram by explicit construction. The Dynkin diagrams are selected by examination of an easily calculated sequence of minors of a symmetrised Cartan matrix. These minors are mostly integers.</description>

      <title>A piecewise linear homeomorphism of the circle which is periodic under renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05825v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a piecewise linear homeomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ which maps rationals to rationals, whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$, and whose rotation number is $\sqrt{2}-1$. This is achieved by showing that a renormalization procedure becomes periodic when applied to $f$. Our construction gives a negative answer to a question of D. Calegari. When combined with work of the 2nd and 3rd authors, our result also shows that $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ does not embed into $F$, where $F_{\frac{2}{3}}$ is the subgroup of the Stein-Thompson group $F_{2,3}$ consisting of those elements whose slopes are powers of $\frac{2}{3}$. Finally, we produce some evidence suggesting a positive answer to a variation of Calegari's question and record a number of computational observations.</description>

      <title>Width bounds and Steinhaus property for unit groups of continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an algebraic decomposition theorem for the unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ of an arbitrary non-discrete irreducible, continuous ring $R$ (in von Neumann's sense), which entails that every element of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ is both a product of $7$ commutators and a product of $16$ involutions. Combining this with further insights into the geometry of involutions, we deduce that $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ has the so-called Steinhaus property with respect to the natural rank topology, thus every homomorphism from $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ to a separable topological group is necessarily continuous. Due to earlier work, this has further dynamical ramifications: for instance, for every action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ by homeomorphisms on a non-void metrizable compact space, every element of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ admits a fixed point in the latter. In particular, our results answer two questions by Carderi and Thom, even in generalized form.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Normalizers in Finite Coxeter Groups as Subdirect Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the structure of the normalizer $N_W(P)$ of a parabolic subgroup $P$ in a finite Coxeter group $W$, originally described by Howlett. Building on Howlett's Lemma, which provides canonical complements for reflection subgroups, and inspired by a recent construction of Serre for involution centralizers, we refine this understanding by interpreting $N_W(P)$ as a subdirect product via Goursat's Lemma. Central to our approach is a Galois connection on the lattice of parabolic subgroups, which leads to a new decomposition \begin{align*} N_W(P) \cong (P \times Q) \rtimes ((A \times B) \rtimes C)\text, \end{align*} where each subgroup reflects a structural feature of the ambient Coxeter system. This perspective yields a more symmetric description of $N_W(P)$, organized around naturally associated reflection subgroups on mutually orthogonal subspaces of the reflection representation of $W$. Our analysis provides new conceptual clarity and includes a case-by-case classification for all irreducible finite Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Eventually periodic resolutions for groups of type $\textbf{VFP}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a construction of eventually periodic projective resolutions for modules of type $\textbf{FP}_{\infty}$ over the integral group rings of $\Gamma = G / (c)$ of type $\textbf{VFP}$, with $G$ of type $\textbf{FP}$ and $c$ a central element. Our approach also applies more generally to quotients of rings of finite left global dimension by a regular central element. It utilises a construction of Shamash, combined with the iterated mapping cone technique, to systematically `purge' homology from a complex. We demonstrate the computability of our method through explicit calculations for several families of groups including hyperbolic triangle groups and mapping class groups of the punctured plane.</description>

Abstract: We propose and study a variation of the classical isomorphism problem for group rings in the context of projective representations. We formulate several weaker conditions following from our notion and give all logical connections between these condition by studying concrete examples. We introduce methods to study the problem and provide results for various classes of groups, including abelian groups, groups of central type, $p$-groups of order $p^4$ and groups of order $p^2q^2$, where $p$ and $q$ denote different primes.</description>

      <title>Classification of orientable torus bundles over closed orientable surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14138v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $g$ be a non-negative integer, $\Sigma _g$ a closed orientable surface of genus $g$, and $\mathcal{M}_g$ its mapping class group. We classify all the group homomorphisms $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)\to G$ up to the action of $\mathcal{M}_g$ on $\pi _1(\Sigma _g)$ in the following cases; (1) $G=PSL(2;\mathbb{Z})$, (2) $G=SL(2;\mathbb{Z})$. As an application of the case (2), we completely classify orientable $T^2$-bundles over closed orientable surfaces up to bundle isomorphisms. In particular, we show that any orientable $T^2$-bundle over $\Sigma _g$ with $g\geq 1$ is isomorphic to the fiber connected sum of $g$ pieces of $T^2$-bundles over $T^2$. Moreover, the classification result in the case (1) can be generalized into the case where $G$ is the free product of finite number of finite cyclic groups. We also apply it to an extension problem of maps from a closed surface to the connected sum of lens spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every locally finite, quasi-transitive graph with a thick end whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the full-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor. This in particular includes all locally finite Cayley graphs of finitely presented groups that are not virtually free, and partially solves problems of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu and of Georgakopoulos and Hamann.
  Additionally, we show that every (not necessarily quasi-transitive) graph of finite maximum degree which has a thick end and whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Modular Isomorphism Problem asks, if an isomorphism between modular group algebras of finite $p$-groups over a field $F$ implies an isomorphism of the group bases. We explore the differences of knowledge on the problem when $F$ is either assumed to be a prime field or a general field of characteristic $p$. After revising the literature and explaining reasons for the differences, we generalize some of the positive answers to the problem from the prime field case to the general case.</description>
