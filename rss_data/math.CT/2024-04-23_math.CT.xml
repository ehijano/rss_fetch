      <title>Monadic functors forgetful of (dis)inhibited actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a number of results of the following common flavor: for a category $\mathcal{C}$ of topological or uniform spaces with all manner of other properties of common interest (separation / completeness / compactness axioms), a group (or monoid) $\mathbb{G}$ equipped with various types of topological structure (topologies, uniformities) and the corresponding category $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{G}}$ of appropriately compatible $\mathbb{G}$-flows in $\mathcal{C}$, the forgetful functor $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{G}}\to \mathcal{C}$ is monadic. In all cases of interest the domain category $\mathcal{C}^{\mathbb{G}}$ is also cocomplete, so that results on adjunction lifts along monadic functors apply to provide equivariant completion and/or compactification functors. This recovers, unifies and generalizes a number of such results in the literature due to de Vries, Mart'yanov and others on existence of equivariant compactifications / completions and cocompleteness of flow categories.</description>

      <title>Partial algebras and implications of (weak) matrix properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix properties are a type of property of categories which includes the ones of being Mal'tsev, arithmetical, majority, unital, strongly unital and subtractive. Recently, an algorithm has been developed to determine implications $M\Rightarrow N$ between them. We show here that this algorithm reduces to construct a partial term corresponding to $N$ from a partial term corresponding to $M$. Moreover, we prove that this is further equivalent to the corresponding implication between the weak versions of these properties, i.e., the one where only strong monomorphisms are considered instead of all monomorphisms.</description>

      <title>On the differentiation of integrals in measure spaces along filters: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a complete measure space of finite measure. The Lebesgue transform of an integrable function $f$ on $X$ encodes the collection of all the mean-values of $f$ on all measurable subsets of $X$ of positive measure. In the problem of the differentiation of integrals, one seeks to recapture $f$ from its Lebesgue transform. In previous work we showed that, in all known results, $f$ may be recaputed from its Lebesgue transform by means of a limiting process associated to an appropriate family of filters defined on the collection of all measurable subsets of $X$ of positive measure. The first result of the present work is that the existence of such a limiting process is equivalent to the existence of a Von Neumann-Maharam lifting of $X$.
  In the second result of this work we provide an independent argument that shows that the recourse to filters is a \textit{necessary consequence} of the requirement that the process of recapturing $f$ from its mean-values is associated to a \textit{natural transformation}, in the sense of category theory. This result essentially follows from the Yoneda lemma. As far as we know, this is the first instance of a significant interaction between category theory and the problem of the differentiation of integrals.
  In the Appendix we have proved, in a precise sense, that \textit{natural transformations fall within the general concept of homomorphism}. As far as we know, this is a novel conclusion: Although it is often said that natural transformations are homomorphisms of functors, this statement appears to be presented as a mere analogy, not in a precise technical sense. In order to achieve this result, we had to bring to the foreground a notion that is implicit in the subject but has remained hidden in the background, i.e., that of \textit{partial magma}.</description>

      <title>Coderived and contraderived categories of locally presentable abelian DG-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of an abelian DG-category, introduced by the first-named author in arXiv:2110.08237, unites the notions of abelian categories and (curved) DG-modules in a common framework. In this paper we consider coderived and contraderived categories in the sense of Becker. Generalizing some constructions and results from the preceding papers by Becker arXiv:1205.4473 and by the present authors arXiv:2101.10797, we define the contraderived category of a locally presentable abelian DG-category $\mathbf B$ with enough projective objects and the coderived category of a Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$. We construct the related abelian model category structures and show that the resulting exotic derived categories are well-generated. Then we specialize to the case of a locally coherent Grothendieck abelian DG-category $\mathbf A$, and prove that its coderived category is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of finitely presentable objects of $\mathbf A$, thus generalizing a result from the second-named author's preprint arXiv:1412.1615. In particular, the homotopy category of graded-injective left DG-modules over a DG-ring with a left coherent underlying graded ring is compactly generated by the absolute derived category of DG-modules with finitely presentable underlying graded modules. We also describe compact generators of the coderived categories of quasi-coherent matrix factorizations over coherent schemes.</description>

      <title>Homology and homotopy for arbitrary categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the prime motivation for topology was Homotopy theory, which captures the general idea of a continuous transformation between two entities, which may be spaces or maps. In later decades, an algebraic formulation of topology was discovered with the development of Homology theory. Some of the deepest results in topology are about the connections between Homotopy and Homology. These results are proved using intricate constructions. This paper takes an axiomatic approach that provides a common ground for homotopy and homology in arbitrary categories. The axioms have simple and natural motivations, and lead to the deeper connections between homotopy and homology.</description>

      <title>n-Groupoids and Stacky Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.2057</link>
      <description>arXiv:0801.2057v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss two generalizations of Lie groupoids. One consists of Lie $n$-groupoids defined as simplicial manifolds with trivial $\pi_{k\geq n+1}$. The other consists of stacky Lie groupoids $\cG\rra M$ with $\cG$ a differentiable stack. We build a 1-1 correspondence between Lie 2-groupoids and stacky Lie groupoids up to a certain Morita equivalence. We prove this in a general set-up so that the statement is valid in both differential and topological categories. \Equivalences of higher groupoids in various categories are also described.</description>

      <title>A double $(\infty,1)$-categorical nerve for double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.01848v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a nerve from double categories into double $(\infty,1)$-categories and show that it gives a right Quillen and homotopically fully faithful functor between the model structure for weakly horizontally invariant double categories and the model structure on bisimplicial spaces for double $(\infty,1)$-categories seen as double Segal objects in spaces complete in the horizontal direction. We then restrict the nerve along a homotopical horizontal embedding of 2-categories into double categories, and show that it gives a right Quillen and homotopically fully faithful functor between Lack's model structure for 2-categories and the model structure for 2-fold complete Segal spaces. We further show that Lack's model structure is right-induced along this nerve from the model structure for 2-fold complete Segal spaces.</description>

      <title>A bijection between support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and $\tau$-cotorsion pairs in extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an extriangulated category with enough projectives and injectives. We give a new definition of tilting subcategories of $\mathscr{C}$ and prove it coincides with the definition given in [19]. As applications, we introduce the notions of support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and $\tau$-cotorsion pairs of $\mathscr{C}$. Then we show that there is a bijection between tilting subcategories and certain cotorsion pairs.</description>
