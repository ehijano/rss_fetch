      <title>Mechanisms for a dynamic many-to-many school choice problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the problem of assigning teachers to public schools over time when teachers have tenured positions and can work simultaneously in multiple schools. To do this, we investigate a dynamic many-to-many school choice problem where public schools have priorities over teachers and teachers hold substitutable preferences over subsets of schools. We introduce a new concept of dynamic stability that recognizes the tenured positions of teachers and we prove that a dynamically stable matching always exists. We propose the Tenured-Respecting Deferred Acceptance $(TRDA)$ mechanism, which produces a dynamically stable matching that is constrained-efficient within the class of dynamically stable matchings and minimizes unjustified claims. To improve efficiency beyond this class, we also propose the Tenured-Respecting Efficiency-Adjusted Deferred Acceptance $(TREADA)$ mechanism, an adaptation of the Efficiency-Adjusted Deferred Acceptance mechanism to our dynamic context. We demonstrate that the outcome of the $TREADA$ mechanism Pareto-dominates any dynamically stable matching and achieves efficiency when all teachers consent. Additionally, we examine the issue of manipulability, showing that although the $TRDA$ and $TREADA$ mechanisms can be manipulated, they remain non-obviously dynamically manipulable under specific conditions on schools' priorities.</description>

      <title>Incentive Design with Spillovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A principal uses payments conditioned on stochastic outcomes of a team project to elicit costly effort from the team members. We develop a multi-agent generalization of a classic first-order approach to contract optimization by leveraging methods from network games. The main results characterize the optimal allocation of incentive pay across agents and outcomes. Incentive optimality requires equalizing, across agents, a product of (i) individual productivity (ii) organizational centrality and (iii) responsiveness to monetary incentives.</description>

      <title>Implementing Dynamic Pricing Across Multiple Pricing Groups in Real Estate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a mathematical model of dynamic pricing for real estate (RE) that incorporates multiple pricing groups, thereby expanding the capabilities of existing models. The developed model solves the problem of maximizing aggregate cumulative revenue at the end of the sales period while meeting the revenue and sales goals. A method is proposed for distributing aggregate cumulative revenue goals across different RE pricing groups. The model is further modified to account for the time value of money and the real estate value increase as construction progresses. The algorithm for constructing a pricing policy for multiple pricing groups is described, and numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate how the algorithm operates.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Voter Relevance in Facility Location Games with Tree-Shaped Invitation Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion mechanism design, which investigate how to incentivise agents to invite as many colleagues to a multi-agent decision making as possible, is a new research paradigm at the intersection between microeconomics and computer science. In this paper we extend traditional facility location games into the model of diffusion mechanism design. Our objective is to completely understand to what extent of anonymity/voter-relevance we can achieve, along with strategy-proofness and Pareto efficiency when voters strategically invite collegues. We define a series of anonymity properties applicable to the diffusion mechanism design model, as well as parameterized voter-relevance properties for guaranteeing reasonably-fair decision making. We obtained two impossibility theorems and two existence theorems, which partially answer the question we have raised in the beginning of the paper</description>
