      <title>Valid Inference on Functions of Causal Effects in the Absence of Microdata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economists are often interested in functions of multiple causal effects, a leading example of which is evaluating the cost-effectiveness of a government policy. In such settings, the benefits and costs might be captured by multiple causal effects and aggregated into a scalar measure of cost-effectiveness. Oftentimes, the microdata underlying these estimates is not accessible; only the published estimates and their corresponding standard errors are available for post-hoc analysis. We provide a method to conduct inference on functions of causal effects when the only information available is the point estimates and their corresponding standard errors. We apply our method to conduct inference on the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF) for 8 different policies, and show that even in the absence of any microdata, it is possible to conduct valid and meaningful inference on the MVPF.</description>

      <title>A Nonparametric Test of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects under Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical inference of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs) across predefined subgroups is challenging when units interact because treatment effects may vary by pre-treatment variables, post-treatment exposure variables (that measure the exposure to other units' treatment statuses), or both. Thus, the conventional HTEs testing procedures may be invalid under interference. In this paper, I develop statistical methods to infer HTEs and disentangle the drivers of treatment effects heterogeneity in populations where units interact. Specifically, I incorporate clustered interference into the potential outcomes model and propose kernel-based test statistics for the null hypotheses of (i) no HTEs by treatment assignment (or post-treatment exposure variables) for all pre-treatment variables values and (ii) no HTEs by pre-treatment variables for all treatment assignment vectors. I recommend a multiple-testing algorithm to disentangle the source of heterogeneity in treatment effects. I prove the asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistics. Finally, I illustrate the application of the test procedures in an empirical setting using an experimental data set from a Chinese weather insurance program.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Econometric Approaches to Fiscal Policies: Understanding Industrial Investment Dynamics in Uruguay (1974-2010)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of fiscal incentives on industrial investment in Uruguay from 1974 to 2010. Using a mixed-method approach that combines econometric models with machine learning techniques, the study investigates both the short-term and long-term effects of fiscal benefits on industrial investment. The results confirm the significant role of fiscal incentives in driving long-term industrial growth, while also highlighting the importance of a stable macroeconomic environment, public investment, and access to credit. Machine learning models provide additional insights into nonlinear interactions between fiscal benefits and other macroeconomic factors, such as exchange rates, emphasizing the need for tailored fiscal policies. The findings have important policy implications, suggesting that fiscal incentives, when combined with broader economic reforms, can effectively promote industrial development in emerging economies.</description>

      <title>Functional Spatial Autoregressive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14763v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel spatial autoregressive model in which the dependent variable is a function that may exhibit functional autocorrelation with the outcome functions of nearby units. This model can be characterized as a simultaneous integral equation system, which, in general, does not necessarily have a unique solution. For this issue, we provide a simple condition on the magnitude of the spatial interaction to ensure the uniqueness in data realization. For estimation, to account for the endogeneity caused by the spatial interaction, we propose a regularized two-stage least squares estimator based on a basis approximation for the functional parameter. The asymptotic properties of the estimator including the consistency and asymptotic normality are investigated under certain conditions. Additionally, we propose a simple Wald-type test for detecting the presence of spatial effects. As an empirical illustration, we apply the proposed model and method to analyze age distributions in Japanese cities.</description>

      <title>When can weak latent factors be statistically inferred?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a new and comprehensive estimation and inference theory for principal component analysis (PCA) under the weak factor model that allow for cross-sectional dependent idiosyncratic components under the nearly minimal factor strength relative to the noise level or signal-to-noise ratio. Our theory is applicable regardless of the relative growth rate between the cross-sectional dimension $N$ and temporal dimension $T$. This more realistic assumption and noticeable result require completely new technical device, as the commonly-used leave-one-out trick is no longer applicable to the case with cross-sectional dependence. Another notable advancement of our theory is on PCA inference $ - $ for example, under the regime where $N\asymp T$, we show that the asymptotic normality for the PCA-based estimator holds as long as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) grows faster than a polynomial rate of $\log N$. This finding significantly surpasses prior work that required a polynomial rate of $N$. Our theory is entirely non-asymptotic, offering finite-sample characterizations for both the estimation error and the uncertainty level of statistical inference. A notable technical innovation is our closed-form first-order approximation of PCA-based estimator, which paves the way for various statistical tests. Furthermore, we apply our theories to design easy-to-implement statistics for validating whether given factors fall in the linear spans of unknown latent factors, testing structural breaks in the factor loadings for an individual unit, checking whether two units have the same risk exposures, and constructing confidence intervals for systematic risks. Our empirical studies uncover insightful correlations between our test results and economic cycles.</description>
