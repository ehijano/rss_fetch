      <title>Cohomology of ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a cochain complex for ample groupoids $\mathcal G$ using a flat resolution defining their homology with coefficients in $\mathbb Z$. We prove that the cohomology of this cochain complex with values in a $\mathcal G$-module $M$ coincides with the previously introduced continuous cocycle cohomology of $\mathcal G$. In particular, this groupoid cohomology is invariant under Morita equivalence. We derive an exact sequence for the cohomology of skew products by a $\mathbb Z$-valued cocycle. We indicate how to compute the cohomology with coefficients in a $\mathcal G$-module $M$ for $AF$-groupoids and for certain action groupoids.</description>

      <title>A quantization of coarse spaces and uniform Roe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantization of coarse spaces and uniform Roe algebras. The objects are based on the quantum relations introduced by N. Weaver and require the choice of a represented von Neumann algebra. In the case of the diagonal inclusion l_infty(X) subset B(l_2(X)), they reduce to the usual constructions. Quantum metric spaces furnish natural examples parallel to the classical setting, but we provide other examples that are not inspired by metric considerations, including the new class of support expansion C*-algebras. We also work out the basic theory for maps between quantum coarse spaces and their consequences for quantum uniform Roe algebras.</description>

      <title>Information geometry for types in the large-$n$ limit of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction between entropy and Wasserstein distance in free probability theory. In particular, we give lower bounds for several versions of free entropy dimension along Wasserstein geodesics, as well as study their topological properties with respect to Wasserstein distance. We also study moment measures in the multivariate free setting, showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a regularized version of Santambrogio's variational problem. The role of probability distributions in these results is played by types, functionals which assign values not only to polynomial test functions, but to all real-valued logical formulas built from them using suprema and infima. We give an explicit counterexample showing that in the framework of non-commutative laws, the usual notion of probability distributions using only non-commutative polynomial test functions, one cannot obtain the desired large-$n$ limiting behavior for both Wasserstein distance and entropy simultaneously in random multi-matrix models.</description>

      <title>Continuous Selection of Unitaries in II$_1$ Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove continuous-valued analogues of the basic fact that Murray-von Neumann subequivalence of projections in II$_1$ factors is completely determined by tracial evaluations. We moreover use this result to solve the so-called trace problem in the case of factorial trivial $W^\ast$-bundles whose base space has covering dimension at most 1. Our arguments are based on applications of a continuous selection theorem due to Michael to von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>A spectral radius for matrices over an operator space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With every operator space structure $\mathcal{E}$ on $\mathbb{C}^d$, we associate a spectral radius function $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}$ on $d$-tuples of operators. For a $d$-tuple $X = (X_1, \ldots, X_d) \in M_n(\mathbb{C}^d)$ of matrices we show that $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(X)&lt;1$ if and only if $X$ is jointly similar to a tuple in the open unit ball of $M_n(\mathcal{E})$, that is, there is an invertible matrix $S$ such that $\|S^{-1}X S\|_{M_n(\mathcal{E})}&lt;1$, where $S^{-1} X S =(S^{-1} X_1 S, \ldots, S^{-1} X_d S)$. When $\mathcal{E}$ is the row operator space, for example, our spectral radius coincides with the joint spectral radius considered by Bunce, Popescu, and others, and we recover the condition for a tuple of matrices to be simultaneously similar to a strict row contraction. When $\mathcal{E}$ is the minimal operator space $\min(\ell^\infty_d)$, our spectral radius $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}$ is related to the joint spectral radius considered by Rota and Strang but differs from it and has the advantage that $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(X)&lt;1$ if and only if $X$ is simultaneously similar to a tuple of strict contractions. We show that for a nc rational function $f$ with descriptor realization $(A,b,c)$, the spectral radius $\rho_{\mathcal{E}}(A)&lt;1$ if and only the domain of $f$ contains a neighborhood of the noncommutative closed unit ball of the operator space dual $\mathcal{E}^*$ of $\mathcal{E}$.</description>

      <title>New Weighted Spectral Geometric Mean and Quantum Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new class of weighted spectral geometric means has recently been introduced. In this paper, we present its inequalities in terms of the L\"{o}wner order, operator norm, and trace. Moreover, we establish a log-majorization relationship between the new spectral geometric mean, and the R\'{e}nyi relative operator entropy. We also give the quantum divergence of the quantity, given by the difference of trace values between the arithmetic mean and new spectral geometric mean. Finally, we study the barycenter that minimizes the weighted sum of quantum divergences for given variables.</description>

      <title>Splittings for C*-correspondences and strong shift equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01917v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of the notion of in-splits from symbolic dynamics to topological graphs and, more generally, to C*-correspondences. We demonstrate that in-splits provide examples of strong shift equivalences of C*-correspondences. Furthermore, we provide a streamlined treatment of Muhly, Pask, and Tomforde's proof that any strong shift equivalence of regular C*-correspondences induces a (gauge-equivariant) Morita equivalence between Cuntz-Pimsner algebras. For topological graphs, we prove that in-splits induce diagonal-preserving gauge-equivariant *-isomorphisms in analogy with the results for Cuntz-Krieger algebras. Additionally, we examine the notion of out-splits for C*-correspondences.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-algebra extensions associated to continued fraction expansions of rational numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the isomorphism problem for essential unital $C^*$-algebra extensions of the form $0 \to \mathcal{K} \oplus \mathcal{K} \to E \xrightarrow{\pi} M_n \otimes C(\mathbb{T}) \to 0$. We then relate these to analogs of the Effros Shen AF algebras for rational numbers. This involves $C^*$-algebras constructed from categories of paths built from certain nonsimple continued fraction expansions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Laws of Non-Hermitian Sums of Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the random matrix model $X_n = P_n + i Q_n$, where $P_n$ and $Q_n$ are independently Haar-unitary rotated Hermitian matrices with at most $2$ atoms in their spectra. Let $(M, \tau)$ be a tracial von Neumann algebra and let $p, q \in (M, \tau)$, where $p$ and $q$ are Hermitian and freely independent. Our main result is the following convergence result: if the law of $P_n$ converges to the law of $p$ and the law of $Q_n$ converges to the law of $q$, then the empirical spectral distributions of the $X_n$ converges to the Brown measure of $X = p + i q$. To prove this, we use the Hermitization technique introduced by Girko, along with the algebraic properties of projections to prove the key estimate. We also prove a converse statement by using the properties of the Brown measure of $X$.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-extreme contractive completely positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize a specific quantized convexity structure of the generalized state space of a $C^*$-algebra and examine the associated extreme points. We introduce the notion of $P$-$C^*$-convex subsets, where $P$ is any positive operator on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. These subsets are defined with in the set of all completely positive (CP) maps from a unital $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{A}$ into the algebra $B(\mathcal{H})$ of bounded linear maps on $\mathcal{H}$. In particular, we focus on certain $P$-$C^*$-convex sets, denoted by $\mathrm{CP}^{(P)}(\mathcal{A},B(\mathcal{H}))$, and analyze their extreme points with respect to this new convexity structure. This generalizes the existing notions of $C^*$-convex subsets and $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps. We significantly extend many of the known results regarding the $C^*$-extreme points of unital completely positive maps into the context of $P$-$C^*$-convex sets we are considering. This includes abstract characterization and structure of $P$-$C^*$-extreme points. Further, using these studies, we completely characterize the $C^*$-extreme points of the $C^*$-convex set of all contractive completely positive maps from $\mathcal{A}$ into $B(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{H}$ is finite-dimensional. Additionally, we discuss the connection between $P$-$C^*$-extreme points and linear extreme points of these convex sets, as well as Krein-Milman type theorems.</description>

      <title>On the Elementary Equivalence of Group Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use techniques of distortion systems, introduced by James Hanson to show that any two elementarily equivalent infinite discrete ICC groups give rise to elementarily equivalent group von Neumann algebras. This answers a question raised by Goldbring-Pi (and attributed there to Koichi Oyakawa), in the negative. In a special case, this resolves the model theoretic free factor isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>On the First-Order Free Group Factor Alternative</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08168v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of elementary equivalence of the free group factors, that is, do all free group factors $L(\mathbb{F}_n)$ share a common first-order theory? We establish a trichotomy of possibilities for their common first-order fundamental group, as well as several possible avenues for establishing a dichotomy in direct analog to the free group factor alternative of Dykema and Radulescu. We also show that the $\forall \exists$-theories of the interpolated free group factors are increasing, and use this to establish that the dichotomy holds on the level of $\forall \exists$-theories. We conclude with some observations on related problems.</description>
