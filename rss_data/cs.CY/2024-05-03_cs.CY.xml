      <title>Public Computing Intellectuals in the Age of AI Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The belief that AI technology is on the cusp of causing a generalized social crisis became a popular one in 2023. Interestingly, some of these worries were voiced from within the tech sector itself. While there was no doubt an element of hype and exaggeration to some of these accounts, they do reflect the fact that there are troubling ramifications to this technology stack. This conjunction of shared concerns about social, political, and personal futures presaged by current developments in machine learning and data science presents the academic discipline of computing with a rare opportunity for self-examination and reconfiguration. This position paper endeavors to do so in four sections. The first expands on the nature of the AI crisis for computing. The second articulates possible critical responses to this crisis and advocates for a broader analytic focus on power relations. The third section presents a novel characterization of academic computing's epistemological field, one which includes not only the discipline's usual instrumental forms of knowledge but reflexive knowledge as well. This reflexive dimension integrates both the critical and public functions of the discipline as equal intellectual partners and a necessary component of any contemporary academic field. The final section will advocate for a conceptual archetype--the Public Computer Intellectual--as a way of practically imagining the expanded possibilities of academic practice in our discipline, one that provides both self-critique and an outward-facing orientation towards the public good. It will argue that the computer education research community can play a vital role in this regard.</description>

      <title>Not a Swiss Army Knife: Academics' Perceptions of Trade-Offs Around Generative Artificial Intelligence Use</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of computing disciplines, substantial efforts are being dedicated to unraveling the sociotechnical implications of generative AI (Gen AI). While existing research has manifested in various forms, there remains a notable gap concerning the direct engagement of knowledge workers in academia with Gen AI. We interviewed 18 knowledge workers, including faculty and students, to investigate the social and technical dimensions of Gen AI from their perspective. Our participants raised concerns about the opacity of the data used to train Gen AI. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to identify and address inaccurate, biased, and potentially harmful, information generated by these models. Knowledge workers also expressed worries about Gen AI undermining trust in the relationship between instructor and student and discussed potential solutions, such as pedagogy readiness, to mitigate them. Additionally, participants recognized Gen AI's potential to democratize knowledge by accelerating the learning process and act as an accessible research assistant. However, there were also concerns about potential social and power imbalances stemming from unequal access to such technologies. Our study offers insights into the concerns and hopes of knowledge workers about the ethical use of Gen AI in educational settings and beyond, with implications for navigating this new landscape.</description>

      <title>Silencing the Risk, Not the Whistle: A Semi-automated Text Sanitization Tool for Mitigating the Risk of Whistleblower Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whistleblowing is essential for ensuring transparency and accountability in both public and private sectors. However, (potential) whistleblowers often fear or face retaliation, even when reporting anonymously. The specific content of their disclosures and their distinct writing style may re-identify them as the source. Legal measures, such as the EU WBD, are limited in their scope and effectiveness. Therefore, computational methods to prevent re-identification are important complementary tools for encouraging whistleblowers to come forward. However, current text sanitization tools follow a one-size-fits-all approach and take an overly limited view of anonymity. They aim to mitigate identification risk by replacing typical high-risk words (such as person names and other NE labels) and combinations thereof with placeholders. Such an approach, however, is inadequate for the whistleblowing scenario since it neglects further re-identification potential in textual features, including writing style. Therefore, we propose, implement, and evaluate a novel classification and mitigation strategy for rewriting texts that involves the whistleblower in the assessment of the risk and utility. Our prototypical tool semi-automatically evaluates risk at the word/term level and applies risk-adapted anonymization techniques to produce a grammatically disjointed yet appropriately sanitized text. We then use a LLM that we fine-tuned for paraphrasing to render this text coherent and style-neutral. We evaluate our tool's effectiveness using court cases from the ECHR and excerpts from a real-world whistleblower testimony and measure the protection against authorship attribution (AA) attacks and utility loss statistically using the popular IMDb62 movie reviews dataset. Our method can significantly reduce AA accuracy from 98.81% to 31.22%, while preserving up to 73.1% of the original content's semantics.</description>

      <title>Data Feminism for AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a set of intersectional feminist principles for conducting equitable, ethical, and sustainable AI research. In Data Feminism (2020), we offered seven principles for examining and challenging unequal power in data science. Here, we present a rationale for why feminism remains deeply relevant for AI research, rearticulate the original principles of data feminism with respect to AI, and introduce two potential new principles related to environmental impact and consent. Together, these principles help to 1) account for the unequal, undemocratic, extractive, and exclusionary forces at work in AI research, development, and deployment; 2) identify and mitigate predictable harms in advance of unsafe, discriminatory, or otherwise oppressive systems being released into the world; and 3) inspire creative, joyful, and collective ways to work towards a more equitable, sustainable world in which all of us can thrive.</description>

      <title>Science Written by Generative AI is Perceived as Less Intelligent, but More Credible and Trustworthy than Science Written by Humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluated the effectiveness of using generative AI to simplify science communication and enhance public trust in science. By comparing lay summaries of journal articles from PNAS, yoked to those generated by AI, this work assessed linguistic simplicity across such summaries and public perceptions. Study 1a analyzed simplicity features of PNAS abstracts (scientific summaries) and significance statements (lay summaries), observing that lay summaries were indeed linguistically simpler, but effect size differences were small. Study 1b used GPT-4 to create significance statements based on paper abstracts and this more than doubled the average effect size without fine-tuning. Finally, Study 2 experimentally demonstrated that simply-written GPT summaries facilitated more favorable public perceptions of scientists (their credibility, trustworthiness) than more complexly-written human PNAS summaries. AI has the potential to engage scientific communities and the public via a simple language heuristic, advocating for its integration into scientific dissemination for a more informed society.</description>

      <title>Fake Artificial Intelligence Generated Contents (FAIGC): A Survey of Theories, Detection Methods, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, generative artificial intelligence models, represented by Large Language Models (LLMs) and Diffusion Models (DMs), have revolutionized content production methods. These artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) have become deeply embedded in various aspects of daily life and work, spanning texts, images, videos, and audio. The authenticity of AI-generated content is progressively enhancing, approaching human-level creative standards. However, these technologies have also led to the emergence of Fake Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (FAIGC), posing new challenges in distinguishing genuine information. It is crucial to recognize that AIGC technology is akin to a double-edged sword; its potent generative capabilities, while beneficial, also pose risks for the creation and dissemination of FAIGC. In this survey, We propose a new taxonomy that provides a more comprehensive breakdown of the space of FAIGC methods today. Next, we explore the modalities and generative technologies of FAIGC, categorized under AI-generated disinformation and AI-generated misinformation. From various perspectives, we then introduce FAIGC detection methods, including Deceptive FAIGC Detection, Deepfake Detection, and Hallucination-based FAIGC Detection. Finally, we discuss outstanding challenges and promising areas for future research.</description>

      <title>ChatGPT in Data Visualization Education: A Student Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlike traditional educational chatbots that rely on pre-programmed responses, large-language model-driven chatbots, such as ChatGPT, demonstrate remarkable versatility and have the potential to serve as a dynamic resource for addressing student needs from understanding advanced concepts to solving complex problems. This work explores the impact of such technology on student learning in an interdisciplinary, project-oriented data visualization course. Throughout the semester, students engaged with ChatGPT across four distinct projects, including data visualizations and implementing them using a variety of tools including Tableau, D3, and Vega-lite. We collected conversation logs and reflection surveys from the students after each assignment. In addition, we conducted interviews with selected students to gain deeper insights into their overall experiences with ChatGPT. Our analysis examined the advantages and barriers of using ChatGPT, students' querying behavior, the types of assistance sought, and its impact on assignment outcomes and engagement. Based on the findings, we discuss design considerations for an educational solution that goes beyond the basic interface of ChatGPT, specifically tailored for data visualization education.</description>

      <title>From Keyboard to Chatbot: An AI-powered Integration Platform with Large-Language Models for Teaching Computational Thinking for Young Children</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teaching programming in early childhood (4-9) to enhance computational thinking has gained popularity in the recent movement of computer science for all. However, current practices ignore some fundamental issues resulting from young children's developmental readiness, such as the sustained capability to keyboarding, the decomposition of complex tasks to small tasks, the need for intuitive mapping from abstract programming to tangible outcomes, and the limited amount of screen time exposure. To address these issues in this paper, we present a novel methodology with an AI-powered integration platform to effectively teach computational thinking for young children. The system features a hybrid pedagogy that supports both the top-down and bottom-up approach for teaching computational thinking. Young children can describe their desired task in natural language, while the system can respond with an easy-to-understand program consisting of the right level of decomposed sub-tasks. A tangible robot can immediately execute the decomposed program and demonstrate the program's outcomes to young children. The system is equipped with an intelligent chatbot that can interact with young children through natural languages, and children can speak to the chatbot to complete all the needed programming tasks, while the chatbot orchestrates the execution of the program onto the robot. This would completely eliminates the need of keyboards for young children to program. By developing such a system, we aim to make the concept of computational thinking more accessible to young children, fostering a natural understanding of programming concepts without the need of explicit programming skills. Through the interactive experience provided by the robotic agent, our system seeks to engage children in an effective manner, contributing to the field of educational technology for early childhood computer science education.</description>

      <title>De-Biasing Models of Biased Decisions: A Comparison of Methods Using Mortgage Application Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prediction models can improve efficiency by automating decisions such as the approval of loan applications. However, they may inherit bias against protected groups from the data they are trained on. This paper adds counterfactual (simulated) ethnic bias to real data on mortgage application decisions, and shows that this bias is replicated by a machine learning model (XGBoost) even when ethnicity is not used as a predictive variable. Next, several other de-biasing methods are compared: averaging over prohibited variables, taking the most favorable prediction over prohibited variables (a novel method), and jointly minimizing errors as well as the association between predictions and prohibited variables. De-biasing can recover some of the original decisions, but the results are sensitive to whether the bias is effected through a proxy.</description>

      <title>Fair Recommendations with Limited Sensitive Attributes: A Distributionally Robust Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As recommender systems are indispensable in various domains such as job searching and e-commerce, providing equitable recommendations to users with different sensitive attributes becomes an imperative requirement. Prior approaches for enhancing fairness in recommender systems presume the availability of all sensitive attributes, which can be difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns or inadequate means of capturing these attributes. In practice, the efficacy of these approaches is limited, pushing us to investigate ways of promoting fairness with limited sensitive attribute information.
  Toward this goal, it is important to reconstruct missing sensitive attributes. Nevertheless, reconstruction errors are inevitable due to the complexity of real-world sensitive attribute reconstruction problems and legal regulations. Thus, we pursue fair learning methods that are robust to reconstruction errors. To this end, we propose Distributionally Robust Fair Optimization (DRFO), which minimizes the worst-case unfairness over all potential probability distributions of missing sensitive attributes instead of the reconstructed one to account for the impact of the reconstruction errors. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence to demonstrate that our method can effectively ensure fairness in recommender systems when only limited sensitive attributes are accessible.</description>

      <title>CoolWalks: Assessing the potential of shaded routing for active mobility in urban street networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walking is the most sustainable form of urban mobility, but is compromised by uncomfortable or unhealthy sun exposure, which is an increasing problem due to global warming. Shade from buildings can provide cooling and protection for pedestrians, but the extent of this potential benefit is unknown. Here we explore the potential for shaded walking, using building footprints and street networks from both synthetic and real cities. We introduce a route choice model with a sun avoidance parameter $\alpha$ and define the CoolWalkability metric to measure opportunities for walking in shade. We derive analytically that on a regular grid with constant building heights, CoolWalkability is independent of $\alpha$, and that the grid provides no CoolWalkability benefit for shade-seeking individuals compared to the shortest path. However, variations in street geometry and building heights create such benefits. We further uncover that the potential for shaded routing differs between grid-like and irregular street networks, forms local clusters, and is sensitive to the mapped network geometry. Our research identifies the limitations and potential of shade for cool, active travel, and is a first step towards a rigorous understanding of shade provision for sustainable mobility in cities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the novel topic of data breach journalism and data breach news through the case of databreaches.net, a news outlet dedicated to data breaches and related cyber crime. Motivated by the issues in traditional crime news and crime journalism, the case is explored by the means of text mining. According to the results, the outlet has kept a steady publishing pace, mainly focusing on plain and short reporting but with generally high-quality source material for the news articles. Despite these characteristics, the news articles exhibit fairly strong sentiments, which is partially expected due to the presence of emotionally laden crime and the long history of sensationalism in crime news. The news site has also covered the full scope of data breaches, although many of these are fairly traditional, exposing personal identifiers and financial details of the victims. Also hospitals and the healthcare sector stand out. With these results, the paper advances the study of data breaches by considering these from the perspective of media and journalism.</description>

      <title>Towards Environmentally Equitable AI via Geographical Load Balancing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fueled by the soaring popularity of large language and foundation models, the accelerated growth of artificial intelligence (AI) models' enormous environmental footprint has come under increased scrutiny. While many approaches have been proposed to make AI more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly, environmental inequity -- the fact that AI's environmental footprint can be disproportionately higher in certain regions than in others -- has emerged, raising social-ecological justice concerns. This paper takes a first step toward addressing AI's environmental inequity by balancing its regional negative environmental impact. Concretely, we focus on the carbon and water footprints of AI model inference and propose equity-aware geographical load balancing (GLB) to explicitly address AI's environmental impacts on the most disadvantaged regions. We run trace-based simulations by considering a set of 10 geographically-distributed data centers that serve inference requests for a large language AI model. The results demonstrate that existing GLB approaches may amplify environmental inequity while our proposed equity-aware GLB can significantly reduce the regional disparity in terms of carbon and water footprints.</description>

      <title>Converting Representational Counterfactuals to Natural Language</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interventions targeting the representation space of language models (LMs) have emerged as an effective means to influence model behavior. Such methods are employed, for example, to eliminate or alter the encoding of demographic information such as gender within the model's representations and, in so doing, create a counterfactual representation. However, because the intervention operates within the representation space, understanding precisely what aspects of the text it modifies poses a challenge. In this paper, we give a method to convert representation counterfactuals into string counterfactuals. We demonstrate that this approach enables us to analyze the linguistic alterations corresponding to a given representation space intervention and to interpret the features utilized to encode a specific concept. Moreover, the resulting counterfactuals can be used to mitigate bias in classification through data augmentation.</description>

      <title>Survey of Bias In Text-to-Image Generation: Definition, Evaluation, and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement of large and powerful models with Text-to-Image (T2I) generation abilities -- such as OpenAI's DALLE-3 and Google's Gemini -- enables users to generate high-quality images from textual prompts. However, it has become increasingly evident that even simple prompts could cause T2I models to exhibit conspicuous social bias in generated images. Such bias might lead to both allocational and representational harms in society, further marginalizing minority groups. Noting this problem, a large body of recent works has been dedicated to investigating different dimensions of bias in T2I systems. However, an extensive review of these studies is lacking, hindering a systematic understanding of current progress and research gaps. We present the first extensive survey on bias in T2I generative models. In this survey, we review prior studies on dimensions of bias: Gender, Skintone, and Geo-Culture. Specifically, we discuss how these works define, evaluate, and mitigate different aspects of bias. We found that: (1) while gender and skintone biases are widely studied, geo-cultural bias remains under-explored; (2) most works on gender and skintone bias investigated occupational association, while other aspects are less frequently studied; (3) almost all gender bias works overlook non-binary identities in their studies; (4) evaluation datasets and metrics are scattered, with no unified framework for measuring biases; and (5) current mitigation methods fail to resolve biases comprehensively. Based on current limitations, we point out future research directions that contribute to human-centric definitions, evaluations, and mitigation of biases. We hope to highlight the importance of studying biases in T2I systems, as well as encourage future efforts to holistically understand and tackle biases, building fair and trustworthy T2I technologies for everyone.</description>

      <title>Robust Pronoun Fidelity with English LLMs: Are they Reasoning, Repeating, or Just Biased?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03134</link>

Abstract: Robust, faithful and harm-free pronoun use for individuals is an important goal for language models as their use increases, but prior work tends to study only one or two of these characteristics at a time. To measure progress towards the combined goal, we introduce the task of pronoun fidelity: given a context introducing a co-referring entity and pronoun, the task is to reuse the correct pronoun later. We present RUFF, a carefully-designed dataset of over 5 million instances to measure robust pronoun fidelity in English, and we evaluate 37 popular large language models across architectures (encoder-only, decoder-only and encoder-decoder) and scales (11M-70B parameters). When an individual is introduced with a pronoun, models can mostly faithfully reuse this pronoun in the next sentence, but they are significantly worse with she/her/her, singular they and neopronouns. Moreover, models are easily distracted by non-adversarial sentences discussing other people; even one additional sentence with a distractor pronoun causes accuracy to drop on average by 34%. Our results show that pronoun fidelity is neither robust, nor due to reasoning, in a simple, naturalistic setting where humans achieve nearly 100% accuracy. We encourage researchers to bridge the gaps we find and to carefully evaluate reasoning in settings where superficial repetition might inflate perceptions of model performance.</description>

      <title>Towards A Structured Overview of Use Cases for Natural Language Processing in the Legal Domain: A German Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of Legal Tech has risen in prevalence, as the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and legal disciplines have combined forces to digitalize legal processes. Amidst the steady flow of research solutions stemming from the NLP domain, the study of use cases has fallen behind, leading to a number of innovative technical methods without a place in practice. In this work, we aim to build a structured overview of Legal Tech use cases, grounded in NLP literature, but also supplemented by voices from legal practice in Germany. Based upon a Systematic Literature Review, we identify seven categories of NLP technologies for the legal domain, which are then studied in juxtaposition to 22 legal use cases. In the investigation of these use cases, we identify 15 ethical, legal, and social aspects (ELSA), shedding light on the potential concerns of digitally transforming the legal domain.</description>
