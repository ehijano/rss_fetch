      <title>Optical Vortex Ladder via Sisyphus Pumping of Pseudospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust higher-order optical vortices are much in demand for applications in optical manipulation, optical communications, quantum entanglement and quantum computing. However, in numerous experimental settings, a controlled generation of optical vortices with arbitrary orbital angular momentum (OAM) remains a substantial challenge. Here, we present a concept of "optical vortex ladder" for stepwise generation of optical vortices through Sisyphus pumping of pseudospin modes in photonic graphene. Instead of conical diffraction and incomplete pseudospin conversion under traditional Gaussian beam excitations, the vortices produced in the ladder arise from non-trivial topology and feature diffraction-free Bessel profiles, thanks to the refined excitation of the ring spectrum around the Dirac cones. By employing a periodic "kick" to the photonic graphene, effectively inducing the Sisyphus pumping, the ladder enables tunable generation of optical vortices of any order even when the initial excitation does not involve any OAM. The optical vortex ladder stands out as an intriguing non-Hermitian dynamical system, and, among other possibilities, opens up a pathway for applications of topological singularities in beam shaping and wavefront engineering.</description>

      <title>Dressing the Cusp: How Sharp-Edge Diffraction Theory Solves a Basic Issue in Catastrophe Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of light diffraction using catastrophe optics is one of the most intriguing theoretical invention in the field of classical optics of the last four decades. Its practical implementation has faced some resistance over the years, mainly due to the difficulty of mathematically decorating the different, topologically speaking, types of optical singularities (caustics) that concur to build up the skeleton on which diffraction patterns stem. Such a fundamental {\em dressing problem} has been solved in the past only for the so-called {\em fold}, which lies at the bottom of the hierarchy of structurally stable caustics. Climbing this hierarchy implies considerably more challenging mathematical problems to be solved.
  An ancient mathematical theorem is here employed to find the complete solution of the dressing problem for the {\em cusp}, which is placed, in the stable caustic hierarchy, immediately after the fold. The other ingredient used for achieving such an important theoretical result is the paraxial version of the boundary diffraction wave theory, whose tight connection with catastrophe optics has recently been emphasized in [R. Borghi, Opt. Lett. {\bf 41,} 3114 - 3117 (2016)].
  A significant example of the developed algorithm aimed at demonstrating its effectiveness and ease of implementation, is also presented.</description>

      <title>783-MHz fundamental repetition rate, Er-doped all-fiber ring laser mode-locked by carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have demonstrated 783-MHz fundamental repetition rate from a compact and robust Er-doped all-fiber ring laser mode-locked by carbon nanotubes (CNT), with pulse width of 623 fs at center wavelength of 1562 nm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest fundamental repetition rate has been reported from an all-fiber ring laser. By using CNT saturable absorber (SA), a relatively low self-starting pump threshold of 108 mW is achieved. The laser has a very compact footprint less than 10 cm X 10 cm, benefiting from the all-active-fiber cavity design. The robust mode-locking is confirmed by the low relative intensity noise (RIN) and a long-term stability test. We propose a new scheme for generating high repetition rate femtosecond optical pulses from a compact and stable all-fiber ring laser.</description>

      <title>Microwave photonic short-time Fourier transform based on stabilized period-one nonlinear laser dynamics and stimulated Brillouin scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microwave photonic short-time Fourier transform (STFT) system based on stabilized period-one (P1) nonlinear laser dynamics and stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) is proposed. By using an optoelectronic feedback loop, the frequency-sweep optical signal generated by the P1 nonlinear laser dynamics is stabilized, which is further used in conjunction with an optical bandpass filter implemented by stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) to achieve the frequency-to-time mapping of microwave signals and the final STFT. By comparing the experimental results with and without optoelectronic feedback, it is found that the time-frequency diagram of the signal under test (SUT) obtained by STFT is clearer and more regular, and the frequency of the SUT measured in each frequency-sweep period is more accurate. The mean absolute error is reduced by 50% under the optimal filter bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Transverse Inscription of Silicon Waveguides by Picosecond Laser Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, picosecond laser inscription of segmented waveguides in crystalline silicon based on a deterministic single-pulse modification process is demonstrated.Pulses of 43 ps duration at 1.55 ${\mu}$m wavelength are used to transversely inscribe periodic structures with a pulse-to-pulse pitch of around 2 ${\mu}$m. Infrared shadowgraphy images and Raman spectroscopy measurements indicate that the modifications exhibit a spherical shape. Characterization of waveguide performance at 1.55 ${\mu}$m for various pulse energies and periods is carried out. Direct comparison with numerical simulations confirms the presence of graded index waveguides, encompassing a micrometer core size and a maximum refractive index change of around $7\times 10^{-3}$. This short-pulse inscription approach can pave the way for three-dimensional integrated photonic devices in the bulk of silicon.</description>

      <title>2 $\mu$m Watt-level Fiber Amplifiers, Lasers, and ASE Sources Pumped by Broadband ASE Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the design and demonstration of novel 2 $\mu$m band Watt-level fiber amplifiers, fiber lasers, and wideband ASE sources that are pumped with broad spectrum Watt-level ASE sources instead of conventional fiber laser pumps. We show good agreement between the simulations and experimental results for the performance of a single-stage Ho-doped fiber amplifier at 2050nm wavelength pumped by a 50 nm broadband Tm-doped ASE source centered at 1860 nm. Next, we show that the new ASE pumping approach works effectively for a two -stage Ho-doped fiber amplifier as for a single stage Ho-doped fiber amplifier. Then, we demonstrate successfully the pumping of a Tm-doped fiber laser at 2039 nm using an ASE source centered at 1550 nm. Finally, we produce a novel 265 nm wide broadband ASE source at 2 $\mu$m by concatenating Tm and Ho ASE sources. Our ASE-based pumping approach is simple and versatile compared to the standard laser based pumping means, and leads to similar device performance.</description>

      <title>Vignetting Effects: a Tool to Characterize a Fourier Ptychographic Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier Ptychographic Microscopy (FPM) is a recent technique to overcome the diffraction limit of a low numerical aperture (NA) objective lens by algorithmic post-processing of several lower resolved images. It can increase the space-bandwidth product of an optical system by computationally combining images captured under different illumination conditions. Vignetting determines the spatial extent of the bright field and dark field regions in the captured images that contain information about low and high frequency image content, respectively. State-of-the-art analyses treat vignetting as a nuisance that needs to be reduced or excluded from algorithmic consideration by means of ad-hoc decision rules [1]. In contrast, this work investigates vignetting effects as a tool to infer a range of properties of the optical system. To achieve this, we characterize the individual system components of the experimental setup and compare experimental data to both, geometrical and wave optical simulations. We demonstrate that using vignetting as an analytical tool enables the modeling of the geometric and coherence properties of the optical system as evidenced by the good agreement between our simulation and experiment. Moreover, our work investigates pupil aberrations in the FPM setup and enables their partial characterization, despite not yet encompassing all aspects.</description>

      <title>Structural colors with embedded anti-counterfeit features fabricated by laser-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural colors can be induced on metals not only to fabricate logos or decorative motives but also to embed anti-counterfeit features for product protection. In this study, stainless steel (EN 1.4301) plates are colorized by growing a thin oxide layer using direct laser writing (DLW) and hidden anti-counterfeit measures are included on their surfaces by direct laser interference patterning (DLIP) processing. The periodic microstructures resulting from the DLIP treatment have a spatial period of 1 um and act as relief diffraction gratings, featuring a characteristic diffraction pattern. These microstructures are not visible to the human eye but are easily detectable upon shining a coherent beam on the surface. Furthermore, the reflectance over the visible spectrum of the colorized surfaces with and without the DLIP microtexture is measured, giving low differences in the color perception following the so-called "CIE L*a*b*" color space. Finally, a demonstrator is fabricated, in which colorized fields with and without the security features are shown.</description>

      <title>Light propagation in time-periodic bi-isotropic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic structures and time-crystals, wherein time is incorporated as an additional degree of freedom for light manipulation, have necessitated the development of analytical and semi-analytical tools. However, such tools are currently limited to specific configurations, leaving several unexplored physical phenomena akin to photonic time-crystals elusive. In this communication, using a coupled-wave theory approach, we unveil the occurring light propagation phenomena in a time-periodic bi-isotropic medium whose permittivity, permeability, and chirality parameter are periodic functions of time. Contrary to their static counterparts, we demonstrate that the considered dynamic medium couples only co-handed counter-propagating waves. In cases of non-constant impedance, we prove that two first-order momentum gaps are formed in the Brillouin diagram, resulting in parametric amplification with different amplification factors and corresponding momenta for the right- and left-handed modes, respectively. The presence of chirality plays a major role in manipulating lightwave signals by controlling the center of resonance, the corresponding bandwidth, and the amplification factor in a distinct fashion for each mode. For a finite ``time-slab'' of the medium, we analytically derive the scattering coefficients as functions of time and momentum, discussing how extreme values of optical rotation grant access to the temporal analog of the chirality-induced negative refraction regime. Finally, we demonstrate the mechanism under which elliptical polarizations may change field orientation whilst the electric field propagates in a momentum gap, thus simultaneously showcasing parametric amplification.</description>

      <title>Nanojet Visualization and Dark-field Imaging of Optically Trapped Vaterite Capsules with Endoscopic Illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical responsivity grants biomedical capsules additional capabilities, promoting them towards multifunctional theragnostic nanodevices. In this endeavor, screening candidates under conditions that closely resemble in situ environments is crucial for both the initial optimization and the subsequent inspection stages of development and operation. Optical tweezers equipped with dark-field spectroscopy are among the preferable tools for nanoparticle imaging and refractometry. However, the effectiveness of conventional illumination and light collection arrangements for inspecting anisotropic complex inner composition particles is quite limited due to reduced collection angles, which can result in the omission of features in scattering diagrams. Here we introduce an endoscopic dark-field illumination scheme, where light is launched on an optically trapped particle from a single-mode fiber, immersed into a fluid cell. This arrangement disentangles illumination and collection paths, thus allowing the collection of scattered light with a very high numerical aperture. This methodology is applied to vaterite nanocapsules, which are known to possess strong anisotropic responses. Tweezer configuration allows revealing optical properties for different crystallographic orientations of vaterite, which is complex to do otherwise. Furthermore, endoscopic dark-field images reveal the emergence of polarization-dependent long-range photonic nanojets, which are capable of interacting with nearby particles, demonstrating a new pathway for nanojet image formation.</description>

      <title>Achromatic Full Stokes Polarimetry Metasurface for Full-color Polarization Imaging in the Visible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces composed of anisotropic subwavelength structures provide an ultrathin platform for a compact, real-time polarimeter. However, applications in polychromatic scenes are restricted by the limited operating bandwidths and degraded imaging quality due to the loss of spectral information. Here, we demonstrated full-color polarization imaging based on an achromatic polarimeter consisting of four polarization-dependent metalenses. Boosted by an intelligent design scheme, arbitrary phase compensation and multi-objective matching are effectively compatible with a limited database. Broadband achromaticity for wavelengths ranging from 450 nm to 650 nm, with a relative bandwidth of nearly 0.435, is achieved for the full Stokes imaging. The experimental polarization reconstructed errors for operating wavelengths of 450 nm, 550 nm, and 650 nm are 7.5%, 5.9%, and 3.8%, respectively. The full-color and full-polarization imaging capability of the device is also verified with a customized object. The proposed scheme paves the way for further developing polarization imaging toward practical applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of paraxial optical Skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector light beams, characterised by a spatially varying polarisation, can exhibit localised structures reminiscent of the Skyrmions familiar from the study of magnetic media. We present a theory of such Skyrmions within paraxial optics, exploiting mathematical analogies with the study of superfluids, especially the A phase of superfluid $\textrm{He}^3$. The key feature is the Skyrmion field which, together with the underlying Skyrmion vector potential, determines the properties of the Skyrmions and, more generally, the polarisation structure of every paraxial vector beam. In addition to structures with integer Skyrmion number we find polarisation patterns with non-integer Skyrmion number; these seem to have no analogue in other fields of physics.</description>

      <title>FDTD-based Inverse Design enables f/0.27 flat Microlens Array for Integral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a high-NA (0.88), ultra-low-f-number (f/0.2714), multi-wavelength (480nm, 550nm and 650nm) multilevel diffractive MicroLens Array (MLA) using inverse design. Each microlens in the array is close-packed with diameter of 70 {\mu}m and focal length of only 19 {\mu}m in air. The MLA was patterned on one surface of a polymer film via UV casting, such that the focal plane was located on the distal end of the film (n of polymer ~ 1.47, thickness = 28 {\mu}m, effective f/# (NA) inside polymer ~ 0.4 (0.78)). Each microlens focuses incident light at 3 design wavelengths into a focal spot with measured full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) &lt; 1 {\mu}m. By placing this MLA directly on a high-resolution print, we demonstrated RGB integral imaging with applications in document security. Compared to refractive MLAs, our diffractive MLA reduces the thickness by &gt; 3X, which is advantageous for manufacturability. Since these multi-level diffractive MLAs are fabricated using UV-casting, they have the potential for low-cost, high-volume manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Divide-Conquer-and-Merge: Memory- and Time-Efficient Holographic Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, deep learning-based computer-generated holography (CGH) has demonstrated tremendous potential in three-dimensional (3D) displays and yielded impressive display quality. However, most existing deep learning-based CGH techniques can only generate holograms of 1080p resolution, which is far from the ultra-high resolution (16K+) required for practical virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications to support a wide field of view and large eye box. One of the major obstacles in current CGH frameworks lies in the limited memory available on consumer-grade GPUs which could not facilitate the generation of higher-definition holograms. To overcome the aforementioned challenge, we proposed a divide-conquer-and-merge strategy to address the memory and computational capacity scarcity in ultra-high-definition CGH generation. This algorithm empowers existing CGH frameworks to synthesize higher-definition holograms at a faster speed while maintaining high-fidelity image display quality. Both simulations and experiments were conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework. By integrating our strategy into HoloNet and CCNNs, we achieved significant reductions in GPU memory usage during the training period by 64.3\% and 12.9\%, respectively. Furthermore, we observed substantial speed improvements in hologram generation, with an acceleration of up to 3$\times$ and 2 $\times$, respectively. Particularly, we successfully trained and inferred 8K definition holograms on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU for the first time in simulations. Furthermore, we conducted full-color optical experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method. We believe our strategy can provide a novel approach for memory- and time-efficient holographic displays.</description>

      <title>Quantum plasmonic sensing by Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum plasmonic sensor using Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry that measures the refractive index of an analyte, embedded in a plasmonic beam splitter composed of a dual-Kretschmann configuration, which serves as a frustrated total internal reflection beamsplitter. The sensing performance of the HOM interferometry, combined with single-photon detectors, is evaluated through Fisher information for estimation of the refractive index of the analyte. This is subsequently compared with the classical benchmark that considers the injection of a coherent state of light into the plasmonic beamsplitter. By varying the wavelength of the single photons and the refractive index of the analyte, we identify a wide range where a 50 % quantum enhancement is achieved and discuss the observed behaviors in comparison with the classical benchmark. We expect this study to provide a useful insight into the advancement of quantum-enhanced sensing technologies, with direct implications for a wide range of nanophotonic beamsplitter structures.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate PT symmetry, induced mechanical lasing and force sensing in an optically levitated nanoparticle with coupled oscillation modes. The coupling in the levitated system is created by the modulation of an asymmetric optical potential in the plane transverse to the beam trapping the nanoparticle. We show that such a coupling can lead to PT-symmetric mechanical behavior for experimentally realistic parameters. Further, by examining the phonon dynamics and the second-order coherence of the nanoparticle modes, we determine that induced mechanical lasing is also possible. Finally, we demonstrate that tunable ultra-sensitive force sensing can be engineered in the system. Our studies represent an advance in the fields of coherent manipulation of coupled degrees of freedom of levitated mechanical oscillators and their application for sensing.</description>

      <title>Photophysics of defect-passivated quasi-2D (PEA)2PbBr4 perovskite using an organic small-molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D Ruddlesden - Popper perovskites are promising candidates for energy harvesting applications due to their tunable optical properties and excellent ambient stability. Moreover, they are solution-processable and compatible with upscalable manufacturing via various printing techniques. Unfortunately, such methods often induce large degrees of heterogeneity due to poorly controlled crystallization. Here, we address this issue by blending the well-known 2D perovskite (PEA)2PbBr4 with an organic small-molecule, namely C8-BTBT, employed as an additive with different blending ratios. Using terahertz (THz) absorption and temperature-dependent photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy techniques we observe that with the C8-BTBT additive the photophysical properties are altered while the perovskite structure in the film remains unaffected. More precisely, the inclusion of trace amounts of C8-BTBT in the hybrid films results in defect passivation at perovskite platelet boundaries and at the surfaces, as indicated by increased carrier lifetimes and substantially increased photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY). This in turn improves the responsivity of photodetectors using the 2D perovskite as active layer. Our study highlights a straightforward strategy for fabricating high-quality 2D perovskites via large-area processing techniques.</description>

      <title>Phonon Directionality Determines the Polarization of the Band-Edge Exciton Emission in Two-Dimensional Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional metal-halide perovskites are highly versatile for light-driven applications due to their exceptional variety in material composition, which can be exploited for tunability of mechanical and optoelectronic properties. The band edge emission is governed by the exciton fine structure that is defined by structure and composition of both organic and inorganic layers. Moreover, electronic and elastic properties are intricately connected in these materials. Electron-phonon coupling plays a crucial role in the recombination dynamics. However, the nature of the electron-phonon coupling, as well as which kind of phonons are involved, is still under debate. Here we investigate the emission and phonon response from single two-dimensional lead-iodide microcrystals with angle-resolved polarized spectroscopy. We find an intricate dependence of the emission polarization with the vibrational directionality in the materials, which clearly reveals that several bands of the low-frequency phonons of the inorganic lead-iodide perovskite lattice play the key role in the band edge emission. Our findings demonstrate how the emission spectrum and polarization of two-dimensional layered perovskites can be designed by their material composition, which is essential for optoelectronic applications, where fine control on the spectral and structural properties of the light is desired.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian magnonic knobbing between electromagnetically induced reflection and transparancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulation of wave propagation through open resonant systems has attracted tremendous interest. When accessible to the open system, the system under study is prone to tempering to out of equilibrium, and a lack of reciprocity is the rule rather than the exception. Open systems correspond to non-hermitian Hamiltonians with very unique properties such as resulting exceptional points and ideal isolation. Here, we have found a highly sensitive modulation for the intersection of resonant patch antennas with respect to cavity magnonic coupling by means of an open coupling system of three resonant modes. Two types of crossings are implemented in this study: the first type of crossing remotely controls the sharp switching of the transmission line 's transmittance, while regulating the repulsive behavior of its zero-reflection states. The second type of crossing corresponds to the modulation of non-reciprocal phase transitions, which enables a more desirable isolation effect. Three different coupling models are realized by a non-Hermitian scattering Hamiltonian, revealing distinct spatial overlaps between modes. This elucidates that dissipative coupling of at least two modes to the environment is crucial for non-reciprocal transport. Our work not only reveals the versatility of cavity magnonic systems but also provides a way to design functional devices for general wave optics using patch antenna crossings.</description>

      <title>A VUV light source for enhanced production of metastable krypton and xenon beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate excitation of metastable krypton and xenon beams using a vacuum ultraviolet lamp and directly compare the performance of this method to metastable excitation based on a radiofrequency-driven plasma discharge. In our apparatus, lamp-based metastable excitation outperforms the plasma discharge across a wide range of beam flux values relevant for Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA). Moreover, we do not observe significant degradation in lamp performance after over 160 hours of operation. We find that lamp-based excitation is particularly advantageous at the smallest and largest beam fluxes tested, demonstrating the utility of this approach both for improving krypton ATTA and for enabling the detection of radioactive xenon isotopes using ATTA. Finally, we demonstrate an additional enhancement to lamp-based metastable excitation efficiency and stability by applying an external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Conversion of twistedness from light to atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a simple model and propose a scheme that allows the production of twisted atoms in free space using the absorption of twisted photons by a bound electron. We show that in the inelastic collision of a photon and an atom, the twisted state of the photon is transferred to the center-of-mass state, so that the projection of the orbital momentum of the atom becomes $m_\gamma-\Delta m_e$. We also show that, depending on the experimental conditions, the twistedness of the photon is either transferred to the atomic center-of-mass quantum state or modifies the selection rule for the bound electron transition.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Snowpack Density, Grain Size, and Black Carbon Concentration Using Time-domain Diffuse Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse optical spectroscopy (DOS) techniques aim to characterize scattering media by examining their optical response to laser illumination. Time-domain DOS methods involve illuminating the medium with a laser pulse and using a fast photodetector to measure the time-dependent intensity of light that exits the medium after multiple scattering events. While DOS research traditionally focused on characterizing biological tissues, we demonstrate that time-domain diffuse optical measurements can also be used to characterize snow. We introduce a model that predicts the time-dependent reflectance of a dry snowpack as a function of its density, grain size, and black carbon content, and we develop an algorithm that retrieves these properties from measurements at two wavelengths. To validate our approach, we use a two-wavelength lidar system and measure the time-dependent reflectance of snow samples with varying properties. Rather than measuring direct surface returns, our system captures photons that enter and exit the snow at different points, separated by a small distance (4-10cm). We find strong, linear correlations between our retrievals of density and black carbon concentration, and ground truth measurements. Although the correlation is not as strong, we also find that our method is capable of distinguishing between small and large grains.</description>

      <title>A Programmable and Reconfigurable Photonic Simulator for Classical XY Models</title>

Abstract: In this work, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated a photonic simulator for XY models, which is a typical kind of classical spin models. By encoding the XY spins on the phase term of the input light field, the corresponding XY Hamiltonian could be performed on the output light intensities. The simulator is mainly based on a programmable and reconfigurable optical vector-matrix multiplication system, which can map arbitrary XY models within the dimensionality limit. Here, we demonstrated the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition in a two-dimensional XY model, in which the expectation values of some observables are calculated and consistent with the theory. Besides, we performed the ground state search of two 25-spin XY models with different spin connections and coupling strengths. Our proposal paves a new way to investigate the XY spin system.</description>

      <title>Performance of a Sagnac interferometer to observe vacuum optical nonlinearity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Quantum Electrodynamics, vacuum becomes a nonlinear optical medium: its optical index should be modified in the presence of intense external electromagnetic fields. The DeLLight project (Deflection of Light by Light) aims to observe this effect using intense focused femtosecond laser pulses delivered by LASERIX. The principle is to measure with a Sagnac interferometer the deflection of a low-intensity focused pulse (probe) crossing the vacuum index gradient induced by a high-intensity pulse (pump). A Sagnac interferometer working with femtosecond laser pulses has been developed for the DeLLight project. Compared to previous prototypes, the interferometer now includes the focusing of the probe beam in the interaction area. In this article, we measure and characterize the critical experimental parameters limiting the sensitivity of the interferometer, namely the extinction factor, the spatial resolution, and the waist at focus of the probe pulse. We discuss future improvements.</description>

      <title>Strongly interacting photons in 2D waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One dimensional confinement in waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) plays a crucial role to enhance light-matter interactions and to induce a strong quantum nonlinear optical response. In two or higher dimensional settings, this response is reduced since photons can be emitted within a larger phase space, opening the question whether strong photon-photon interaction can be still achieved. In this study, we positively answer this question for the case of a 2D square array of atoms coupled to the light confined into a two-dimensional waveguide. More specifically, we demonstrate the occurrence of long-lived two-photon repulsive and bound states with genuine 2D features. Furthermore, we observe signatures of these effects also in free-space atomic arrays in the form of weakly-subradiant in-band scattering resonances. Our findings provide a paradigmatic signature of the presence of strong photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED.</description>
