      <title>On the exterior power structure of the cohomology groups for the general hypergeometric integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the exterior power structure of the algebraic de Rham cohomology group associated with the Gelfand hypergeometric function and its confluent family. The hypergeometric function F(z) is a function on the Zariski open subset $Z_{r+1}\subset\mat{r+1,N}$, called the generic stratum, defined by an r-dimesional integral on $\Ps^{r}$. For $z\in Z_{r+1}$, the algebraic de Rham cohomology group is associated to the integral. When z belongs to the particular subset of $Z_{r+1}$, called the Veronese image, we show that this cohomology group can be expressed as the exterior power product of the de Rham cohomology group associated with the hypergeometric function defined by 1-dimensional integral.</description>

      <title>Recurrence relations and the Christoffel-Darboux formula for elliptic orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant progress in the theory of orthogonal polynomials on algebraic curves, particularly on genus 1 surfaces. In this paper, we focus on elliptic orthogonal polynomials and establish several of their fundamental properties. In particular, we derive general five-term and seven-term recurrence relations, which lead to a Christoffel-Darboux formula and the construction of an associated point process on the A-cycle of the torus. Notably, the recurrence coefficients in these relations are intricately linked through the underlying elliptic curve equation. Under additional symmetry assumptions on the weight function, the structure simplifies considerably, recovering known results for orthogonal polynomials on the complex plane.</description>

      <title>Mizohata-Takeuchi inequalities for orthonormal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish some weighted $L^2$ inequalities for Fourier extension operators in the setting of orthonormal systems. In the process we develop a direct approach to such inequalities based on generalised Wigner distributions, complementing the Schatten duality approach that is prevalent in the wider context of estimates for such orthonormal systems. Our results are set within a broader family of tentatively suggested ($L^p$) inequalities of Mizohata--Takeuchi type. For $p$ an even integer we see that such weighted inequalities may be recast as questions of co-positivity of tensor forms, and for $p\leq 1$ we provide some evidence that they may hold in reverse provided the orthonormal sequence is complete.</description>

      <title>A characterization of $(\mu,\nu)$-dichotomies via admissibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a characterization of $(\mu,\nu)$-dichotomies in terms of the admissibility of certain pairs of weighted spaces for nonautonomous discrete time dynamics acting on Banach spaces. Our general framework enables us to treat various settings in which no similar result has been previously obtained as well as to recover and refine several known results. We emphasize that our results hold without any bounded growth assumption and the statements make no use of Lyapunov norms. Moreover, as a consequence of our characterization, we study the robustness of $(\mu, \nu)$-dichotomies, i.e. we show that this notion persists under small but very general linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing for Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that Gibbs measures on self-conformal sets generated by a $C^{1+\alpha}$ conformal IFS on $\mathbb{R}^d$ satisfying the OSC are exponentially mixing. We exploit this to obtain essentially sharp asymptotic counting statements for the recurrent and the shrinking target subsets associated with any such set. In particular, we provide explicit examples of dynamical systems for which the recurrent sets exhibit (unexpected) behaviour that is not present in the shrinking target setup. In the process of establishing our exponential mixing result we extend Mattila's rigidity theorem for self-similar sets to self-conformal sets without any separation condition and for arbitrary Gibbs measures.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity and Fourier asymptotics of spectral measures for 1D Schr\"odinger operators under exponentially decaying perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity, or even the Lipschitz property, for the spectral measures of half-line discrete Schr\"odinger operators under suitable boundary conditions and exponentially decaying small potentials. These are the first known examples, apart from the free case, of Schr\"odinger operators with Lipschitz continuous spectral measures up to the spectral edge, and it was obtained as a consequence of the Dirichlet boundary condition. Notably, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the time-averaged quantum return probability, either $\log (t) / t$ or $1 / t$, as in the case of the free Laplacian, remains unchanged in this setting. Furthermore, we prove the persistence of the purely absolutely continuous spectrum and the $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuity of the spectral measures for (Diophantine) quasi-periodic operators under exponentially decaying small perturbations. These results are optimal and hold for all energies, up to the border of the absolutely continuous spectrum.</description>
