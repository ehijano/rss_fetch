      <title>On the Type IIn SN 2025cbj coincidence with the high-energy neutrino IceCube-250421A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The origin of the astrophysical high-energy neutrino flux remains uncertain. Core-collapse supernovae with strong CSM interaction (Type IIn) are compelling candidates for efficient hadronic acceleration and neutrino production. Aims. We investigate the possible association between the Type IIn supernova SN2025cbj and the IceCube high-energy neutrino IceCube-250421A, and assess whether the observed properties of the SN permit an appreciable neutrino yield. Methods. We combined rapid optical follow-up with LAST and archival ZTF photometry with spectroscopy from LT/SPRAT and MMT/BINOSPEC to characterize the SN evolution and CSM interaction. We estimated the explosion and peak times from early light-curve fitting, and quantified the chance-coincidence probability with resampling simulations that scramble neutrino right ascensions while preserving declinations and error contours. Using a simple post-shock-breakout interaction model in a dense wind, we estimated the expected muon-neutrino yield for IceCube real-time Bronze stream. Results. Spectra of SN2025cbj obtained after the neutrino epoch show persistent narrow Balmer lines superposed on broad Lorentzian electron-scattering wings, consistent with sustained dense-CSM interaction. For the multi-messenger association, resampling simulations against the TNS catalog give a chance-coincidence probability for observing $k \ge 1$ events of $p \simeq 0.24$ (and $p \simeq 0.078$ against the ZTF-BTS catalog). These values are sensitive to the size of the SNe and neutrino samples. A post-breakout interaction scenario predicts an expected $N_{\nu_\mu} \sim 10^{-3}$ events in the IceCube Bronze alert stream over 76 days per this one candidate. We discuss the implications of these numbers and possible biases that may affect these results.</description>

      <title>Detecting Neutrino Emission from Supernova Remnants: A Theoretically Motivated Target Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) are thought to accelerate cosmic rays (CRs) to several PeV energies, but this has yet to be confirmed as general behavior. Although several sources show ~100 TeV gamma rays, their hadronic origin is uncertain; a matching neutrino signal would provide definitive evidence. Using insight from the theory of diffusive shock acceleration, we evaluate the spectra and environments of the sample of Galactic SNRs to identify those most likely to be hadronic, categorizing them into a tiered catalog depending on their likelihood to produce neutrinos detectable in the TeV-PeV range. We then calculate the estimated stacked sensitivity of IceCube for each tier using IceCube's ten-year public data. Our results suggest that this strategy of stacking SNRs and carefully excluding leptonic sources by using theoretical arguments may allow for a detection of this source class that would otherwise be impossible. A follow-up analysis of these catalogs using TeV-PeV sensitive neutrino data from IceCube (or similar telescopes like KM3NeT/ARCA) offers the most decisive, near-future test for the hadronic nature of these SNRs and the maximum energies of their CR spectra.</description>

      <title>UVOIR spectrum, X-ray emission, and proper motion of the isolated neutron star RX J2143.0+0654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the isolated neutron star RX J2143.0+0654 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in the UVOIR wavelength range (0.14-1.7 $\mu$m). The UV part is consistent with a Rayleigh-Jeans tail of a thermal spectrum, $f_\nu\propto \nu^2$, while a power-law spectrum, $f_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$ with $\alpha \sim -0.8$, dominates in the NIR-optical. A joint fit of the UVOIR and contemporaneous X-ray spectra with a two-component blackbody with possible absorption features + power-law optical spectrum yields the following temperature and apparent radius of the colder component (which gives the main contribution in the UV): $kT_{\rm cold}\approx 45$ eV, $R_{\rm cold}\approx 6 d_{260}$ km, where $d_{260}$ is the distance in units of 260 pc. The temperature and radius of the hotter component, $kT_{\rm hot}\approx 106$ eV and $R_{\rm hot} \approx 1.5d_{260}$ km, the parameters of an absorption feature at 0.74 keV, and the properties of X-ray pulsations, are the same as found in previous X-ray observations. In the NIR images the neutron star is possibly surrounded by extended emission with a characteristic size of $\sim 2''$ and flux densities of about 1.7 and 0.9 $\mu$Jy at 1.54 and 1.15 $\mu$m, respectively. Comparison with a previous HST observation in the optical 14 years ago shows a proper motion $\mu\approx 6$ mas yr$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a small transverse velocity of $7d_{260}$ km s$^{-1}$. It is consistent with the hypothesis that the neutron star was born in the vicinity of the solar system about 0.5 Myr ago.</description>

      <title>First detection of X-ray polarization from the long-period X-ray pulsar 4U 1954+319</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of X-ray polarization with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) from the X-ray pulsar (XRP) 4U 1954+319. The source belongs to an extremely rare class of systems in which a slowly rotating neutron star accretes from the dense wind of a red supergiant companion. Coherent pulsations are detected at $P_{\rm spin}=5.49\pm0.05$ h, which is one of the longest spin periods known among XRPs. While the phase-averaged analysis shows no significant polarization, with a 99% confidence minimum detectable polarization (MDP$_{99}$) of 5.0% in the 2-8 keV band, the phase-resolved analysis shows one interval at pulse maximum in which the polarization degree (PD) exceeds its MDP$_{99}$, giving ${\rm PD}=10.3\pm3.1$%. The polarization angle (PA) exhibits a smooth $\approx140^{\circ}$ rotation over the pulse, and a joint evaluation of all phase bins yields an overall detection significance of $3.3\sigma$. Using the rotating vector model, we identify the geometric solution that reproduces the observed PA variation. By subsequently applying an event-by-event derotation of the Stokes parameters based on this solution, we remove the PA swing and recover the phase-averaged polarization which is detected at the $5.2\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>Supernovae Shock Breakout from Red Supergiants in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new two-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations of supernova shock breakout from red supergiants using the $\texttt{CASTRO}$ code. Our progenitors are 20 and 25 M$_{\odot}$ solar-metallicity stars evolved from the zero-age main sequence with $\texttt{MESA}$ and exploded in one dimension using $\texttt{FLASH}$. We consider a range of circumstellar media (CSM) produced by stellar winds to investigate how pre-explosion mass-loss affects shock breakout. The multigroup flux-limited diffusion scheme in $\texttt{CASTRO}$ captures the interaction between the explosion shock, its radiation precursor, and the surrounding CSM. We find that strong radiation precursors, generated by radiation leakage behind the shock, can drive fluid instabilities and move the effective photosphere outward before the shock reaches the stellar surface. The resulting breakout emissions reach peak luminosities of ${\sim}10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ with full-width half-maximum durations of 1-3 hr, which are much dimmer and longer than those from blue supergiants. The light-curve colors gradually evolve from blue to red after the peak. The 25 M$_{\odot}$ model with explosion energy $E \sim 1.69\times10^{51}$ erg produces ${\sim}$10-30\% higher maximum luminosity than the 20 M$_{\odot}$ model with $E \sim 1.09\times10^{51}$ erg. The dense CSM further extends the breakout rise time by increasing the photon diffusion. These results provide new constraints on red supergiant atmospheres and mass-loss histories prior to core collapse.</description>

      <title>The Head-on Collision of a Neutron Star with a White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have computed the physical processes involved in a head-on collision between a neutron star (NS) and a white dwarf (WD). The outcomes of such collisions vary depending on the mass and type of the WD. We have separately examined the dynamical processes for collisions between NSs and helium WDs (He-WDs), carbon-oxygen WDs (CO-WDs), and oxygen-neon WDs (ONe-WDs). We aim to investigate whether the collision can trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD, and if not, whether the NS can remain bound within the WD to form a Thorne-Zytkow-like object (TZlO). For a thermonuclear explosion to occur, at least two conditions must be satisfied: (i) the collision-induced temperature must reach the ignition threshold of the relevant nuclear reactions, and (ii) the burning material must remain in a degenerate state. For different types of WDs, there exist parameter ranges where both conditions are fulfilled, implying that NS-WD collisions can indeed induce thermonuclear explosions, leading to sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernovae or other exotic optical transients powered by thermonuclear explosion. On the other hand, the formation of a TZlO requires that the WD material exerts sufficient drag on the NS to prevent its escape, while the interaction must not trigger a thermonuclear explosion of the WD. Our results indicate that such conditions can be realized in the case of low-mass CO-WDs and low-mass ONe-WDs, provided that the viscous coefficient is sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of baseband data of CHIME FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are bright millisecond radio pulses. Their origin is still unknown in the field of astronomy. A notable distinction among FRBs is that some sources repeat, while others appear to be non-repeating events. Interestingly, repeating FRBs tend to exhibit broader temporal widths and narrower spectral bandwidths compared to non-repeat events, suggesting they may arise from different physical mechanisms. However, current radio telescopes have limited coverage and sensitivity, which hinders a complete survey with continuous long-term monitoring. This issue makes it difficult to confirm repeat activity and potentially leads to misclassification of repeaters as non-repeaters; these are referred to as repeater candidates. To address this, machine learning techniques have emerged as a useful tool for classifying distinct FRB types in previous studies. In this study, we utilize the CHIME/FRB baseband catalog with three orders of magnitude better time resolution than the intensity catalog. Measured fluences are available in the baseband catalog, while only upper limits are reported in the intensity catalog. We apply machine learning to the baseband catalog to evaluate classification outcomes. We identify 15 repeater candidates among 122 non-repeating FRBs in the baseband catalog. Additionally, our classification identifies 31 sources previously categorized as repeater candidates as non-repeaters, highlighting a significant difference from the prior work. Of these repeater candidates, 14 overlap with previous findings, while 1 is newly identified in this work. Notably, one of our candidates was confirmed as a repeater by CHIME/FRB. Follow-up observations for the 14 candidates are highly encouraged.</description>

      <title>Kick &amp; spin: new probes for multi-messenger black-hole mergers in AGNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recoiling remnants of black-hole mergers in dense environments can produce bright electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to the gravitational-wave (GW) emission. Significance assessments of such GW-EM candidates are restricted to time and sky-localisation consistency, omitting the physics governing the EM emission process. Different emission mechanisms, however, impose different observability constraints on the remnant black-hole recoil and spin, which are gravitational-wave observables. We present a statistical framework that includes such parameters. We assess the consistency of the GW190521-ZTF19abanrhr pair with two types of emission processes: a Blandford-Znajek jet closely aligned with the final spin axis and a diffusive isotropic flare. Assuming the sky-location of ZTF19abanrhr, we find these mechanisms to be respectively strongly and moderately disfavoured with log-evidences $\log_{10}{\cal I}_{\rm jet} = -1.65$ and $\log_{10}{\cal I}_{\rm diff} = -0.075$. Combining these with odds for a common sky-location $\Omega$ we obtain respective combined odds $\log_{10} {\cal O}_{\Omega,{\rm jet}}= -1.17$ and $\log_{10} {\cal O}_{\Omega,{\rm diff}}= +0.39$ for a true GW-EM coincidence as opposed to a random one. Our method leverages a previously unexplored evidence axis to assess GW-EM associations and constrain both the physics powering flare mechanisms and the properties of AGNs.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing flares from black hole binaries V: systematic searches in LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has now seen first light, and over a 10 year duration, LSST is projected to catalogue tens of millions of quasars, many of which are expected to be associated with sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). Out of these SMBHBs, up to thousands of relatively massive binary-quasars are expected to exhibit gravitational self-lensing flares (SLFs) that last for at least 20-30 days. We assess the effectiveness of the Lomb-Scargle (LS) periodogram and matched filters (MFs) as methods for systematic searches for these binaries, using toy-models of hydrodynamical, Doppler, and self-lensing variability from equal-mass, eccentric SMBHBs. We inject SLFs into random realizations of damped random walk (DRW) lightcurves, representing stochastic quasar variability, and compute the LS periodogram with and without the SLF. We find that periodograms of SLF+DRW light-curves do not have maximum peak heights that could not arise from DRW-only periodograms. On the other hand, the matched filter signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can distinguish SLFs from noise even with LSST-like cadences and DRW noise. Furthermore, we develop a three-step procedure with matched filters, which can also recover injected binary parameters from these light-curves. We expect this method to be computationally efficient enough to be applicable to millions of quasar light-curves in LSST.</description>

      <title>Photon Dynamics and Collision Risks in Relativistic Spaceflight: A Comparative Study of Methods and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This dissertation explores the dynamics of relativistic spaceflight, focusing on the risks associated with collisions and photon interactions as a spacecraft approaches velocities near the speed of light. The study emphasizes two primary collision types: (1) collisions with interstellar dust and particles, and (2) interactions with cosmic molecules, specifically hydrogen. Using principles of energy conservation and relativistic mechanics, the energy transfer from these collisions is calculated, showing that even small particles can impart massive energy at relativistic speeds. The dissertation also examines the impact of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, particularly its blue-shifting effect at high velocities, which influences photon interactions with the spacecraft. Additionally, the Schwinger limit, which sets an upper bound on the electromagnetic field strength for sustained relativistic travel, is discussed in the context of photon-induced pair production. Lastly, advanced photon interactions, such as Compton scattering, are analyzed for their role in thermal management and spacecraft design. The findings highlight the importance of shielding, thermal regulation, and collision avoidance strategies in the design of spacecraft for interstellar travel, offering insights into the potential challenges and solutions for achieving relativistic spaceflight.</description>

      <title>Delving into the depths of NGC 3783 with XRISM III. Birth of an ultrafast outflow during a soft flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 2024 X-ray/UV observation campaign of NGC 3783, led by XRISM, revealed the launch of an ultrafast outflow (UFO) with a radial velocity of 0.19c (57000 km/s). This event is synchronized with the sharp decay, within less than half a day, of a prominent soft X-ray/UV flare. Accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the XRISM Resolve data alone indicate a low probability of 2e-5 that this UFO detection is due to random chance. The UFO features narrow H-like and He-like Fe lines with a velocity dispersion of 1000 km/s, suggesting that it originates from a dense clump. Beyond this primary detection, there are hints of weaker outflow signatures throughout the rise and fall phases of the soft flare. Their velocities increase from 0.05c to 0.3c over approximately three days, and they may be associated with a larger stream in which the clump is embedded. The radiation pressure is insuffcient to drive the acceleration of this rapidly evolving outflow. The observed evolution of the outflow kinematics instead closely resembles that of solar coronal mass ejections, implying magnetic driving and, conceivably, reconnection near the accretion disk as the likely mechanisms behind both the UFO launch and the associated soft flare.</description>

      <title>Relativistic MHD simulations of merging and collapsing stars and effects on GRB transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact binary mergers and the collapse of massive stars can produce intense transients observable across high-energy wavelengths. Events such as gamma-ray bursts and kilonova emissions are often accompanied by gravitational wave detections, making them crucial sources for multimessenger astrophysics. To explore these phenomena theoretically, state-of-the-art approaches of General Relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations are used. We present recent findings from our simulations, and discuss observational consequences of the stellar/post-merger environment on the gamma ray burst prompt emission properties.</description>

      <title>Radiation pressure instability: from heart-beat states in black hole binary systems to Quasars and Changing-Look AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation-pressure instability was identified soon after the seminal classical accretion disk models of Shakura-Sunyaev and Novikov-Thorne, yet its full implications remain an active area of investigation. These models form the backbone of our understanding of accretion onto compact objects and successfully describe the phenomenology of black hole and neutron star X-ray binaries, as well as luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN), in the regime of high mass accretion rates. At luminosities approaching a significant fraction of the Eddington limit (L/LEdd &gt; 0.1), standard thin disks are predicted to become thermally unstable due to the dominance of radiation pressure. This prediction has found empirical support in several Galactic stellar-mass black hole systems, where the instability manifests as quasi-periodic, large-amplitude luminosity oscillations, so-called "heartbeat states", and has been proposed as a driver of observed signatures of deterministic chaos in accretion-driven light curves. The scope of radiation-pressure-induced variability extends beyond stellar-mass black holes: both black holes across mass scales and accreting neutron stars can exhibit related behavior, though the presence of a boundary layer in neutron stars adds complexity and offers a unique laboratory for testing the interplay between accretion dynamics and the central object. On extragalactic scales, the instability has been invoked to explain the duty cycles and apparent short lifetimes of radio-loud AGN, as well as the dramatic spectral-state transitions seen in Changing-Look AGN.

      <title>NICER Perspective on TeV Blazar Mrk~421: X-ray Variability and Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mrk~421 is one of the most fascinating blazars, widely studied across the electromagnetic spectrum using observations at various wavebands, from radio to the TeV gamma ray bands. We present the first detailed spectral and timing analysis of the TeV blazar Mrk~421 based on 45 X-ray observations from the \textit{NICER} X-ray telescope, collected over two years from 2022 to 2024. The source exhibits strong X-ray variability across intraday and long-term timescales. During this period, we observe a dramatic change in flux, from $\sim 50$ to $\sim 1380$~counts~s$^{-1}$, representing a $\sim 28$-fold increase. Spectral modeling with power-law, broken power-law, and log-parabolic functions shows that the log-parabola provides the most accurate description of the X-ray spectra. The hardness ratio analysis confirms a \textit{harder-when-brighter} trend, consistent with the anticorrelation between flux and both $\Gamma$ and $\alpha$. Correlation studies reveal a positive relation between $\alpha$ and $\beta$, a negative correlation between $\beta$ and synchrotron peak energy $E_{\mathrm{p}}$, and a positive correlation between $E_{\mathrm{p}}$ and flux. These observed features can be interpreted within the framework of energy-dependent particle acceleration in blazar jets, which are often associated with turbulence, strong magnetic fields, and relativistic outflows. This work demonstrates that observations from \textit{NICER} can play an important role in blazar variability studies and motivate future multiwavelength campaigns aimed at fully characterizing the dynamical processes in relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Pulsars identified in the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey at 144 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the astrometric identification of 80 known radio pulsars as unresolved continuum sources detected at 144 MHz in the second data release of the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS DR2), which covers 27% of the Northern hemisphere. These identifications represent the majority ($\geq$ 86%) of radio pulsars present in the LoTSS DR2 footprint and provide independent celestial positions and flux densities at 144 MHz. We compare LoTSS flux densities with literature values from various image and time-domain observations and find good agreement for all but two pulsars. We attribute these flux density deviations to intrinsic pulsar properties (nulling and off-pulse emission). We investigate criteria to select promising pulsar candidates using data from the upcoming LoTSS release of the entire Northern sky ($\delta&gt;0^\circ$), as well as the LOFAR LBA Sky Survey (LoLSS) at 54 MHz (covering $\delta&gt;24^\circ$). Of the 80 detections, 35 (44%) were blindly redetected based on their linear or circular polarization. Therefore we conclude that candidate selection based on polarization properties is a promising approach. Candidate selection can be supplemented with spectral indices via cross-matching to LoLSS sources at 54 MHz, as the high sensitivity of LoTSS is not matched by image-domain surveys at higher frequencies.</description>

      <title>Low-Mass Neutron Stars and Effective Phase Transitions from a Hybrid Van der Waals-Polytropic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phase-transition-like behavior in neutron stars using a simplified, piecewise equation of state that couples a modified van der Waals-type core to a polytropic crust. The model remains analytically tractable while allowing for nonlinear density dependence. We impose thermodynamic and causal consistency conditions and determine the critical densities at which the curvature of the pressure-energy density relation changes. In the non-relativistic limit, the generalized Lane-Emden equations describe a smooth core-crust transition layer. We integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations across different $(\tau_1,\sigma_1)$ regimes, where these parameters encode thermal and interaction effects in the core. The resulting mass-radius sequences yield low neutron star masses $(0.99-2.05)M_{\odot}$, and the chemical potential exhibits the characteristic signatures of phase-transition behavior at densities well above the matching point. Our results show that analytic EOS models can reproduce the key phenomenology of phase transitions and provide a controlled framework for exploring low-mass neutron star configurations.</description>

      <title>A magnetar outburst with atypical evolution: the case of Swift J1555.2-5402</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetar Swift J1555.2-5402 was discovered in outburst on 2021 June 3 by the Burst Alert Telescope on board the Swift satellite. Early X-ray follow-up revealed a spin period P~3.86 s, a period derivative Pdot~3e-11 s/s, dozens of short bursts, and an unusually flux decline. We report here on the X-ray monitoring of Swift J1555.2-5402 over the first ~29 months of its outburst with Swift, NICER, NuSTAR, INTEGRAL and Insight-HXMT, as well as radio observations with Parkes soon after the outburst onset. The observed 0.3-10 keV flux remained at levels &gt;~1e-11 erg/cm^2/s for nearly 500 days before dropping by a factor of ~10 from its June 2021 peak towards the end of the monitoring campaign. During this time span, the spectrum was dominated by a single blackbody, with temperature attaining approximately a constant value (~1.2 keV) while the inferred radius shrank from ~1.7 km to ~0.3 km (assuming a source distance of 10 kpc). The long-term spin-down rate (Pdot~3.6e-11 s/s) is only ~15 % higher than that measured in the first 30 days. No periodic or burst-like radio emission was detected, in line with what has been previously reported using different radio facilities. The persistently high temperature, shrinking hotspot, and a prolonged bright flux plateau followed by a fast dimming observed during the outburst evolution pose a challenge for the outburst mechanisms proposed so far.</description>

      <title>Optical polarimetry of the accreting black hole X-ray binary Swift J1727.8$-$1613 over the state transition and radio ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first optical ($BVR$) polarimetric observations of Swift J1727.8$-$1613 during its 2023--2024 outburst. Observations were performed during the X-ray hard-to-soft state transition, the soft state and the decaying hard state of the source. For the vast majority of nights, we detect statistically significant polarization of ${\approx}1$\%, a fraction of which is of interstellar origin. We find a significant change of polarization coinciding in time with discrete radio ejections. The direction of this polarization variation differs from the directions inferred from the X-ray, sub-mm and radio polarization angles, as well as from the resolved jet orientation. After correcting for the interstellar component, we find that the intrinsic polarization degree remained approximately constant at PD $\approx 0.3$\% throughout the hard-intermediate state. We explore several possible origins for the polarization and conclude that it is most plausibly produced by scattering within the optically thin accretion disk wind. The intrinsic polarization angle, PA $\approx-15\deg$, is notably offset from the jet axis, which we interpret as evidence for a misalignment between the black hole spin and the orbital axis.</description>

      <title>Backwards Gamma-Ray Bursts: Searching for Exploding Primordial Black Holes in Short-Duration GRB Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for signatures of terminal black-hole evaporation in short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) catalogs. An exploding primordial black hole (PBH) undergoing final-stage Hawking radiation is predicted to produce a distinctive "backwards burst"-a very short, spectrally hard transient with monotonically increasing flux and little or no longer-wavelength afterglow. We develop a forward-modeling framework that directly compares theoretical PBH evaporation light curves, computed with full Standard Model particle content and detector response folding, against empirical GRB pulse templates. Analyzing 39 well-characterized Swift sGRBs with non-detected or extremely faint afterglows, we find that all events exhibit fast-rise, slow-decay temporal profiles inconsistent with the PBH prediction. Model comparison via Akaike and Bayesian information criteria decisively favors conventional FRED or ERCA fits over the PBH template for every burst. No candidates for terminal PBH evaporation are identified. The null result yields an upper bound on the local PBH explosion rate density $R_{\mathrm{PBH}} \lesssim 10^5~\mathrm{pc}^{-3}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, comparable to constraints from dedicated TeV $\gamma$-ray searches. Our methodology establishes a robust template-matching approach that can be scaled to larger multi-instrument catalogs, providing a foundation for future searches targeting this unique signature of quantum gravity and early-Universe physics.</description>

      <title>Neutrino pair bremsstrahlung due to electromagnetic collisions in neutron star cores revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the problem of neutrino pair bremsstrahlung emission originating from the electromagnetic collisions of charged particles in nucleonic ($npe\mu$) neutron star cores. Two limiting cases are considered: (i) protons are in the normal state and (ii) protons are in the superconducting state. In both cases, the dominant contribution to the bremsstrahlung emissivity $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ comes from the transverse part of in-medium electromagnetic interactions. For non-superconducting matter, we obtain an unusual $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}\propto T^{23/3}$ temperature dependence due to the dynamical character of plasma screening in the transverse channel, but considerably smaller values of $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ than in previous studies, rendering the considered process unimportant in practice. In contrast, for superconducting and superfluid matter, the neutrino emission processes involving nucleons are suppressed and $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ due to lepton collisions provides the residual contribution to the neutrino emissivity of neutron star core matter. In the superconducting case, the plasma screening becomes static and the standard $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}\propto T^{8}$ temperature scaling is restored. Simple analytical expressions for $Q^{\mathrm{em}}_{\mathrm{Br}}$ in both limiting cases are provided.</description>

      <title>The Radius of PSR J0437-4715 from NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data have been used to estimate the masses and radii of the rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030$+$0451, PSR J0740$+$6620, PSR J0437$-$4715, PSR J1231$-$1411, and PSR J0614$-$3329, sometimes in joint analyses with X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) data. These measurements provide invaluable information about the properties of cold, catalyzed matter beyond nuclear saturation density. Here we present the results of our modeling of NICER data on PSR J0437$-$4715 using several different models of hot thermal X-ray emitting spots on the stellar surface. For this pulsar, previous Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) observations established that there is also a modulated nonthermal component to the emission, but the previously published analysis of NICER data did not model this component. We find that the Bayesian evidence is significantly higher when the modulated nonthermal component is included, and that omission of this component leads to poor fits to the bolometric NICER data and thus risks bias in the resulting radius estimates. Our models, which we pursue to inferential convergence, therefore have modulated nonthermal emission, and our headline model has in addition three uniform-temperature thermally-emitting circular spots. Using this model, the symmetric 68% credible range in the radius is 11.8 km to 15.1 km, which at the independently-measured mass of $M=1.418\pm 0.044~M_\odot$ is consistent with previous reports of the radius of the $\sim 1.4~M_\odot$ pulsar PSR J0030$+$0451. We discuss the implications of this measurement for the equation of state of dense matter.</description>

      <title>A search for successful and choked jets in nearby broad-lined Type Ic supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observational link between long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae (SNe Ic-BL) is well established. Significant progress has been made in constraining what fraction of SNe Ic-BL may power high- or low-luminosity GRBs when viewed at small off-axis angles. However, the GRB-SN connection still lacks a complete understanding in the broader context of massive-star evolution and explosion physics. Models predict a continuum of outcomes for the fastest ejecta, from choked to ultra-relativistic jets, and observations from radio to X-rays are key to probing these scenarios across a range of viewing angles and velocities. Here, we present results from a coordinated radio-to-X-ray campaign targeting nearby (z&lt;=0.1) SNe Ic-BL designed to explore this diversity. With eight new radio-monitored events and updated data for one previously observed SN, we further tighten constraints on the fraction of SNe Ic-BL as relativistic as SN 1998bw/GRB 980425. We identify SN 2024rjw as a new radio-loud event likely powered by strong interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), and add evidence supporting a similar interpretation for SN 2020jqm. We also establish new limits on the properties of radio-emitting ejecta with velocities consistent with cocoons from choked jets, highlighting SN 2022xxf as a promising cocoon-dominated candidate. These results refine our understanding of the continuum linking ordinary SNe Ic-BL, engine-driven explosions, and GRBs, and contribute to building a sample that will inform future multi-messenger searches for electromagnetic counterparts to high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Self-lensing of moving gravitational-wave sources can break the microlensing crossing timescale degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a moving gravitational-wave (GW) source travels behind a massive astrophysical object, its signal is gravitationally lensed, showing a waveform distortion similar to a Paczy\'{n}ski curve. We present a first study of the lensing signature of a massive black hole (MBH) on a frequency-dependent GW signal from a moving binary merger. For both light and GW sources in a Keplerian circular orbit around a MBH lens, the self-lensing geometry breaks the microlensing degeneracy in the Einstein radius crossing timescale $t_{\rm E}$. The duration of the curve ($2 t_{\rm E}$) becomes independent on the MBH mass $M_{\rm MBH}$, and provides a direct measure of the distance $d_{\rm LS}$ to the MBH. However, $M_{\rm MBH}$ remains unknown. We show that, in GW signals, the redshifted mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ can additionally be obtained from the interference pattern, by measuring the modulation period $T$, the GW frequency $f$, and $t_{\rm E}$: $M_{{\rm MBH},z}\simeq 2.5\times 10^6\,M_\odot\,(t_{\rm E}/[100\,{\rm s}])\,(f\,T)^{-1}$. If this lensing signature is not considered, it may be confused with other waveform distortions, especially in the modeling of overlapping signals in next generation ground-based GW detectors. The observation of one of these curves and its associated parameters may help (1) constrain the orbital distance $d_{\rm LS}$ of sources, especially around low mass MBHs at the centers of star clusters and galaxies, (2) additionally estimate the mass $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ of these MBHs, and (3) infer the orbital inclination of the binary. Simultaneously obtaining $d_{\rm LS}$ and $M_{{\rm MBH},z}$ through self-lensing can help constrain the astrophysical environments where GW signals come from.</description>

      <title>Resolving the (Debate About) Nozzle Shocks in Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a star passes within the Roche limit of a supermassive black hole (SMBH), it is pulled apart by the BH's tidal field in a tidal disruption event (TDE). The resulting flare is powered by the circularization and accretion of bound stellar debris, which initially returns to the BH on eccentric orbits in a thin debris stream. The returning fluid elements follow inclined orbits that converge near pericenter, resulting in extreme vertical compression to scales $10^{-4}~R_\odot$ and the formation of a nozzle shock. Dissipation at the nozzle shock may affect circularization by altering the properties of the debris stream, but its role is the subject of ongoing debate. We develop an idealized model for the debris stream evolution combining 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, the semi-analytic affine model, and 1D finite-volume hydrodynamic simulations. Because our model is computationally cheap, we can unambiguously resolve the nozzle shock, use a realistic equation of state, and follow the debris stream evolution at many different times. Near peak fallback, Hydrogen recombination and molecular Hydrogen formation broaden the stream by a factor $\sim 5$, enhancing dissipation at the nozzle. However, the dissipation is still insufficient to directly circularize the debris by in-plane pressure gradients. Instead, the thicker stream substantially increases the likelihood that the stream self-intersects on the second orbit, despite relativistic nodal precession. The stream properties at self-intersection are sensitive to dissipation at the nozzle and the timing of focal points where the ballistic trajectories of the debris converge. Our results clarify the nozzle shock's role in circularization in TDEs, providing a foundation for more realistic circularization and emission models.</description>

      <title>Core-halo scaling relations in self-interacting scalar field dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of self-interactions on the structure and evolution of scalar field dark matter (SFDM) halos. Using three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson simulations of multiple soliton mergers, we explore both repulsive and attractive regimes across a wide range of scattering lengths. Our results show that repulsive self-interactions lead to more massive and extended cores with lower central densities compared to the free (non-interacting) fuzzy dark matter case, while attractive interactions enhance central densities and can drive cores toward collapse, once a critical mass is exceeded. We confirm that the mass-radius relation of solitonic cores is well described by analytical predictions, even in the presence of self-interactions, and we extend the core-halo mass relation to scenarios beyond fuzzy dark matter. We find that the scaling relations between core mass, size, and total energy are not universal but depend sensitively on the strength and sign of the self-interaction, as well as on the evolutionary stage of the halo. These results demonstrate that self-interactions provide a natural mechanism to regulate core properties, with important implications for the formation of supermassive black holes and for potential astrophysical signatures in galactic cores.</description>

      <title>Impact on orbital period of X-ray Binary system attached to a cosmic string</title>

Abstract: Cosmic strings attached to rotating black holes extract its rotational energy, resulting in a mass loss and reduced spin. In this paper we discuss the proposed methods to detect these phenomena and present a novel methodology based on existing literature, by considering a Low Mass X-ray binary system. We investigate the impact of a cosmic string interacting with a black hole in an X-ray binary system and attempt to explain the observations of unexpected orbital period changes in such systems by proposing mass loss by cosmic strings to be a potential cause. For a period change of order $10^{-10}$, the string tension is $\sim 10^{-17}$, lying in the predicted range for cosmic string tension. An analysis of multiple low mass X-ray binary systems is carried out and it is shown that a significant and observable change occurs for a string tension $\sim 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>Evidence for evolving Dark Energy from a new cosmic probe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmological model provides a remarkably successful description of the formation and evolution of structure in the Universe. However, a growing discrepancy between measurements of the expansion rate $H_0$ from the near and distant Universe now appears to be significant at the ~4-7 $\sigma$ level. This inconsistency, known as the ``Hubble tension'', has arisen either due to unrecognized systematics in these measurements or new physics beyond the standard model, such as an evolving dark energy equation of state. Modeling ~20-year, multi-band optical light curves for 6992 active galactic nuclei (AGN), we find a tight relation linking the variability amplitude and characteristic timescale to their intrinsic luminosity. This empirical law enables us to construct an AGN-based Hubble diagram to z ~3.5. Joint inference with supernova distances reveals evidence for an evolving dark energy equation of state at the 3.8-3.9 $\sigma$ level over constant w models and 4.4-4.8 $\sigma$ over $\Lambda$CDM. Our results establish AGN light curves as a powerful tool for cosmography that could offer a novel pathway to test deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM expansion history.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Dark Matter Subhalo Constraints from Stellar Streams using Implicit Likelihood Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evidence for dark matter (DM) remains compelling, although attempts to understand its particle nature remain inconclusive. One promising method to study DM is detecting DM subhalos through their gravitational interactions with stellar streams. In this study, we apply Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE) to constrain subhalo interaction parameters, including mass, scale radius, velocity, and encounter geometry, from stellar stream kinematics. We generate particle spray simulations based on the Lagrange Cloud stripping technique, focusing on the ATLAS-Aliqa Uma stream as a test case. We train multiple NPE models across multiple observational scenarios, quantifying how kinematic completeness affects inference and forecasting constraints from upcoming surveys including LSST, 4MOST, and 10-year Gaia data. Our results demonstrate that NPE can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors. In the idealized case with full 6D coordinates, we achieve subhalo mass uncertainties of 15-20% for a $10^7 \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ subhalo, with 5D coordinates (excluding radial velocities) achieving similar performance. Under realistic observational conditions, mass uncertainties range from 50% (present-day) to 20-40% (future scenarios), with comparable performance between the photometric-only LSST sample and a smaller sample that includes Gaia proper motions and 4MOST radial velocities. Most notably, we find that velocity bimodality emerges when phase space is poorly sampled, whether due to missing kinematic information or limited stellar tracers. Combining large photometric samples with targeted spectroscopic follow-up can effectively resolves this degeneracy. These results demonstrate the power of implicit likelihood inference for optimizing stellar stream observational strategies and forecasting DM subhalo constraints from upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Rapidly Spinning Massive Pulsars as an Indicator of Quark Deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rotating hybrid stars, with particular emphasis on the effect of spin on the deconfinement phase transition and star properties. Our analysis is based on a hybrid equation of state with a phase transition from hadronic matter containing hyperons to color-superconducting quark matter, where the quark phase is modeled within a relativistic density functional approach. By varying the strength of the vector repulsion and diquark pairing couplings in the microscopic quark Lagrangian, we construct a set of hybrid star sequences with different quark-matter onset densities. This framework ensures consistency with astrophysical and gravitational wave constraints on mass, radius, and tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>High-overtone ringdown fits: start time, no-hair tests, and correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overtones are known to improve the performance of fits to the ringdown, both in numerical-relativity simulations and gravitational-wave observations. Although the overtone frequencies are a concrete prediction of general relativity, it remains an open question whether they are excited to the extent that fits would suggest. In this work, we take a pragmatic approach and investigate the practical utility of each additional overtone in extracting information from the ringdown. We look at the dependence of the ringdown start time on the number of overtones, and the feasibility of detecting deviations from general relativity in the ringdown frequencies. We suggest that there is no clear "maximum" overtone, but rather the utility of each additional overtone decreases compared to the one before. Finally, we perform Bayesian parameter estimation (as opposed to least-squares fits) to obtain posterior distributions on the overtone amplitudes and phases, allowing us to investigate their correlation structure. Due to strong correlations it becomes increasingly hard to measure individual amplitudes and phases for the highest overtones. However, we find that the joint measurement of overtone amplitudes (i.e., the correlation structure itself) is sensitive to the frequencies and decay times of even the highest overtones, possibly offering an avenue to perform consistency tests with general relativity.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Strings via Black Hole Quasinormal Modes in Gravitational Wave Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes, the simplest solution to Einstein's field equations, do not emit light, making their observations a major challenge for researchers. However, discovery of binary black holes (BBHs) in 2015 by LIGO has transformed the study of compact objects, with over 300 BBHs recorded, providing a new avenue for probing new physics. GWs remain a prominent and precise method of observing not only BBHs, but also dark matter and cosmic strings. Cosmic strings -- hypothetical one dimensional topological defects formed in the early universe, are yet to be observed, with multiple detection methods such as particle radiation, gravitational waves and lensing being proposed. Here we present a novel framework to search for cosmic strings by modeling them as perturbations within non-rotating black hole spacetime, focusing on their imprint on the spectrum of quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our numerical simulations identify a lower limit on perturbation strength, $\lambda \sim 10^{-10}$ for uncharged string and $\lambda \sim 10^{-7}$ for charged string, below which cosmic string effects become unobservable in QNM signals. By analyzing eigenvalue splitting and centers, we show that cosmic string properties impart distinct and detectable features to GW signals. Our results establish QNM analysis as a powerful, alternative observational strategy for constraining or detecting cosmic strings, and offer an inverse approach to estimate string energy or charge if a signal is detected. With upgrades in LIGO technologies and advanced multimessenger astronomy under development, these findings highlight new potential for detecting cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Careless Whispers: A population of sub-threshold post-merger gravitational waves constrains the hot nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to coherently combine information from a population of sub-threshold, gravitational-wave binary neutron star post-merger remnants. Although no individual event in our synthetic population can be claimed as a confident detection, we show how to statistically determine the fraction of merger events that promptly collapse to form a black hole, compared to those for which a neutron star survives the merger for at least tens of milliseconds. This fraction, when combined with information about the neutron star mass distribution gleaned from the inspiral portion of the signals, provides an indirect measure of the neutron star maximum mass. Using conservative measures of the post-merger waveforms, we show that 50-70 events with binary neutron star inspiral measurements can be combined to give an $11-20\%$ fractional uncertainty on the maximum mass of rapidly rotating, hot neutron stars, which can potentially be turned into a $12-21\%$ fractional constraint on the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. We discuss how this measure of the hot nuclear equation of state can be combined with information of cold neutron stars to see the effect of temperature on physics in the densest regions of the Universe.</description>

      <title>On the existence of bound states in SIMP dark sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In strongly interacting massive particle (SIMP) scenarios, dark matter is comprised of stable dark pions whose $3\to 2$ or $4\to 2$ reactions set the dark matter relic abundance. Recent work has shown that shallow two-pion bound states significantly affect the freeze-out, but did not establish whether such states actually form. In this work we demonstrate that a scalar isosinglet bound state does exist in a well-defined region of parameter space by solving an on-shell Lippmann--Schwinger equation in a chiral-unitary framework and analyzing the $S$-wave $\pi\pi$ amplitude in the complex energy plane. We determine the range of $m_\pi/f_\pi$ for which a pole appears below the two-pion threshold, extract the corresponding residue, and, in the non-relativistic limit, obtain the bound-state wave function at the origin, $|\Psi(0)|$, which controls bound-state-assisted annihilation and decay rates relevant for catalyzed freeze-out. Comparing this T-matrix based result with variational estimates using simple finite-range potentials, we find agreement within order-one factors for shallow binding. For binding energies of order the freeze-out temperature, $E_B \sim m_\pi/20$, we obtain $|\Psi(0)|\sim \mathcal{O}(0.1)\,m_\pi^{3/2}$, thereby supporting the parametric assumptions used in previous phenomenological analyses.</description>

      <title>Superluminal constraints from ultra-high-energy neutrino events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\sim 100\,$PeV neutrino detected by KM3NeT marks the beginning of ultra-high-energy neutrino astronomy and provides a powerful probe of Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV). In superluminal scenarios, neutrinos can decay through vacuum $e^-e^+$ pair emission or neutrino splitting. Previous analyses of the KM3-230213A event relied on simplified survival-probability estimates and, in some cases, used inaccurate decay-width expressions or neglected redshift and threshold effects. In this work we present a unified and self-consistent framework that corrects these issues and applies to both the energy-independent ($n=0$) and quadratic ($n=2$) superluminal cases. We collect and recast the decay-width and threshold expressions, clarify their flavor dependence, and include a consistent treatment of cosmological propagation. We also assess the impact of cascade regeneration and show that cascade effects are negligible for the purpose of setting LIV bounds. The survival-probability approximation adopted in previous works is therefore justified, while our framework provides a coherent basis for future analyses of superluminal neutrino constraints, which should consistently include possible time-delay signatures.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Approach Study of Hybrid Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore how astronomical observations (specifically measurements of masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities) can constrain the presence of quark matter inside neutron stars, namely the phase transition from nuclear matter to deconfined quark matter. Our approach employs Bayesian analysis to study this phenomenon. Hadronic matter is modeled using the relativistic mean-field (RMF) approximation, for which we have selected two parameter sets: \(NL3^{*}\omega\rho\), representing hadronic matter with nucleons only, and $EL3\omega\rho$ with nucleons only and $EL3\omega\rho Y$, which includes hyperons. On the other hand deconfined quark matter is modeled using the vector-MIT bag model. For our purpose, the phase transition is implemented using the Maxwell construction. Bayesian inference is performed by tuning three parameters: the bag constant (i.e. $B^{1/4}$), the vector coupling constant \(\left(G_{v}\right)\), and the Dirac sea contribution ($b_{4}$). We found that a phase transition could exist at densities below \(2.0\,n_{0}\) for both the $EL3\omega\rho - EL3\omega\rho Y $ and $NL3^{*}\omega\rho$ parametrizations. As a consequence, our results also indicate that a hybrid neutron star could have a large quark core that comprises more than \(80\%\) of its size.</description>

Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects powers fast outflows in ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). Such outflows, which can reach mildly relativistic velocities, are often observed forming bubble structures. Wind bubbles are expected to develop strong wind termination shocks, which are sites of great interest for diffusive shock acceleration. We developed a model of diffusive shock acceleration in the wind bubbles powered by ULXs. We find that the maximum energy in these objects can easily reach the PeV range, promoting winds from ULXs as a new class of PeVatrons. We specialized our model in the context of the Galactic source SS433 and show that high-energy protons in the bubble might explain the highest energy photons (&gt;100 TeV) and their morphology recently observed by LHAASO. In this paper, we discuss the detectability of such a source in neutrinos, and we analyze the possible radio counterpart of ULXs focusing on the case of W50, the nebula surrounding SS433. Finally, we discuss the possible contribution of Galactic ULXs to the cosmic-ray flux at the knee, concluding that their role could be significant only if one of these sources, currently undetected, were sufficiently close.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If sub-GeV Dark matter(DM) annihilates to the charged particles such as $e^+ e^-$, $\mu^+ \mu^-$, or $\pi^+ \pi^-$, it generates an additional source of electrons and positrons in the cosmic ray (CR) population within our Milky Way. During propagation, these secondary electrons and positrons undergo reacceleration processes, boosting their energies to the GeV scale. Observatories like AMS-02 can detect these high-energy particles, enabling constraints on the properties of sub-GeV DM. By analyzing AMS-02 electron and positron data, the 95\% upper limits on the DM annihilation cross-section have been established in the range of $10^{-28}$ to $10^{-27}$ cm$^3\,$s$^{-1}$, corresponding to DM masses ranging from 100 MeV to 1 GeV. Meanwhile, MeV telescopes will provide complementary constraints on DM properties by detecting photon emissions from such annihilation processes. Notably, the sensitivity of future MeV gamma-ray observatories is projected to approach or match the constraints derived from CR data.</description>

Abstract: We present a study on the detection and characterization of transient quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the $\gamma$-ray emission of blazars 4C +31.03, MG1 J123931+0443, and PKS 1622$-$253. Using light curves derived from \textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope data, we investigate oscillatory patterns characterized by periodic multiplicative amplitudes that vary linearly over time. By segmenting the light curves into increasing and decreasing trends, we analyze each segment independently, allowing for precise measurements of both the periodicity and long-term variations. To interpret these QPOs, we explore various theoretical scenarios that could explain their origin and underlying physical mechanisms. The variability observed in 4C~+31.03 is more consistent with a stochastic process, whereas the periods estimated for MG1~J123931+0443 and PKS~1622$-$253 align with the precessional dynamics expected from binary supermassive black hole systems. However, the current results remain tentative and do not allow for a definitive conclusion.</description>

      <title>Assessing Universal Relations for Rapidly Rotating Neutron Stars: Insights from an Interpretable Deep Learning Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relations between stellar properties independent of the nuclear equation of state offer profound insights into neutron star physics and have practical applications in data analysis. Commonly, these relations are derived from utilizing various realistic nuclear cold hadronic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models, each of which should obey the current constraints and cover a wide range of stiffnesses. Concurrently, the field of multimessenger astronomy has been significantly enhanced by the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, which increasingly incorporates deep learning techniques and algorithms. At the same time, X-ray spectral data from NICER based on known pulsars are available, and additional observations are expected from upcoming missions. In this study, we revisit established universal relations, introduce new ones, and reassess them using a feed-forward neural network as a regression model. More specifically, we mainly propose ``deep'' EoS-insensitive hypersurface relations for rapidly rotating compact objects between several of the star's global parameters, which achieve an accuracy of within $1\%$ in most cases, with only a small fraction of investigated models exceeding this threshold. While analytical expressions can be used to represent some of these relations, the neural network approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly in complex regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to interpret the suggested network's predictions, since is based on a strong theoretical framework inspired by the field of cooperative Game Theory. Most importantly, these highly accurate universal relations empowered with the interpretability description could be used in efforts to constrain the high-density equation of state in neutron stars, with the potential to enhance our understanding as new observables emerge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A review of several analyses is presented that forces the conclusion that the mass composition of the highest-energy cosmic rays is not proton-dominated. This deduction, combined with the use of a modern hadronic interaction model, should lead to a re-evaluation of the energy spectrum reported by the Telescope Collaboration that may well bring that measurement, and the corresponding one from the Pierre Auger Observatory, into better agreement.</description>

      <title>Hot, cold, and multi-component accretion flows around supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model for supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) accreting below their Eddington limit, focusing on systems where hot, advection-dominated flows become viable. We specifically explore the spectral appearance of multi-component accretion flows where the solution can independently transition between cold, thin disks and hot, advection-dominated torii depending on the local accretion rate. Using a three-disk model, we compute spectral energy distributions for four possible accretion configurations and assess their observational signatures, including which frequencies might reflect variability at the binary orbital period. The spectral modeling reveals that binary accretion can self-consistently account for many of the properties of standard AGN, while the variability analysis shows that hydrodynamic modulation at the binary period is most likely in the thermal emission and low-frequency synchrotron components. Doppler boosting of emitting material bound to a single binary component would also induce periodic variability. We apply our model to the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and demonstrate that a mixed-component accretion state (plus a jet feature) can self-consistently capture the observed broadband spectrum. Our model offers a framework for interpreting candidate SMBHBs and motivates future multi-wavelength follow-up of potential multi-messenger sources, as well as more detailed future modeling of multi-component binary accretion.</description>

      <title>Inferring Mbh-Mbulge Evolution from the Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We test the impact of an evolving supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass scaling relation (Mbh-Mbulge) on the predictions for the gravitational wave background (GWB). The observed GWB amplitude is 2-3 times higher than predicted by astrophysically informed models which suggests the need to revise the assumptions in those models. We compare a semi-analytic model's ability to reproduce the observed GWB spectrum with a static versus evolving-amplitude Mbh-Mbulge relation. We additionally consider the influence of the choice of galaxy stellar mass function on the modeled GWB spectra. Our models are able to reproduce the GWB amplitude with either a large number density of massive galaxies or a positively evolving Mbh-Mbulge amplitude (i.e., the Mbh / Mbulge ratio was higher in the past). If we assume that the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude does not evolve, our models require a galaxy stellar mass function that implies an undetected population of massive galaxies (Mstellar &gt; 10^11 Msun at z &gt; 1). When the Mbh-Mbulge amplitude is allowed to evolve, we can model the GWB spectrum with all fiducial values and an Mbh-Mbulge amplitude that evolves as alpha(z) = alpha_0 (1 + z)^(1.04 +/- 0.5).</description>

      <title>Disentangling Multiple Gas Kinematic Drivers in the Perseus Galaxy Cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters, the Universe's largest halo structures, are filled with 10-100 million degree X-ray-emitting gas. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematic properties remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of gas thermodynamics and energy conversion within clusters. High-resolution spectral mapping across a broad spatial-scale range provides a promising solution to this challenge, enabled by the recent launch of the XRISM X-ray Observatory. Here, we present the kinematic measurements of the X-ray-brightest Perseus cluster with XRISM, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for the presence of at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner ~60 kpc, likely associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. The inner driver sustains a heating rate at least an order of magnitude higher than the outer one. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, the SMBH feedback generates turbulence, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could play a significant role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources for robust conclusions on the properties of the velocity field and their role in the assembly and evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for theoretical models of SMBH feedback.</description>

      <title>Hunting Very High-Energy ($&gt;$100 GeV) Emitting High-Synchrotron Peaked Blazars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06017v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very-high energy (VHE; $&gt;$100 GeV) $\gamma$-ray emission originates via some of the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the universe. Considering beamed active galactic nuclei, i.e., blazars, only a small fraction, mainly high synchrotron peak BL Lacs, have been detected in the VHE band with the ground-based Cherenkov telescopes. We utilized $\sim$16 years of Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations in the 0.1$-$2 TeV energy range to systematically search for potential VHE emitters in a sample of high synchrotron peaked ($\nu^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}&gt;10^{15}$ Hz) BL Lac sources. We identified, for the first time, 92 VHE emitting blazars at $\geq 5\sigma$ confidence level. A significant VHE emission was also detected from 52 sources previously reported as VHE blazars.
  Comparing with the general blazar population, these VHE emitting blazars are found to be located at low redshifts (mean $z=0.2 \pm 0.1$) and exhibit bright synchrotron emission ($\log F^{\rm peak}_{\rm syn}=-11.2 \pm 0.4$, in erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$). We also investigated the coincidence of VHE photon arrivals with the source activity states and found that Fermi-LAT has detected VHE photons during both quiescent and elevated activity epochs. These VHE emitting blazars represent promising targets for current and next-generation ground-based Cherenkov telescopes, and provide powerful laboratories for probing particle acceleration in relativistic jets, testing multi-messenger connections, and constraining extragalactic background light models.</description>

      <title>Exploring the connection between compact object mergers and fast X-ray transients: The cases of LXT 240402A and EP250207b</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13015v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between compact object mergers and some extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) has long been hypothesized, but never ultimately established. In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient LXT 240402A and the Einstein Probe EP250207b, whose precise positions lie close to nearby ($z\!\lesssim\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\!\gtrsim\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.</description>

      <title>Relativistic reflection within an extended hot plasma geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The reflection of X-rays at the inner accretion disk around black holes imprints relativistically broadened features in the observed spectrum. Aside from the black hole properties and the ionization and density of the accretion disk, these features also depend on the location and geometry of the primary source of X-rays, often referred to as the corona. We present a fast general relativistic model for spectral fitting of a radially extended, ring-like corona above the accretion disk. A common approach used to explain observed X-ray reflection spectra is the lamp post geometry, which assumes a point-like source on the rotational axis of the black hole. While it is typically able to explain the observations, this geometric model does not allow for any constraint to be placed on the radial size of the corona. We therefore extended the publicly available relativistic reflection model relxill by implementing a radially extended, ring-like primary source. With the new RELXILL model allowing us to vary the position of the primary source in two dimensions, we present simulated line profiles and spectra and discuss the implications of carrying out a data fitting, in comparison to the lamp post model. We applied this extended RELXILL model to XMM-Newton and NuSTAR data of the radio-quiet Seyfert-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) ESO 033-G002. The new model describes the data well and we are able to constrain the distance of the source to the black hole to be less than three gravitational radii, while the angular position of the source is poorly constrained. We show that a compact, radially extended corona close to the innermost stable circular orbit is able to explain the observed relativistic reflection as well as the lamp post corona does. This model has been made freely available to the community.</description>

      <title>Sco X-1 as a continuous gravitational waves source: modelling the secular evolution using MESA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from Sco X-1 and evaluate the most likely waveform and progenitor parameters. We model the spin of the neutron star by the accretion torque and the gravitational-wave torque, considering two mechanisms for generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the latter: magnetic mountains and crustal breakage deformation. Both torques are intertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the NS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA, starting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a magnetic ellipticity of $\varepsilon\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for detection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases with the accretion efficiency $\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G (Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs, with ellipticities as small as $6\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the waveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of detectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on $\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\eta\leq$30%, the crust does not break. For $\eta\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with $M^d\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\eta\geq$70% all crusts break. In some systems, the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase. If Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW signal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies in $\approx 150000[\varepsilon /10^{-5}]^{-2/5}$ years. We estimate the current detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability increases substantially - to around 41% - with 3G detectors.</description>

      <title>Is The Trace Anomaly at its Minimum Value at Neutron Star Centers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the equation of state (EOS) $P(\varepsilon)$ of neutron star (NS) matter has been extensively studied, the EOS-parameter $\phi = P/\varepsilon$ or equivalently the dimensionless trace anomaly $\Delta = 1/3 - \phi$, which quantifies the balance between pressure $P$ and energy density $\varepsilon$, remains far less explored, especially in NS cores. Its bounds and density profile carry crucial information about the nature of superdense matter. Physically, the EOS-parameter $\phi$ represents the mean stiffness of matter accumulated from the stellar surface up to a given density. Based on the intrinsic structure of the Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations, we show that $\phi$ decreases monotonically outward from the NS center, independent of any specific input NS EOS model. Furthermore, observational evidence of a peak in the speed-of-sound squared (SSS) density-profile near the center effectively rules out a valley and a subsequent peak in the radial profile of $\phi$ at similar densities, reinforcing its monotonic decrease. These model-independent relations impose strong constraints on the near-center behavior of the EOS-parameter $\phi$, particularly demonstrating that the mean stiffness (or equivalently $\Delta$) reaches a local maximum (minimum) at the center.</description>

      <title>Accretion Geometry of the New Galactic Black Hole Candidate AT2019wey in the Hard State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform broadband spectral and timing studies of the Galactic low-mass black hole candidate AT2019wey using quasi-simultaneous NICER, Swift, and NuSTAR observations obtained in 2022. The long-term MAXI light curve, along with the hardness-intensity diagram (HID), indicates that the source remained in the hard state and did not switch to the soft state. Spectral modeling using two different model combinations reveals that the broadband spectrum is best described by two distinct Comptonizing regions, associated reflection components, and thermal emission from the disk. The harder Comptonizing region dominates ($\gtrsim80\%$) the total flux and is primarily responsible for the observed reflection features from the distant part of the disk. We find that the accretion disk is truncated at a radius of $\sim16-56~r_{\rm{g}}$, while the luminosity is $\sim1.9\%$ of the Eddington limit, assuming a black hole mass of $10 ~ M_\odot$ and distance of 8 kpc. Our spectral results also show consistency in the estimated inner disk radius obtained through two independent methods: modeling the disk continuum and the reflection spectrum. The variability studies imply the presence of intrinsic disk variability, likely originating from an instability in the disk. We also detect hard time lags at low frequencies, possibly arising from the inward propagation of mass accretion rate fluctuations from the outer to the inner regions of the accretion disk. Moreover, an observed deviation of the lag-energy spectrum from the log-linear trend at $\lesssim 0.7$ keV is most likely attributed to thermal reverberation, arising from the reprocessing of hard coronal photons in the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength Afterglows as Diagnostic Probes of Dense Circumburst Medium in GRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07719</link>

Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are generally believed to occur in environments where the surrounding medium is either a uniform interstellar medium (ISM) or, in some cases, a dense stellar wind from a massive progenitor. Recently, GRB 191019A has been proposed to originate within the accretion disk of an active galactic nucleus (AGN), suggesting that some GRBs may occur in extremely dense environments, although this interpretation remains under debate. This scenario has drawn considerable attention, as AGN disks are promising sites that can host progenitors of both long and short GRBs, and whose dense, gas-rich environment could significantly influence jet propagation and afterglow emission. Yet, our theoretical understanding of the resulting afterglow signatures in such environments is limited, and further systematic exploration is required. In this study, we investigate how multi-wavelength afterglow light curves can be utilized as diagnostic tools to probe the nature of the circumburst environment. Our results show that in dense environments, GRB afterglows exhibit distinct frequency-dependent behaviors. For jets with large opening angles, the X-ray light curve displays a shallow decay or bump due to a transition from synchrotron to SSC dominance, while the optical and high-energy (GeV) light curves follow typical power-law decays. On the other hand, for small opening angles, the light curves exhibit wavelength-dependent jet breaks: the GeV and optical bands break simultaneously, while the X-ray break is delayed as the SSC component gradually compensates for the fading synchrotron component. These signatures provide potential diagnostics of GRBs occurring in dense media such as AGN disks.</description>

      <title>Neural Surrogate HMC: On Using Neural Likelihoods for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in Simulation-Based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference methods such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) typically require repeated computations of the likelihood function, but in some scenarios this is infeasible and alternative methods are needed. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods address this problem by using machine learning to amortize computations. In this work, we highlight a particular synergy between the SBI method of neural likelihood estimation and the classic MCMC method of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We show that approximating the likelihood function with a neural network model can provide three distinct advantages: (1) amortizing the computations for MCMC; (2) providing gradients for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and (3) smoothing over noisy simulations resulting from numerical instabilities. We provide practical guidelines for defining a prior, sampling a training set, and evaluating convergence. The method is demonstrated in an application modeling the heliospheric transport of galactic cosmic rays, where it enables efficient inference of latent parameters in the Parker equation.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Supersymmetric Dark Matter for the origin of KM3NeT Ultra-High Energy signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an explanation for the recently reported ultra-high-energy neutrino signal at KM3NeT, which shows no clear association with known astrophysical sources. While decaying dark matter in the Galactic Center is a natural candidate, the observed arrival direction strongly suggests an extragalactic origin. We introduce a multicomponent dark matter scenario in which the components are part of a supermultiplet, with supersymmetry ensuring a nearly degenerate mass spectrum among the fields with different spins. In this setup, a cosmologically long-lived fermionic state decays into a slightly lighter bosonic dark matter state, producing a boosted neutrino spectrum with energy $E_\nu \sim 100$ PeV, determined by the mass difference. The heavy-to-light decay occurs at a cosmological redshift of $z \sim \text{a few}$ or higher, leading to an isotropic directional distribution of the signal.</description>

      <title>Comparing a Compact-Binary Mass-Shell Model with Select Observed Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, coalescing compact binaries (CCBs) were modeled as a rotating and contracting compact mass shell, providing an alternative effective representation to the state-of-the-art effective-one-body approach. Using a variational methodology, the Laplace-Beltrami formulation of the Ricci tensor was applied to a Kerr metric Ansatz, and the corresponding energy density $T_{00}$ of the CCB mass shell was obtained via the Einstein field equations. At the time of coalescence $t_C$, the resulting surface energy depends on the reduced mass $\mu$, the symmetric mass ratio $\alpha$, and the normalized orbital spin velocity of the CCB. In this work, we evaluate the radiated energy predicted by this variational approach for 45 select gravitational wave (GW) events from the O1--O4 runs, and compare these values with those inferred from observational catalogs, either directly or via the total-minus-remnant mass difference. For 38 of the 45 events analyzed, the predicted radiated energies agree with observationally inferred values within the reported uncertainties, with 1:1 ratios spanning from $0.828$ to $0.997$ (mean $0.942$, median $0.955$). Three events exhibit ratios in the range $0.721\sim0.779$, one event yields a ratio of $0.466$, and for the remaining events the radiated energy is either unconstrained or inaccessible due to undocumented total-minus-remnant mass differences. These results indicate that the analytical approximation captures, for the most part, the leading-order energy scaling of compact binary mergers, while also suggesting clear avenues for further systematic improvement, including incorporating post-Newtonian corrections due to e.g. a non-zero eccentricity or combined tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>Enhanced radio emission between a galaxy cluster pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting pairs of galaxy clusters offer a unique opportunity to study the properties of the gas residing in the intracluster bridge connecting them. As a consequence of the encounter, both the X-ray and radio emission from the gas are expected to be enhanced by shocks and turbulence, facilitating their detection. PSZ2 G279.79+39.09 is likely an off-axis merging system at $z = 0.29$ with its two main cluster components observed at a projected distance of $\sim$1.3 Mpc. In this paper, we investigate the presence of diffuse radio emission associated with the system. We observed this cluster pair with the MeerKAT UHF band (544-1088 MHz) for 7.5 h and with the uGMRT band 3 (300-500 MHz) for 8 h. These are the first targeted radio observations of this system. We discover diffuse synchrotron emission in the system, with indication of enhanced emission in the region bridging the cluster pair. The detection is based on the MeerKAT UHF data, while the uGMRT band 3 observation does not allow us to derive a stringent limit on the spectral index of the source. This emission is likely generated by the turbulence injected as a consequence of the cluster-cluster encounter. However, the study of its physical properties is limited by the observations currently available on the target. If the two clusters have not yet collided, this emission would resemble the radio bridges observed in A399-A401 and A1758N-S. As other systems with multiple cluster components studied in recent years, the analyzed cluster pair represents an appealing target to investigate the presence of nonthermal phenomena beyond the well-studied denser regions of the intracluster medium. While in this work we presented a new detection, our analysis underlines the need for multi-band observations to fully understand these kinds of sources.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from stars in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos are produced during stellar evolution by means of thermal and thermonuclear processes. We model the cumulative neutrino flux expected at Earth from all stars in the Milky Way: the Galactic stellar neutrino flux (GS$\nu$F). We account for the star formation history of our Galaxy and reconstruct the spatial distribution of Galactic stars by means of a random sampling procedure based on Gaia Data Release 2. We use the stellar evolution code $\texttt{MESA}$ to compute the neutrino emission for a suite of stellar models with solar metallicity and zero-age-main-sequence mass between $0.08M_\odot$ and $100\ M_\odot$, from their pre-main sequence phase to their final fates. We then reconstruct the evolution of the neutrino spectral energy distribution for each stellar model in our suite. The GS$\nu$F lies between $\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV and $\mathcal{O}(10)$ MeV, with thermal (thermonuclear) processes responsible for shaping neutrino emission at energies smaller (larger) than $0.1$ MeV. Stars with mass larger than $\mathcal{O}(1\ M_\odot)$, located in the thin disk of the Galaxy, provide the largest contribution to the GS$\nu$F. Moreover, most of the GS$\nu$F originates from stars distant from Earth about $5-10$ kpc, implying that a large fraction of stellar neutrinos can reach us from the Galactic Center. Solar neutrinos and the diffuse supernova neutrino background have energies comparable to those of the GS$\nu$F, challenging the detection of the latter. However, directional information of solar neutrino and GS$\nu$F events, together with the annual modulation of the solar neutrino flux, could facilitate the GS$\nu$F detection; this will kick off a new era for low-energy neutrino astronomy, also providing a novel probe to discover New Physics.</description>

      <title>A theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework for black-hole spectroscopy: a case study on GW250114 in Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black-hole spectroscopy has emerged as a powerful probe of strong-field gravity in the era of gravitational-wave astronomy. In this context, many current tests of modified or extended gravity are implemented by searching for predicted signatures modeled as perturbative corrections to general-relativistic waveforms; however, this approach may introduce model-dependent systematics and limit applicability to broader classes of theories. To complement such methods, we develop a theory-agnostic hierarchical Bayesian framework that connects ringdown observations -- modeled as damped sinusoids -- directly with theoretical quasinormal mode spectra, performing the comparison at the spectral level rather than through theory-specific waveform matching. The framework incorporates a soft-truncation module to account for the finite domain of validity in the theory's parameter space and is equipped with quantitative diagnostics that identify stable analysis time windows. As an illustrative application, we implement the framework within Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet gravity and apply it to the gravitational-wave event GW250114, finding that the resulting posterior for the dimensionless coupling $\zeta$ is robust against prior assumptions yet remains only weakly informative over the range considered in this work. We further perform controlled ringdown injection studies across different values of $\zeta$, confirming that nonzero couplings can be recovered while also indicating a potential systematic effect: Kerr-based priors in the $\zeta$ inference may partially absorb spectral deviations arising in alternative theories of gravity. This work establishes a transparent and extensible foundation for future strong-field gravity tests, naturally compatible with the growing precision and modal resolution of next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.</description>
