      <description>arXiv:2405.16530v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>On Laplace equation solution in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal coordinate systems enable expressing the boundary conditions of differential equations in accord with the physical boundaries of the problem. It can significantly simplify calculations. The orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies or particles with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. The interior solution of the Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates was recently found; however, the exterior solution was missing. The exterior solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates is derived. In the steps leading to this solution, important formulas of the SOS algebra are found. Various forms of the Laplace operator in the SOS coordinates in azimuthally symmetric case are shown. General transformation between two different SOS coordinate systems is derived. It is determined that the SOS harmonics are physically the same as the solid harmonics. Further, a formula expressing any generalized Legendre polynomial as a finite sum of monomials is found. The reported relations have potential application in geophysics, astrophysics, electrostatics and solid state physics (e.g. ferroic inclusions).</description>

      <title>Demystifying Arrow of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific discussions of the arrow of time often get quite confusing due to highly complex systems they deal with. Popular literature then often coveys messages that tend to get lost in translation. The purpose of this note is to demystify the arrow of time by stripping off the unnecessary complexities and thereby simplifying the discussion. We do this by providing examples that are exactly solvable and make it easy to see the root cause of the apparent "time-irreversibility". We also discuss "time-reversal" solutions, where the initial state evolves such that it reaches the state which is the same as the initial state moving backward in time. These solutions are simple enough to be comprehensible to a highschooler. We discuss the arrow of time both in the classical and quantum settings, including in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Transmission des Ondes \'Electromagn\'etiques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book aims to familiarize Electrical Engineering students with exercises and problems related to electromagnetic wave transmission. It includes a brief theoretical introduction to classical electromagnetism formulas to bridge the gap between theory and practical applications. The book focuses on free space, coaxial cables, and waveguides, emphasizing the role of complex permittivity in transmission. It does not cover antennas or the generation of electromagnetic waves. The content is based on courses taught at \'Ecole Polytechnique de Montr\'eal from 1986 to 2017.

Il inclut une br\`eve introduction th\'eorique aux formules classiques de l'\'electromagn\'etisme pour combler l'\'ecart entre la th\'eorie et les applications pratiques. Le livre se concentre sur l'espace libre, les c\^ables coaxiaux et les guides d'ondes, en soulignant le r\^ole de la permittivit\'e complexe dans la transmission. Il ne couvre pas les antennes ni la g\'en\'eration des ondes \'electromagn\'etiques.

      <title>Representation of wave fields in a graded multilayer medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present a new approach in representation of wave fields in nonuniform 1-D multilayer medium. This approach is based on the use of a modified homogeneous basis. A new form of coupled equations for describing nonuniform one-directional photonic crystals is proposed. This description can be especially useful to study radiation that originates when fast electrons move in such medium</description>

      <title>Natural dynamical reduction of the three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.12372v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The three-body problem is a fundamental long-standing open problem, with applications in all branches of physics, including astrophysics, nuclear physics and particle physics. In general, conserved quantities allow to reduce the formulation of a mechanical problem to fewer degrees of freedom, a process known as dynamical reduction. However, extant reductions are either non-general, or hide the problem's symmetry or include unexplained definitions. This paper presents a dynamical reduction that avoids these issues, and hence is general and natural. Any three-body configuration defines a triangle, and its orientation in space. Accordingly, we decompose the dynamical variables into the geometry (shape + size) and orientation of the triangle. The geometry variables are shown to describe the motion of an abstract point in a curved 3d space, subject to a potential-derived force and a magnetic-like force with a monopole charge. The orientation variables are shown to obey a dynamics analogous to the Euler equations for a rotating rigid body, only here the moments of inertia depend on the geometry variables, rather than being constant. The reduction rests on a novel symmetric solution to the center of mass constraint inspired by Lagrange's solution to the cubic. The formulation of the orientation variables is novel and rests on a little known generalization of the Euler-Lagrange equations to non-coordinate velocities. Applications to global features, to the statistical solution and to special exact solutions are presented. A generalization to the four-body problem is presented.</description>
