      <title>Online Bernstein-von Mises theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online learning is an inferential paradigm in which parameters are updated incrementally from sequentially available data, in contrast to batch learning, where the entire dataset is processed at once. In this paper, we assume that mini-batches from the full dataset become available sequentially. The Bayesian framework, which updates beliefs about unknown parameters after observing each mini-batch, is naturally suited for online learning. At each step, we update the posterior distribution using the current prior and new observations, with the updated posterior serving as the prior for the next step. However, this recursive Bayesian updating is rarely computationally tractable unless the model and prior are conjugate. When the model is regular, the updated posterior can be approximated by a normal distribution, as justified by the Bernstein-von Mises theorem. We adopt a variational approximation at each step and investigate the frequentist properties of the final posterior obtained through this sequential procedure. Under mild assumptions, we show that the accumulated approximation error becomes negligible once the mini-batch size exceeds a threshold depending on the parameter dimension. As a result, the sequentially updated posterior is asymptotically indistinguishable from the full posterior.</description>

      <title>Revisiting poverty measures using quantile functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we redefine various poverty measures in literature in terms of quantile functions instead of distribution functions in the prevailing approach. This enables provision for alternative methodology for poverty measurement and analysis along with some new results that are difficult to obtain in the existing framework. Several flexible quantile function models that can enrich the existing ones are proposed and their utility is demonstrated for real data.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric local polynomial regression for functional covariates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonparametric regression with functional covariates, that is, they are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. A locally polynomial estimator is constructed, where an orthonormal basis and various tuning parameters remain to be selected. We provide a general asymptotic upper bound on the estimation error and show that this procedure achieves polynomial convergence rates under appropriate tuning and supersmoothness of the regression function. Such polynomial convergence rates have usually been considered to be non-attainable in nonparametric functional regression without any additional strong structural constraints such as linearity of the regression function.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Tangent Approximation Framework for Strongly Super-Gaussian Likelihoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tangent approximation form a popular class of variational inference (VI) techniques for Bayesian analysis in intractable non-conjugate models. It is based on the principle of convex duality to construct a minorant of the marginal likelihood, making the problem tractable. Despite its extensive applications, a general methodology for tangent approximation encompassing a large class of likelihoods beyond logit models with provable optimality guarantees is still elusive. In this article, we propose a general Tangent Approximation based Variational InferencE (TAVIE) framework for strongly super-Gaussian (SSG) likelihood functions which includes a broad class of flexible probability models. Specifically, TAVIE obtains a quadratic lower bound of the corresponding log-likelihood, thus inducing conjugacy with Gaussian priors over the model parameters. Under mild assumptions on the data-generating process, we demonstrate the optimality of our proposed methodology in the fractional likelihood setup. Furthermore, we illustrate the empirical performance of TAVIE through extensive simulations and an application on the U.S. 2000 Census real data.</description>

      <title>Debiasing Continuous-time Nonlinear Autoregressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how to identify a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems defined by an ordinary differential equation affine in the unknown parameter. We define a notion of asymptotic consistency as $(n, h) \to (\infty, 0)$, and we achieve it using a family of direct methods where the first step is differentiating a noisy time series and the second step is a plug-in linear estimator. The first step, differentiation, is a signal processing adaptation of the nonparametric statistical technique of local polynomial regression. The second step, generalized linear regression, can be consistent using a least squares estimator, but we demonstrate two novel bias corrections that improve the accuracy for finite $h$. These methods significantly broaden the class of continuous-time systems that can be consistently estimated by direct methods.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Hessian estimator from random samples on a manifold with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common method for estimating the Hessian operator from random samples on a low-dimensional manifold involves locally fitting a quadratic polynomial. Although widely used, it is unclear if this estimator introduces bias, especially in complex manifolds with boundaries and nonuniform sampling. Rigorous theoretical guarantees of its asymptotic behavior have been lacking. We show that, under mild conditions, this estimator asymptotically converges to the Hessian operator, with nonuniform sampling and curvature effects proving negligible, even near boundaries. Our analysis framework simplifies the intensive computations required for direct analysis.</description>

      <title>Empirical Bayes large-scale multiple testing for high-dimensional binary outcome data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05943v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the multiple testing problem for sparse high-dimensional data with binary outcomes. We propose novel empirical Bayes multiple testing procedures based on a spike-and-slab posterior and then evaluate their performance in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). A surprising finding is that the procedure using the default conjugate prior (namely, the $\ell$-value procedure) can be overly conservative in estimating the FDR. To address this, we introduce two new procedures that provide accurate FDR control. Sharp frequentist theoretical results are established for these procedures, and numerical experiments are conducted to validate our theory in finite samples. To the best of our knowledge, we obtain the first {\it uniform} FDR control result in multiple testing for high-dimensional data with binary outcomes under the sparsity assumption.</description>

      <title>Inference with Mondrian Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random forests are popular methods for regression and classification analysis, and many different variants have been proposed in recent years. One interesting example is the Mondrian random forest, in which the underlying constituent trees are constructed via a Mondrian process. We give precise bias and variance characterizations, along with a Berry-Esseen-type central limit theorem, for the Mondrian random forest regression estimator. By combining these results with a carefully crafted debiasing approach and an accurate variance estimator, we present valid statistical inference methods for the unknown regression function. These methods come with explicitly characterized error bounds in terms of the sample size, tree complexity parameter, and number of trees in the forest, and include coverage error rates for feasible confidence interval estimators. Our novel debiasing procedure for the Mondrian random forest also allows it to achieve the minimax-optimal point estimation convergence rate in mean squared error for multivariate $\beta$-H\"older regression functions, for all $\beta &gt; 0$, provided that the underlying tuning parameters are chosen appropriately. Efficient and implementable algorithms are devised for both batch and online learning settings, and we study the computational complexity of different Mondrian random forest implementations. Finally, simulations with synthetic data validate our theory and methodology, demonstrating their excellent finite-sample properties.</description>

      <title>Generalizability of experimental studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental studies are a cornerstone of machine learning (ML) research. A common, but often implicit, assumption is that the results of a study will generalize beyond the study itself, e.g. to new data. That is, there is a high probability that repeating the study under different conditions will yield similar results. Despite the importance of the concept, the problem of measuring generalizability remains open. This is probably due to the lack of a mathematical formalization of experimental studies. In this paper, we propose such a formalization and develop a quantifiable notion of generalizability. This notion allows to explore the generalizability of existing studies and to estimate the number of experiments needed to achieve the generalizability of new studies. To demonstrate its usefulness, we apply it to two recently published benchmarks to discern generalizable and non-generalizable results. We also publish a Python module that allows our analysis to be repeated for other experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Flexible Conformal Highest Predictive Conditional Density Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18052v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce our method, conformal highest conditional density sets (CHCDS), that forms conformal prediction sets using existing estimated conditional highest density predictive regions. We prove the validity of the method, and that conformal adjustment is negligible under some regularity conditions. In particular, if we correctly specify the underlying conditional density estimator, the conformal adjustment will be negligible. The conformal adjustment, however, always provides guaranteed nominal unconditional coverage, even when the underlying model is incorrectly specified. We compare the proposed method via simulation and a real data analysis to other existing methods. Our numerical results show that CHCDS is better than existing methods in scenarios where the error term is multi-modal, and just as good as existing methods when the error terms are unimodal.</description>

      <title>A partial likelihood approach to tree-based density modeling and its application in Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tree-based priors for probability distributions are usually specified using a predetermined, data-independent collection of candidate recursive partitions of the sample space. To characterize an unknown target density in detail over the entire sample space, candidate partitions must have the capacity to expand deeply into all areas of the sample space with potential non-zero sampling probability. Such an expansive system of partitions often incurs prohibitive computational costs and makes inference prone to overfitting, especially in regions with little probability mass. Thus, existing models typically make a compromise and rely on relatively shallow trees. This hampers one of the most desirable features of trees, their ability to characterize local features, and results in reduced statistical efficiency. Traditional wisdom suggests that this compromise is inevitable to ensure coherent likelihood-based reasoning in Bayesian inference, as a data-dependent partition system that allows deeper expansion only in regions with more observations would induce double dipping of the data. We propose a simple strategy to restore coherency while allowing the candidate partitions to be data-dependent, using Cox's partial likelihood. Our partial likelihood approach is broadly applicable to existing likelihood-based methods and, in particular, to Bayesian inference on tree-based models. We give examples in density estimation in which the partial likelihood is endowed with existing priors on tree-based models and compare with the standard, full-likelihood approach. The results show substantial gains in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency from adopting the partial likelihood.</description>
