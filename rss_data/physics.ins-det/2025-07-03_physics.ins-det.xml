      <title>The fast X-ray detector system of the FAMU experiment at RAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FAMU experiment at RAL has been designed to study the hyperfine splitting (HFS) of muonic hydrogen and thus measure the Zemach radius of the proton, with a precision better than 1 %. The HFS transition is excited by a tunable MIR laser at ~ 6790 nm and is recognized by delayed ($\mu$O) X-ray emission around 130-170 keV. The fast X-ray detection system is based on 34 scintillating LaBr3:Ce crystals and one HPGe detector for inter-calibration.</description>

      <title>Type-1.5 SNSPD: Interacting vortex theory of two bandgap superconducting single photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon detectors based on type-2 superconductors have found widespread applications from on-chip quantum computing to quantum remote sensing. Here, we develop the theory for a new class of type-1.5 superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on two bandgap superconductors with high transition temperatures such as MgB2 (Tc ~38.6K). We show that vortex-vortex interactions in two component condensates lead to a unique operating regime where single photons can seed multiple vortices within a hotspot. We also show that dark counts are suppressed in the type-1.5 regime compared to the widely studied type-2 SNSPDs. Our work opens the door for exploring the unique vortex physics of two-gap superconductors for quantum device applications.</description>

      <title>Ge-based Quantum Sensors for Low-Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textbf{GeQuLEP} (Germanium-based Quantum Sensors for Low-Energy Physics), a conceptual design for an advanced quantum sensing platform integrating high-purity germanium (Ge) crystals with engineered phononic crystal cavities. At cryogenic temperatures, these cavities naturally host dipole-bound states, effectively forming quantum dots coupled to radio-frequency quantum point contact (RF-QPC) readout systems. This innovative coupling approach promises ultra-sensitive phonon-mediated charge detection through phonon-induced charge displacement. GeQuLEP is specifically designed to achieve exceptionally low detection thresholds, theoretically enabling single primary phonon sensitivity with anticipated energy depositions as low as \textbf{0.00745~eV}. This unprecedented sensitivity, if realized experimentally, would provide unique access to searches for low-mass dark matter down to the keV/$c^2$ mass range via nuclear and electronic recoils. Additionally, GeQuLEP aims to facilitate the real-time detection of solar \textit{pp} neutrinos through coherent elastic neutrino--nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). By combining phonon-based quantum transduction with quantum-classical hybrid readout schemes, the GeQuLEP architecture represents a scalable, contact-free phonon spectroscopy design that could significantly advance the capabilities of ultra-low-energy rare-event detection at the quantum limit.</description>

      <title>Genetic algorithm as a tool for detection setup optimisation: SiFi-CC case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective: Proton therapy is a precision-focused cancer treatment where accurate proton beam range monitoring is critical to ensure effective dose delivery. This can be achieved by prompt gamma detection with a Compton camera like the SiFi-CC. This study aims to show the feasibility of optimising the geometry of SiFi-CC Compton camera for verification of dose distribution via prompt gamma detection using a genetic algorithm (GA). Approach: The SiFi-CC key geometric parameters for optimisation with the GA are the source-to-scatterer and scatterer-to-absorber distances, and the module thicknesses. The optimisation process was conducted with a software framework based on the Geant4 toolkit, which included detailed and realistic modelling of gamma interactions, detector response, and further steps such as event selection and image reconstruction. The performance of each individual configuration was evaluated using a fitness function incorporating factors related to gamma detection efficiency and image resolution. Results: The GA-optimised SiFi-CC configuration demonstrated the capability to detect a 5 mm proton beam range shift with a 2 mm resolution using 5e8 protons. The best-performing geometry, with 16 fibre layers in the scatterer, 36 layers in the absorber, source-to-scatterer distance 150 mm and scatterer-to-absorber distance 120 mm, has an imaging sensitivity of 5.58(1)e-5. Significance: This study demonstrates that the SiFi-CC setup, optimised through a GA, can reliably detect clinically relevant proton beam range shifts, improving real-time range verification accuracy in proton therapy. The presented implementation of a GA is a systematic and feasible way of searching for a SiFi-CC geometry that shows the best performance.</description>

      <title>Computed tomography of propagating microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propagating photons serve as essential links for distributing quantum information and entanglement across distant nodes. Knowledge of their Wigner functions not only enables their deployment as active information carriers but also provides error diagnostics when photons passively leak from a quantum processing unit. While well-established for standing waves, characterizing propagating microwave photons requires post-processing of room-temperature signals with excessive amplification noise. Here, we demonstrate amplification-free Wigner function tomography of propagating microwave photons using a superconductor--normal-metal--superconductor bolometer based on the resistive heating effect of absorbed radiation. By introducing two-field interference in power detection, the bolometer acts as a sensitive and broadband quadrature detector that samples the input field at selected angles at millikelvin with no added noise. Adapting the principles of computed tomography (CT) in medical imaging, we implement Wigner function CT by combining quadrature histograms across different projection angles and demonstrate it for Gaussian states at the single-photon level. Compressed sensing and neural networks further reduce the projections to three without compromising the reconstruction quality. These results address the long-standing challenge of characterizing propagating microwave photons in a superconducting quantum network and establish a new avenue for real-time quantum error diagnostics and correction.</description>
