      <title>Spectrum of two-flavored spin-zero heavy dibaryons in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the ground state energy spectra of two-flavored heavy dibaryons in the spin-singlet channel. In particular, the ground state masses of $\Omega_{llQ}\Omega_{llQ}, \Omega_{QlQ}\Omega_{llQ}$ and $\Omega_{QlQ}\Omega_{QlQ}$ states are computed and compared with their respective lowest non-interacting energy levels, where the flavor $Q \in (c,b)$ denotes charm and bottom quarks, and the other flavor $l \in {s,c,b}$ represents strange, charm and bottom, respectively. Considering their valence quark structures, these hadrons could be thought of as the heavy flavor analogues of spin-singlet nucleon-nucleon states. The gauge configurations employed in this study are HISQ ensembles with $N_f = 2+1+1$ flavors, generated by the MILC collaboration, at four lattice spacings, namely $a=0.1207, 0.0888, 0.0582$ and $0.0448$ fm. The aforementioned states are also computed at different quark masses, between $m_s \le m_l \le m_b$, including at unphysical heavy quark masses, to explore the quark mass dependence of any possible binding. For the dibaryon states $\Omega_{bbc}\Omega_{bbc}, \Omega_{ccb}\Omega_{ccb}$ and $\Omega_{ccb} \Omega_{bbc}$, we find a clear evidence of an energy level below their respective non-interacting energy levels. In addition, for these dibaryons at quark masses $m_c &lt; m_l \le m_b$, a trend is found where the gap, between the lowest energy levels and the respective lowest non-interacting levels, increases as the quark mass $m_l$ increases. We also study the heavy quark spin-symmetry and its breaking for these heavy dibaryons.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Free Localization for Benchmarking Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder-free localization (DFL) is a phenomenon as striking as it appears to be simple: a translationally invariant state evolving under a disorder-free Hamiltonian failing to thermalize. It is predicted to occur in a number of quantum systems exhibiting emergent or native \emph{local} symmetries. These include models of lattice gauge theories and, perhaps most simply, some two-component spin chains. Though well-established analytically for special soluble examples, numerical studies of generic systems have proven difficult. Moreover, the required local symmetries are a challenge for any experimental realization. Here, we show how a canonical model of DFL can be efficiently implemented on gate-based quantum computers, which relies on our efficient encoding of three-qubit gates. We show that the simultaneous observation of the absence of correlation spreading and tunable entanglement growth to a volume law provides an ideal testbed for benchmarking the capabilities of quantum computers. In particular, the availability of a soluble limit allows for a rigorous prediction of emergent localization length scales and tunable time scales for the volume law entanglement growth, which are ideal for testing capabilities of scalable quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Classical Continuum Limit of the String Field Theory Dual to Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the classical continuum limit of the string field theory dual to the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ lattice gauge theory and investigate various fundamental phenomena in the continuum theory at the mean-field level. Our construction of the continuum theory is based on the concept of {\it area derivative}, which can be regarded as a generalization of the ordinary derivative $\partial/\partial x^\mu$ to operators acting on functional fields $\phi[C]$ on the loop space. The resultant continuum theory has a $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ $1$-form global symmetry, which originates in the $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ center symmetry in the gauge theory. We find that the confined and deconfined phases of the gauge theory are identified by the unbroken and broken phases of the $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ symmetry respectively by showing the Area/Perimeter law of the classical solution. In the broken phase, the low-energy effective theory is described by a $\mathrm{BF}$-type topological field theory and has a emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ $(D-2)$-form global symmetry. The existence of the emergent symmetry is deeply related to $(D-2)$-dimensional topological configurations (i.e. center vortex for $D=4$), and we explicitly construct such a topological defect in the continuum theory. Finally, we also comment on the upper and lower critical dimensions of the gauge theory/string field theory.</description>

      <title>Gauged Gaussian PEPS -- A High Dimensional Tensor Network Formulation for Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge theories form the basis of our understanding of modern physics - ranging from the description of quarks and gluons to effective models in condensed matter physics. In the non-perturbative regime, gauge theories are conventionally treated discretely as lattice gauge theories. The resulting systems are evaluated with path-integral based Monte Carlo methods. These methods, however, can suffer from the sign problem and do not allow for a direct evaluation of real-time dynamics. In this work, we present a unified and comprehensive framework for gauged Gaussian Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), a variational ansatz based on tensor networks. We review the construction of Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories, explain their similarities with PEPS, and detail the construction of the state. The estimation of ground states is based on a variational Monte Carlo procedure with the PEPS as an ansatz state. This sign-problem-free ansatz can be efficiently evaluated in any dimension with arbitrary gauge groups, and can include dynamical fermionic matter, suggesting new options for the simulation of non-perturbative regimes of gauge theories, including QCD.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant renormalization of four-quark operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the renormalization of four-quark operators in one-loop perturbation theory. We employ a coordinate-space Gauge-Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS), which can be advantageous compared to other schemes, especially in nonperturbative lattice investigations. From our perturbative calculations, we extract the conversion factors between GIRS and the modified Minimal Subtraction scheme ($\overline{\rm MS}$) at the next-to-leading order. A formidable issue in the study of the four-quark operators is that operators with different Dirac matrices mix among themselves upon renormalization. We focus on both parity-conserving and parity-violating four-quark operators, which change flavor numbers by two units ($\Delta F = 2$). The extraction of the conversion factors entails the calculation of two-point Green's functions involving products of two four-quark operators, as well as three-point Green's functions with one four-quark and two bilinear operators. The significance of our results lies in their potential to refine our understanding of QCD phenomena, offering insights into the precision of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements and shedding light on the nonperturbative treatment of complex mixing patterns associated with four-quark operators.</description>

      <title>Finite- and infinite-volume study of $DD\pi$ scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for extracting the pole position and properties of the doubly-charmed tetraquark $T_{\rm cc}^+(3875)$ from lattice QCD data using the relativistic three-particle formalism. This approach incorporates the effect of the one-pion exchange diagram in $DD\pi$ and $DD^*$ scattering, making it applicable at energies coinciding with the left-hand cut in the partial-wave projected $DD^*$ amplitude. We present an example application of this framework to existing lattice QCD data at $m_\pi = 280$ MeV. We solve the integral equations describing the $DD\pi$ reaction, use LSZ reduction to determine the corresponding $DD^*$ amplitude, and find the values of the infinite-volume two- and three-body $K$ matrices that lead to agreement with lattice $DD^*$ phase shifts within their uncertainties. Using these $K$ matrices in the three-particle quantization condition, we describe the finite-volume $DD^*$ spectrum and find good agreement with the lattice QCD energies. Our results suggest that, at this pion mass, the tetraquark appears as a pair of subthreshold complex poles whose precise location strongly depends on the value of the $DD\pi$ three-particle $K$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Disentangling new physics in $K\rightarrow\pi\bar{\nu}\nu$ and $B\rightarrow K(K^*)\bar{\nu}\nu$ observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of disentangling different new physics contributions to the rare meson decays $K\rightarrow\pi+\displaystyle{\not}E$ and $B\rightarrow K(K^*)+\displaystyle{\not}E$ through kinematic distributions in the missing energy $\displaystyle{\not}E$. We employ dimension-$6$ operators within the Low-Energy Effective Field Theory (LEFT), identifying the invisible part of the final state as either active or sterile neutrinos. Special emphasis is given to lepton-number violating (LNV) operators with scalar and tensor currents. We show analytically that contributions from scalar, vector, and tensor quark currents can be uniquely determined from experimental data of kinematic distributions. In addition, we present new correlations of branching ratios for $K$ and $B$-decays involving scalar and tensor currents. As there could a priori also be new invisible particles in the final states, we include dark-sector operators giving rise to two dark scalars, fermions, or vectors in the final state. In this context, we present new calculations of the inclusive decay rate $B\rightarrow X_s+\displaystyle{\not}E$ for dark operators. We show that careful measurements of kinematic distributions make it theoretically possible to disentangle the contribution from LEFT operators from most of the dark-sector operators, even when multiple operators are contributing. We revisit sum rules for vector currents in LEFT and show that the latter are also satisfied in some new dark-physics scenarios that could mimic LEFT. Finally, we point out that an excess in rare meson decays consistent with a LNV hypothesis would point towards highly flavor non-democratic physics in the UV, and could put high-scale leptogenesis under tension.</description>

      <title>Loop unitary and phase band topological invariant in generic multi-band Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quench dynamics of topological phases have been studied in the past few years and dynamical topological invariants are formulated in different ways. Yet most of these invariants are limited to minimal systems in which Hamiltonians are expanded by Gamma matrices. Here we generalize the dynamical 3-winding-number in two-band systems into the one in generic multi-band Chern insulators and prove that its value is equal to the difference of Chern numbers between post-quench and pre-quench Hamiltonians. Moreover we obtain an expression of this dynamical 3-winding-number represented by gapless fermions in phase bands depending only on the phase and its projectors, so it is generic for the quench of all multi-band Chern insulators. Besides, we obtain a multifold fermion in the phase band in (k, t) space by quenching a three-band model, which cannot happen for two band models.</description>
