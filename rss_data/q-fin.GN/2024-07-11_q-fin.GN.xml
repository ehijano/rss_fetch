      <title>Central Bank Digital Currency: The Advent of its IT Governance in the financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) can be defined as a virtual currency based on node network and digital encryption algorithm issued by a country which has a legal credit protection. CBDCs are supported by Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs), and they may allow a universal means of payments for the digital era. There are many ways to proceed, they all require central banks to develop technological expertise. Considering these points, it is important to understand the new IT governance in the financial markets due to CBDC and digital economy. Information Technology is an essential driver that will allow the new financial industry design. This paper has the objective to answer two questions through an updated Systematic Literature Review (SLR). The first question is What IT resources and tools have been considered or applied to set the governance of CBDC adoption? The second; Identify IT governance models in the financial market due to CBDC adoption. Bank for International Settlements (BIS) publications, Scopus and Web of Science were considered as sources of studies. After the strings and including criteria were applied, fourteen papers were analyzed. This paper finds many IT resources used in the CBDC adoption and some preliminary IT design related to the IT governance of CBDC, in the results and discussion section the findings are more detailed. Finally, limitations and future work are considered. Keywords: Blockchain, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC), Digital Economy, Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), Information Technology (IT), IT governance.</description>

      <title>Not feeling the buzz: Correction study of mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01740v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a replication and correction of a recent article (Ramirez, P., Reade, J.J., Singleton, C., Betting on a buzz: Mispricing and inefficiency in online sportsbooks, International Journal of Forecasting, 39:3, 2023, pp. 1413-1423, doi: 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2022.07.011). RRS measure profile page views on Wikipedia to generate a "buzz factor" metric for tennis players and show that it can be used to form a profitable gambling strategy by predicting bookmaker mispricing. Here, we use the same dataset as RRS to reproduce their results exactly, thus confirming the robustness of their mispricing claim. However, we discover that the published betting results are significantly affected by a single bet (the "Hercog" bet), which returns substantial outlier profits based on erroneously long odds. When this data quality issue is resolved, the majority of reported profits disappear and only one strategy, which bets on "competitive" matches, remains significantly profitable in the original out-of-sample period. While one profitable strategy offers weaker support than the original study, it still provides an indication that market inefficiencies may exist, as originally claimed by RRS. As an extension, we continue backtesting after 2020 on a cleaned dataset. Results show that (a) the "competitive" strategy generates no further profits, potentially suggesting markets have become more efficient, and (b) model coefficients estimated over this more recent period are no longer reliable predictors of bookmaker mispricing. We present this work as a case study demonstrating the importance of replication studies in sports forecasting, and the necessity to clean data. We open-source release comprehensive datasets and code.</description>
