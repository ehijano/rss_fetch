      <title>Orbits and invariants for coisotropy representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a subgroup $H$ of a reductive group $G$, let $\mathfrak m\subset \mathfrak g^*$ be the cotangent space of $eH\in G/H$. The linear action $(H:\mathfrak m)$ is the coisotropy representation. It is known that the complexity and rank of $G/H$ (denoted $c$ and $r$, respectively) are encoded in properties of $(H:\mathfrak m)$. We complement existing results on $c$, $r$, and $(H:\mathfrak m)$, especially for quasiaffine varieties $G/H$. If the algebra of invariants $k[\mathfrak m]^H$ is finitely generated, then we establish a connection between the nullcones in $\mathfrak m$ and $\mathfrak g^*$. Two other topics considered are (i) a relationship between varieties $G/H$ of complexity at most 1 and the homological dimension of the algebra of invariants $k[\mathfrak m]^H$ and (ii) the Poisson structure of $k[\mathfrak m]^H$ and Poisson-commutative subalgebras in $k[\mathfrak m]^H$ with maximal transcendence degree.</description>

      <title>Saturation rank for nilradical of parabolic subalgebras in Type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mfp(d)$ be a standard parabolic subalgebra of $\mfsl_{n+1}(K)$ and $\mfu$ be the corresponding nilradical defined over an algebraically closed field $K$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We construct a finite connected quiver $Q(d)$, through which we provide a combinatorial characterization of the centralizer $c_{\mfu}(x(d))$ of the Richardson element $x(d)$. We specifically focus on the centralizer when the levi factor of $\mfp(d)$ is determined by either one or two simple roots. This allows us to demonstrate that, under certain mild restrictions, the saturation rank of $\mfu$ equals the semisimple rank of the algebraic $K$-group $\SL_{n+1}(K)$.</description>

      <title>On the Submodule Structure of Hook Specht Modules in Characteristic 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The submodule structure of general Specht modules in prime characteristic is a difficult open problem. Kleshchev and Sheth [Journal of Algebra, 221(2), pp.705-722] gave a combinatorial description of the submodule structure of Specht modules labelled by $2$-part partitions in prime characteristic. Using this result, as well as filtrations of Specht modules labelled by hook partitions via $2$-part Specht modules in characteristic $2$, one can study the submodule structure of hook Specht modules. In particular, we classify which of these are uniserial.</description>

      <title>k-Fold Gaussian Random Matrix Ensembles I: Forcing Structure into Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random Matrix Theory is a powerful tool in applied mathematics. Three canonical models of random matrix distributions are the Gaussian Orthogonal, Unitary and Symplectic Ensembles. For matrix ensembles defined on k-fold tensor products of identical vector spaces we motivate natural generalizations of the Gaussian Ensemble family. We show how the k-fold invariant constraints are satisfied in both disordered spin models and systems with gauge symmetries, specifically quantum double models. We use Schur-Weyl duality to completely characterize the form of allowed Gaussian distributions satisfying k-fold invariant constraints. The eigenvalue distribution of our proposed ensembles is computed exactly using the Harish-Chandra integral method. For the 2-fold tensor product case, we show that the derived distribution couples eigenvalue spectrum to entanglement spectrum. Guided by representation theory, our work is a natural extension of the standard Gaussian random matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Local cohomology with support in Schubert varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with local cohomology sheaves on generalized flag varieties supported in closed Schubert varieties, which carry natural structures as (mixed Hodge) D-modules. We employ Kazhdan--Lusztig theory and Saito's theory of mixed Hodge modules to describe a general strategy to calculate the simple composition factors, Hodge filtration, and weight filtration on these modules. Our main tool is the Grothendieck--Cousin complex, introduced by Kempf, which allows us to relate the local cohomology modules in question to parabolic Verma modules over the corresponding Lie algebra. We show that this complex underlies a complex of mixed Hodge modules, and is thus endowed with Hodge and weight filtrations. As a consequence, strictness implies that computing cohomology commutes with taking associated graded with respect to both of these filtrations. We execute this strategy to calculate the composition factors and weight filtration for Schubert varieties in the Grassmannian, in particular showing that the weight filtration is controlled by the augmented Dyck patterns of Raicu--Weyman. As an application, upon restriction to the opposite big cell, we recover the simple composition factors and weight filtration on local cohomology with support in generic determinantal varieties.</description>

      <title>On the spherical partition algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and study the spherical partition algebras ${\mathcal{SP} }_{k}$ for $k\in \mathbb{N}$, defined in general over $\mathbb{C}[x]$. For each ${\mathcal{SP} }_{k}$ we determine a basis and hence determine the rank $ {\rm rk}_{\mathbb{C}[x]} \, \mathcal{SP}_{k}= bp_k$ as the sequence A002774 in the OEIS. For $ t \in \mathbb{C} $ we consider the specialized algebra $\mathcal{SP}_{k}(t)$ and show that $\mathcal{SP}_{k}(t)$ is quasi-hereditary over $ \mathbb{C}$ for almost all $ t $. As a step in determining the structure of $\mathcal{SP}_{k}(n)$ we determine the permutation module decomposition of the $k$'th symmetric power of the defining module for the symmetric group algebra $ \mathbb{C} \mathfrak{S}_n $.
  We give the structure of $\mathcal{SP}_{k}(t)$ for every specialization $ t \in \mathbb{C} $ except $ t= 0 $, (which includes semisimple and non-semisimple cases). In particular we determine the structure of all indecomposable projective modules; and the indecomposable tilting modules.</description>

      <title>Inflations for representations of shifted quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fix a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and let $\mathfrak{g}_J\subseteq\mathfrak{g}$ be a Lie subalgebra coming from a Dynkin diagram inclusion. Then, the corresponding restriction functor is not essentially surjective on finite-dimensional simple $\mathfrak{g}_J$-modules. In this article, we study Finkelberg-Tsymbaliuk's shifted quantum affine algebras $U_q^{\mu}(\mathfrak{g})$ and the associated categories $\mathcal{O}^{\mu}$ (defined by Hernandez). In particular, we introduce natural subalgebras $U_q^{\nu}(\mathfrak{g}_J)\,{\subseteq}\,U_q^{\mu}(\mathfrak{g})$ and obtain a functor $\mathcal{R}_J$ from $\mathcal{O}^{sh}\,{=}\bigoplus_{\mu}\mathcal{O}^{\mu}$ to $\bigoplus_{\nu}(U_q^{\nu}(\mathfrak{g}_J)\text{-Mod})$ using the canonical restriction functors. We then establish that $\mathcal{R}_J$ is essentially surjective on finite-dimensional simple objects by constructing notable preimages that we call inflations. We conjecture that all simple objects in $\mathcal{O}^{sh}_J$ (which is the analog of $\mathcal{O}^{sh}$ for the subalgebras $U_q^{\nu}(\mathfrak{g}_J)$) admit some inflation and prove this for $\mathfrak{g}$ of type A-B or $\mathfrak{g}_J$ a direct sum of copies of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$. We finally apply our results to deduce certain $R$-matrices and examples of cluster structures over Grothendieck rings.</description>

      <title>A resolution theorem for extriangulated categories with applications to the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10576v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quillen's Resolution Theorem in algebraic $K$-theory provides a powerful computational tool for calculating $K$-groups of exact categories. At the level of $K_0$, this result goes back to Grothendieck. In this article, we first establish an extriangulated version of Grothendieck's Resolution Theorem.
  Second, we use this Extriangulated Resolution Theorem to gain new insight into the index theory of triangulated categories. Indeed, we propose an index with respect to an extension-closed subcategory $\mathscr{N}$ of a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ and we prove an additivity formula with error term. Our index recovers the index with respect to a contravariantly finite, rigid subcategory $\mathscr{X}$ defined by J{\o}rgensen and the second author, as well as an isomorphism between $K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$ and the Grothendieck group of a relative extriangulated structure $\mathscr{C}_{R}^{\mathscr{X}}$ on $\mathscr{C}$ when $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting. In addition, we generalize and enhance some results of Fedele. Our perspective allows us to remove certain restrictions and simplify some arguments.
  Third, as another application of our Extriangulated Resolution Theorem, we show that if $\mathscr{X}$ is $n$-cluster tilting in an abelian category, then the index introduced by Reid gives an isomorphism $K_0(\mathscr{C}_R^{\mathscr{X}}) \cong K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$.</description>

      <title>Hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials of Jacobi type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the theory of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials, we consider quasi-orthogonal polynomial families - those that are orthogonal with respect to a non-degenerate bilinear form defined by a linear functional - in which the ratio of successive coefficients is given by a rational function $f(u,s)$ which is polynomial in $u$. We call this a family of Jacobi type.
  Our main result is that, up to rescaling and renormalization, there are only five families of Jacobi type. These are the classical families of Jacobi, Laguerre and Bessel polynomials, and two more one parameter families $E_n^{(c)},F_n^{(c)}$. Each family arises as a specialization of some hypergeometric series. The last two families can also be expressed through Lommel polynomials, and they are orthogonal with respect to a positive measure on $\mathbb{R}$ for $c&gt;0$ and $c&gt;-1$ respectively.
  We also consider the more general rational families, i.e. quasi-orthogonal families in which the ratio $f(u,s)$ of successive coefficients is allowed to be rational in $u$ as well.</description>

      <title>Global Representation Ring and Knutson Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global representation rings were discovered by Sarah Witherspoon in 1995 and the Knutson Index was introduced by the second author in 2022. In the present paper we introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings and study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks. We discuss what properties of a group can be recovered from its global table.</description>
