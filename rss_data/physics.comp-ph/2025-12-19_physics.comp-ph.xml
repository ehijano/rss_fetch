      <title>Sparse Operator-Adapted Wavelet Decomposition Using Polygonal Elements for Multiscale FEM Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a sparse multiscale operator-adapted wavelet decomposition-based finite element method (FEM) on unstructured polygonal mesh hierarchies obtained via a coarsening procedure. Our approach decouples different resolution levels, allowing each scale to be solved independently and added to the entire solution without the need to recompute coarser levels. At the finest level, the meshes consist of triangular elements which are geometrically coarsened at each step to form convex polygonal elements. Smooth field regions of the domain are solved with fewer, larger, polygonal elements, whereas high-gradient regions are represented by smaller elements, thereby improving memory efficiency through adaptivity. The proposed algorithm computes solutions via sequences of hierarchical sparse linear-algebra operations with nearly linear computational complexity.</description>

      <title>ClusTEK: A grid clustering algorithm augmented with diffusion imputation and origin-constrained connected-component analysis: Application to polymer crystallization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid clustering algorithms are valued for their efficiency in large-scale data analysis but face persistent limitations: parameter sensitivity, loss of structural detail at coarse resolutions, and misclassifications of edge or bridge cells at fine resolutions. Previous studies have addressed these challenges through adaptive grids, parameter tuning, or hybrid integration with other clustering methods, each of which offers limited robustness. This paper introduces a grid clustering framework that integrates Laplacian-kernel diffusion imputation and origin-constrained connected-component analysis (OC-CCA) on a uniform grid to reconstruct the cluster topology with high accuracy and computational efficiency. During grid construction, an automated preprocessing stage provides data-driven estimates of cell size and density thresholds. The diffusion step then mitigates sparsity and reconstructs missing edge cells without over-smoothing physical gradients, while OC-CCA constrains component growth to physically consistent origins, reducing false merges across narrow gaps. Operating on a fixed-resolution grid with spatial indexing ensures the scaling of O(nlog n). Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and polymer simulation datasets demonstrate that the method correctly manages edges, preserves cluster topology, and avoids spurious connections. Benchmarking on polymer systems across scales (9k, 180k, and 989k atoms) shows that optimal preprocessing, combined with diffusion-based clustering, reproduces atomic-level accuracy and captures physically meaningful morphologies while delivering accelerated computation.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the amorphous ice layer during premelting using AFM integrating machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Premelting plays a key role across physics, chemistry, materials and biology sciences but remains poorly understood at the atomic level due to surface characterization limitations. We report the discovery of a novel amorphous ice layer (AIL) preceding the quasi-liquid layer (QLL) during ice premelting, enabled by a machine learning framework integrating atomic force microscopy (AFM) with molecular dynamics simulations. This approach overcomes AFM's depth and signal limitations, allowing for three-dimensional surface structure reconstruction from AFM images. It further enables structural exploration of premelting interfaces across a wide temperature range that are experimentally inaccessible. We identify the AIL, present between 121-180K, displaying disordered two-dimensional hydrogen-bond network with solid-like dynamics. Our findings refine the ice premelting phase diagram and offering new insights into the surface growth dynamic, dissolution and interfacial chemical reactivity. Methodologically, this work establishes a novel framework for AFM-based 3D structural discovery, marking a significant leap in our ability to probe complex disordered interfaces with unprecedented precision and paving the way for future disciplinary research, including surface reconstruction, crystallization, ion solvation, and biomolecular recognition.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Symbolic Regression in the Physical Sciences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful method for uncovering interpretable mathematical relationships from data, offering a novel route to both scientific discovery and efficient empirical modelling. This article introduces the Special Issue on Symbolic Regression for the Physical Sciences, motivated by the Royal Society discussion meeting held in April 2025. The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.
  The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity. Finally we emphasise emerging directions, particularly the incorporation of symmetry constraints, asymptotic behaviour and other theoretical information. Taken together, the papers in this Special Issue illustrate the accelerating progress of SR and its growing relevance across the physical sciences.</description>

      <title>A unified MRT-LB framework for Navier-Stokes and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations and beyond: moment equations, auxiliary moments, multispeed lattices, and Hermite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) framework based on discrete Hermite polynomials (Hermite matrices) for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations (NCDEs), using multispeed rectangular lattice (rD$d$Q$b$) models. For NSEs, the proposed MRT-LB model simulates incompressible and compressible isothermal flows in both single-phase and multiphase systems. Macroscopic moment equations are derived from the MRT-LB model via the direct Taylor expansion method. By selecting appropriate fundamental moments, the target NSEs and NCDE are recovered from these moment equations. Critically, the elimination of spurious terms and/or the recovery of the desired terms relies on specific auxiliary moments: the second-order auxiliary moment ($\mathbf{M}_{2G}$) of the source term distribution function (SDF) and the third-order auxiliary moment ($\mathbf{M}_{30}$) of the equilibrium distribution function (EDF) for NSEs, as well as the first-order auxiliary moment ($\mathbf{M}_{1G}$) of the SDF and the second-order auxiliary moment ($\mathbf{M}_{20}$) of the EDF for NCDE. Furthermore, using the weighted orthogonality of Hermite matrices, we establish essential relations for weight coefficients and construct several multispeed rectangular lattice models, including rD2Q25 and rD3Q53, with subgroup models rD2Q21, rD2Q17, rD2Q13, rD3Q45, and rD3Q33. A generalized third-order equilibrium distribution function is derived. We emphasize that for rectangular lattices, specific elements of the Hermite matrix corresponding to third-order discrete Hermite polynomials require correction to satisfy weighted orthogonality.</description>

      <title>Beyond dpa: an atomistic framework for a quantitative description of radiation damage in YBa2Cu3O7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation damage in high-temperature cuprate superconductors represents one of the main technological challenges for their deployment in harsh environments, such as fusion reactors and accelerator facilities. Their complex crystal structure makes modeling irradiation effects in this class of materials a particularly demanding task, for which existing damage models remain inadequate. In this work, we develop an atomistic-based approach for describing primary radiation damage in YBa2Cu3O7, by coupling Molecular Dynamics and Binary Collision Approximation simulations in a way that makes them complementary. When integrated with Primary Knock-on Atom spectra obtained from Monte Carlo codes, our results establish a framework for multiscale modeling of radiation damage, enabling quantitative estimates of several damage descriptors, such as defect production, defect clustering, and the effective damaged volume for any specific irradiation conditions where collision cascades dominate. This computational approach is suitable for the prediction of irradiation effects in any complex functional oxide, with applications ranging from aerospace to nuclear fusion and high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Atomic forces from correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.</description>

      <title>Disruption Modelling for Engineering and Physics Design of Tokamak Energy ST-E1 Fusion Power Plant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasma disruptions represent a critical challenge for high-performance tokamak operations, as they can compromise machine integrity and reduce operational availability. Although future fusion devices essentially need to incorporate strategies to minimise disruption occurrence, complete avoidance remains unattainable. Consequently, assessing and characterising unmitigated disruption consequences is fundamental for the design and qualification of next-generation fusion power plants. This work supports the pre-conceptual design of ST-E1, a low aspect-ratio Tokamak Fusion Power Plant developed by Tokamak Energy Ltd., by presenting a comprehensive disruption modelling approach applied across different design stages. The methodology integrates both physics and engineering considerations to evaluate the impact of disruptions on machine performance and structural integrity. From an engineering perspective, several ST-E1 layout options were analysed to investigate the electromagnetic response of key components under disruption-induced loads, enabling comparison between alternative design solutions. On the physics side, a broad set of disruption scenarios was explored, scanning operational space parameters, plasma-material interactions, and associated thermal loads. Furthermore, the study examined variations in disruption behaviour arising from different reference equilibria, focusing on a range starting from Double Null to Single Null configurations, reflecting the increasing up-down asymmetry consequences. The results reveal significant contrasts in plasma dynamics and structures electromagnetic behaviour between configurations, highlighting the importance of disruption modelling in guiding design choices. These analyses have proven instrumental in shaping ST-E1 development, offering critical insights for mitigating risks and optimising future fusion reactor designs.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Stochastic Interpolants for Amorphous Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern generative models hold great promise for accelerating diverse tasks involving the simulation of physical systems, but they must be adapted to the specific constraints of each domain. Significant progress has been made for biomolecules and crystalline materials. Here, we address amorphous materials (glasses), which are disordered particle systems lacking atomic periodicity. Sampling equilibrium configurations of glass-forming materials is a notoriously slow and difficult task. This obstacle could be overcome by developing a generative framework capable of producing equilibrium configurations with well-defined likelihoods. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging an equivariant Riemannian stochastic interpolation framework which combines Riemannian stochastic interpolant and equivariant flow matching. Our method rigorously incorporates periodic boundary conditions and the symmetries of multi-component particle systems, adapting an equivariant graph neural network to operate directly on the torus. Our numerical experiments on model amorphous systems demonstrate that enforcing geometric and symmetry constraints significantly improves generative performance.</description>

      <title>QMCkl: A Kernel Library for Quantum Monte Carlo Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods deliver highly accurate electronic structure calculations but are computationally intensive. The quantum Monte Carlo kernel library (QMCkl) provides a modular, portable collection of high-performance kernels implementing the core building blocks of QMC calculations. It offers a C-compatible API, supports the TREXIO standard for input, and covers essential QMC kernels including atomic and molecular orbitals, cusp corrections, Jastrow factor, and the necessary derivatives also to perform variational and structural optimization. QMCkl separates algorithmic development from hardware-specific tuning by combining human-readable reference implementations with performance-optimized kernels that produce identical numerical results. The library enables consistent, efficient, and reproducible simulations across different QMC codes and architectures, and achieves substantial speedups in the evaluation of the energy and its derivatives. Beyond QMC, QMCkl can accelerate deterministic quantum chemistry workflows and visualization tools, promoting cross-code interoperability and simplifying high-performance scientific software development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte-Carlo simulations are widely used to simulate complex molecular systems, but standard approaches suffer from metastability. Lately, the use of non-local proposal updates in a collective-variable (CV) space has been proposed in several works. Here, we generalize these approaches and explicitly spell out an algorithm for non-linear CVs and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove reversibility of the resulting scheme and demonstrate its performance on several numerical examples, observing a substantial performance increase compared to methods based on overdamped Langevin dynamics as considered previously. Advances in generative machine-learning-based proposal samplers now enable efficient sampling in CV spaces of intermediate dimensionality (tens to hundreds of variables), and our results extend their applicability toward more realistic molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical study of N$_2$ clathrate hydrate from DFT calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic stability of N$_2$ clathrate hydrates in the sI and sII structures is investigated using density functional theory with several exchange-correlation functionals, explicitly accounting for composition (cage occupancies) and pressure at T = 0 K. Among the tested functionals, revPBE-D3(0) best reproduces experimental lattice parameters and bulk moduli B$_0$ . Energetic analyses confirm the strong impact of large cage double occupancy on sI, whereas the convex-hull results show that sI with single occupancy remains thermodynamically stable up to $\sim$ 0.8 GPa alongside sII with single occupancy. Increasing pressure then stabilizes sII with double occupancy, consistent with its larger large-cage volume and lower framework strain. These results provide a coherent, first-principles thermodynamic framework for N$_2$ hydrate stability and a baseline for finite-temperature extension.</description>

      <title>An evacuation simulator for pedestrian dynamics based on the Social Force Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evacuation of pedestrians from enclosed spaces represents a key problem in safety engineering and infrastructure design. Analyzing the collective dynamics that emerge during evacuation processes requires simulation tools capable of capturing individual interactions and spatial constraints realistically.
  In this work, we present \textit{SiCoBioNa}, an open-source evacuation simulator based on the Social Force Model (SFM). The software provides an intuitive graphical interface that allows users to configure pedestrian properties, spatial geometries, and initial conditions without requiring prior expertise in numerical modeling techniques. The SFM framework enables the representation of goal-oriented motion, interpersonal interactions, and interactions with fixed obstacles.
  The simulator generates both quantitative data and visual outputs, facilitating the analysis of evacuation dynamics and the evaluation of different spatial configurations. Due to its modular and extensible design, \textit{SiCoBioNa} serves as a reproducible research tool for studies on pedestrian dynamics providing practical support for evacuation planning.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Delta Tracking Schemes Using a Track-Length Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations, Woodcock-delta tracking is a common alternative to the more popular surface tracking technique. In this work we introduce a delta-tracking algorithm that tallies fluxes to a structured rectilinear mesh using the track-length estimator. This development also enables hybrid surface-delta tracking algorithms, because the track-length tally can be used everywhere for scalar flux estimation regardless of which tracking algorithm is employed. We use this tallying technique to develop a novel hybrid-in-energy method. We also implement a hybrid-in-material method, like what is implemented in Serpent2. We demonstrate that these delta tracking algorithms can be used in conjunction with continuously moving surfaces. We compare these methods showing figures of merit on four time-dependent problems (multi-group and continuous energy) solved with CPU- and GPU-based computers. Our implementation of delta tracking with a track length tally modestly improves figures of merit compared to standard delta tracking with a collision estimator and surface tracking with a track length estimator (1.5X 2.5X) for a problem with significant void regions. For both multi-group and continuous energy pressurized water reactor benchmarks, standard delta tracking with a collision estimator performs best. Hybrid-in-energy methods show significant improvements (7X-11X) for a continuous energy reactor benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>An interpretation of the Brownian bridge as a physics-informed prior for the Poisson equation</title>

Abstract: Many inverse problems require reconstructing physical fields from limited and noisy data while incorporating known governing equations. A growing body of work within probabilistic numerics formalizes such tasks via Bayesian inference in function spaces by assigning a physically meaningful prior to the latent field. In this work, we demonstrate that Brownian bridge Gaussian processes can be viewed as a softly-enforced physics-constrained prior for the Poisson equation. We first show equivalence between the variational problem associated with the Poisson equation and a kernel ridge regression objective. Then, through the connection between Gaussian process regression and kernel methods, we identify a Gaussian process for which the posterior mean function and the minimizer to the variational problem agree, thereby placing this PDE-based regularization within a fully Bayesian framework. This connection allows us to probe different theoretical questions, such as convergence and behavior of inverse problems. We then develop a finite-dimensional representation in function space and prove convergence of the projected prior and resulting posterior in Wasserstein distance. Finally, we connect the method to the important problem of identifying model-form error in applications, providing a diagnostic for model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer network model recognized for its efficiency in neuromorphic computing, where synapses between neurons are trained linearly. Computations in KAN are performed by generating a polynomial vector from the state vector and layer-wise trained synapses, enabling efficient processing. While KAN can be implemented on quantum computers using block encoding and Quantum Signal Processing, these methods require fault-tolerant quantum devices, making them impractical for current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware. We propose the Enhanced Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (EVQKAN) to overcome this limitation, which emulates KAN through variational quantum algorithms. The EVQKAN ansatz employs a tiling technique to emulate layer matrices, leading to significantly higher accuracy compared to conventional Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) and Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), even with a smaller number of layers. EVQKAN achieves superior performance with a single-layer architecture, whereas QNN and VQKAN typically struggle. Additionally, EVQKAN eliminates the need for Quantum Signal Processing, enhancing its robustness to noise and making it well-suited for practical deployment on NISQ-era quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic structure of the PL5 defect in silicon carbide revealed by single-spin spectroscopy and oxygen implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PL5 and PL6 centers in 4H-SiC are promising for quantum applications due to their superior charge stability and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) properties at room temperature. However, their atomic structures remain unresolved, with ongoing controversy regarding their potential association with stacking faults. Previous measurements relying on spin ensemble detection were insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In this work, we conduct correlative imaging of stacking faults and PL5/PL6 at the single-defect level, definitively ruling out any spatial correlation and demonstrating that these centers are not associated with stacking faults. Furthermore, we find that substituting oxygen for nitrogen in ion implantation enhances the yields of PL5 and PL6 by more than $11$-fold and $23$-fold, respectively. Single-spin ODMR spectroscopy of PL5 reveals six distinct orientations, determines the transverse zero-field splitting parameter $E$, and characterizes the hyperfine coupling. Combined with our ab initio calculations, these results provide compelling evidence for the assignment of PL5 as an OV($kh$) defect, consisting of an oxygen atom occupying the C($k$) site as the nearest neighbor to a Si($h$) vacancy. The structural analysis together with the demonstrated defect yield enhancement lays the foundation for fabricating high-sensitivity, high-contrast ensemble quantum sensors in two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement across scales: Quantics tensor trains as a natural framework for renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information as a witness of non-Markovianity and criticality in the spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum Fisher information, the quantum analogue of the classical Fisher information, is a central quantity in quantum metrology and quantum sensing due to its connection to parameter estimation and fidelity susceptibility. Using numerically exact methods applied to a paradigmatic open quantum system, the spin-boson model, we calculate both static and dynamical quantum Fisher information matrix elements with respect to spin-bath couplings and magnetic field strengths. As the spin-bath interaction increases, we first show that the coupling-coupling matrix elements relative to the ground state of the Hamiltonian are linked to the entanglement growth and signal the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition through their non-monotonic behavior. We also point out that the static quantum Fisher information exhibits a non-perturbative behavior in the zero-coupling limit, which we justify with an analytic argument. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the time-dependent matrix elements can reveal non-Markovian effects as well as the transition from the coherent to incoherent regime at the Toulouse point, remaining robust under pure dephasing noise. Non-monotonic signatures of the quantum Fisher information matrix reflect changes in quantum resources such as entanglement and coherence, quantify non-Markovian behavior, and enable criticality-enhanced quantum sensing, thereby shedding light on key features of open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Direct probing of the simulation complexity of open quantum many-body dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19959v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is key to understanding non-equilibrium processes, as persistent influence from the environment induces dissipation and can give rise to steady-state phase transitions. A common strategy is to embed the system-environment into a larger unitary framework, but this obscures the intrinsic complexity of the reduced system dynamics. Here, we investigate the computational complexity of simulating open quantum systems, focusing on two physically relevant parameters -- correlation length and mixing time -- and explore whether it can be comparable (or even lower) to that of simulating their closed counterparts. In particular, we study the role of dissipation in simulating open-system dynamics using both quantum and classical methods, where the classical complexity is characterised by the bond dimension and operator entanglement entropy. Our results show that dissipation affects correlation length and mixing time in distinct ways at intermediate and long timescales. Moreover, we observe numerically that in classical tensor network simulations, classical complexity does not decrease with stronger dissipation, revealing a separation between quantum and classical resource scaling.</description>
