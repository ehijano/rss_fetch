      <title>On the Centralization and Regionalization of the Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, Internet centralization and its implications for both people and the resilience of the Internet has become a topic of active debate. While the networking community informally agrees on the definition of centralization, we lack a formal metric for quantifying centralization, which limits research beyond descriptive analysis. In this work, we introduce a statistical measure for Internet centralization, which we use to better understand how the web is centralized across four layers of web infrastructure (hosting providers, DNS infrastructure, TLDs, and certificate authorities) in 150~countries. Our work uncovers significant geographical variation, as well as a complex interplay between centralization and sociopolitically driven regionalization. We hope that our work can serve as the foundation for more nuanced analysis to inform this important debate.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Uplink Performance Analysis of Satellite-Based IoT Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the deployment of satellite constellations, Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in remote areas have gained access to low-cost network connectivity. In this paper, we investigate the performance of IoT devices connecting in up-link through low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites to geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) links. We model the dynamic LEO satellite constellation using the stochastic geometry method and provide an analysis of end-to-end availability with low-complexity and coverage performance estimates for the mentioned link. Based on the analytical expressions derived in this research, we make a sound investigation on the impact of constellation configuration, transmission power, and the relative positions of IoT devices and GEO satellites on end-to-end performance.</description>

      <title>Prediction based computation offloading and resource allocation for multi-access ISAC enabled IoT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), tasks are now being migrated to edge sites closer to data generators. Mobile devices inherently encounter limitations in terms of energy and computational processing capabilities. In high mobility paradigm, ISAC provides a promising foundation for integrating deployment management within dynamic spatial settings. We are interested in applying prediction mechanism to resource allocation management by extracting data attributes, focusing on ISAC related contexts of the trajectory and velocity and making the allocating decision. We present a system design, a theoretical framework and an implementation of the ClusterMan software package. The numerical suggests that the strong clustering subset of feature may yield high accuracy up to 97\% in the prediction results.</description>

      <title>Koopman based trajectory model and computation offloading for high mobility paradigm in ISAC enabled IoT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User experience on mobile devices is constrained by limited battery capacity and processing power, but 6G technology advancements are diving rapidly into mobile technical evolution. Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers a solution, offloading computationally intensive tasks to edge cloud servers, reducing battery drain compared to local processing. The upcoming integrated sensing and communication in mobile communication may improve the trajectory prediction and processing delays. This study proposes a greedy resource allocation optimization strategy for multi-user networks to minimize aggregate energy usage. Numerical results show potential improvement at 33\% for every 1000 iteration. Addressing prediction model division and velocity accuracy issues is crucial for better results. A plan for further improvement and achieving objectives is outlined for the upcoming work phase.</description>

      <title>Chronicles of jockeying in queuing systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relevance of studies in queuing theory in social systems has inspired its adoption in other mainstream technologies with its application in distributed and communication systems becoming an intense research domain. Considerable work has been done regarding the application of the impatient queuing phenomenon in distributed computing to achieve optimal resource sharing and allocation for performance improvement. Generally, there are two types of common impatient queuing behaviour that have been well studied, namely balking and reneging, respectively. In this survey, we are interested in the third type of impatience: jockeying, a phenomenon that draws origins from impatient customers switching from one queue to another.
  This survey chronicles classical and latest efforts that labor to model and exploit the jockeying behaviour in queuing systems, with a special focus on those related to information and communication systems, especially in the context of Multi-Access Edge Computing. We comparatively summarize the reviewed literature regarding their methodologies, invoked models, and use cases.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Resource Management in Joint Communication and Computing-Embedded SAGIN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of the 6G era aims for ubiquitous connectivity, with the integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTN) offering extensive coverage and enhanced capacity. As manufacturing advances and user demands evolve, space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN) with computational capabilities emerge as a viable solution for services requiring low latency and high computational power. Resource management within joint communication and computing-embedded SAGIN (JCC-SAGIN) presents greater complexity than traditional terrestrial networks. This complexity arises from the spatiotemporal dynamics of network topology and service demand, the interdependency of large-scale resource variables, and intricate tradeoffs among various performance metrics. Thus, a thorough examination of resource management strategies in JCC-SAGIN is crucial, emphasizing the role of non-terrestrial platforms with processing capabilities in 6G. This paper begins by reviewing the architecture, enabling technologies, and applications in JCC-SAGIN. Then, we offer a detailed overview of resource management modeling and optimization methods, encompassing both traditional optimization approaches and learning-based intelligent decision-making frameworks. Finally, we outline the prospective research directions in JCC-SAGIN.</description>

      <title>Optimal Flow Admission Control in Edge Computing via Safe Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the uptake of intelligent data-driven applications, edge computing infrastructures necessitate a new generation of admission control algorithms to maximize system performance under limited and highly heterogeneous resources. In this paper, we study how to optimally select information flows which belong to different classes and dispatch them to multiple edge servers where deployed applications perform flow analytic tasks. The optimal policy is obtained via constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) theory accounting for the demand of each edge application for specific classes of flows, the constraints on computing capacity of edge servers and of the access network.
  We develop DR-CPO, a specialized primal-dual Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) method which solves the resulting optimal admission control problem by reward decomposition. DR-CPO operates optimal decentralized control and mitigates effectively state-space explosion while preserving optimality. Compared to existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions, extensive results show that DR-CPO achieves 15\% higher reward on a wide variety of environments, while requiring on average only 50\% of the amount of learning episodes to converge. Finally, we show how to match DR-CPO and load-balancing to dispatch optimally information streams to available edge servers and further improve system performance.</description>
