      <title>Lifts of maps to frame bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a Riemannian manifold, $L(M)$ be its frame bundle, $O(M)$ its orthonormal frame bundle. For a distribution $D$ on $M$ we define a subbundle $L(D)\subset L(M)$ or $O(D)\subset O(M)$ in a natural way. This allows us to consider a lift $L\varphi$ of a map $\varphi:M\to N$ not necessarily being a local diffeomorphism. More precisely, if $\varphi:M\to N$ is a submersion, then $L\varphi:L(\mathcal{H}^{\varphi})\to L(N)$ or $L\varphi:O(\mathcal{H}^{\varphi})\to L(N)$, where $\mathcal{H}^{\varphi}$ is a horizontal distribution of $\varphi$. Equipping $L(M)$ and $L(N)$ with the Mok metrics, we study conformality and harmonicity of lifts $L\varphi$.</description>

      <title>A note on Huisken monotonicity-type formula for the mean curvature flow in a gradient shrinking extended Ricci soliton background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an application of a Huisken monotonicity-type formula for the mean curvature flow in a compact smooth manifold with a Riemannian metric that evolves by a shrinking self-similar solution of the extended Ricci flow. Our investigation builds on previous articles by Huisken and the third author as we apply their techniques to establish new results in this geometric setting. Moreover, under some natural geometric assumptions, the noncompact case is also resolved</description>

      <title>Schouten like metrics on five dimensional nilpotents Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prescribed Ricci curvature problem consists in finding a Riemannian metric g to satisfy the equation Ric(g) = T, for some fixed symmetric (0, 2)-tensor field T on a differential manifold M. In this paper, we define Schouten like metric as a particular solution of a prescribed Ricci curvature problem and we classify them on five dimensional nilpotent Lie groups by establishing a link with algebraic Schouten solitons. This also permit us to make a classification of five dimensional nilsoliton.</description>

      <title>Wall-chamber decompositions for generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Monge-Amp\`ere equations form a large class of PDE including Donaldson's J-equation, inverse Hessian equations, some supercritical deformed Hermitian-Yang Mills equations, and some Z-critical equations. Solvability of these equations is characterized by numerical criteria involving intersection numbers over all subvarieties, and in this paper, we aim to characterize algebraically what happens when these nonlinear Nakai-Moishezon type criteria fail. As a main result, we show that under mild positivity assumptions, there is a finite number of subvarieties violating the Nakai type criterion, and such subvarieties are moreover rigid in a suitable sense. This gives first effective solvability criteria for these familes of PDE, thus improving on work of Gao Chen, Datar-Pingali, Song and Fang-Ma. As an application, we obtain first examples in higher dimension of polarized compact K\"ahler manifolds exhibiting a natural PDE analog of Bridgeland's locally finite wall-chamber decomposition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear potenrial theory and Ricci-pinched 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M, g)$ be a complete, connected, noncompact Riemannian $3$-manifold. In this short note, we give an alternative proof, based on the nonlinear potential theory, of the fact that if $(M,g)$ satisfies the Ricci-pinching condition and superquadratic volume growth, then it is flat. This result is one of the building blocks of the proof of Hamilton's pinching conjecture.</description>

      <title>Rigidity and regularity for almost homogeneous spaces with Ricci curvature bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that a metric space $X$ is $(\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous if $G&lt;Iso(X)$ is a discrete group of isometries with $diam(X/G)&lt;\epsilon$.\ A sequence of $(\epsilon_i,G_i)$-homogeneous spaces $X_i$ with $\epsilon_i\to0$ is called a sequence of almost homogeneous spaces.
  In this paper we show that the Gromov-Hausdorff limit of a sequence of almost homogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ spaces must be a nilpotent Lie group with $Ric\geqslant K$. We also obtain a topological rigidity theorem for $(\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ spaces, which generalizes a recent result by Wang. Indeed, if $X$ is an $(\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous RCD$(K,N)$ space and $G$ is an almost-crystallographic group, then $X/G$ is bi-H\"older to an infranil orbifold. Moreover, we study $(\epsilon,G)$-homogeneous spaces in the smooth setting and prove rigidity and $\epsilon$-regularity theorems for Riemannian orbifolds with Einstein metrics and bounded Ricci curvatures respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the curved geometries modelled on the homogeneous space $G/P$, where $G=SL(6,\mathbb R)$ acts transitively on the Grassmannian $Gr(3,3)$ of three-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb R^6$, and $P$ is the corresponding isotropic subgroup. We classify the strongly invariant operators between sections of vector bundles induced on such geometries by irreducible $P$-modules, i.e., those obtained via homomorphisms of semi-holonomic Verma modules.</description>

      <title>On the Gauss Map of Anisotropic Minimal Surfaces and applications to the Morse Index estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we study the Gauss map of a completely immersed anisotropic minimal surface with respect to convex parametric integrand in $\mathbb{R}^3$. By a local analysis, we prove the discreteness of the critical set of the Gauss map of an anisotropic minimal surface. In particular, we may consider the Gauss map as a branched covering map from an anisotropic minimal surface to the unit sphere. As a consequence, we may obtain an upper and a lower estimate for the Morse index of an anisotropic minimal surface by applying some conformal geometric technics to the Gauss map.</description>

      <title>Deformations of ideals in Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the deformation theory of Lie ideals. It shows that the smooth deformations of an ideal $\mathfrak i$ in a Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ differentiate to cohomology classes in the cohomology of $\mathfrak g$ with values in its adjoint representation on $\operatorname{Hom}(\mathfrak i, \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i)$. The cohomology associated with the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in $\mathfrak g$ is compared with other Lie algebra cohomologies defined by $\mathfrak i$, such as the cohomology defined by $\mathfrak i$ as a Lie subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$ (Richardson, 1969), and the cohomology defined by the Lie algebra morphism $\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak g/\mathfrak i$.
  After a choice of complement of the ideal $\mathfrak i$ in the Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$, its deformation complex is enriched to the differential graded Lie algebra that controls its deformations, in the sense that its Maurer-Cartan elements are in one-to-one correspondence with the (small) deformations of the ideal. Furthermore, the $L_{\infty}$-algebra that simultaneously controls the deformations of $\mathfrak{i}$ and of the ambient Lie bracket is identified.
  Under appropriate assumptions on the low degrees of the deformation cohomology of a given Lie ideal, the (topological) rigidity and stability of ideals are studied, as well as obstructions to deformations of ideals of Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Splitting theorems for weighted Finsler spacetimes via the $p$-d'Alembertian: beyond the Berwald case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A timelike splitting theorem for Finsler spacetimes was previously established by the third author, in collaboration with Lu and Minguzzi, under relatively strong hypotheses, including the Berwald condition. This contrasts with the more general results known for positive definite Finsler manifolds. In this article, we employ a recently developed strategy for proving timelike splitting theorems using the elliptic $p$-d'Alembertian. This approach, pioneered by Braun, Gigli, McCann, S\"amann, and the second author, allows us to remove the restrictive assumptions of the earlier splitting theorem. For timelike geodesically complete Finsler spacetimes, we establish a diffeomorphic splitting. In the specific case of Berwald spacetimes, we show that the Busemann function generates a group of isometries via translations. Furthermore, for Berwald spacetimes, we extend these splitting theorems by replacing the assumption of timelike geodesic completeness with global hyperbolicity. Our results encompass and generalize the timelike splitting theorems for weighted Lorentzian manifolds previously obtained by Case and Woolgar-Wylie.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focus on the properties and characterizations of harmonic RCD$(K,N)$ spaces, which are the counterparts of harmonic Riemannian manifolds in the non-smooth setting. We prove that a compact RCD$(K,N)$ space is isometric to a locally harmonic Riemannian manifold if it satisfies either of the following harmonicity conditions: (1) the heat kernel $\rho(x,y,t)$ depends only on the variable $t$ and the distance between points $x$ and $y$; (2) the volume of the intersection of two geodesic balls depends only on their radii and the distance between their centers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze oriented Riemannian 4-manifolds whose Weyl tensors $W$ satisfy the conformally invariant condition $W(T,\cdot,\cdot,T) = 0$ for some nonzero vector $T$. While this can be algebraically classified via $W$'s normal form, we find a further geometric classification by deforming the metric into a Lorentzian one via $T$. We show that such a $W$ will have the analogue of Petrov Types from general relativity, that only Types I and D can occur, and that each is completely determined by the number of critical points of $W$'s associated Lorentzian quadratic form. A similar result holds for the Lorentzian version of this question, with $T$ timelike.</description>

      <title>Parabolic gap theorems for the Yang-Mills energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove parabolic versions of several known gap theorems in classical Yang-Mills theory. On an $\mathrm{SU}(r)$-bundle of charge $\kappa$ over the 4-sphere, we show that the space of all connections with Yang-Mills energy less than $4 \pi^2 \left( |\kappa| + 2 \right)$ deformation-retracts under Yang-Mills flow onto the space of instantons, allowing us to simplify the proof of Taubes's path-connectedness theorem. On a compact quaternion-K\"ahler manifold with positive scalar curvature, we prove that the space of pseudo-holomorphic connections whose $\mathfrak{sp}(1)$ curvature component has small Morrey norm deformation-retracts under Yang-Mills flow onto the space of instantons. On a nontrivial bundle over a compact manifold of general dimension, we prove that the infimum of the scale-invariant Morrey norm of curvature is positive.</description>

      <title>The minimal Lie groupoid and infinity algebroid of the singular octonionic Hopf foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous singular leaf decomposition $\mathcal{L}_{OH}$ of $\mathbb{R}^{16}\cong \mathbb{O}^2$ induced by the Hopf construction for octonions $\mathbb{O}$ has no known Lie group action generating it. In this article we construct a $\mathrm{G}_2$-equivariant Lie groupoid $\mathcal{G} \Rightarrow \mathbb{O}^{2}$ whose orbits coincide with $\mathcal{L}_{OH}$. Its Lie algebroid $E=\mathrm{Lie}(\mathcal{G})$ is of the form $\mathbb{O}^4 \to \mathbb{O}^2$ with polynomial structure functions. Its sheaf of sections induces a singular foliation $\mathcal{F}_{OH} := \rho(\Gamma(E))$ on $\mathbb{O}^{2}$, which we call the singular octonionic Hopf foliation (SOHF). $\mathcal{F}_{OH}$ is shown to be maximal among all singular foliations $\mathcal{F}$ generating $\mathcal{L}_{OH}$ -- in the polynomial, the real analytic, as well as in the smooth setting.
  We extend $E$ to a Lie $3$-algebroid, which is a minimal length representative of the universal Lie $\infty-$algebroid of the SOHF. This permits to prove that $E$ is the minimal rank Lie algebroid and that $\mathcal{G}$ the lowest dimensional Lie groupoid which generate the SOHF.
  The leaf decomposition $\mathcal{L}_{OH}$ is one of the few known examples of a singular Riemannian foliation in the sense of Molino which cannot be generated by local isometries (local non-homogeneity). We improve this result by showing that any smooth singular foliation $\mathcal{F}$ inducing $\mathcal{L}_{OH}$ cannot be even Hausdorff Morita equivalent to a singular foliation $\mathcal{F}_M$ on a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ generated by local isometries. Furthermore, we show that there is no real analytic singular foliation $\mathcal{F}$ generating $\mathcal{L}_{OH}$ which turns $(\mathbb{R}^{16}, g_{st}, \mathcal{F})$ into a module singular Riemannian foliation as defined in \cite{NS24}.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the Laplacian on the Page metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically construct the spectrum of the Laplacian on Page's inhomogeneous Einstein metric on $\mathbb{CP}^2 \# \overline{\mathbb{CP}}^2$ by reducing the problem to a (singular) Sturm-Liouville problem in one dimension. We perform a perturbative analysis based upon a closely related, exactly solvable problem that strongly supports our results. We also study the spectrum of the Lichnerowicz Laplacian on symmetric traceless transverse two-tensors. The method relies on both the isometries of the Page metric and pseudospectral methods to numerically solve the resulting ODEs.</description>

      <title>Topological Gauge Theories with Sixteen Supercharges: Higher $A_\infty$-categorification of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We will show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], we will furnish purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3] and Doan-Rezchikov [4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Koszul-Vinberg manifold is a generalization of a Hessian manifold, and their relation is similar to the relation between Poisson manifolds and symplectic manifolds. Koszul-Vinberg structures and Poisson structures on manifolds extend to the structures on algebroids. A Koszul-Vinberg structure on a left-symmetric algebroid is regarded as a symmetric analogue of a Poisson structure on a Lie algebroid. We define a Jacobi-Koszul-Vinberg structure on a Jacobi-left-symmetric algebroid as a symmetric analogue of a Jacobi structure on a Jacobi algebroid. We show some properties of Jacobi-Koszul-Vinberg structures on Jacobi algebroids and give the definition of a Jacobi-Koszul-Vinberg manifold, which is a symmetric analogue of a Jacobi manifold.</description>

      <title>A canonical foliation on null infinity in perturbations of Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kerr stability for small angular momentum has been proved in the series of works by Klainerman-Szeftel, Giorgi-Klainerman-Szeftel and Shen. Some of the most basic conclusions of the result, concerning various physical quantities on the future null infinity are derived in the work of Klainerman-Szeftel. Further important conclusions were later derived in An-He-Shen and Chen-Klainerman. In this paper, based on the existence and uniqueness results for GCM spheres by Klainerman-Szeftel, we establish the existence of a canonical foliation on the future null infinity for which the null energy, linear momentum, center of mass and angular momentum are well defined and satisfy the expected physical laws of gravitational radiation. The rigid character of this foliation eliminates the usual ambiguities related to these quantities in the physics literature. We also show that under the initial assumption of Klainerman-Szeftel, the center of mass of the black hole has a large deformation (recoil) after the perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is a record of the lecture at the centennial conference for Harish-Chandra. The admissibility theorem of Harish-Chandra concerns the restrictions of irreducible representations to maximal compact subgroups. In this article, we begin with a brief explanation of two directions for generalizing his pioneering work to {\it{non-compact}} reductive subgroups: one emphasizes discrete decomposability with the finite multiplicity property, while the other focuses on finite/uniformly bounded multiplicity properties. We discuss how the recent representation-theoretic developments in these directions collectively offer a powerful method for the new spectral analysis of standard locally symmetric spaces, extending beyond the classical Riemannian setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regular contact manifolds $(M,\eta)$ whose Reeb vector field is complete and prove that they are canonically principal bundles with the structure group $S^1$ or $\mathbb{R}$. For compact $M$, our proof is very short and elementary and covers the celebrated Boothby-Wang theorem, but we do not assume compactness from the very beginning. However, to prove our result in full generality we use some topological tools adapted to smooth fibrations. In the second part of the paper, we describe a natural concept of contact products of general contact manifolds as well as a product of principal contact manifolds, which exists if the periods of the Reeb vector fields are commensurate, and corresponds to the construction of products of prequantization bundles of symplectic manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the hot spots conjecture on Riemannian manifolds with isothermal coordinates and analytic metrics, such as hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{D}^n$ and spheres $S^n$ for $n\geq 2$. We prove that for some (possibly non-convex) Lipschitz domains in such a Riemannian manifold, which are generalizations of lip domains and symmetric domains with two axes of symmetry in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the hot spot conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Contact instantons and Proofs of Weinstein's conjecture and Arnold's chord conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper is a continuation of the study of the interplay between the contact Hamiltonian dynamics and the moduli theory of (perturbed) contact instantons and its applications initiated in [Oh21b, Oh22a]. In this paper we prove Weinstein's conjecture and Arnold's chord conjecture in their full generalities. The two key ingredients lying in the background of our proof of Arnold's chord conjecture are the existence of the fundamental class of the Legendrian contact instanton cohomology modulo bubbling-off, and the evaluation transversality of the moduli space of contact instantons against the level set of conformal exponent function. Our proof of Weinstein's conjecture also utilizes the existence scheme of translated points of a contactomorphism developed in [Oh22a], especially associated to a contact Hamiltonian loop, via the geometric construction of the Legendrianization of contactomorphisms of $(Q,\lambda)$ in the contact product $M_Q = Q \times Q \times \mathbb R$ and its usage of the $\mathbb Z_2$ anti-contact involutive symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum mechanical systems of spin chain type, with finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and $\mathcal{N}=2$ or $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetry, described in $\mathcal{N}=2$ superspace in terms of nonlinear chiral multiplets. We prove that they are natural truncations of 1D sigma models, whose target spaces are $\mathsf{SU}(n)$ (co)adjoint orbits. As a first application, we compute the Witten indices of these finite-dimensional models showing that they reproduce the Dolbeault and de Rham indices of the target space. The problem of finding the exact spectra of generalized Laplace operators on such orbits is shown to be equivalent to the diagonalization of spin chain Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to obtain estimates for nonnegative solutions of the differential inequality $$\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t} - \Delta\right) u \leq A u^p + B u $$ with small initial data in borderline Morrey norms over a Riemannian manifold with bounded geometry. We obtain $L^\infty$ estimates assuming $$\|u(\cdot,0)\|_{M^{q, \frac{2q}{p-1}}} + \sup_{0 \leq t &lt; T} \|u(\cdot, t) \|_{L^s} &lt; \delta,$$ where $1 &lt; q \leq q_c := \frac{n(p-1)}{2}$ and $1 \leq s \leq q_c$. Assuming also a bound on $\|u(\cdot, 0)\|_{M^{q', \lambda'}}$, where either $q' &gt; q$ or $\lambda' &lt; \frac{2q}{p-1}$, we get an improved estimate near the initial time. These results have applications to geometric flows in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We complete the classification of all smooth 4-dimensional Kahler geometries admitting a twistor (conformal Killing-Yano) 2-form invariant under a 2-torus action. We establish that there are six geometrically distinct families, and we provide them in a simple form amenable to calculations and compute their curvature. We also find that for toric geometries the square norm of the twistor 2-form is quadratic in moment maps, and we are led to conjecture that this holds when less symmetry is present.</description>

Abstract: The Colding-Gromov gap theorem asserts that an almost non-negatively Ricci curved manifold with unit diameter and maximal first Betti number is homeomorphic to the flat torus. In this paper, we prove a parametrized version of this theorem, in the context of collapsing Riemannian manifolds with Ricci curvature bounded below: if a closed manifold with Ricci curvature uniformly bounded below is Gromov-Hausdorff close to a (lower dimensional) manifold with bounded geometry, and has the difference of their first Betti numbers equal to the dimensional difference, then it is diffeomorphic to a torus bundle over the one with bounded geometry. We rely on two novel technical tools: the first is an effective control of the spreading of minimal geodesics with initial data parallel transported along a short geodesic segment, and the second is a Ricci flow smoothing result for certain collapsing initial data with Ricci curvature bounded below.</description>

      <title>A Sharp Li-Yau gradient bound on Compact Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.08933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\M^n, g)$ be a $n$ dimensional, complete ( compact or noncompact) Riemannian manifold whose Ricci curvature is bounded from below by a constant $-K \le 0$. Let $u$ be a positive solution of the heat equation on $\M^n \times (0, \infty)$. The well known Li-Yau gradient bound states that $$ t \left(\frac{|\nabla u|^2}{u^2} - \alpha\frac{\pa_t u}{u}\right) \leq \frac{n\alpha^2}{2} + t \frac{n\alpha^2K}{2(\alpha-1)},\quad \forall \alpha&gt;1, t&gt;0. $$ The bound with $\alpha =1$ is sharp if $K=0$. If $-K &lt; 0$, the bound tends to infinity if $\alpha=1$. In over 30 years, several sharpening of the bounds have been obtained with $\alpha$ replaced by several functions $\alpha=\alpha(t)&gt;1$ but not equal to $1$. An open question (\cite{CLN}, \citeLX} etc) asks if a sharp bound can be reached. In this short note, we observe that for all complete compact manifolds one can take $\alpha=1$. Thus a sharp bound, up to computable constants, is found in the compact case. This result also seems to sharpen Theorem 1.4 in \cite{LY} for compact manifolds with convex boundaries. In the noncompact case one can not take $\alpha=1$ even for the hyperbolic space. An example is also given, which shows that there does not exist an optimal function of time only $\alpha=\alpha(t)$ for all noncompact manifolds with Ricci lower bound, giving a negative answer to the open question in the noncompact case.</description>

      <title>Singular Riemannian foliations and $\mathcal{I}$-Poisson manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recall the notion of a singular foliation (SF) on a manifold $M$, viewed as an appropriate submodule of $\mathfrak{X}(M)$, and adapt it to the presence of a Riemannian metric $g$, yielding a module version of a singular Riemannian foliation (SRF). Following Garmendia-Zambon on Hausdorff Morita equivalence of SFs, we define the Morita equivalence of SRFs (both in the module sense as well as in the more traditional geometric one of Molino) and show that the leaf spaces of Morita equivalent SRFs are isomrophic as pseudo-metric spaces.
  In a second part, we introduce the category of $\mathcal{I}$-Poisson manifolds. Its objects and morphisms generalize Poisson manifolds and morphisms in the presence of appropriate ideals $\mathcal{I}$ of the smooth functions on the manifold such that two conditions are satisfied: $(i)$ The category of Poisson manifolds becomes a full subcategory when choosing $\mathcal{I}=0$ and $(ii)$ there is a reduction functor from this new category to the category of Poisson algebras, which generalizes coistropic reduction to the singular setting.
  Every SF on $M$ gives rise to an $\mathcal{I}$-Poisson manifold on $T^*M$ and $g$ enhances this to an SRF if and only if the induced Hamiltonian lies in the normalizer of $\mathcal{I}$. This perspective provides, on the one hand, a simple proof of the fact that every module SRF is a geometric SRF and, on the other hand, a construction of an algebraic invariant of singular foliations: Hausdorff Morita equivalent SFs have isomorphic reduced Poisson algebras.</description>

      <title>Plateau Bubbles and the Quintuple Bubble Theorem on $\mathbb{S}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08164v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sullivan's multi-bubble isoperimetric conjectures in $n$-dimensional Euclidean and spherical spaces assert that standard bubbles uniquely minimize total perimeter among all $q-1$ bubbles enclosing prescribed volume, for any $q \leq n+2$. The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^3$ was confirmed by Hutchings-Morgan-Ritor\'e-Ros (and later extended to $\mathbb{R}^n$). The double-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^n$ ($n \geq 2$) and the triple- and quadruple- bubble conjectures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{S}^n$ (for $n \geq 3$ and $n \geq 4$, respectively) were recently confirmed in our previous work, but the approach employed there does not seem to allow extending these results further.
  In this work, we confirm the quintuple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{S}^n$ ($n \geq 5$), and as a consequence, by approximation, also the quintuple-bubble conjecture on $\mathbb{R}^n$ ($n \geq 5$) but without the uniqueness assertion. Moreover, we resolve the conjectures on $\mathbb{S}^n$ and on $\mathbb{R}^n$ (without uniqueness) for all $q \leq n+1$, conditioned on the assumption that the singularities which appear at the meeting locus of several bubbles obey a higher-dimensional analogue of Plateau's laws. Another scenario we can deal with is when the bubbles are full-dimensional ("in general position"), or arrange in some good lower-dimensional configurations.
  To this end, we develop the spectral theory of the corresponding Jacobi operator (finding analogies with the quantum-graph formalism), and a new method for deforming the bubbles into a favorable configuration. As a by-product, we show that the Jacobi operator on a minimizing configuration always has index precisely $q-1$ and hence the corresponding isoperimetric profile is concave, answering a question of Heppes. Several compelling conjectures are proposed, which would allow extending our results to all $q \leq n+1$ unconditionally.</description>

      <title>Partial Groupoid Actions on Smooth Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth partial action $\alpha$ of a Lie groupoid $G$ on a smooth manifold $M,$ we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $\alpha$ to be globalizable with smooth globalization. As an application, we provide results on the differentiable structure of orbit and stabilizer spaces induced by $\alpha,$ which leads to other criteria for its globalization in terms of its orbit maps in the case that $\alpha$ is free and transitive. Further, under the assumption that $\alpha$ is free and proper, we prove that there exists exactly one differentiable structure on the quotient structure of the orbit equivalence space $M/G$ such that the quotient map $\pi:M\to M/G$ is a submersion</description>

      <title>Anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces in a wedge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic capillary hypersurfaces within a wedge in Euclidean space. In this study, we generalize the Minkowski norm \(F\), traditionally employed to define the anisotropic surface energy, to a gauge on the unit sphere \(S^n\). This generalization helps to illuminate a significant relationship between capillary hypersurfaces and hypersurfaces with free boundary. Our main results include new Minkowski formulae and a Heintze-Karcher type inequality. As an application, we prove an Alexandrov-type theorem, thereby extending the known results to the anisotropic setting.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity free covering of a graded manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study a multiplicity-free covering of a graded manifold. We compute its deck transformation group, which is isomorphic to the permutation group $S_n$. We show that it is not possible to construct a covering of a graded manifold in the category of $n$-fold vector bundles. As an application of our research, we give a new conceptual proof of the equivalence of the categories of graded manifolds and symmetric $n$-fold vector bundles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we classify totally geodesic submanifolds of homogeneous nearly K\"ahler 6-manifolds, and of the G2-cones over these 6-manifolds. To this end, we develop new techniques for the study of totally geodesic submanifolds of analytic Riemannian manifolds, naturally reductive homogeneous spaces, and Riemannian cones. In particular, we obtain an example of a totally geodesic submanifold with self-intersections in a simply connected homogeneous space.</description>

Abstract: We prove that there is no nontrivial $L^2$-integrable harmonic 1-form on noncompact complete gradient steady Ricci solitons or noncompact complete gradient shrinking K\"{a}hler-Ricci solitons. As an application, it can be used to distinguish certain flat vector bundles that arise from fundamental group representations into $SL(r,\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the language of proper CAT(-1) spaces to study thick, locally compact trees, the real, complex and quaternionic hyperbolic spaces and the hyperbolic plane over the octonions. These are rank 1 Euclidean buildings, respectively rank 1 symmetric spaces of non-compact type. We give a uniform proof that these spaces may be reconstructed using the cross ratio on their visual boundary, bringing together the work of Tits and Bourdon.</description>
