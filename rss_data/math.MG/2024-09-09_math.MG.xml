      <title>Minimal displacement set for weakly systolic complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of the minimal displacement set in weakly systolic complexes. We show that such set is systolic and that it embeds isometrically into the complex. As corollaries, we prove that any isometry of a weakly systolic complex either fixes the barycentre of some simplex (elliptic case) or it stabilizes a thick geodesic (hyperbolic case).</description>

      <title>Principal frequency of clamped plates on RCD(0,N) spaces: sharpness, rigidity and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fine properties of the principal frequency of clamped plates in the (possibly singular) setting of metric measure spaces verifying the RCD(0,N) condition, i.e., infinitesimally Hilbertian spaces with non-negative Ricci curvature and dimension bounded above by N&gt;1 in the synthetic sense. The initial conjecture -- an isoperimetric inequality for the principal frequency of clamped plates -- has been formulated in 1877 by Lord Rayleigh in the Euclidean case and solved affirmatively in dimensions 2 and 3 by Ashbaugh and Benguria [Duke Math. J., 1995] and Nadirashvili [Arch. Rat. Mech. Anal., 1995]. The main contribution of the present work is a new isoperimetric inequality for the principal frequency of clamped plates in RCD(0,N) spaces whenever N is close enough to 2 or 3. The inequality contains the so-called ``asymptotic volume ratio", and turns out to be sharp under the subharmonicity of the distance function, a condition satisfied in metric measure cones. In addition, rigidity (i.e., equality in the isoperimetric inequality) and stability results are established in terms of the cone structure of the RCD(0,N) space as well as the shape of the eigenfunction for the principal frequency, given by means of Bessel functions. These results are new even for Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. We discuss examples of both smooth and non-smooth spaces where the results can be applied.</description>

      <title>Approximating Metric Magnitude of Point Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric magnitude is a measure of the "size" of point clouds with many desirable geometric properties. It has been adapted to various mathematical contexts and recent work suggests that it can enhance machine learning and optimization algorithms. But its usability is limited due to the computational cost when the dataset is large or when the computation must be carried out repeatedly (e.g. in model training). In this paper, we study the magnitude computation problem, and show efficient ways of approximating it. We show that it can be cast as a convex optimization problem, but not as a submodular optimization. The paper describes two new algorithms - an iterative approximation algorithm that converges fast and is accurate, and a subset selection method that makes the computation even faster. It has been previously proposed that magnitude of model sequences generated during stochastic gradient descent is correlated to generalization gap. Extension of this result using our more scalable algorithms shows that longer sequences in fact bear higher correlations. We also describe new applications of magnitude in machine learning - as an effective regularizer for neural network training, and as a novel clustering criterion.</description>

      <title>On $m$-point homogeneous polyhedra in $3$-dimensional Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the $m$-point homogeneity property for the vertex sets of polytopes in Euclidean spaces. In particular, we present the classifications of $2$-point and $3$-point homogeneous polyhedra in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>On the $m$th-order Affine P\'olya-Szeg\"o Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An affine P\'olya-Szeg\"o principle for a family of affine energies, with equality condition characterization, is demonstrated. In particular, this recovers, as special cases, the $L^p$ affine P\'olya-Szeg\"o principles due to Cianchi, Lutwak, Yang and Zhang, and subsequently Haberl, Schuster and Xiao. Various applications of this new P\'olya-Szeg\"o principle are shown.</description>
