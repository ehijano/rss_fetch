      <title>Asymptotic models for the evolution of a circular biofilm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of lubrication-type equations modeling the spread of thin poroelastic biofilms at air/agar interfaces. Starting from a biofilm slab model, we perform a formal multi-scale asymptotic expansion to derive a reduced nonlinear evolution equation with time-dependent coefficients. First, we establish a local-in-time existence result as well as a continuation criteria. Moreover, under suitable assumptions on the radius of the biofilm, we show the existence of global in time solutions. We conclude with some numerical simulations illustrating the emergence of instabilities and potential singularities in finite time.</description>

      <title>The bidirectional NLS approximation for the one-dimensional Euler-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation is known as a universal equation describing the evolution of the envelopes of slowly modulated spatially and temporarily oscillating wave packet in various dispersive systems. In this paper, we prove that under a certain multiple scale transformation, solutions to the Euler-Poisson system can be approximated by the sums of two counter-propagating waves solving the NLS equations. It extends the earlier results [Liu and Pu, Comm. Math. Phys., 371(2), (2019)357-398], which justify the unidirectional NLS approximation to the Euler-Poisson system for the ion-coustic wave. We demonstrate that the solutions could be convergent to two counter-propagating wave packets, where each wave packet involves independently as a solution of the NLS equation. We rigorously prove the validity of the NLS approximation for the one-dimensional Euler-Poisson system by obtaining uniform error estimates in Sobolev spaces. The NLS dynamics can be observed at a physically relevant timespan of order $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$. As far as we know, this result is the first construction and valid proof of the bidirectional NLS approximation.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows of Interfacial Energies: Curvature Agents and Incompressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for the gradient flow of sharp-interface surface energies that couple to embedded curvature active agents. We use a penalty method to develop families of locally incompressible gradient flows that couple interface stretching or compression to local flux of interfacial mass. We establish the convergence of the penalty method to an incompressible flow both formally for a broad family of surface energies and rigorously for a more narrow class of surface energies. We present an analysis, including a $\Gamma$-limit, of an Allen-Cahn type model for a coupled surface agent curvature energy.</description>

      <title>On the exponential convergence to equilibrium for ultrafast diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple proof of the exponential convergence to equilibrium for ultrafast diffusion equations in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Our approach, based on the direct use of Poincar\'e inequality, gets rid of the optimal transport arguments used in \cite{fathi2025} which are valid for Gaussian-excluded one-dimensional weights. This simplification allows us to extend their results to Gaussian measures in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Existence and stability of the Riemann solutions for a non-symmetric Keyfitz--Kranzer type model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07391v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a new hyperbolic model governing the first-order dynamics of a thin film flow under the influence of gravity and solute transport. The obtained system turns out to be a non-symmetric Keyfitz-Kranzer type system. We find an entire class of convex entropies in the regions where the system remains strictly hyperbolic. By including delta shocks, we prove the existence of unique solutions of the Riemann problem. We analyze their stability with respect to the perturbation of the initial data and to the gravity and surface tension parameters. Moreover, we discuss the large time behaviour of the solutions of the perturbed Riemann problem and prove that the initial Riemann states govern it. Thus, we confirm the structural stability of the Riemann solutions under the perturbation of initial data. Finally, we validate our analytical results with well-established numerical schemes for this new system of conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Blow-up for a Nonlocal Diffusion Equation with Time Regularly Varying Nonlinearity and Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Cauchy problem for a semilinear parabolic equation driven by a mixed local-nonlocal diffusion operator of the form \[ \partial_t u - (\Delta - (-\Delta)^{\mathsf{s}})u = \mathsf{h}(t)|x|^{-b}|u|^p + t^\varrho \mathbf{w}(x), \qquad (x,t)\in \mathbb{R}^N\times (0,\infty), \] where $\mathsf{s}\in (0,1)$, $p&gt;1$, $b\geq 0$, and $\varrho&gt;-1$. The function $\mathsf{h}(t)$ is assumed to belong to the generalized class of regularly varying functions, while $\mathbf{w}$ is a prescribed spatial source. We first revisit the unforced case and establish sharp blow-up and global existence criteria in terms of the critical Fujita exponent, thereby extending earlier results to the wider class of time-dependent coefficients. For the forced problem, we derive nonexistence of global weak solutions under suitable growth conditions on $\mathsf{h}$ and integrability assumptions on $\mathbf{w}$. Furthermore, we provide sufficient smallness conditions on the initial data and the forcing term ensuring global-in-time mild solutions. Our analysis combines semigroup estimates for the mixed operator, test function methods, and asymptotic properties of regularly varying functions. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing blow-up phenomena for nonlinear diffusion equations with such a class of time-dependent coefficients.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Harnack inequalities for nonlocal double phase equations I ; with positive bounded modulating coefficient with no H\"older condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by applying the De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory we prove nonlocal Harnack inequalities for (locally nonnegative in $\Omega$) weak solutions to nolocal double phase equations \begin{equation*}\begin{cases}\cL u =0 &amp; \text{ in $\Omega$,} \\ u=g &amp; \text{ in $\BR^n\s\Omega$ } \end{cases}\end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset\BR^n$ ($n\ge 2$) is a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary, $\cL$ is the nonlocal double phase operator $\cL$ given by \begin{equation*}\begin{split}\cL u(x)=&amp;\pv\int_{\BR^n}|u(x)-u(y)|^{p-2}(u(x)-u(y))K_{ps}(x,y)\,dy \\ &amp;+\pv\int_{\BR^n}\fa(x,y)|u(x)-u(y)|^{q-2}(u(x)-u(y))K_{qt}(x,y)\,dy, \end{split} \end{equation*} $0&lt;\fa(x,y) = \fa(y,x) \le \|\fa\|_{L^\iy(\BR^n\times\BR^n)} &lt; \iy$ and $ps\ge qt$ for $0&lt;s,t&lt;1&lt;p\le q&lt;\iy$. In addition, we get local boundedness with explicit formula and weak Harnack inequalities for their weak supersolutions.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Biological Models Through Turing Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turing patterns play a fundamental role in morphogenesis and population dynamics, encoding key information about the underlying biological mechanisms. Yet, traditional inverse problems have largely relied on non-biological data such as boundary measurements, neglecting the rich information embedded in the patterns themselves. Here we introduce a new research direction that directly leverages physical observables from nature--the amplitude of Turing patterns--to achieve complete parameter identification. We present a framework that uses the spatial amplitude profile of a single pattern to simultaneously recover all system parameters, including wavelength, diffusion constants, and the full nonlinear forms of chemotactic and kinetic coefficient functions. Demonstrated on models of chemotactic bacteria, this amplitude-based approach establishes a biologically grounded, mathematically rigorous paradigm for reverse-engineering pattern formation mechanisms across diverse biological systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of families $(u_\alpha)_{\alpha&gt;0}$ of solutions to the high-order critical equation $P_\alpha u_\alpha=\Delta_g^k u_\alpha +\hbox{lot}=|u_\alpha|^{2^\star-2}u_\alpha$ on a Riemannian manifold $M$, with a uniform bound on the Dirichlet energy. We prove a sharp pointwise control of the $u_\alpha$'s by a sum of bubbles uniformly with respect to $\alpha\to +\infty$, that is $|u_\alpha|\leq C\Vert u_\infty \Vert_\infty +C\sum_{i=1}^NB_{i,\alpha}$ where $u_\infty \in C^{2k}(M)$ and the $(B_{i,\alpha})_\alpha$, $i=1,...,N$ are explicit standard peaks.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev logarithmic inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new logarithmic Sobolev inequalities in the fractional Sobolev setting. Our approach relies on a interpolation inequality, which can be viewed as a fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequality without weights. We further relate the optimal constant in this interpolation inequality to a corresponding variational problem. These results extend classical logarithmic Sobolev inequalities to the nonlocal framework and provide new tools for analysis in fractional Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>A multi-point maximum principle to prove global Harnack inequalities for Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a new methodology to prove global parabolic Harnack inequalities on Riemannian manifolds. We focus on presenting a new proof of the global pointwise Harnack inequality satisfied by positive solutions of the linear Schr\"odinger equation on a Riemannian manifold $M$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature, where the potential term $V$ is bounded from below. Our approach is based on a multi-point maximum principle argument. Standard proofs of this result (see, for instance, Li-Yau [Acta Math, 1986]) rely on first establishing a gradient estimate. This requires the solution to be at least $C^4$ on $M$. We instead prove the Harnack inequality directly, which has the advantage of avoiding higher-order derivatives of the solution in the proof, enabling us to assume it is only $C^2$ on $M$. In the particular case that $V$ is the quadratic potential $V(x)=|x|^2$ and $M$ is the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we prove a new Harnack inequality with sharper constants. Finally, we treat positive solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation with a gradient drift term, including applications to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator $\Delta - x\cdot \nabla$ with quadratic potential in $\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the fractional Kirchhoff-Choquard system given by
  $$ \left\{ \begin{array}{lr} (a+b\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|(-\Delta)^{\frac{s}{2}} u|^2\;dx)(-\Delta)^su=\lambda_1u+(I_{\mu}*|v|^{{2^*_{\mu,s}}})|u|^{{2^*_{\mu,s}}-2}u +\alpha p (I_{\mu}*|v|^{q})|u|^{p-2}u \;\text{in}\;\mathbb{R}^N,\\ (a+b\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|(-\Delta)^{\frac{s}{2}} v|^2\;dx)(-\Delta)^sv=\lambda_2v+ (I_{\mu}*|u|^{{2^*_{\mu,s}}})|v|^{{2^*_{\mu,s}}-2}u +\alpha q(I_{\mu}*|u|^{p})|v|^{q-2}v \;\;\text{in}\;\mathbb{R}^N,\\ \int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|u|^2=d_1^2,\;\;\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}|v|^2=d_2^2. \end{array} \right. $$
  where $N&gt; 2s$, $s \in (0,1)$, $\mu \in (0, N)$, $\alpha \in\mathbb{R}$. Here, $I_{\mu}:\mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$ denotes the Riesz potential. We denote by $2_{\mu,*}:=\frac{2N-\mu}{N}$ and $\frac{2N-\mu}{N-2s}:={2^*_{\mu,s}}$, the lower and upper Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev critical exponents, repectively, and assume that $2_{\mu,*} &lt; p,q&lt; {2^*_{\mu,s}}$. Our primary focus is on the existence of normalized solutions for the case $\alpha&gt;0$ in two scenarios: the $L^2$ subcritical case characterized by $22_{\mu,*}&lt;p + q &lt; 4 + \frac{4s-2\mu}{N}$ and $L^2$ supercritical associated with $4+\frac{8s-2\mu}{N}&lt; p + q &lt; 2{2^*_{\mu,s}}$.</description>

      <title>A gradient estimate for the linearized translator equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop some analytic foundations for the linearized translator equation in $\mathbb{R}^4$, i.e. in the first dimension where the Bernstein property fails. This equation governs how the (noncompact) singularity models of the mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{R}^4$ fit together in a common moduli space. Here, we prove a gradient estimate, which gives a sharp bound for $W_v$, namely for the derivative of the variation field $W$ in the tip region. This serves as a substitute for the fundamental quadratic concavity estimate from Angenent-Daskalopoulos-Sesum, which has been crucial for controlling $Y_v$, namely the derivative of the profile function $Y$ in the tip region. Moreover, together with interior estimates by virtue of the linearized translator equation our gradient estimate implies a bound for $W_\tau$ as well. Hence, our gradient estimate also serves as substitute Hamilton's Harnack inequality, which has played an important role for controlling $Y_\tau$ in the tip region.</description>

      <title>Non-homogeneous Schrodinger systems with sign-changing and general nonlinearities: Infinitely many solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the non-homogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger system $$\left\{ \begin{array}{ll} -\triangle u_j+V_j(x) u_j=g_j(x,u_1,\cdots,u_m)+h_j(x),&amp; x\in \Omega,\\ \\ u_j:=u_j(x)=0,&amp; x\in \partial\Omega,\\ \\ j=1,2,\cdots,m, \end{array}\right. $$ where $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{N}$ ($N\ge2$) is a bounded smooth domain, $(g_1,\cdots,g_m)$ is the gradient of $G(x,U)\in C^1(\Omega\times\mathbb{R}^m,\mathbb{R})$, $G(x,U)$ may be sign-changing, and it is super-quadratic or asymptotically-quadratic as $|U|\to\infty$. We obtain infinitely many solutions by using variational methods and perturbation methods, and we provide several typical examples to illustrate the main results. The {\bf main novelties} are as follows. (1) The nonlinearity $G$ may be sign-changing. (2) The nonlinearity $G$ is not only general, but also super-quadratic or asymptotically-quadratic at infinity and zero. (3) The nonlinearity $G$ is power-type or non-power-type. (4) We not only construct some new conditions, but also apply some conditions used in homogeneous problems to the study of non-homogeneous systems for the first time. The {\bf main difficulties} come from the following three aspects. (1) The proof of boundedness for $(PS)$ sequence of approximate functionals. (2) The detailed analysis of the asymptotic behaviors of approximate functionals. (3) The estimate of the upper and lower bounds for the minimax value sequence $\{c_k\}$ of the even function.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Reifenberg With Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a calibrated version of Reifenberg theorem "with holes". In particular we study sets that are suitably approximable at all points and scales by calibrated planes and show that, without any additional hypotheses on $\beta$-numbers, this implies measure upper bounds and rectifiability. This article follows the main techniques introduced in a previous article, but it allows for holes in the sets under consideration, and is more self-contained.</description>

      <title>Duality estimates for subdiffusion problems including time-fractional porous medium type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove duality estimates for time-fractional and more general subdiffusion problems. An important example is given by subdiffusive porous medium type equations. Our estimates can be used to prove uniqueness of weak solutions to such problems, and they allow to extend a key estimate from classical reaction-diffusion systems to the subdiffusive case. Besides concrete equations involving a Laplacian, we also consider abstract problems in a Hilbert space setting.</description>

      <title>Mean field control with absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a mean field control problem in which particles are absorbed when they reach the boundary of a smooth domain. The value of the N-particle problem is described by a hierarchy of Hamilton-Jacobi equations which are coupled through their boundary conditions. The value function of the limiting problem; meanwhile, solves a Hamilton-Jacobi equation set on the space of sub-probability measures on the smooth domain, i.e. the space of non-negative measures with total mass at most one. Our main contributions are (i) to establish a comparison principle for this novel infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equation and (ii) to prove that the value of the N-particle problem converges in a suitable sense towards the value of the limiting problem as N tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>An Egorov Theorem for Wasserstein Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a new version of Egorov's theorem formulated in the Schr\"{o}dinger picture of quantum mechanics, using the $p$-Wasserstein metric applied to the Husimi functions of quantum states. The special case $p=1$ corresponds to a "low-regularity" Egorov theorem, while larger values $p&gt;1$ yield progressively stronger estimates. As a byproduct of our analysis, we prove an optimal transport inequality analogous to a result of Golse and Paul in the context of mean-field many-body quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>How smooth are restrictions of Besov functions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous work, we showed that Besov spaces do not enjoy the restriction property unless $q\leq p$. Specifically, we proved that if $p&lt;q$, then it is always possible to construct a function $f\in B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$ such that $f(\cdot,y)\notin B_{p,q}^s(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for a.e. $y\in \mathbb{R}^{N-d}$, while this "pathology" does not happen if $q\leq p$. We showed that the partial maps belong, in fact, to the Besov space of generalised smoothness $B_{p,q}^{(s,\Psi)}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ provided the function $\Psi$ satisfies a simple summability condition involving $p$ and $q$. This short note completes the picture by showing that this characterisation is sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the rank-one convex hull of finitely many $2\times 2$ triangular matrices is a semialgebraic set, defined by linear and quadratic polynomials. We present explicit constructions for five-point configurations and offer evidence suggesting that a similar characterization does not hold in the more general setting of directional convexity.</description>

      <title>Homogenization with Guaranteed Bounds via Primal-Dual Physically Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in micromechanics.</description>

      <title>Variable Matrix-Weighted Besov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, applying matrix ${\mathcal A}_{p(\cdot),\infty}$ weights introduced in our previous work, we introduce the matrix-weighted variable Besov space via the matrix weight $W$ or the reducing operators ${\mathbb{A}}$ of order $p(\cdot)$ for $W$, Then we show that, defined either by the matrix weight $W$ or the reducing operators ${\mathbb{A}}$ of order $p(\cdot)$ for $W$, the matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces (respectively, the matrix-weighted variable Besov sequence spaces) are both equal. Next, we establish the $\varphi$-transform theorem for matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces and, using this, find that the definition of matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces is independent of the choice of $\varphi$. After that, for the further discussion of variable Besov spaces, we establish the theorem of almost diagonal operators and then, by using this, we establish the molecular characterization. Then, with applying the molecular characterization, we obtain the wavelet and atomic characterizations of matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces. Finally, as an application, we consider some classical operators. By using the wavelet characterization, we establish the trace operator and obtain the theorem of trace operators. Moreover, with applying the molecular characterization, we establish the theorem of Calder\'on--Zygmund operators on matrix-weighted variable Besov spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Cauchy problem is well-posed in a strong sense and in a general setting. Our main result is the construction of an abstract semi-flow for the Hele-Shaw problem within general fluid domains (enabling, for instance, changes in the topology of the fluid domain) and which satisfies several properties: We provide simple comparison arguments, establish a new stability estimate and derive several consequences, including monotonicity and continuity results for the solutions, along with many Lyapunov functionals. We establish an eventual analytic regularity result for any arbitrary initial data. We also study numerous qualitative properties, including global regularity for initial data in sub-critical Sobolev spaces, well-posedness in a strong sense for initial data with barely a modulus of continuity, as well as waiting-time phenomena for Lipschitz solutions, in any dimension.
  This revision contains some corrections.</description>

      <title>Envelope representation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.</description>

      <title>Upwind filtering of scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of multi-dimensional non-local conservation laws of the form $\partial_t u = \operatorname{div}^{\Phi} \mathbf{F}(u)$, where the standard local divergence $\operatorname{div}$ of the flux vector $\mathbf{F}(u)$ is replaced by an average upwind divergence operator $\operatorname{div}^{\Phi}$ acting on the flux along a continuum of directions given by a reference measure and a filter $\Phi$. The non-local operator $\operatorname{div}^{\Phi}$ applies to a general non-monotone flux $\mathbf{F}$, and is constructed by decomposing the flux into monotone components according to wave speeds determined by $\mathbf{F}'$. Each monotone component is then consistently subjected to a non-local derivative operator that utilizes an anisotropic kernel supported on the "correct" half of the real axis. We establish well-posedness, derive a priori and entropy estimates, and provide an explicit continuous dependence result on the kernel. This stability result is robust with respect to the "size" of the kernel, allowing us to specify $\Phi$ as a Dirac delta $\delta_0$ to recover entropy solutions of the local conservation law $\partial_t u = \operatorname{div} \mathbf{F}(u)$ (with an error estimate). Other choices of $\Phi$ (and the reference measure) recover known numerical methods for (local) conservation laws. This work distinguishes itself from many others in the field by developing a consistent non-local approach capable of handling non-monotone fluxes.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stability of 2-D Couette flow for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations at high Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear stability of the Couette flow for the two-dimensional compressible Navier--Stokes equations at high Reynolds numbers ($Re$) regime. It was proved that if the initial data $(\rho_{in},u_{in})$ satisfies $\|(\rho_{in},u_{in})-(1, y, 0)\|_{H^4(\mathbb{T}\times\mathbb{R})}\leq \epsilon Re^{-1}$ for some small $\epsilon$ independent of $Re$, then the corresponding solution exists globally and remains close to the Couette flow for all time. Formal asymptotics indicate that this stability threshold is sharp within the class of Sobolev perturbations. The proof relies on the Fourier-multiplier method and exploits three essential ingredients: (i) the introduction of ``good unknowns" that decouple the perturbation system; (ii) the construction of a carefully designed Fourier multiplier that simultaneously captures the enhanced dissipation and inviscid-damping effects while taming the lift-up mechanism; and (iii) the design of distinct energy functionals for the incompressible and compressible modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation derived from a Cucker-Smale model for flocking with noise. There is a known phase transition depending on the noise between a regime with a unique stationary solution which is isotropic (symmetry) and a regime with a continuum of polarized stationary solutions (symmetry breaking). If the value of the noise is larger than the threshold value, the solution of the evolution equation converges to the unique radial stationary solution. This solution is linearly unstable in the symmetry-breaking range, while polarized stationary solutions attract all solutions with sufficiently low entropy. We prove that the convergence measured in a weighted $L^2$ norm occurs with an exponential rate and that the average speed also converges with exponential rate to a unique limit which determines a single polarized stationary solution.</description>

      <title>On Limit Formulas for Besov Seminorms and Nonlocal Perimeters in the Dunkl Setting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the limiting behavior of Besov seminorms and nonlocal perimeters in Dunkl theory. The present work generalizes two fundamental results: the Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova formula for Gagliardo seminorms and the asymptotics of (relative) fractional $s$-perimeters. Our main contributions are twofold. First, we establish a dimension-free Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova formula via a novel, robust approach that avoids reliance on the density property of Besov spaces, offering broader applicability. Second, we prove limit formulas for nonlocal perimeters relative to bounded open sets $\Omega$, removing boundary regularity assumptions in the forward direction, while introducing a weakened regularity condition on $\partial\Omega$ (admitting fractal boundaries) for the converse, a significant improvement over existing requirements. To the best of our knowledge, the results in this second part are new even in the classic Laplacian setting.</description>
