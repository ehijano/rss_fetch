      <title>A job-based assessment of economic complexity: from hidden to revealed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Economic complexity measures aim to quantify the capability content or endowment of industries and territories; however, capabilities are not observable, and therefore cannot be directly used in the computations. We estimate such endowments by quantifying the quality and diversity of the skills in the occupations required in specific industries. We refer to this job-based assessment as the hidden complexity, in contrast with the usual revealed complexity, which is computed from economic outputs such as exports or production. We show that our job-based measure of complexity is positively associated to wage levels and labor productivity growth, whereas the classic revealed measure is not. Finally, we discuss the application of these methods at the territorial level, showing their connection with economic growth.</description>

      <title>Chladni states in Ising Spin Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the core concept for understanding the emergence of collective order. In finite-dimensional systems, however, the nature of the broken phase is often constrained by the compatibility between spontaneous order and the microscopic symmetries of the underlying lattice. Here, we propose the topological substratum on which Ising spin lattices exhibit long-range order when cooled under non-ergodic conditions. Our topological decomposition, tantamount to resonating sand plates, enables monitoring and control of the dynamical evolution in systems surfing complex energy landscapes with multiple metastable patterns.</description>

      <title>Multistability and High Codimension Bifurcations in Synergistic Epidemics on Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of network heterogeneity on synergistic contagion dynamics. By extending a synergistic contagion model to diverse heterogeneous network topologies, we uncover the emergence of novel dynamical regimes characterized by multiple stable states, separated by a rich set of bifurcations reaching up to codimension 4. Additionally, we demonstrate how synergy fundamentally reshapes the influence of nodes based on their degree. Unlike in non-synergistic epidemics, low-degree nodes can play a pivotal role in enabling network invasion at the onset of spread, while high-degree nodes can trigger explosive contagion. These findings challenge conventional control strategies, highlighting the need for new approaches to enhance or suppress synergistic contagion.</description>
