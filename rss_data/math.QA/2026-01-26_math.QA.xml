      <title>Duality for graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-known and old result of Hazewinkel and Koszul states that the cohomology of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra is isomorphic, up to a suitable shift, to its twisted homology, a Lie-theoretical version of Poincare duality. This paper establishes an analogue of this result for graded (or super) Lie algebras and, more generally, differential graded Lie algebras.
  Closely related to this result is a calculation of the cohomology of a graded Lie algebra g with coefficients in its universal enveloping algebra U(g) as a one-sided module. This cohomology turns out to be one-dimensional and serves as a dualizing module for the cohomology of g. Moreover, it is shown that for a unimodular graded Lie algebra g, the derived category of U(g) has a Calabi-Yau structure. As a consequence, the category of rational infinity local systems on a simply connected topological space with totally finite-dimensional rational homotopy groups, has a Calabi-Yau structure, a generalization of Poincare duality for elliptic spaces.</description>

      <title>The Getzler-Gauss-Manin connection and Kontsevich-Soibelman operations on the periodic cyclic homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equivariant operations on the periodic cyclic homology of a dg algebra that arise from the chain level action of the two-colored Kontsevich-Soibelman operad. Using classical computations of Cohen [Coh], we explicitly compute a set of generators for these operations under composition, and show that they agree with the p-fold equivariant cap products previously studied by the author [Che2] in relation to equivariant Gromov-Witten theory with mod p coefficients. The main technical novelty is a re-formulation of the Kontsevich-Soibelman operad in terms of a two-colored version of the cacti operad, and a proof that it is equivariantly quasi-equivalent to the two-colored operad of little disks on a disk/cylinder. We give applications of the main results to symplectic topology, and more specifically, arithmetic aspects of Fukaya category and classical obstructions to realizing a middle cohomology class of a symplectic manifold by Lagrangian submanifold</description>

      <title>Algebraic Phase Theory III: Structural Quantum Codes over Frobenius Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the quantum component of Algebraic Phase Theory by showing that quantum phase, Weyl noncommutativity, and stabiliser codes arise as unavoidable algebraic consequences of Frobenius duality. Working over finite commutative Frobenius rings, we extract nondegenerate phase pairings, Weyl operator algebras, and quantum stabiliser codes directly from admissible phase data, without assuming Hilbert spaces, analytic inner products, or an externally imposed symplectic structure.
  Within this framework, quantum state spaces appear as minimal carriers of faithful phase action, and stabiliser codes are identified canonically with self-orthogonal submodules under the Frobenius phase pairing. CSS-type constructions arise only as a special splitting case, while general Frobenius rings admit intrinsically non-CSS stabilisers. Nilpotent and torsion structure in the base ring give rise to algebraically protected quantum layers that are invisible to admissible Weyl-type errors.
  These results place quantum stabiliser theory within Algebraic Phase Theory: quantisation emerges as algebraic phase induction rather than analytic completion, and quantum structure is information-complete at the level of algebraic phase relations alone. Throughout, we work over finite Frobenius rings, which are precisely the base rings for which admissible phase data become strongly admissible, and in this regime the full quantum formalism is forced by Frobenius duality.</description>

      <title>On the computation of the canonical basis for irreducible highest weight $U_q (\mathfrak{gl}_{\infty})$-module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study canonical basis elements in higher-level Fock spaces associated with the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_\infty)$, which are conjecturally related to Calogero-Moser theory for complex reflection groups. We generalize the Leclerc-Miyachi formula to arbitrary levels by introducing new explicit constructions based on symbols, including a column removal theorem and closed formulas in several cases. These results provide explicit descriptions of canonical basis elements with applications to Calogero-Moser cellular characters and to the decomposition matrices of Ariki-Koike algebras.</description>

      <title>Integral Transforms for Finite Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that quantization of $\pi$-finite spaces, as a functor out of a higher category of spans, is equivariant in two ways: Symmetries of a given polarization/Lagrangian always induce coherent symmetries of the quantization. On the other hand, symmetries of the entire phase space a priori only induce projective symmetries, with an invertible once-categorified theory, the anomaly theory, encoding the projectivity.
  We give projective symmetries of three-dimensional finite gauge theories a concrete description via a twice-categorified analogue of Blattner-Kostant-Sternberg kernels and the associated integral transforms, such as the Fourier transform. This establishes an analogy between certain instances of the $\pi$-finite quantization procedure considered herein and the geometric quantization of a symplectic vector space.</description>

      <title>Computing colored Khovanov homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare eight versions of finite-dimensional categorifications of the colored Jones polynomial and show that they yield isomorphic results over a field of characteristic zero. As an application, we verify a physics-motivated conjectural formula for colored superpolynomials based on Poincar\'e polynomials of the Khovanov homology of cables. We also obtain a conjectural closed formula for the Poincar\'e series of the skein lasagna module of $\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. Accompanying this note is an online database of colored superpolynomials.</description>

      <title>A unitary vertex operator algebra arising from the 3C-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give an algebraic proof of the unitarity of the vertex operator algebra $L(21/22, 0)\oplus L(21/22, 8)$ and of all its irreducible ordinary modules, using a coset realization arising from the $3C$-algebra. Motivated by the structure of the resulting module decomposition, we establish a general result on fusion rules for commutant vertex operator subalgebras within the framework of modular tensor categories. As an application of this general result, we explicitly determine the fusion rules of all irreducible $L(21/22, 0)\oplus L(21/22, 8)$-modules.</description>

Abstract: We establish an algebra isomorphism between the center of the category $\mathcal{O}$ for a hybrid quantum group at a root of unity $\zeta$ and the cohomology of $\zeta$-fixed locus on affine Grassmannian. A deformed version of this isomorphism was established in the previous paper of the author. For the Steinberg block of $\mathcal{O}$, we construct an abelian equivalence to the category of equivariant sheaves on the Springer resolution.</description>

      <title>Planar algebras for the Young graph and the Khovanov Heisenberg category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies planar algebras of Jones' style associated with the Young graph. We first see that, given a positive real valued function on the Young graph, we may obtain a planar algebra whose structure is defined in terms of a state sum over the ways of filling planar tangles with Young diagrams. We delve into the case that the function is harmonic and related to the Plancherel measures on Young diagrams. Along with an element that is depicted as a cross of two strings, we see that the defining relations among morphisms for the Khovanov Heisenberg category are recovered in the planar algebra. We also identify certain elements in the planar algebra with particular functions of Young diagrams that include the moments, Boolean cumulants and normalized characters. This paper thereby bridges diagramatical categorification and asymptotic representation theory. In fact, the Khovanov Heisenberg category is one of the most fundamental examples of diagramatical categorification whereas the harmonic functions on the Young graph have been a central object in the asymptotic representation theory of symmetric groups.</description>
