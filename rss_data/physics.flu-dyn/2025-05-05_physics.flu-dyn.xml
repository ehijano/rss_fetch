      <title>Drop rebound at low Weber number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rebound of drops impacting non-wetting substrates at low Weber number $We$ through experiment, direct numerical simulation, and reduced-order modeling. Submillimeter-sized drops are normally impacted onto glass slides coated with a thin viscous film that allows them to rebound without contact line formation. Experiments are performed with various drop viscosities, sizes, and impact velocities, and we directly measure metrics pertinent to spreading, retraction, and rebound using high-speed imaging. We complement experiments with direct numerical simulation and a fully predictive reduced-order model that applies natural geometric and kinematic constraints to simulate the drop shape and dynamics using a spectral method. At low $We$, drop rebound is characterized by a weaker dependence of the coefficient of restitution on $We$ than in the more commonly studied high-$We$ regime, with nearly $We$-independent rebound in the inertio-capillary limit, and an increasing contact time as $We$ decreases. Drops with higher viscosity or size interact with the substrate longer, have a lower coefficient of restitution, and stop bouncing sooner, in good quantitative agreement with our reduced-order model. In the inertio-capillary limit, low $We$ rebound is characterized by nearly symmetric spreading and retraction phases, which corresponds to a coefficient of restitution that is near unity. Increasing $We$ or viscosity breaks this symmetry, coinciding with a drop in the coefficient of restitution and an increased dependence on $We$. Lastly, the maximum drop deformation and spreading are related through energy arguments, providing a comprehensive framework for drop impact and rebound at low $We$.</description>

      <title>accLB: A High-Performance Lattice Boltzmann Code for Multiphase Turbulence on Multi-Gpu Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present accLB, a high-performance Fortran-based lattice Boltzmann (LB) solver tailored to multiphase turbulent flows on multi-GPU architectures. The code couples a conservative phase-field formulation of the Allen-Cahn equation with a thread-safe, regularized LB method to capture complex interface dynamics. Designed from the ground up for HPC environments, accLB employs MPI for distributed memory parallelism and OpenACC for GPU acceleration, achieving excellent portability and scalability on leading pre-exascale systems such as Leonardo and LUMI. Benchmark tests demonstrate strong and weak scaling efficiencies on multiple GPUs. Physical validation includes direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT). Further, we examine bubble-laden HIT and observe a transition to a $-3$ energy scaling, as in experiments and theoretical predictions, due to bubble-induced dissipation, along with enhanced small-scale intermittency. These results highlight accLB as a robust and scalable platform for the simulation of multiphase turbulence in extreme computational regimes.</description>

      <title>Robustness and uncertainty of direct numerical simulation under the influence of rounding and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical precision in large-scale scientific computations has become an emerging topic due to recent developments in computer hardware. Lower floating point precision offers the potential for significant performance improvements, but the uncertainty added from reducing the numerical precision is a major obstacle for it to reach prevalence in high-fidelity simulations of turbulence. In the present work, the impact of reducing the numerical precision under different rounding schemes is investigated and compared to the presence of white noise in the simulation data to obtain statistical averages of different quantities in the flow. To investigate how this impacts the simulation, an experimental methodology to assess the impact of these sources of uncertainty is proposed, in which each realization $u^i$ at time $t_i$ is perturbed, either by constraining the flow to a coarser discretization of the phase space (corresponding to low precision formats rounded with deterministic and stochastic rounding) or by perturbing the flow with white noise with a uniform distribution. The purpose of this approach is to assess the limiting factors for precision, and how robust a direct numerical simulation (DNS) is to noise and numerical precision. Our results indicate that for low-Re turbulent channel flow, stochastic rounding and noise impacts the results significantly less than deterministic rounding, indicating potential benefits of stochastic rounding over conventional round-to-nearest. We find that to capture the probability density function of the velocity change in time, the floating point precision is especially important in regions with small relative velocity changes and low turbulence intensity, but less important in regions with large velocity gradients and variations such as in the near-wall region.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based prediction of species mass fraction and flame characteristics in partially premixed turbulent jet flame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques with large eddy simulation (LES) for predicting species mass fraction and flame characteristics in partially premixed turbulent jet flames. The LES simulations, conducted using STAR-CCM+ software, employed the Flamelet Generated Manifold (FGM) approach to effectively capture the interactions between the turbulence and chemical reactions, providing high-fidelity data on flame behaviour and pollutant formation. The simulation was based on the Sandia Flame D specification, utilizing a detailed mesh to accurately represent flow features and flame dynamics. To enhance real-time prediction capabilities, three ML models, Neural Networks (NN), Linear Regression (LR), and Decision Tree Regression (DTR), were trained on the LES data. Comparative analysis using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Pearson Coefficient (PC), and R-squared (R2) identified the NN model as the most effective one. The NN model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting species mass fractions and flame patterns, significantly outperforming traditional LES solvers in terms of computational efficiency. The study also highlighted the considerable computational speedup achieved by the NN model, making it approximately 17.25 times faster than traditional LES solvers. Despite some limitations, such as handling large dataset fluctuations, the ML models have shown promise for future applications in combustion simulations.</description>

      <title>Experiments in a novel quasi-1D diffusion flame with variable bulk flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel species injector of a recently developed research burner, consisting of an array of hypodermic needles, which allows to produce quasi one-dimensional unstrained diffusion flames has been improved. It is used in a new symmetric design with fuel and oxidizer injected through needle arrays which allows to independently choose both the magnitude and direction of the bulk flow through the flame. A simplified theoretical model for the flame position with variable bulk flow is presented which accounts for the transport properties of both reactants. The model results are compared to experiments with a CO2-diluted H2-O2 flame and variable bulk flow. The mixture composition throughout the burning chamber is monitored by mass spectrometry. The resulting concentration profiles are also compared to the simplified theory and demonstrate that the new burner configuration produces a good approximation of the 1-D chambered diffusion flame, which has been used extensively for the stability analysis of diffusion flames. Hence, the new research burner opens up new possibilities for the experimental validation of theoretical models developed in the idealized unstrained 1-D chambered flame configuration, in particular models concerning the effect of bulk flow magnitude and direction on flame stability. Some preliminary results are presented on the effect of bulk flow direction on the thermal-diffusive cellular flame instability.</description>

      <title>Carbon fiber damage evolution under flame attack and the role of impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon fibers (CFs) are prone to extensive oxidation under fire attack, for instance, in an aircraft fire scenario. This work addresses the damage mechanisms observed on polyacrylonitrile (PAN)-based CFs with different microstructure exposed to open flames. A fixed-point technique was developed to follow up individual CFs by means of time-controlled insertion into premixed methane/air flames, followed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. Besides diameter reduction, three localized damage mechanisms were discerned in presence of impurities, which were quantified by neutron activation analysis (NAA). Severe pitting was ascribed to catalytic oxidation mainly caused by alkali and alkaline earth metals. After an initial period where catalytic reactions between impurities and the carbon surface dominate, the flame stoichiometry governed the CF gasification process, with lean flames being much more aggressive than rich ones. A second mechanism, channelling, was caused by mobile metallic impurities. Some impurities showed an opposite effect, lowering reactivity and thus preventing further catalysis. Amorphous damage with a skin-peeling effect is believed to be the result of localized impurities at high concentrations and microstructural variations. Hindrance or synergistic effects between impurities are discussed. Finally, apparent axial pit growth rates were determined and compared with other carbonaceous materials, revealing a strong influence of impurities and the flame reactive atmosphere on CF oxidation.</description>

      <title>Numerical Integration of Navier-Stokes Equations by Time Series Expansion and Stabilized FEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript introduces an advanced numerical approach for the integration of incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations using a Time Series Expansion (TSE) method within a Finite Element Method (FEM) framework. The technique is enhanced by a novel stabilization strategy, incorporating a Divergent Series Resummation (DSR) technique, which significantly augments the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The stabilization mechanism is meticulously designed to improve the stability and validity of computed series terms, enabling the application of the Factorial Series (FS) algorithm for series resummation. This approach is pivotal in addressing the challenges associated with the accurate and stable numerical solution of NS equations, which are critical in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications. The manuscript elaborates on the variational formulation of Stokes problem and present convergence analysis of the method using the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuska-Brezzi (LBB) condition. It is followed by the NS equations and the implementation details of the stabilization technique, underscored by numerical tests on laminar flow past a cylinder, showcasing the method's efficacy and potential for broad applicability in fluid dynamics simulations. The results of the stabilization indicate a substantial enhancement in computational stability and accuracy, offering a promising avenue for future research in the field.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Ocean Flows with the Scattering Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upper-ocean flows are a multi-scale jigsaw puzzle of turbulence and waves. Characterizing these flows is essential for understanding their role in redistributing heat, carbon, and nutrients, yet power spectral analysis cannot always distinguish between types of motion. We show that the scattering transform (ST), a wavelet convolution method, can extract geometric information from flow fields, offering insights beyond the power spectrum. The ST distinguishes balanced dynamics, internal waves, and types of turbulence -- even when their power spectra are identical. Applied to sea surface height (SSH) fields from ocean models, the ST differentiates regions with distinct underlying dynamics. Our analysis offers a framework for interpreting SSH from satellite altimetry missions and for analyzing other spatial maps (e.g., from airborne and coastal radar). More generally, the ST is an appealing way to characterize complex fluid motion in a variety of geophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field gradients on the development of the MRI: Applications to binary neutron star mergers and proto-planetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-rotational instability (MRI) is widely believed to play a central role in generating large-scale, poloidal magnetic fields during binary neutron star mergers. However, the few simulations that begin with a weak seed magnetic field and capture its growth until saturation predominantly show the effects of small-scale turbulence and winding, but lack convincing evidence of MRI activity. In this work, we investigate how the MRI is affected by the complex magnetic field topologies characteristic of the post-merger phase, aiming to assess the actual feasibility of MRI in such environments. We first derive the MRI instability criterion, as well as expressions for the characteristic wavelength and growth timescale of the fastest-growing modes, under conditions that include significant magnetic field gradients. Our analysis reveals that strong radial magnetic field gradients can impact significantly on the MRI, slowing its growth or suppressing it entirely if large enough. We then apply this extended framework to both idealized analytical disk models and data from a numerical relativity simulation of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant. We find that conditions favourable to MRI growth on astrophysically relevant timescales may occur only in limited regions of the post-merger disk, and only at late times $t\gtrsim 100$ ms after the merger. These results suggest that the MRI plays a limited role in amplifying poloidal magnetic fields in post-merger environments during the first $\mathcal{O}(100)$ms.</description>

      <title>Model for transitional turbulence in a planar shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A central obstacle to understanding the route to turbulence in wall-bounded flows is that the flows are composed of complex, highly fluctuating, and strongly nonlinear states. In the case of pipe flow, models have deepened our understanding of turbulent onset by providing valuable theory to complement experiments and simulations. In planar cases, the large-scale flows associated with transitional turbulence are considerably more complex than for pipes, limiting our ability to develop models and provide theoretical analyses for these cases. We address this challenge here by deriving from the Navier-Stokes equations a simplified model for transitional turbulence in a planar setting. The Reynolds-averaged and turbulent-kinetic-energy equations are projected onto a minimal set of wall-normal modes and justified model closures are used for the Reynolds stresses and turbulent dissipation and transport. The model reproduces phenomena found at the onset of turbulence in planar shear flows, such as turbulent-laminar patterns (turbulent bands) oriented obliquely to the streamwise direction and large-scale flows associated with both stationary patterns and growing turbulent spots. We demonstrate the model's utility by showing that patterns arise with decreasing Reynolds number via a linear instability of uniform turbulence and by deriving a selection criterion for the pattern orientation at onset.</description>

      <title>Mesh-based Super-Resolution of Fluid Flows with Multiscale Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07769v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph neural network (GNN) approach is introduced in this work which enables mesh-based three-dimensional super-resolution of fluid flows. In this framework, the GNN is designed to operate not on the full mesh-based field at once, but on localized meshes of elements (or cells) directly. To facilitate mesh-based GNN representations in a manner similar to spectral (or finite) element discretizations, a baseline GNN layer (termed a message passing layer, which updates local node properties) is modified to account for synchronization of coincident graph nodes, rendering compatibility with commonly used element-based mesh connectivities. The architecture is multiscale in nature, and is comprised of a combination of coarse-scale and fine-scale message passing layer sequences (termed processors) separated by a graph unpooling layer. The coarse-scale processor embeds a query element (alongside a set number of neighboring coarse elements) into a single latent graph representation using coarse-scale synchronized message passing over the element neighborhood, and the fine-scale processor leverages additional message passing operations on this latent graph to correct for interpolation errors. Demonstration studies are performed using hexahedral mesh-based data from Taylor-Green Vortex and backward-facing step flow simulations at Reynolds numbers of 1600 and 3200. Through analysis of both global and local errors, the results ultimately show how the GNN is able to produce accurate super-resolved fields compared to targets in both coarse-scale and multiscale model configurations. Reconstruction errors for fixed architectures were found to increase in proportion to the Reynolds number. Geometry extrapolation studies on a separate cavity flow configuration show promising cross-mesh capabilities of the super-resolution strategy.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement-learning-assisted control of four-roll mills: geometric symmetry and inertial effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedding the intrinsic symmetry of a flow system in training its machine learning algorithms has become a significant trend in the recent surge of their application in fluid mechanics. This paper leverages the geometric symmetry of a four-roll mill (FRM) to enhance its training efficiency. Stabilizing and precisely controlling droplet trajectories in a FRM is challenging due to the unstable nature of the extensional flow with a saddle point. Extending the work of Vona &amp; Lauga, this study applies Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to effectively guide a displaced droplet to the center of the FRM. Through direct numerical simulations, we explore the applicability of DRL in controlling FRM flow with moderate inertial effects, i.e., Reynolds number $\sim\mathcal{O}(1)$, a nonlinear regime previously unexplored. The FRM's geometric symmetry allows control policies trained in one of the eight sub-quadrants to be extended to the entire domain, reducing training costs. Our results indicate that the DRL-based control method can successfully guide a displaced droplet to the target center with robust performance across various starting positions, even from substantially far distances. The work also highlights potential directions for future research, particularly focusing on efficiently addressing the delay effects in flow response caused by inertia. This study presents new advances in controlling droplet trajectories in more nonlinear and complex situations, with potential applications to other nonlinear flows. The geometric symmetry used in this cutting-edge reinforcement learning approach can also be applied to other control methods.</description>
