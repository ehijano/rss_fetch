      <title>Forbidden configurations for coherency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Right (and left) coherency and right (and left) weak coherency are natural finitary conditions for monoids, however, determining whether a given monoid is right, or dually left, coherent turns out to be hard and disparate techniques have been developed to show that certain classes of monoids are (or are not) right coherent. We exhibit a particular configuration of elements in a monoid subsemigroup of a right (respectively, left) $E$-Ehresmann monoid, relative to the Ehresmann structure of the overmonoid, that prohibits left (respectively, right) coherence. We apply this technique to show that the free left Ehresmann monoid of rank at least $2$ is not left coherent and the free Ehresmann monoid of rank at least $2$ is neither left nor right coherent. We show that our technique is particularly useful in the case where the overmonoid is an $E$-unitary inverse monoid, and apply this to recover the following results of Gould and Hartmann: the free inverse monoids and free ample monoids of rank at least 2 are neither left nor right coherent, and the free left ample monoid of rank at least $2$ is not left coherent. Viewed as a unary monoid, a free left Ehresmann monoid does not embed into an inverse monoid. We show that a free left Ehresmann monoid viewed as a monoid (the standpoint of this paper) does embed into an $E$-unitary inverse monoid. In another positive direction, we demonstrate that the free left Ehresmann monoid is weakly coherent.</description>

      <title>Relative modality of elements in generalized Takiff Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a natural number m and a Lie algebra g, the m th generalized Takiff Lie algebra of g is the Lie algebra gm\,:= g $\otimes$ C[T ]/T m+1 . For n $\ge$ m, we define the (m, n)-modality of an adjoint orbit $\Omega$m in gm to be the minimum codimension of an adjoint orbit in the pullback of $\Omega$m in gn.  In this paper, we study this family of invariants in generalized Takiff Lie algebras associated to a quadratic Lie algebra g. We show that this family of invariants satisfies some concavity and hereditary properties. From which we deduce that (n -m)$\chi$(g) is a lower bound, where $\chi$(g) is the index of g. We prove that this lower bound is in fact an equality for a dense set of orbits, and that if g is reductive, it is always an equality when m = 0 (and also some special orbits). We conjecture that equality holds for all m when g is reductive.</description>

      <title>\'Etale algebras and the Kummer theory of finite Galois modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galois cohomology groups $H^i(K,M)$ are widely used in algebraic number theory, in such contexts as Selmer groups of elliptic curves, Brauer groups of fields, class field theory, and Iwasawa theory. The standard construction of these groups involves maps out of the absolute Galois group $G_K$, which in many cases of interest (e.g. $K = \mathbb{Q}$) is too large for computation or even for gaining an intuitive grasp. However, for finite $M$, an element of $H^i(K,M)$ can be described by a finite amount of data. For the important case $i = 1$, the appropriate object is an \'etale algebra over $K$ (a finite product of separable field extensions) whose Galois group is a subgroup of the semidirect product $\operatorname{Hol} M = M \rtimes \operatorname{Aut} M$ (often called the \emph{holomorph} of $M$), equipped with a little bit of combinatorial data.
  Although the correspondence between $H^1$ and field extensions is in widespread use, it includes some combinatorial and Galois-theoretic details that seem never to have been written down. In this short quasi-expository paper, we fill in this gap and explain how the \'etale algebra perspective illuminates some common uses of $H^1$, including parametrizing cubic and quartic algebras as well as computing the Tate pairing on Galois coclasses of local fields.</description>

      <title>Prime and semiprime Lie ideals in C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the theory of Dixmier ideals developed in previous work, we show that every semiprime Lie ideal in a C*-algebra arises as the full normalizer subspace of a semiprime two-sided ideal. This leads to a concise description of all semiprime Lie ideals in terms of semiprime two-sided ideals, and an analogous description of prime Lie ideals in terms of prime two-sided ideals.
  For unital C*-algebras without characters, we obtain a natural bijection between (semi)prime two-sided ideals and (semi)prime Lie ideals, and it follows that a Lie ideal is fully noncentral if and only if it is not contained in any prime Lie ideal.</description>

      <title>Group actions and automorphisms of evolution algebras associated to finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an evolution algebra associated to a connected finite graph $\Gamma$, we exhibit a free action of the group of symmetries of $\Gamma$ on the set of automorphisms of the algebra. This allows us to explicitly describe this set and we prove that a sufficient condition for it to be finite is that every automorphism is induced by a graph symmetry. Consequently, we extend a known result about perfect evolution algebras to other families.</description>

      <title>Generalized symmetries of remarkable (1+2)-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using an original method, we find the algebra of generalized symmetries of a remarkable (1+2)-dimensional ultraparabolic Fokker-Planck equation, which is also called the Kolmogorov equation and is singled out within the entire class of ultraparabolic linear second-order partial differential equations with three independent variables by its wonderful symmetry properties. It turns out that the essential subalgebra of this algebra, which consists of linear generalized symmetries, is generated by the recursion operators associated with the nilradical of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the Kolmogorov equation, and the Casimir operator of the Levi factor of the latter algebra unexpectedly arises in the consideration. We also establish an isomorphism between this algebra and the Lie algebra associated with the second Weyl algebra, which provides a dual perspective for studying their properties. After developing the theoretical background of finding exact solutions of homogeneous linear systems of differential equations using their linear generalized symmetries, we efficiently apply it to the Kolmogorov equation.</description>

      <title>Double groupoids and $2$-groupoids in regular Mal'tsev categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ of internal $2$-groupoids is a Birkhoff subcategory of the category $ \mathrm{Grpd}^2(\mathscr{C}) $ of double groupoids in a regular Mal'tsev category $\mathscr{C}$ with finite colimits. In particular, when $\mathscr{C}$ is a Mal'tsev variety of universal algebras, the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ is also a Mal'tsev variety, of which we describe the corresponding algebraic theory. When $\mathscr{C}$ is a naturally Mal'tsev category, the reflector from $ \mathrm{Grpd}^2(\mathscr{C}) $ to 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ has an additional property related to the commutator of equivalence relations. We prove that the category 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ is semi-abelian when $\mathscr{C}$ is semi-abelian, and then provide sufficient conditions for 2-$ \mathrm{Grpd}(\mathscr{C}) $ to be action representable.</description>

      <title>Lie ideals in properly infinite C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every Lie ideal in a unital, properly infinite C*-algebra is commutator equivalent to a unique two-sided ideal. It follows that the Lie ideal structure of such a C*-algebra is concisely encoded by its lattice of two-sided ideals. This answers a question of Robert in this setting.
  We obtain similar structure results for Lie ideals in unital, real rank zero C*-algebras without characters. As an application, we show that every Lie ideal in a von Neumann algebra is related to a unique two-sided ideal, which solves a problem of Bre\v{s}ar, Kissin, and Shulman.</description>
