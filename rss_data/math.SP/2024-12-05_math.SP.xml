      <title>Refining Friedlander-Filonov inequality with the de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Laplacian and of other differential operators have been intensively studied in the past decades. The aim of this paper is to introduce differential forms and the de Rham complex in the study of such inequalities. We show how differential forms lie hidden at the heart of work of Rohleder on inequalities between Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues for the Laplacian on planar domains. Moreover, we extend and generalize the result of Rohleder by proving that the j+2:nd eigenvalue of the Neumann Laplacian is less than or equal to the j:th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian for any compact Lipschitz domain in dimension two or greater.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-like Schr\"odinger Operators at Low Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a Schr\"odinger operator on an asymptotically Euclidean manifold $X$ of dimension at least two, and suppose that the potential is of attractive Coulomb-like type. Using Vasy's second 2nd-microlocal approach, "the Lagrangian approach," we analyze -- uniformly, all the way down to $E=0$ -- the output of the limiting resolvent $R(E\pm i 0) = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0^+} R(E\pm i \epsilon)$. The Coulomb potential causes the output of the low-energy resolvent to possess oscillatory asymptotics which differ substantially from the sorts of asymptotics observed in the short-range case by Guillarmou, Hassell, Sikora, and (more recently) Hintz and Vasy. Specifically, the compound asymptotics at low energy and large spatial scales are more delicate, and the resolvent output is smooth all the way down to $E=0$. In fact, we will construct a compactification of $(0,1]_E\times X$ on which the resolvent output is given by a specified (and relatively complicated) function that oscillates as $r\to\infty$ times something polyhomogeneous. As a corollary, we get complete and compatible asymptotic expansions for solutions to the scattering problem as functions of both position and energy, with a transitional regime.</description>

      <title>Finitude of physical measures for random maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For random compositions of independent and identically distributed measurable maps on a Polish space, we study the existence and finitude of absolutely continuous ergodic stationary probability measures (which are, in particular, physical measures) whose basins of attraction cover the whole space almost everywhere. We characterize and hierarchize such random maps in terms of their associated Markov operators, as well as show the difference between classes in the hierarchy by plenty of examples, including additive noise, multiplicative noise, and iterated function systems. We also provide sufficient practical conditions for a random map to belong to these classes. For instance, we establish that any continuous random map on a compact Riemannian manifold with absolutely continuous transition probability has finitely many physical measures whose basins of attraction cover Lebesgue almost all the manifold.</description>

      <title>Multilinear Hyperquiver Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05622v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We count singular vector tuples of a system of tensors assigned to the edges of a directed hypergraph. To do so, we study the generalisation of quivers to directed hypergraphs. Assigning vector spaces to the nodes of a hypergraph and multilinear maps to its hyperedges gives a hyperquiver representation. Hyperquiver representations generalise quiver representations (where all hyperedges are edges) and tensors (where there is only one multilinear map). The singular vectors of a hyperquiver representation are a compatible assignment of vectors to the nodes. We compute the dimension and degree of the variety of singular vectors of a sufficiently generic hyperquiver representation. Our formula specialises to known results that count the singular vectors and eigenvectors of a generic tensor. Lastly, we study a hypergraph generalisation of the inverse tensor eigenvalue problem and solve it algorithmically.</description>

      <title>Tubes and Steklov eigenvalues in negatively curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12180v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Steklov eigenvalue problem on a compact pinched negatively curved manifold $M$ of dimension at least three with totally geodesic boundaries. We obtain a geometric lower bound for the first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue in terms of the total volume of $M$ and the volume of its boundary. We provide examples illustrating the necessity of these geometric quantities in the lower bound. Our result can be seen as a counterpart of the lower bound for the first nonzero Laplace eigenvalue on closed pinched negatively curved manifolds of dimension at least three proved by Schoen in 1982.
  The proof is composed of certain key elements. We provide a uniform lower bound for the first eigenvalue of the Steklov-Dirichlet problem on a neighborhood of the boundary of $M$ and show that it provides an obstruction to having a small first nonzero Steklov eigenvalue. As another key element of the proof, we give a tubular neighborhood theorem for totally geodesic hypersurfaces in a pinched negatively curved manifold. We give an explicit dependence for the width function in terms of the volume of the boundary and the pinching constant.</description>
