      <title>Strange Nonchaotic Attractor in an Unforced Turbulent Reactive Flow System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover strange nonchaotic attractor (SNA) through experiments in an unforced system comprising turbulent reactive flow. While models suggest SNAs are common in dynamical systems, experimental observations are primarily limited to systems with external forcing. We observe SNA prior to the emergence of periodic oscillations from chaotic fluctuations. In complex systems, self-organization can lead to order, and inherent nonlinearity can induce chaos. The occurrence of SNA, which is nonchaotic yet nonperiodic in one such complex system, is intriguing.</description>

      <title>Chaos destroys the excited state quantum phase transition of the Kerr parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The driven Kerr parametric oscillator, of interest to fundamental physics and quantum technologies, exhibits an excited state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) originating in an unstable classical periodic orbit. The main signature of this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of the energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two distinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are useful for quantum technologies, because they show a cat-like structure that protects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how chaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the nonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the cat states. Our results demonstrate the importance of the analysis of theoretical models for the design of new parametric oscillators with ever larger nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>An upper critical dimension for dynamo action: A $d$-dimensional closure model study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a $d$-dimensional Eddy Damped Quasi-Normal Markovian (EDQNM) Closure Model to study dynamo action in arbitrary dimensions. In particular, we find lower $d_L$ and upper $d_U$ critical dimensions for sustained dynamo action in this incompressible problem. Our model is adaptable for future studies incorporating helicity, compressible effects and a wide range of magnetic Reynolds and Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>Reservoir computing with logistic map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on reservoir computing essentially involve a high dimensional dynamical system as the reservoir, which transforms and stores the input as a higher dimensional state, for temporal and nontemporal data processing. We demonstrate here a method to predict temporal and nontemporal tasks by constructing virtual nodes as constituting a reservoir in reservoir computing using a nonlinear map, namely the logistic map, and a simple finite trigonometric series. We predict three nonlinear systems, namely Lorenz, Rossler, and Hindmarsh-Rose, for temporal tasks and a seventh order polynomial for nontemporal tasks with great accuracy. Also, the prediction is made in the presence of noise and found to closely agree with the target. Remarkably, the logistic map performs well and predicts close to the actual or target values. The low values of the root mean square error confirm the accuracy of this method in terms of efficiency. Our approach removes the necessity of continuous dynamical systems for constructing the reservoir in reservoir computing. Moreover, the accurate prediction for the three different nonlinear systems suggests that this method can be considered a general one and can be applied to predict many systems. Finally, we show that the method also accurately anticipates the time series of the all the three variable of Rossler system for the future (self prediction).</description>
