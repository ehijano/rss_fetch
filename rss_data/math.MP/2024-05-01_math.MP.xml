      <title>Surface energy and elementary excitations of the XYZ spin chain with integrable open boundary fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic limit of the anisotropic XYZ spin chain with non-diagonal integrable open boundary conditions. Although the $U(1)$-symmetry is broken, by using the new parametrization scheme, we exactly obtain the surface energy and the excitation energy of the system, which has solved the difficulty in the inhomogeneous $T-Q$ relation. With the boundary parameters in the regions making the Hamiltonian Hermitian, we have obtained the distribution patterns of the zero roots of the eigenvalue of the transfer matrix for the ground state and the excited ones. We find that the surface and excitation energies depend on the parities of sites number $N$, due to the long-range Neel order in the bulk. The spontaneous magnetization and easy-axis for all the regions of boundary parameters are studied. We also obtain the physical quantities in the thermodynamic limit of boundary XXZ model by taking the triangular limit.</description>

      <title>Species of structure and physical dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses the often underestimated importance of physical dimensions and units in the formal reconstruction of physical theories, focusing on structuralist approaches that use the concept of ``species of structure" as a meta-mathematical tool. We are pursuing an approach that goes back to a suggestion by T.~Tao. It involves the representation of fundamental physical quantities by one-dimensional real ordered vector spaces, while derived quantities are formulated using concepts from linear algebra, e.~g.~tensor products and dual spaces. As an introduction, the theory of Ohm's law is considered. We then formulate a reconstruction of the calculus of physical dimensions, including Buckingham's $\Pi$-theorem. Furthermore, an application of this method to the Newtonian theory of gravitating systems consisting of point particles is demonstrated, emphasizing the role of the automorphism group.</description>

      <title>Billiard Partitions, Fibonacci Sequences, SIP Classes, and Quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from billiard partitions which arose recently in the description of periodic trajectories of ellipsoidal billiards in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space, we introduce a new type of separable integer partition classes, called type B. We study the numbers of basis partitions with $d$ parts and relate them to the Fibonacci sequence and its natural generalizations. Remarkably, the generating series of basis partitions can be related to the quiver generating series of symmetric quivers corresponding to the framed unknot via knots-quivers correspondence, and to the count of Schr\"oder paths.</description>

      <title>New look at Milnor Spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: S. Donaldson disproved the smooth $\mathrm{h}$-cobordism conjecture in dimension $4$ by studying invariants coming from the moduli space of connections on $\mathrm{SO}(3)$-bundles over smooth $4$-dimension manifolds $X$. In this paper, we reverse his point of view in dimension $8$. Namely, we consider fibrations coming from diffeomorphisms classes of homotopy Hopf manifolds $\Sigma^7\times\mathrm{S}^1$, i.e., $\Sigma^7$ is a homotopy sphere, seeing the bases as moduli spaces for additional structures.
  Our overarching objective is to establish a correspondence between the smooth invariants of Kervaire--Milnor and categorical invariants. One interprets pairwise non-diffeomorphic smooth structures on $\Sigma^7\times\mathrm{S}^1$ in terms of non-rationality. This paper's contributions are diverse, each carrying its significance. We believe profound connections exist between the themes addressed, which connect hypersurface singularity theory, Homological Mirror Symmetry, Topological Modular forms ($\mathrm{tmf}$), and Spherical T-duality.</description>

      <title>Spin Covariance Fluctuations in the SK Model at High Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on \cite{H}, it is well known that the rescaled two point correlation functions
  \[ \sqrt{N} \langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle = \sqrt{N} \big( \langle \sigma_i \sigma_j\rangle -\langle \sigma_i\rangle \langle \sigma_j\rangle\big) \] in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model with non-zero external field admit at sufficiently high temperature an explicit non-Gaussian distributional limit as $N\to \infty$. Inspired by recent results from \cite{ABSY, BSXY, BXY}, we provide a novel proof of the distributional convergence which is based on expanding $\langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle$ into a sum over suitable weights of self-avoiding paths from vertex $i$ to $j$. Compared to \cite{H}, our key observation is that the path representation of $\langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle$ provides a direct explanation of the specific form of the limiting distribution of $\sqrt{N} \langle \sigma_i ; \sigma_j\rangle$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically conserved charges and 2-kink collision in quasi-integrable potential KdV models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a particular deformation of the potential KdV model (pKdV) and construct the quasi-conservation laws by a direct method. The charge densities, differing from their integrable counterpart with homogeneous degree terms, exhibit mixed scale dimension terms. The modifications of the charges around the soliton interaction regions are examined by numerically simulating some representative anomalies. We show numerically the elastic scattering of two kinks for a wide range of values of the deformation parameters. It is discussed an anomaly cancellation mechanism to define an exact conservation law of the usual pKdV model, and a renormalization procedure is introduced for some divergent charges by subtructing the continuous linear background contribution. The KdV-type equations are quite ubiquitous in several areas of non-linear science, such as the study of General Relativity in $AdS_{3}$, Bose-Einstein condensates, superconductivity and fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mixed-Precision Matrix Factorization of the Inverse Overlap Matrix in Electronic Structure Calculations with AI-Hardware and GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, a new kind of accelerated hardware has gained popularity in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) communities which enables extremely high-performance tensor contractions in reduced precision for deep neural network calculations. In this article, we exploit Nvidia Tensor cores, a prototypical example of such AI/ML hardware, to develop a mixed precision approach for computing a dense matrix factorization of the inverse overlap matrix in electronic structure theory, $S^{-1}$. This factorization of $S^{-1}$, written as $ZZ^T=S^{-1}$, is used to transform the general matrix eigenvalue problem into a standard matrix eigenvalue problem. Here we present a mixed precision iterative refinement algorithm where $Z$ is given recursively using matrix-matrix multiplications and can be computed with high performance on Tensor cores. To understand the performance and accuracy of Tensor cores, comparisons are made to GPU-only implementations in single and double precision. Additionally, we propose a non-parametric stopping criteria which is robust in the face of lower precision floating point operations. The algorithm is particularly useful when we have a good initial guess to $Z$, for example, from previous time steps in quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations or from a previous iteration in a geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>A characterization of entangled two-qubit states via partial-transpose-moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although quantum entanglement is an important resource, its characterization is quite challenging. The partial transposition is a common method to detect bipartite entanglement. In this paper, the authors study the partial-transpose(PT)-moments of two-qubit states,and completely describe the whole region, composed of the second and third PT-moments, for all two-qubit states. Furthermore, they determine the accurate region corresponding to all entangled two-qubit states. The states corresponding to those boundary points of the whole region, and to the border lines between separable and entangled states are analyzed. As an application, they characterize the entangled region of PT-moments for the two families of Werner states and Bell-diagonal states. The relations between entanglement and the pairs of PT-moments are revealed from these typical examples. They also numerically plot the whole region of possible PT-moments for all two-qubit X-states, and find that this region is almost the same as the whole region of PT-moments for all two-qubit states. Moreover, they extend their results to detect the entanglement of multiqubit states. By utilizing the PT-moment-based method to characterize the entanglement of the multiqubit states mixed by the GHZ and W states, they propose an operational way of verifying the genuine entanglement in such states.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Signature of the Superradiant Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement and quantum correlations between atoms are not usually considered key ingredients of the superradiant phase transition. Here we consider the Tavis-Cummings model, a solvable system of two-levels atoms, coupled with a single-mode quantized electromagnetic field. This system undergoes a superradiant phase transition, even in a finite-size framework, accompanied by a spontaneous symmetry breaking, and an infinite sequence of energy level crossings. We find approximated expressions for the ground state, its energy, and the position of the level crossings, valid in the limit of a very large number of photons with respect to that of the atoms. In that same limit, we find that the number of photons scales quadratically with the coupling strength, and linearly with the system size, providing a new insight into the superradiance phenomenon. Resorting to novel multipartite measures, we then demonstrate that this quantum phase transition is accompanied by a crossover in the quantum correlations and entanglement between the atoms (qubits). The latters therefore represent suited order parameters for this transition. Finally, we show that these properties of the quantum phase transition persist in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian statistics in static and dynamic Galton boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbing the arrangements of pegs on a static Galton board can result in non-trivial stationary distributions, which in the continuum limit correspond to departure from regular gaussian behavior. Two such distributions are obtained. Further, the distributions generated for a dynamic galton board under external forcing in a general direction are obtained by solution of the corresponding stochastic differential equations. Exact cumulant generating functions for the distribution are presented for forcing in one dimension. An approximate expression, correct to first order in the forcing amplitude, is presented for the case of two dimensions. Both cases show nontrivial departures from the static gaussian solution.</description>

      <title>Contactifications: a Lagrangian description of compact Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $\eta$ is a contact form on a manifold $M$ such that the orbits of the Reeb vector field form a simple foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $M$, then the presymplectic 2-form $d\eta$ on $M$ induces a symplectic structure $\omega$ on the quotient manifold $N=M/\mathcal{F}$. We call $(M,\eta)$ a $\textit contactification$ of the symplectic manifold $(N,\omega)$. First, we present an explicit geometric construction of contactifications of some coadjoint orbits of connected Lie groups. Our construction is a far going generalization of the well-known contactification of the complex projective space $\mathbb{C}P^{n-1}$, being the unit sphere $S^{2n-1}$ in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$, and equipped with the restriction of the Liouville 1-form on $\mathbb{C}^n$. Second, we describe a constructive procedure for obtaining contactification in the process of the Marsden-Weinstein-Meyer symplectic reduction and indicate geometric obstructions for the existence of compact contactifications. Third, we show that contactifications provide a nice geometrical tool for a Lagrangian description of Hamiltonian systems on compact symplectic manifolds $(N,\omega)$, on which symplectic forms never admit a `vector potential'.</description>

      <title>On the non-existence of oscillation numbers in Sturm-Liouville theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an old conjecture that relates the existence of non-real eigenvalues of Sturm-Liouville Dirichlet problems on a finite interval to the non-existence of oscillation numbers of its real eigenfunctions, [[6], p.104, Problems 3 and 5]. This extends to the general case, a previous result in [1], [2] where it was shown that the presence of even one pair of non-real eigenvalues implies the non-existence of a positive eigenfunction (or ground state). We also provide estimates on the Haupt and Richardson indices and Haupt and Richardson numbers thereby complementing the original Sturm oscillation theorem with the Haupt-Richardson oscillation theorem discovered over 100 years ago with estimates on the missing oscillation numbers of the real eigenfunctions observed.</description>

Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem for tensor product random variables $c_k:=a_k \otimes a_k$, where $(a_k)_{k \in \mathbb{N}}$ is a free family of variables. We show that if the variables $a_k$ are centered, the limiting law is the semi-circle. Otherwise, the limiting law depends on the mean and variance of the variables $a_k$ and corresponds to a free interpolation between the semi-circle law and the classical convolution of two semi-circle laws.</description>

      <title>ATOMMIC: An Advanced Toolbox for Multitask Medical Imaging Consistency to facilitate Artificial Intelligence applications from acquisition to analysis in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AI is revolutionizing MRI along the acquisition and processing chain. Advanced AI frameworks have been developed to apply AI in various successive tasks, such as image reconstruction, quantitative parameter map estimation, and image segmentation. Existing frameworks are often designed to perform tasks independently or are focused on specific models or datasets, limiting generalization. We introduce ATOMMIC, an open-source toolbox that streamlines AI applications for accelerated MRI reconstruction and analysis. ATOMMIC implements several tasks using DL networks and enables MultiTask Learning (MTL) to perform related tasks integrated, targeting generalization in the MRI domain. We first review the current state of AI frameworks for MRI through a comprehensive literature search and by parsing 12,479 GitHub repositories. We benchmark 25 DL models on eight publicly available datasets to present distinct applications of ATOMMIC on accelerated MRI reconstruction, image segmentation, quantitative parameter map estimation, and joint accelerated MRI reconstruction and image segmentation utilizing MTL. Our findings demonstrate that ATOMMIC is the only MTL framework with harmonized complex-valued and real-valued data support. Evaluations on single tasks show that physics-based models, which enforce data consistency by leveraging the physical properties of MRI, outperform other models in reconstructing highly accelerated acquisitions. Physics-based models that produce high reconstruction quality can accurately estimate quantitative parameter maps. When high-performing reconstruction models are combined with robust segmentation networks utilizing MTL, performance is improved in both tasks. ATOMMIC facilitates MRI reconstruction and analysis by standardizing workflows, enhancing data interoperability, integrating unique features like MTL, and effectively benchmarking DL models.</description>

      <title>Exponential localization for eigensections of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotic spectral properties of the Bochner-Schr\"odinger operator $H_{p}=\frac 1p\Delta^{L^p\otimes E}+V$ on high tensor powers of a Hermitian line bundle $L$ twisted by a Hermitian vector bundle $E$ on a Riemannian manifold $X$ of bounded geometry under assumption that the curvature form of $L$ is non-degenerate. At an arbitrary point $x_0$ of $X$ the operator $H_p$ can be approximated by a model operator $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$, which is a Schr\"odinger operator with constant magnetic field. For large $p$, the spectrum of $H_p$ asymptotically coincides, up to order $p^{-1/4}$, with the union of the spectra of the model operators $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$ over $X$. We show that, if the union of the spectra of $\mathcal H^{(x_0)}$ over the complement of a compact subset of $X$ has a gap, then the spectrum of $H_{p}$ in the gap is discrete and the corresponding eigensections decay exponentially away the compact subset.</description>

      <title>Fibering polarizations and Mabuchi rays on symmetric spaces of compact type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe holomorphic quantizations of the cotangent bundle of a symmetric space of compact type $T^*(U/K)\cong U_\mathbb{C}/K_\mathbb{C}$, along Mabuchi rays of $U$-invariant K\"ahler structures. At infinite geodesic time, the K\"ahler polarizations converge to a mixed polarization $\mathcal{P}_\infty$. We show how a generalized coherent state transform relates the quantizations along the Mabuchi geodesics such that holomorphic sections converge, as geodesic time goes to infinity, to distributional $\mathcal{P}_\infty$-polarized sections. Unlike in the case of $T^*U$, the gCST mapping from the Hilbert space of vertically polarized sections are not asymptotically unitary due to the appearance of representation dependent factors associated to the isotypical decomposition for the $U$-action. In agreement with the general program outlined in [Bai+23], we also describe how the quantization in the limit polarization $\mathcal{P}_\infty$ is given by the direct sum of the quantizations for all the symplectic reductions relative to the invariant torus action associated to the Hamiltonian action of $U$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.01142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the generic $\tau$-function of the Painlev\'e II equation as a Fredholm determinant of an integrable (Its-Izergin-Korepin-Slavnov) operator. The $\tau$-function depends on the isomonodromic time $t$ and two Stokes' parameters, and the vanishing locus of the $\tau$-function, called the Malgrange divisor is determined by the zeros of the Fredholm determinant.</description>

      <title>Conjugate Operators of 1D-harmonic Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conjugate operator $T$ of 1D-harmonic oscillator $N=1/2 (p^2+q^2-1)$ is defined by an operator satisfying canonical commutation relation $[N,T]=-i$ on some domain but not necessarily dense. The angle operator $T_A=1/2 (\arctan q^{-1} p+\arctan pq^{-1} )$ and Galapon operator $T_G=i \sum_{n=0}^\infty(\sum_{m\neq n}\frac{(v_m,\cdot) }{n-m}v_n)$ are examples of conjugate operators, where ${v_n}$ denotes the set of normalized eigenvectors of $N$. Let $T$ be a subset of conjugate operators of $N$. A classification of $T$ are given as $T=T_{\{0\}}\cup T_{D\setminus \{0\}}\cup T_{\partial D}$, and $T_A\in T_{\{0\}}$ and $T_G\in T_{\partial D}$ are shown. Here the classification is specified by a pair of parameters $(\omega,m)\in C\times N$. Finally the time evolution $T_{\omega,m}(t)=e^{itN} T_{\omega,m}e^{-itN}$ for $T_{\omega,m}\in T$ is investigated, and show that $T_{\omega,m}(t)$ is periodic.</description>

      <title>BPHZ renormalisation and vanishing subcriticality asymptotics of the fractional $\Phi^3_d$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13028</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.13028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider stochastic PDEs on the $d$-dimensional torus with fractional Laplacian of parameter $\rho\in(0,2]$, quadratic nonlinearity and driven by space-time white noise. These equations are known to be locally subcritical, and thus amenable to the theory of regularity structures, if and only if $\rho &gt; d/3$. Using a series of recent results by the second named author, A. Chandra, I. Chevyrev, M. Hairer and L. Zambotti, we obtain precise asymptotics on the renormalisation counterterms as the mollification parameter $\varepsilon$ becomes small and $\rho$ approaches its critical value. In particular, we show that the counterterms behave like a negative power of $\varepsilon$ if $\varepsilon$ is superexponentially small in $(\rho-d/3)$, and are otherwise of order $\log(\varepsilon^{-1})$. This work also serves as an illustration of the general theory of BPHZ renormalisation in a relatively simple situation.</description>

      <title>Infinite disorder renormalization fixed point for the continuum random field Ising chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the continuum version of the random field Ising model in one dimension: this model arises naturally as weak disorder scaling limit of the original Ising model. Like for the Ising model, a spin configuration is conveniently described as a sequence of spin domains with alternating signs (domain-wall structure). We show that for fixed centered external field and as spin-spin couplings become large, the domain-wall structure scales to a disorder dependent limit that coincides with the infinite disorder fixed point process introduced by D. S. Fisher in the context of zero temperature quantum Ising chains. In particular, our results establish a number of predictions that one can find in [Fisher, Le Doussal and Monthus 2001]. The infinite disorder fixed point process for centered external field is equivalently described in terms of the process of suitably selected extrema of a Brownian trajectory introduced and studied by J. Neveu and J. Pitman [Neveu and Pitman 1989]. This characterization of the infinite disorder fixed point is one of the important ingredients of our analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00601v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Williamson's theorem is well known for symmetric matrices. In this paper, we state and re-derive some of the cases of Williamson's theorem for symmetric positive-semi definite matrices and symmetric matrices having negative index 1, due to H\"ormander. We prove theorems that guarantee conditions under which two symmetric positive-definite matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized in the sense of Williamson's theorem and their corollaries. Finally, we provide an application of this result to physical systems and another connecting the decompositions for the degenerate and non-degenerate cases, involving phase space constraints that we later apply to phase space cylinders and ellipsoids via symplectic capacities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the first relationship between Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) in the supercritical (a.k.a. strongly coupled) phase, which corresponds to central charge values $\mathbf c_{\mathrm L} \in (1,25)$ or equivalently to complex values of $\gamma$ with $|\gamma|=2$. More precisely, we introduce a canonical supercritical LQG surface with the topology of the disk. We then show that for each $\mathbf c_{\mathrm L} \in (1,25)$ there is a coupling of this LQG surface with a conformal loop ensemble with parameter $\kappa=4$ (CLE$_4$) wherein the LQG surfaces parametrized by the regions enclosed by the CLE$_4$ loops are conditionally independent supercritical LQG disks given their boundary lengths. In this coupling, the CLE$_4$ is neither determined by nor independent from the LQG. Guided by our coupling result, we exhibit a combinatorially natural family of loop-decorated random planar maps whose scaling limit we conjecture to be the supercritical LQG disk coupled to CLE$_4$. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Hartree and Schr\"{o}dinger equations describing the time evolution of wave functions of infinitely many interacting fermions in three-dimensional space. These equations can be formulated using density operators, and they have infinitely many stationary solutions. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic stability of a wide class of stationary solutions. We emphasize that our result includes Fermi gas at zero temperature. This is one of the most important steady states from the physics point of view; however, its asymptotic stability has been left open after Lewin and Sabin first formulated this stability problem and gave significant results in their seminal work [arXiv:1310.0604].</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process with Slow Boundaries: A Hydrodynamic Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the one-dimensional model of the symmetric simple exclusion process slowly coupled with two unequal reservoirs at the boundaries. In its non-equilibrium stationary state, the large deviations functions of density and current have been recently derived using exact microscopic analysis by Derrida, Hirschberg and Sadhu in J. Stat. Phys. 182, 15 (2021). We present an independent derivation using the hydrodynamic approach of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT). The slow coupling introduces additional boundary terms in the MFT-action, which modifies the spatial boundary conditions for the associated variational problem. For the density large deviations, we explicitly solve the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations using a simple local transformation of the optimal fields. For the current large deviations, our solution is obtained using the additivity principle. In addition to recovering the expression of the large deviations functions, our solution describes the most probable path for these rare fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Cutting $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity by Schramm-Loewner evolution for $\kappa \not\in \{\gamma^2, 16/\gamma^2\}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11455v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many deep and useful theorems relating Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE$_\kappa$) and Liouville quantum gravity ($\gamma$-LQG) in the case when the parameters satisfy $\kappa \in \{\gamma^2, 16/\gamma^2\}$. Roughly speaking, these theorems say that the SLE$_\kappa$ curve cuts the $\gamma$-LQG surface into two or more independent $\gamma$-LQG surfaces. We extend these theorems to the case when $\kappa \not\in \{\gamma^2, 16/\gamma^2\}$. Roughly speaking we show that if we have an appropriate variant of SLE$_\kappa$ and an independent $\gamma$-LQG disk, then the SLE curve cuts the LQG disk into two or more $\gamma$-LQG surfaces which are conditionally independent given the values along the SLE curve of a certain collection of auxiliary imaginary geometry fields, viewed modulo conformal coordinate change. These fields are sampled independently from the SLE and the LQG and have the property that that the sum of the central charges associated with the SLE$_\kappa$ curve, the $\gamma$-LQG surface, and the auxiliary fields is 26. This condition on the central charge is natural from the perspective of bosonic string theory. We also prove analogous statements when the SLE curve is replaced by, e.g., an LQG metric ball or a Brownian motion path. Statements of this type were conjectured by Sheffield and are continuum analogs of certain Markov properties of random planar maps decorated by two or more statistical physics models. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

      <title>The Case Against Smooth Null Infinity V: Early-Time Asymptotics of Linearised Gravity Around Schwarzschild for Fixed Spherical Harmonic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from Post-Newtonian predictions for a system of $N$ infalling masses from the infinite past, we formulate and solve a scattering problem for the system of linearised gravity around Schwarzschild as introduced in [DHR19]. The scattering data are posed on a null hypersurface $\mathcal C$ emanating from a section of past null infinity $\mathcal I^-$, and on the part of $\mathcal I^-$ that lies to the future of this section: Along $\mathcal C$, we implement the Post-Newtonian theory-inspired hypothesis that the gauge-invariant components of the Weyl tensor $\alpha$ and $\underline{\alpha}$ (a.k.a. $\Psi_0$ and $\Psi_4$) decay like $r^{-3}$, $r^{-4}$, respectively, and we exclude incoming radiation from $\mathcal I^-$ by demanding the News function to vanish along $\mathcal I^-$.
  We also show that compactly supported gravitational perturbations along $\mathcal I^-$ induce very similar data, with $\alpha$, $\underline{\alpha}$ decaying like $r^{-3}$, $r^{-5}$ along $\mathcal C$.
  After constructing the unique solution to this scattering problem, we provide a complete analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of projections onto fixed spherical harmonic number $\ell$ near spacelike $i^0$ and future null infinity $\mathcal I^+$. Using our results, we also give constructive corrections to popular historical notions of asymptotic flatness such as Bondi coordinates or asymptotic simplicity. In particular, confirming earlier heuristics due to Damour and Christodoulou, we find that the peeling property is violated both near $\mathcal I^-$ and near $\mathcal I^+$, with e.g. $\alpha$ near $\mathcal I^+$ only decaying like $r^{-4}$ instead of $r^{-5}$. We also find that the resulting solution decays slower towards $i^0$ than often assumed, with $\alpha$ decaying like $r^{-3}$ towards $i^0$.
  The issue of summing up the fixed angular mode estimates in $\ell$ is dealt with in forthcoming work.</description>

Abstract: A new type of high-dimensional Lie superalgebras is constructed, including Lie superalgebras spo(4,2) and osp(4,2). Based on it, two different coupled nonisospectral super AKNS hierarchies and their bi-Hamiltonian structures are obtained. Then, the Lie superalgebras spo(4,2) and osp(4,2) are expanded to infinite-dimensional Lie superalgebras spo(2N,2) and osp(2N,2). It follows that we present the generation of multi-component super integrable hierarchy, and deduce two different multi-component super integrable AKNS hierarchies and their Hamiltonian structures.</description>

      <title>Discrete minimizers of the interaction energy in collective behavior: a brief numerical and analytic review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider minimizers of the N-particle interaction potential energy and briefly review numerical methods used to calculate them. We consider simple pair potentials which are repulsive at short distances and attractive at long distances, focusing on examples which are sums of two powers. The range of powers we look at includes the well-known case of the Lennard-Jones potential, but we are also interested in less singular potentials which are relevant in collective behavior models. We report on results using the software GMIN developed by Wales and collaborators for problems in chemistry. For all cases, this algorithm gives good candidates for the minimizers for relatively low values of the particle number N. This is well-known for potentials similar to Lennard-Jones, but not for the range which is of interest in collective behavior. Standard minimization procedures have been used in the literature in this range, but they are likely to yield stationary states which are not minimizers. We illustrate numerically some properties of the minimizers in 2D, such as lattice structure, Wulff shapes, and the continuous large-N limit for locally integrable (that is, less singular) potentials.</description>

Abstract: We consider a class of percolation models where the local occupation variables have long-range correlations decaying as a power law $\sim r^{-a}$ at large distances $r$, for some $0&lt; a&lt; d$ where $d$ is the underlying spatial dimension. For several of these models, we present both, rigorous analytical results and matching simulations that determine the critical exponents characterizing the fixed point associated to their phase transition, which is of second order. The exact values we obtain are rational functions of the two parameters $a$ and $d$ alone, and do not depend on the specifics of the model.</description>

      <title>Metrizability of SO(3)-invariant connections: Riemann versus Finsler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a torsion-free affine connection on a given manifold, which does not necessarily arise as the Levi-Civita connection of any pseudo-Riemannian metric, it is still possible that it corresponds in a canonical way to a Finsler structure; this property is known as Finsler (or Berwald-Finsler) metrizability. In the present paper, we clarify, for 4-dimensional SO(3)-invariant, Berwald-Finsler metrizable connections, the issue of the existence of an affinely equivalent pseudo-Riemannian structure. In particular, we find all classes of SO(3)-invariant connections which are not Levi-Civita connections for any pseudo-Riemannian metric - hence, are non-metric in a conventional way - but can still be metrized by SO(3)-invariant Finsler functions. The implications for physics, together with some examples are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>
