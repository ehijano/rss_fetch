      <title>Inverse Diffusion Approximation for Extraction of Scattering and Absorption Coefficients in Highly Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon transport through a diffusing slab can be described by the radiative transfer equation (RTE). When the slab is highly scattering and weakly absorbing, the RTE simplifies to the diffusion equation. In this paper, an inverse diffusion approximation (IDA) method is numerically developed to determine the optical properties (reduced scattering $\mu'_s$ and absorption coefficient $\mu_a$) of a homogeneous slab using simple reflectance and transmission measurements with a spectrometer. The reflectance and transmission of a diffusing slab with an arbitrary thickness can then be predicted by solving the forward problem by using the calculated $\mu'_s$ and $\mu_a$. Our method is validated both numerically, by directly comparing with Monte-Carlo simulations, and experimentally, by comparing with measurements on ZnO/PDMS and TiO$_2$/PDMS composite polymer films with varying thicknesses. The IDA method is also applied to distinguish between different types of tissue. Overall, our method could be used to guide the design of radiative cooling reflectors, or lighting and optical display diffusers for applications in medical imaging and other fields.</description>

      <title>Modelling Optomechanical Responses in Optical Tweezers Beyond Paraxial Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically levitated dielectric nanoparticles have become valuable tools for precision sensing and quantum optomechanical experiments. To predict the dynamic properties of a particle trapped in an optical tweezer with high fidelity, a tool is needed to compute the particle's response to the given optical field accurately. Here, we utilise a numerical solution of the three-dimensional trapping light to accurately simulate optical tweezers and predict key optomechanical parameters. By controlling the numerical aperture and measuring the the particle's oscillation frequencies in the trap, we validate the accuracy of our method. We foresee broad applications of this method in the field of levitodynamics, where precise characterisation of optical tweezers is essential for estimating parameters ranging from motional frequencies to scattering responses of the particle with various dielectric properties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a monolithically integrated terahertz optoelectronics (MITO) platform that uses quantum well (QW) structures to enable tunable terahertz signal generation and detection on a single chip. Through photomixing in QW PIN photodiodes, the MITO platform achieves terahertz generation and detection with substantially enhanced power efficiency and sensitivity over previous devices. By integrating semiconductor optical amplifiers, lasers, modulators, filters, demultiplexers, and other passive optical components with photomixers using commercially available photonic integrated circuit foundry processes, this platform supports the development of compact, scalable terahertz systems capable of high-speed data transfer, spectroscopy, and hyperspectral imaging. This advancement positions terahertz technology for widespread use, facilitating practical applications across remote sensing, communications, and medical diagnostics within portable devices.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Time Interfaces in Wire Media: Innovations for Subwavelength Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study temporal interfaces between media with strong spatial dispersion and dielectrics. In particular, we consider a temporal discontinuity that transforms a wire medium sample, a metamaterial with resonant spatial dispersion, into a uniaxial dielectric. We show that this transition results in a transformation of the deeply subwavelength spatial spectrum of TEM waves propagating in the wire medium at a certain frequency into a spectrum of plane waves at new frequencies that are all higher than the initial one. The waves at different frequencies propagate in different directions. Their complex amplitudes and propagation directions are uniquely related to the amplitudes of the spatial harmonics of the fields which existed before the transition. We explain how to implement this transition. The revealed effect may result in a promising method of subwavelength imaging.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fluorescence in a Scattering Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Often only small amounts of sample are available for spectroscopic analytical determinations. This work investigates the enhancement of signal in columns packed with silica particles. We propose that silica particles cause the light to scatter through the column, effectively increasing optical path length. Packed columns are shown to be effective with fluorescence spectroscopy, but results were inconclusive with absorbance spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Perfecting Imperfect Physical Neural Networks with Transferable Robustness using Sharpness-Aware Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI models are essential in science and engineering, but recent advances are pushing the limits of traditional digital hardware. To address these limitations, physical neural networks (PNNs), which use physical substrates for computation, have gained increasing attention. However, developing effective training methods for PNNs remains a significant challenge. Current approaches, regardless of offline and online training, suffer from significant accuracy loss. Offline training is hindered by imprecise modeling, while online training yields device-specific models that can't be transferred to other devices due to manufacturing variances. Both methods face challenges from perturbations after deployment, such as thermal drift or alignment errors, which make trained models invalid and require retraining. Here, we address the challenges with both offline and online training through a novel technique called Sharpness-Aware Training (SAT), where we innovatively leverage the geometry of the loss landscape to tackle the problems in training physical systems. SAT enables accurate training using efficient backpropagation algorithms, even with imprecise models. PNNs trained by SAT offline even outperform those trained online, despite modeling and fabrication errors. SAT also overcomes online training limitations by enabling reliable transfer of models between devices. Finally, SAT is highly resilient to perturbations after deployment, allowing PNNs to continuously operate accurately under perturbations without retraining. We demonstrate SAT across three types of PNNs, showing it is universally applicable, regardless of whether the models are explicitly known. This work offers a transformative, efficient approach to training PNNs, addressing critical challenges in analog computing and enabling real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Design of Dual-Band Plasmonic Absorber for Biomedical Sensing and Environmental Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a dual-band plasmonic absorber designed for simultaneous sensing applications in the near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) regions. The absorber, composed of silver nanostructures on a metal plate with a dielectric spacer, exhibits a combination of localized and gap surface plasmon resonances, resulting in two distinct absorption peaks in theoretical analysis based on the FDTD method. Numerical simulations also validate the sensor's high refractive index sensitivity, enabling the detection of biomolecules, proteins, viruses, and various solutes in aqueous solutions. The absorber demonstrates significant resonance shifts, making it a promising candidate for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and chemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Bound states in the continuum of infinite quality factor in finite unit cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theory based on the superposition principle is developed to uncover the basic physics of the wave behavior in a finite grating of N unit cells. The theory reveals that bound states in the continuum (BICs) of infinite quality factor (Q-factor) can be supported by such grating when the perfect reflection is introduced at its boundaries. If geometrical perturbations are introduced in the structure, the dark BICs transit to bright quasi-BICs of finite Q-factor, whose spectral behaviors are nearly the same as that of quasi-BICs supported by infinite gratings. When the boundaries are replaced with metallic mirrors of high reflectivity, the Q-factor of the resonant mode is reduced to be finite; however, it can be much larger than that in the corresponding nanostructure of open boundaries and can be tuned in a large range by varying the number of unit cells or boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Micrometer-resolution fluorescence and lifetime mappings of CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal films coupled with a TiO$_2$ grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing light emission from perovskite nanocrystal (NC) films is essential in light-emitting devices, as their conventional stacks often restrict the escape of emitted light. This work addresses this challenge by employing a TiO$_2$ grating to enhance light extraction and shape the emission of CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal films. Angle-resolved photoluminescence (PL) demonstrated a tenfold increase in emission intensity by coupling the Bloch resonances of the grating with the spontaneous emission of the perovskite NCs. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) provided micrometer-resolution mapping of both PL intensity and lifetime across a large area, revealing a decrease in PL lifetime from 8.2 ns for NC films on glass to 6.1 ns on the TiO$_2$ grating. Back focal plane (BFP) spectroscopy confirmed how the Bloch resonances transformed the unpolarized, spatially incoherent emission of NCs into polarized and directed light. These findings provide further insights into the interactions between dielectric nanostructures and perovskite NC films, offering possible pathways for designing better performing perovskite optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced third-harmonic generation and degenerate four-wave mixing in an all-dielectric metasurfaces via Brillouin zone folding-induced bound states in the continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) exhibit significant electric field confinement capabilities and have recently been employed to enhance nonlinear optics response at the nanoscale. In this study, we achieve substantial enhancement of third-harmonic generation (THG) and degenerate four-wave mixing (dFWM) by implementing Brillouin zone folding-induced BICs (BZF-BICs) in an air-hole type nonlinear metasurface. By introducing gap perturbations within the metasurface, guided modes below the light line can be folded into the light cone, resulting in three resonant modes: guided resonances (GRs), $\Gamma$-BICs, and BZF-BICs. Through the eigenvalue analysis and multipole decompositions, we establish their excitation conditions. With their resonantly enhanced local field, we successfully boost both THG and dFWM under $x$- and $y$- polarizations within the same metasurfaces. The simulated results indicate that the BZF-BICs provide the most significant enhancement of third-order nonlinear optical responses, with the output power of THG to 10$^{-4}$ W and dFWM output power of 10$^{-2}$ W under a moderate input power density of 1 MW/cm$^{2}$. These findings demonstrate that the BZF-BICs can offer an effective pathway for chip-scale nonlinear optical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in optical technology have significantly enhanced the resolution of imaging of living cells, achieving nanometer-scale precision. However, the crowded three-dimensional environment within cells presents a challenge for measuring the spatio-temporal dynamics of cellular components. One solution to this issue is expansion microscopy, which cannot be used for living cells. Here, we present a method for flattening live cells to a thickness of down to 200 nanometers by confining them between two surface-treated transparent plates. The anti-fouling coating on the surfaces restricts the cells to a quasi-two-dimensional space by exerting osmotic control and preventing surface adhesion. This technique increases the distance between cellular components, thereby enabling high-resolution imaging of their spatio-temporal dynamics. The viability and phenotype of various cell types are demonstrated to be unaltered upon release from flat-cell confinement. The flat cell imaging method is a robust and straightforward technique, making it a practical choice for optical microscopy.</description>

      <title>X-ray Phase Measurements by Time-Energy Correlated Photon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The invention of X-ray interferometers has led to advanced phase-sensing devices that are invaluable in various applications. These include the precise measurement of universal constants, e.g. the Avogadro number, of lattice parameters of perfect crystals, and phase-contrast imaging, which resolves details that standard absorption imaging cannot capture. However, the sensitivity and robustness of conventional X-ray interferometers are constrained by factors, such as fabrication precision, beam quality, and, importantly, noise originating from external sources or the sample itself. In this work, we demonstrate a novel X-ray interferometric method of phase measurement with enhanced immunity to various types of noise, by extending, for the first time, the concept of the SU(1,1) interferometer into the X-ray regime. We use a monolithic silicon perfect crystal device with two thin lamellae to generate correlated photon pairs via spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). Arrival time coincidence and sum-energy filtration allow a high-precision separation of the correlated photon pairs, which carry the phase information from orders-of-magnitude larger uncorrelated photonic noise. The novel SPDC-based interferometric method presented here is anticipated to exhibit enhanced immunity to vibrations as well as to mechanical and photonic noise, compared to conventional X-ray interferometers. Therefore, this SU(1,1) X-ray interferometer should pave the way to unprecedented precision in phase measurements, with transformative implications for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Fast and Automated Optical Polarization Compensation of Fiber Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarization of light is critical in various applications, including quantum communication, where the photon polarization encoding a qubit can undergo uncontrolled changes when transmitted through optical fibers. Bends in the fiber, internal and external stresses, and environmental factors cause these polarization changes, which lead to errors and therein limit the range of quantum communication. To prevent this, we present a fast and automated method for polarization compensation using liquid crystals. This approach combines polarimetry based on a rotating quarter-waveplate with high-speed control of the liquid-crystal cell, offering high-fidelity compensation suitable for diverse applications. Our method directly solves for compensation parameters, avoiding reliance on stochastic approaches or cryptographic metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves over 99% fidelity within an average of fewer than six iterations, with further fine-tuning to reach above 99.5% fidelity, providing a robust solution for maintaining precise polarization states in optical systems.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable quantum correlations of dipolar polaritons with micrometer-scale blockade radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extreme yet reconfigurable nonlinear response to a single photon by a photonic system is crucial for realizing a universal two-photon gate, an elementary building block for photonic quantum computing. Yet such a response, characterized by the photon blockade effect, has only been achieved in atomic systems or solid states ones that are difficult to scale up. Here we demonstrate electrically tunable partial photon blockade in dipolar waveguide polaritons on a semiconductor chip, measured via photon-correlations. Remarkably, these "dipolar photons" display a two-orders-of-magnitude stronger nonlinearity compared to unpolarized polaritons, with an extracted dipolar blockade radius up to more than 4 $\mu$m, significantly larger than the optical wavelength, and comparable to that of atomic Rydberg polaritons. Furthermore, we show that the dipolar interaction can be electrically switched and locally configured by simply tuning the gate voltage. Finally we show that with a simple modification of the design, a full photon blockade is expected, setting a new route towards scalable, reconfigurable, chip-integrated quantum photonic circuits with strong two-photon nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Normal and lateral Casimir-Lifshitz forces between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the normal and lateral components of the Casimir-Lifshitz (CL) force between a nanoparticle and 1D graphene grating deposited on a fused silica slab. For this purpose, the scattering matrix approach together with the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions are used. We find that, by covering a fused silica slab by a graphene grating, the spectrum of the normal CL force at small frequencies is increased by about 100% for a grating filling fraction of 0.5, and even more when the slab is completely covered. The typically employed additive approximation (the weighted average of the force with and without the graphene coating) cannot provide any information on the lateral CL force, and, as we show, cannot provide accurate estimation for the normal CL force. When the nanoparticle is laterally shifted ($x_A$), the normal CL force is modulated and remains attractive. On the contrary, the lateral CL force changes sign twice in each period, showing a series of alternating stable and unstable lateral equilibrium positions, occurring in the graphene strips and of the grating slits regions, respectively. Finally, we show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ ($d$ is the separation distance, and $D$ is the grating period). We identify two clear regions: a region ($d/D&lt;1.0$) where the lateral shift significantly affects the CL energy, and a region ($d/D \geq 1.0$) where this effect is negligible, with a crossover at $d\approx D$. Our predictions can have relevant implications to experiments and applications of the CL normal and lateral forces acting on nanoparticles interacting with structured objects at the nano/micro scale, and are also directly valid for atoms close to these nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation with dissimilar quantum dots over a hybrid quantum network</title>

Abstract: Photonic quantum information processing in metropolitan quantum networks lays the foundation for cloud quantum computing [1, 2], secure communication [3, 4], and the realization of a global quantum internet [5, 6]. This paradigm shift requires on-demand and high-rate generation of flying qubits and their quantum state teleportation over long distances [7]. Despite the last decade has witnessed an impressive progress in the performances of deterministic photon sources [8-11], the exploitation of distinct quantum emitters to implement all-photonic quantum teleportation among distant parties has remained elusive. Here, we overcome this challenge by using dissimilar quantum dots whose electronic and optical properties are engineered by light-matter interaction [12], multi-axial strain [13] and magnetic fields [14] so as to make them suitable for the teleportation of polarization qubits. This is demonstrated in a hybrid quantum network harnessing both fiber connections and 270 m free-space optical link connecting two buildings of the University campus in the center of Rome. The protocol exploits GPS-assisted synchronization, ultra-fast single photon detectors as well as stabilization systems that compensate for atmospheric turbulence. The achieved teleportation state fidelity reaches up to 82+-1%, above the classical limit by more than 10 standard deviations. Our field demonstration of all-photonic quantum teleportation opens a new route to implement solid-state based quantum relays and builds the foundation for practical quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear skin modes and fixed-points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional tight-binding lattice with asymmetrical couplings and various type of nonlinearities to study nonlinear non-Hermitian skin effect. Our focus is on the exploration of nonlinear skin modes through a fixed-point perspective. Nonlinearities are shown to have no impact on the spectral region in the semi-infinite system; however, they induce considerable changes when boundaries are present. The spectrum under open boundary conditions is found not to be a subset of the corresponding spectrum under the semi-infinite boundary conditions. We identify distinctive features of nonlinear skin modes, such as power-energy dependence, degeneracy, and power-energy discontinuity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a family of localized modes that are neither skin nor scale-free localized modes is formed with the introduction of a coupling impurity. Additionally, we show that an impurity can induce discrete dark and anti-dark solitons.</description>

      <title>Optothermally Induced Active and Chiral Motion of the Colloidal Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial soft matter systems have appeared as important tools to harness mechanical motion for microscale manipulation. Typically, this motion is driven either by the external fields or by mutual interaction between the colloids. In the latter scenario, dynamics arise from non-reciprocal interaction among colloids within a chemical environment. In contrast, we eliminate the need for a chemical environment by utilizing a large area of optical illumination to generate thermal fields. The resulting optothermal interactions introduce non-reciprocity to the system, enabling active motion of the colloidal structure. Our approach involves two types of colloids: passive and thermally active. The thermally active colloids contain absorbing elements that capture energy from the incident optical beam, creating localized thermal fields around them. In a suspension of these colloids, the thermal gradients generated drive nearby particles through attractive thermo-osmotic forces. We investigate the resulting dynamics, which lead to various swimming modes, including active propulsion and chiral motion. We have also experimentally validated certain simulated results. By exploring the interplay between optical forces, thermal effects, and particle interactions, we aim to gain insights into controlling colloidal behavior in non-equilibrium systems. This research has significant implications for directed self-assembly, microfluidic manipulation, and the study of active matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method called the complex frequency fingerprint (CFF) to detect the complex frequency Green's function, $G(\omega\in\mathbb{C})$, in a driven-dissipative system. By utilizing the CFF, we can measure the complex frequency density of states (DOS) and local DOS (LDOS), providing unique insights into the characterization of non-Hermitian systems. By applying our method to systems exhibiting the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), we demonstrate how to use our theory to detect both the non-Hermitian eigenvalues and eigenstates. This offers a distinctive and reliable approach to identifying the presence or absence of NHSE in experimental settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementing arbitrary unitary transformations is crucial for applications in quantum computing, signal processing, and machine learning. Unitaries govern quantum state evolution, enabling reversible transformations critical in quantum tasks like cryptography and simulation and playing key roles in classical domains such as dimensionality reduction and signal compression. Integrated optical waveguide arrays have emerged as a promising platform for these transformations, offering scalability for both quantum and classical systems. However, scalable and efficient methods for implementing arbitrary unitaries remain challenging. Here, we present a theoretical framework for realizing arbitrary unitary matrices through programmable waveguide arrays (PWAs). We provide a mathematical proof demonstrating that cascaded PWAs can implement any unitary matrix within practical constraints, along with a numerical optimization method for customized PWA designs. Our results establish PWAs as a universal and scalable architecture for quantum photonic computing, effectively bridging quantum and classical applications, and positioning PWAs as an enabling technology for advancements in quantum simulation, machine learning, secure communication, and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Capturing Nonlinear Electron Dynamics with Fully Characterised Attosecond X-ray Pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are the key to studying electron dynamics at their natural timescale in specifically targeted electronic states. They promise to build the conceptual bridge between physical and chemical photo-reaction processes. Free-electron lasers (FELs) have demonstrated their capability of generating intense attosecond X-ray pulses. The use of SASE-based FELs for time-resolving experiments and investigations of nonlinear X-ray absorption mechanisms, however, necessitates their full pulse-to-pulse characterisation which remains a cutting-edge challenge. We have characterised X-ray pulses with durations of down to 600 attoseconds and peak powers up to 200 GW at ~1 keV photon energy via angular streaking at the Small Quantum Systems instrument of the European XFEL in Germany. As a direct application, we present results of nonlinear X-ray--matter interaction via time-resolved electron spectroscopy on a transient system, observing single- and double-core-hole generation in neon atoms. Using the derived temporal information about each single X-ray pulse, we reveal an otherwise hidden peak-intensity dependence of the probability for formation of double-core vacancies in neon after primary K-shell ionisation. Our results advance the field of attosecond science with highly intense and fully characterised X-ray pulses to the state-specific investigation of electronic motion in non-stationary media.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

Abstract: Optical memristors represent a monumental leap in the fusion of photonics and electronics, heralding a new era of applications from neuromorphic computing to artificial intelligence. However, current technologies are hindered by complex fabrication, limited endurance, high optical loss or low modulation depth. For the first time, we reveal optical non-volatility in thin-film Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) by electrically manipulating the ferroelectric domains to control the refractive index, providing a brand-new routine for optical memristors. The developed PZT optical memristors offer unprecedented advantages more than exceptional performance metrics like low loss of &lt;2 dB/cm, high precision exceeding 6-bits, large modulation depth with an index change as large as 4.6x10-3. Additionally, these devices offer impressive stability, maintaining minimal wavelength variation for over three weeks and enduring more than 10,000 cycles, and require a mere 0.8 pJ of energy for non-volatile operation. The wafer-scale sol-gel fabrication process also ensures compatible with standardized mass fabrication processes and high scalability for photonic integration. Specially, these devices also demonstrate unique functional duality: setting above a threshold voltage enables non-volatile behaviors, below this threshold allows volatile high-speed optical modulation. This marks the first-ever optical memristor capable of performing high-speed (48 Gbps) and energy-efficient (450 fJ/bit) signal processing and non-volatile retention on a single platform, and is also the inaugural demonstration of scalable functional systems. The PZT optical memristors developed here facilitate the realization of novel paradigms for high-speed and energy-efficient optical interconnects, programmable PICs, quantum computing, neural networks, in-memory computing and brain-like architecture.</description>

      <title>Sensing atomic superfluid rotation beyond the standard quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic superfluids formed using Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a ring trap are currently being investigated in the context of superfluid hydrodynamics, quantum sensing and matter-wave interferometry. The characterization of the rotational properties of such superfluids is important, but can presently only be performed by using optical absorption imaging, which completely destroys the condensate. Recent studies have proposed coupling the ring BEC to optical cavity modes carrying orbital angular momentum to make minimally destructive measurements of the condensate rotation. The sensitivity of these proposals, however, is bounded below by the standard quantum limit set by the combination of laser shot noise and radiation pressure noise. In this work, we provide a theoretical framework that exploits the fact that the interaction between the scattered modes of the condensate and the light reduces to effective optomechanical equations of motion. We present a detailed theoretical analysis to demonstrate that the use of squeezed light and backaction evasion techniques allows the angular momentum of the condensate to be sensed with noise well below the standard quantum limit. Our proposal is relevant to atomtronics, quantum sensing and quantum information.</description>
