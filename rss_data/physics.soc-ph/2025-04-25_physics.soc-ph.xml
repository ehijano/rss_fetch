      <title>Graph Percolation as Decision Threshold for Risk Management in Cross-Country Thermal Soaring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long range flight by fixed-wing aircraft without propulsion systems can be accomplished by "soaring" -- exploiting randomly located updrafts to gain altitude which is expended in gliding flight. As the location of updrafts is uncertain and cannot be determined except through in situ observation, aircraft exploiting this energy source are at risk of failing to find a subsequent updraft. Determining when an updraft must be exploited to continue flight is essential to managing risk and optimizing speed. Graph percolation offers a theoretical explanation for this risk, and a framework for evaluating it using information available to the operator of a soaring aircraft in flight. The utility of graph percolation as a risk measure is examined by analyzing flight logs from human soaring pilots. This analysis indicates that in sport soaring pilots rarely operate in a condition which does not satisfy graph percolation, identifies an apparent desired minimum node degree, and shows that pilots accept reduced climb rates in order to maintain percolation.</description>

      <title>Structural roles and gender disparities in corruption networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criminal activities are predominantly due to males, with females exhibiting a significantly lower involvement, especially in serious offenses. This pattern extends to organized crime, where females are often perceived as less tolerant to illegal practices. However, the roles of males and females within corruption networks are less understood. Here, we analyze data from political scandals in Brazil and Spain to shed light on gender differences in corruption networks. Our findings reveal that females constitute 10% and 20% of all agents in the Brazilian and Spanish corruption networks, respectively, with these proportions remaining stable over time and across different scandal sizes. Despite this disparity in representation, centrality measures are comparable between genders, except among highly central individuals, for which males are further overrepresented. Additionally, gender has no significant impact on network resilience, whether through random dismantling or targeted attacks on the largest component. Males are more likely to be involved in multiple scandals than females, and scandals predominantly involving females are rare, though these differences are explained by a null network model in which gender is randomly assigned while maintaining gender proportions. Our results further reveal that the underrepresentation of females partially explains gender homophily in network associations, although in the Spanish network, male-to-male connections exceed expectations derived from a null model.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Shock Recovery in IO Networks with Priority Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical risks, such as droughts, floods, rising temperatures, earthquakes, infrastructure failures, and geopolitical conflicts, can ripple through global supply chains, raising costs, and constraining production across industries. Assessing these risks requires understanding not only their immediate effects, but also their cascading impacts. For example, a localized drought can disrupt the supply of critical raw materials such as cobalt or copper, affecting battery and electric vehicle production. Similarly, regional conflicts can impede cross-border trade, leading to broader economic consequences. Building on an existing model of simultaneous supply and demand shocks, we introduce a new propagation algorithm, Priority with Constraint, which modifies standard priority-based rationing by incorporating a minimum supply guarantee for all customers, regardless of their size or priority ranking. We also identify a buffer effect inherent in the Industry Proportional algorithm, which reflects real-world economic resilience. Finally, we extend the static shock propagation model to incorporate dynamic processes. We introduce mechanisms for gradual shock propagation, reflecting demand stickiness and the potential buffering role of inventories, and gradual recovery, modeling the simultaneous recovery of supply capacity and the inherent tendency for demand to return to pre-shock levels. Simulations demonstrate how the interplay between demand adjustment speed and supply recovery speed significantly influences the severity and duration of the economic impact after a shock.</description>

      <title>SimFLEX: a methodology for comparative analysis of urban areas for implementing new on-demand feeder bus services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-demand feeder bus services present an innovative solution to urban mobility challenges, yet their success depends on thorough assessment and strategic planning. Despite their potential, a comprehensive framework for evaluating feasibility and identifying suitable service areas remains underdeveloped. Simulation Framework for Feeder Location Evaluation (SimFLEX) uses spatial, demographic, and transport-specific data to run microsimulations and compute key performance indicators (KPIs), including service attractiveness, waiting time reduction, and added value. SimFLEX employs multiple replications to estimate demand and mode choices and integrates OpenTripPlanner (OTP) for public transport routing and ExMAS for calculating shared trip attributes and KPIs. For each demand scenario, we model the traveler learning process using the method of successive averages (MSA), stabilizing the system. After stabilization, we calculate KPIs for comparative and sensitivity analyzes. We applied SimFLEX to compare two remote urban areas in Krakow, Poland - Bronowice and Skotniki - the candidates for service launch. Our analysis revealed notable differences between analyzed areas: Skotniki exhibited higher service attractiveness (up to 30%) and added value (up to 7%), while Bronowice showed greater potential for reducing waiting times (by nearly 77%). To assess the reliability of our model output, we conducted a sensitivity analysis across a range of alternative-specific constants (ASC). The results consistently confirmed Skotniki as the superior candidate for service implementation. SimFLEX can be instrumental for policymakers to estimate new service performance in the considered area, publicly available and applicable to various use cases. It can integrate alternative models and approaches, making it a versatile tool for policymakers and urban planners to enhance urban mobility.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Balance Theory: Emergence of Instability in Follower Layer Below Critical Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchy significantly shapes interactions in social structures by organizing individuals or groups based on status, power, or privilege. This study investigates how hierarchy affects structural balance as temperature variations, which measure an individual's average irrationality in society. To address this question, we develop a two-layer balance model, the \enquote{leader layer}, which maintains structural balance exclusively through intra-layer interactions. Conversely, the \enquote{follower layer} maintains structural equilibrium through both inter- and intra-layer interactions. The Hamiltonian of the leading layer is independent, while the follower layer depends on its parameters as well as those of the leading layer. Analytical results from the mean-field approximation and exact Monte Carlo simulations show that instability arises in the equilibrium states of the follower layer when the temperature is below the critical threshold ($T&lt;T_c$), which is different from the structural Heider equilibrium. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the critical temperature is elevated in the follower layer.</description>

      <title>The need for statistical physics in Africa: perspective and an illustration in drug delivery problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of statistical physics in Africa is in its nascent stages, yet its application holds immense promise for advancing emerging research trends on the continent. This perspective paper, a product of a two-week workshop on biophysics in Morogoro (Tanzania), aims to illuminate the potential of statistical physics in regional scientific research. We employ in-silico atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the loading and delivery capabilities of lecithin nanolipids for niclosamide, a poorly water-soluble drug. Our simulations reveal that the loading capacity and interaction strength between lecithin nanolipids and niclosamide improve with increased lecithin concentrations. We perform a free-energy landscape analysis which uncovers two distinct metastable conformations of niclosamide within both the aqueous phase and the lecithin nanolipids. Over a simulation period of half a microsecond, lecithin nanolipids self-assemble into a spherical monolayer structure, providing detailed atomic-level insights into their interactions with niclosamide. These findings underscore the potential of lecithin nanolipids as efficient drug delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Strength and weakness of disease-induced herd immunity in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04700v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a fraction of a population becomes immune to an infectious disease, the population-wide infection risk decreases nonlinearly due to collective protection, known as herd immunity. Studies based on mean-field models suggest that natural infection in a heterogeneous population may induce herd immunity more efficiently than homogeneous immunization. Here, we theoretically explore network epidemic models to show that the opposite can also be true. We identify two competing mechanisms driving disease-induced herd immunity in networks: the biased distribution of immunity toward socially active individuals enhances herd immunity, while the topological localization of immune individuals weakens it. The effect of localization is stronger in networks embedded in a low-dimensional space, which can make disease-induced immunity less effective than random immunization. Our results highlight the role of networks in shaping herd immunity and call for a careful examination of model predictions that inform public health policies.</description>
