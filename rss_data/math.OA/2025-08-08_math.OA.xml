      <title>Paper-folding models for the CAR algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the CAR algebra admits a Cantor spectrum C*-diagonal that is not conjugate to the standard AF diagonal. We obtain this by classification theory of C*-algebras, and the diagonal arises by realising the CAR algebra as the crossed product of a free minimal action on the Cantor space, where the acting group is the product of a locally finite group with the infinite dihedral group. The main ingredient in the construction is a binary subshift associated to the well-known regular paper-folding sequence.
  Moreover, we show that the CAR algebra in fact admits countably many, pairwise non-conjugate, Cantor spectrum diagonals which are distinguished by the different values of their diagonal dimension, as defined by Li, Liao and the second named author.</description>

      <title>Hybrid oscillator-qudit quantum processors: stabilizer states and symplectic operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states. We construct general hybrid error-correcting codes by relating stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori and obtaining logical operators via Morita equivalence. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.</description>

      <title>Transfinite Operator Fixed Points on Hilbert Spaces: An Alpay Algebra Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a functional-analytic framework based on the transfinite iteration of a self-adjoint operator. Beginning with a densely defined self-adjoint operator $A$ on a Hilbert space $H$, a spectral-transform functor $\Phi$ is applied iteratively. This process generates a transfinite sequence of operators, $\{\Phi^{\alpha}(A)\}_{\alpha&lt;\Omega}$, by progressively enlarging the ambient Hilbert space at each ordinal stage. Under suitable continuity and monotonicity conditions on $\Phi$, it is established via transfinite induction that the sequence converges, stabilizing at a minimal ordinal $\Omega$ where $\Phi^{\Omega+1}(A) = \Phi^{\Omega}(A)$. The resultant limit operator, $A_{\infty} = \Phi^{\infty}(A)$, is a self-adjoint fixed point of the transformation, satisfying $\Phi(A_{\infty}) = A_{\infty}$. Its spectrum is characterized by the relation $$\sigma(A_{\infty})=\bigcap_{n&lt;\infty}f^{\,n}\bigl(\sigma(A)\bigr),$$ where $f$ is the spectral map induced by $\Phi$. For canonical transformations, such as $\Phi(A)=A^2$ or the semigroup action $\Phi_t(A)=e^{tA}$, the limit operator $A_{\infty}$ is identified as the orthogonal projection onto the iteratively invariant eigenspaces of the initial operator $A$. Principal contributions include a transfinite spectral-mapping theorem, a proof of the uniqueness of $A_{\infty}$ up to unitary equivalence, and a reinterpretation of the discrete iteration as an evolution semigroup on an $L^2$-type function space. The framework is demonstrated to subsume and generalize classical asymptotic-projection results. This study is partly motivated by the algebraic structures introduced by F. Alpay (arXiv:2505.15344). An appendix outlines a hierarchy of open problems in operator theory whose complexity is indexed by the iterative stage.</description>

Abstract: We prove a number of structure and isomorphism results concerning the non-commutative Natsume-Olsen spheres $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}_{\theta}$ deformed along a skew-symmetric matrix $\theta\in \mathbb{R}$. These include (a) the fact that two $C^*$-algebras of the form $\mathbb{S}^{3}_{\theta}\otimes M_n$ are isomorphic precisely in the obvious cases; (b) the fact that $m$ and $n$ are recoverable from the isomorphism class of $C(\mathbb{S}^{2m-1}_{\theta})\otimes M_n$; (c) the PI character, PI degree and Azumaya loci of $C(\mathbb{S}^{2m-1}_{\theta})$ for rational $\theta$, along with a realization of their centers as (function algebras of) branched cover of $\mathbb{S}^{2n-1}$ and (d) for rational $\theta$ again, the topological finite generation of $C(\mathbb{S}^{2m-1}_{\theta})$ over their centers, with algebraic finite generation equivalent to being classical (equivalently, Azumaya).</description>

      <title>Harmonic analysis and automatic continuity in the context of generalized differential subalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For appropriate parameters $k,p,q$, we introduce and systematically study the class of $(k,p,q)$-differential subalgebras. This is a vast class of Banach $^*$-algebras defined by their relation with their $C^*$-envelopes. Some examples are given by normable two-sided $^*$-ideals, domains of closed $^*$-derivations, full Hilbert algebras, and some weighted convolution algebras of various kinds. We prove that this class of algebras possesses various interesting properties, such as closedness under a functional calculus based on smooth functions, $^*$-regularity, Wiener's property $(W)$, and even properties of automatic continuity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12428v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the ideal completions of countable discrete groups, as introduced by Brown and Guentner, to second countable Hausdorff \'etale groupoids. Specifically, to every pair consisting of an algebraic ideal in the algebra of bounded Borel functions on the groupoid and a non-empty family of quasi-invariant measures on the unit space, we construct a $\rm C^*$-algebra in a way which naturally encapsulates the constructions of the full and reduced groupoid $\rm C^*$-algebras. We investigate the connection between these constructions and the Haagerup property, and use the construction to show the existence of many exotic groupoid $\rm C^*$-algebras for certain classes of groupoids.</description>

Abstract: We prove rigidity properties for von Neumann algebraic graph products. We introduce the notion of rigid graphs and define a class of II$_1$-factors named $\mathcal{C}_{\rm Rigid}$. For von Neumann algebras in this class we show a unique rigid graph product decomposition. In particular, we obtain unique prime factorization results and unique free product decomposition results for new classes of von Neumann algebras. Furthermore, we show that for many graph products of II$_1$-factors, including the hyperfinite II$_1$-factor, we can, up to a constant 2, retrieve the radius of the graph from the graph product. We also prove several technical results concerning relative amenability and embeddings of (quasi)-normalizers in graph products. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions for a graph product to be nuclear and characterize strong solidity, primeness and free-indecomposability for graph products.</description>

      <title>Real Noncommutative Convexity II: Extremality and nc convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue with the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convexity, following the recent and profound complex case developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the theory of nc extreme (and pure and maximal) points and the nc Choquet boundary in the real case, and on the theory of real nc convex and semicontinuous functions and real nc convex envelopes. Our main emphasis is on how these interact with complexification. For example some of our paper analyzes carefully how various notions of `extreme' or `maximal' interact with our earlier concept of the complexification of a convex set. Several new features appear in the real case, particularly in later sections of our paper, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex function, and the complexification of the convex envelope of a nc function. With an Appendix by T. Russell.</description>

      <title>Sharp concentration for sums of matrices with Markovian dependence through universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a sum of random matrices generated by a $\psi$-mixing Markov chain has similar spectral properties to a Gaussian matrix with the same mean and covariance structure. This nonasymptotic universality principle enables sharp concentration inequalities when combined with recent advances in the Gaussian literature. We illustrate the theory with examples, showing how it enables polynomial dimensional improvements relative to previous Markovian matrix concentration results when applied to Wigner-type matrices, and how one can recover sharp limiting values for a model used to study of spectral clustering techniques.
  A key challenge in the proof is that techniques based only on classical cumulants, which can be used when summands are independent, are not sufficient on their own for efficient estimates in a Markovian setting. Our approach exploits Boolean cumulants and a change--of--measure argument.</description>
