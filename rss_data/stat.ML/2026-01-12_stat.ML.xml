      <title>Machine learning assisted state prediction of misspecified linear dynamical system via modal reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of structural dynamics is imperative for preserving digital twin fidelity throughout operational lifetimes. Parametric models with fixed nominal parameters often omit critical physical effects due to simplifications in geometry, material behavior, damping, or boundary conditions, resulting in model form errors (MFEs) that impair predictive accuracy. This work introduces a comprehensive framework for MFE estimation and correction in high-dimensional finite element (FE) based structural dynamical systems. The Gaussian Process Latent Force Model (GPLFM) represents discrepancies non-parametrically in the reduced modal domain, allowing a flexible data-driven characterization of unmodeled dynamics. A linear Bayesian filtering approach jointly estimates system states and discrepancies, incorporating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. To ensure computational tractability, the FE system is projected onto a reduced modal basis, and a mesh-invariant neural network maps modal states to discrepancy estimates, permitting model rectification across different FE discretizations without retraining. Validation is undertaken across five MFE scenarios-including incorrect beam theory, damping misspecification, misspecified boundary condition, unmodeled material nonlinearity, and local damage demonstrating the surrogate model's substantial reduction of displacement and rotation prediction errors under unseen excitations. The proposed methodology offers a potential means to uphold digital twin accuracy amid inherent modeling uncertainties.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Generative Modeling Approach for Arbitrary Conditional Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern data analysis increasingly requires flexible conditional inference P(X_B | X_A) where (X_A, X_B) is an arbitrary partition of observed variable X. Existing conditional inference methods lack this flexibility as they are tied to a fixed conditioning structure and cannot perform new conditional inference once trained. To solve this, we propose a Bayesian generative modeling (BGM) approach for arbitrary conditional inference without retraining. BGM learns a generative model of X through an iterative Bayesian updating algorithm where model parameters and latent variables are updated until convergence. Once trained, any conditional distribution can be obtained without retraining. Empirically, BGM achieves superior prediction performance with well calibrated predictive intervals, demonstrating that a single learned model can serve as a universal engine for conditional prediction with uncertainty quantification. We provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of the stochastic iterative algorithm, statistical consistency and conditional-risk bounds. The proposed BGM framework leverages the power of AI to capture complex relationships among variables while adhering to Bayesian principles, emerging as a promising framework for advancing various applications in modern data science.

      <title>A brief note on learning problem with global perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This brief note considers the problem of learning with dynamic-optimizing principal-agent setting, in which the agents are allowed to have global perspectives about the learning process, i.e., the ability to view things according to their relative importances or in their true relations based-on some aggregated information shared by the principal. Whereas, the principal, which is exerting an influence on the learning process of the agents in the aggregation, is primarily tasked to solve a high-level optimization problem posed as an empirical-likelihood estimator under conditional moment restrictions model that also accounts information about the agents' predictive performances on out-of-samples as well as a set of private datasets available only to the principal. In particular, we present a coherent mathematical argument which is necessary for characterizing the learning process behind this abstract principal-agent learning framework, although we acknowledge that there are a few conceptual and theoretical issues still need to be addressed.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Modeling for Engineering Applications with Sparse Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern engineering and scientific workflows often require simultaneous predictions across related tasks and fidelity levels, where high-fidelity data is scarce and expensive, while low-fidelity data is more abundant. This paper introduces an Multi-Task Gaussian Processes (MTGP) framework tailored for engineering systems characterized by multi-source, multi-fidelity data, addressing challenges of data sparsity and varying task correlations. The proposed framework leverages inter-task relationships across outputs and fidelity levels to improve predictive performance and reduce computational costs. The framework is validated across three representative scenarios: Forrester function benchmark, 3D ellipsoidal void modeling, and friction-stir welding. By quantifying and leveraging inter-task relationships, the proposed MTGP framework offers a robust and scalable solution for predictive modeling in domains with significant computational and experimental costs, supporting informed decision-making and efficient resource utilization.</description>

      <title>Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The scaling law holds universally for all continuous semimartingales with finite quadratic variation, including general Ito diffusions with nonlinear or state-dependent volatility, but fails sharply for deterministic systems -- thereby providing a theoretically-certfied method of distinguishing between these dynamics, as opposed to the subjective entropy or recurrence based state of the art methods. We construct a robust data-driven diffusion test. The method compares the empirical excursion counts against the theoretical expectation. The resulting ratio $K(\varepsilon)=N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{emp}}/N_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{theory}}$ is then summarized by a log-log slope deviation measuring the $\varepsilon^{-2}$ law that provides a classification into diffusion-like or not. We demonstrate the method on canonical stochastic systems, some periodic and chaotic maps and systems with additive white noise, as well as the stochastic Duffing system. The approach is nonparametric, model-free, and relies only on the universal small-scale structure of continuous semimartingales.</description>

      <title>Manifold limit for the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete-to-continuum consistency of the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) on proximity graphs of sampled point clouds under a manifold assumption. Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly infinite width are linear functionals on the space of measures on the parameter space. From this functional-analytic perspective, graph signals are seen as spatial discretizations of functions on the manifold, which leads to a natural notion of training data consistent across graph resolutions. To enable convergence results, the continuum parameter space is chosen as a weakly compact product of unit balls, with Sobolev regularity imposed on the output weight and bias, but not on the convolutional parameter. The corresponding discrete parameter spaces inherit the corresponding spectral decay, and are additionally restricted by a frequency cutoff adapted to the informative spectral window of the graph Laplacians. Under these assumptions, we prove $\Gamma$-convergence of regularized empirical risk minimization functionals and corresponding convergence of their global minimizers, in the sense of weak convergence of the parameter measures and uniform convergence of the functions over compact sets. This provides a formalization of mesh and sample independence for the training of such networks.</description>

      <title>Graph energy as a measure of community detectability in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key challenge in network science is the detection of communities, which are sets of nodes in a network that are densely connected internally but sparsely connected to the rest of the network. A fundamental result in community detection is the existence of a nontrivial threshold for community detectability on sparse graphs that are generated by the planted partition model (PPM). Below this so-called ``detectability limit'', no community-detection method can perform better than random chance. Spectral methods for community detection fail before this detectability limit because the eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors that are relevant for community detection can be absorbed by the bulk of the spectrum. One can bypass the detectability problem by using special matrices, like the non-backtracking matrix, but this requires one to consider higher-dimensional matrices. In this paper, we show that the difference in graph energy between a PPM and an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi (ER) network has a distinct transition at the detectability threshold even for the adjacency matrices of the underlying networks. The graph energy is based on the full spectrum of an adjacency matrix, so our result suggests that standard graph matrices still allow one to separate the parameter regions with detectable and undetectable communities.</description>

      <title>On the use of case estimate and transactional payment data in neural networks for individual loss reserving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of neural networks trained on individual claims data has become increasingly popular in the actuarial reserving literature. We consider how to best input historical payment data in neural network models. Additionally, case estimates are also available in the format of a time series, and we extend our analysis to assessing their predictive power. In this paper, we compare a feed-forward neural network trained on summarised transactions to a recurrent neural network equipped to analyse a claim's entire payment history and/or case estimate development history. We draw conclusions from training and comparing the performance of the models on multiple, comparable highly complex datasets simulated from SPLICE (Avanzi, Taylor and Wang, 2023). We find evidence that case estimates will improve predictions significantly, but that equipping the neural network with memory only leads to meagre improvements. Although the case estimation process and quality will vary significantly between insurers, we provide a standardised methodology for assessing their value.</description>

      <title>Ontology Neural Networks for Topologically Conditioned Constraint Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuro-symbolic reasoning systems face fundamental challenges in maintaining semantic coherence while satisfying physical and logical constraints. Building upon our previous work on Ontology Neural Networks, we present an enhanced framework that integrates topological conditioning with gradient stabilization mechanisms. The approach employs Forman-Ricci curvature to capture graph topology, Deep Delta Learning for stable rank-one perturbations during constraint projection, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for parameter optimization. Experimental evaluation across multiple problem sizes demonstrates that the method achieves mean energy reduction to 1.15 compared to baseline values of 11.68, with 95 percent success rate in constraint satisfaction tasks. The framework exhibits seed-independent convergence and graceful scaling behavior up to twenty-node problems, suggesting that topological structure can inform gradient-based optimization without sacrificing interpretability or computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generalized Canonical Polyadic Tensor Decompositions with General Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Canonical Polyadic (CP) tensor decomposition is a workhorse algorithm for discovering underlying low-dimensional structure in tensor data. This is accomplished in conventional CP decomposition by fitting a low-rank tensor to data with respect to the least-squares loss. Generalized CP (GCP) decompositions generalize this approach by allowing general loss functions that can be more appropriate, e.g., to model binary and count data or to improve robustness to outliers. However, GCP decompositions do not explicitly account for any symmetry in the tensors, which commonly arises in modern applications. For example, a tensor formed by stacking the adjacency matrices of a dynamic graph over time will naturally exhibit symmetry along the two modes corresponding to the graph nodes. In this paper, we develop a symmetric GCP (SymGCP) decomposition that allows for general forms of symmetry, i.e., symmetry along any subset of the modes. SymGCP accounts for symmetry by enforcing the corresponding symmetry in the decomposition. We derive gradients for SymGCP that enable its efficient computation via all-at-once optimization with existing tensor kernels. The form of the gradients also leads to various stochastic approximations that enable us to develop stochastic SymGCP algorithms that can scale to large tensors. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed SymGCP algorithms with a variety of experiments on both synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>From Unstructured Data to Demand Counterfactuals: Theory and Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Empirical models of demand for differentiated products rely on low-dimensional product representations to capture substitution patterns. These representations are increasingly proxied by applying ML methods to high-dimensional, unstructured data, including product descriptions and images. When proxies fail to capture the true dimensions of differentiation that drive substitution, standard workflows will deliver biased counterfactuals and invalid inference. We develop a practical toolkit that corrects this bias and ensures valid inference for a broad class of counterfactuals. Our approach applies to market-level and/or individual data, requires minimal additional computation, is efficient, delivers simple formulas for standard errors, and accommodates data-dependent proxies, including embeddings from fine-tuned ML models. It can also be used with standard quantitative attributes when mismeasurement is a concern. In addition, we propose diagnostics to assess the adequacy of the proxy construction and dimension. The approach yields meaningful improvements in predicting counterfactual substitution in both simulations and an empirical application.</description>

      <title>Multi-Group Quadratic Discriminant Analysis via Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-group classification arises in many prediction and decision-making problems, including applications in epidemiology, genomics, finance, and image recognition. Although classification methods have advanced considerably, much of the literature focuses on binary problems, and available extensions often provide limited flexibility for multi-group settings. Recent work has extended linear discriminant analysis to multiple groups, but more general methods are still needed to handle complex structures such as nonlinear decision boundaries and group-specific covariance patterns.
  We develop Multi-Group Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (MGQDA), a method for multi-group classification built on quadratic discriminant analysis. MGQDA projects high-dimensional predictors onto a lower-dimensional subspace, which enables accurate classification while capturing nonlinearity and heterogeneity in group-specific covariance structures. We derive theoretical guarantees, including variable selection consistency, to support the reliability of the procedure. In simulations and a gene-expression application, MGQDA achieves competitive or improved predictive performance compared with existing methods while selecting group-specific informative variables, indicating its practical value for high-dimensional multi-group classification problems. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.</description>

      <title>What Functions Does XGBoost Learn?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for the function class implicitly learned by XGBoost, bridging the gap between its empirical success and our theoretical understanding. We introduce an infinite-dimensional function class $\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{ST}}$ that extends finite ensembles of bounded-depth regression trees, together with a complexity measure $V^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{XGB}}(\cdot)$ that generalizes the $L^1$ regularization penalty used in XGBoost. We show that every optimizer of the XGBoost objective is also an optimizer of an equivalent penalized regression problem over $\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{ST}}$ with penalty $V^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{XGB}}(\cdot)$, providing an interpretation of XGBoost as implicitly targeting a broader function class. We also develop a smoothness-based interpretation of $\mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{ST}}$ and $V^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{XGB}}(\cdot)$ in terms of Hardy--Krause variation. We prove that the least squares estimator over $\{f \in \mathcal{F}^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{ST}}: V^{d, s}_{\infty-\text{XGB}}(f) \le V\}$ achieves a nearly minimax-optimal rate of convergence $n^{-2/3} (\log n)^{4(\min(s, d) - 1)/3}$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Our results provide the first rigorous characterization of the function space underlying XGBoost, clarify its connection to classical notions of variation, and identify an important open problem: whether the XGBoost algorithm itself achieves minimax optimality over this class.</description>

      <title>Poisson Hyperplane Processes with Rectified Linear Units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks have shown state-of-the-art performances in various classification and regression tasks. Rectified linear units (ReLU) are often used as activation functions for the hidden layers in a neural network model. In this article, we establish the connection between the Poisson hyperplane processes (PHP) and two-layer ReLU neural networks. We show that the PHP with a Gaussian prior is an alternative probabilistic representation to a two-layer ReLU neural network. In addition, we show that a two-layer neural network constructed by PHP is scalable to large-scale problems via the decomposition propositions. Finally, we propose an annealed sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the classic two-layer ReLU neural network. The implementation of our proposed model is available at https://github.com/ShufeiGe/Pois_Relu.git.</description>

      <title>Auditing Fairness under Model Updates: Fundamental Complexity and Property-Preserving Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly embedded in societal infrastructure, auditing them for bias is of growing importance. However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.
  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.
  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.</description>

      <title>DeePM: Regime-Robust Deep Learning for Systematic Macro Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose DeePM (Deep Portfolio Manager), a structured deep-learning macro portfolio manager trained end-to-end to maximize a robust, risk-adjusted utility. DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous "ragged filtration" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information freshness; (2) it combats low signal-to-noise ratios via a Macroeconomic Graph Prior, regularizing cross-asset dependence according to economic first principles; and (3) it optimizes a distributionally robust objective where a smooth worst-window penalty serves as a differentiable proxy for Entropic Value-at-Risk (EVaR) - a window-robust utility encouraging strong performance in the most adverse historical subperiods. In large-scale backtests from 2010-2025 on 50 diversified futures with highly realistic transaction costs, DeePM attains net risk-adjusted returns that are roughly twice those of classical trend-following strategies and passive benchmarks, solely using daily closing prices. Furthermore, DeePM improves upon the state-of-the-art Momentum Transformer architecture by roughly fifty percent. The model demonstrates structural resilience across the 2010s "CTA (Commodity Trading Advisor) Winter" and the post-2020 volatility regime shift, maintaining consistent performance through the pandemic, inflation shocks, and the subsequent higher-for-longer environment. Ablation studies confirm that strictly lagged cross-sectional attention, graph prior, principled treatment of transaction costs, and robust minimax optimization are the primary drivers of this generalization capability.</description>

      <title>Next-Generation Reservoir Computing for Dynamical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11338v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple and scalable implementation of next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) for modeling dynamical systems from time-series data. The method uses a pseudorandom nonlinear projection of time-delay embedded inputs, allowing the feature-space dimension to be chosen independently of the observation size and offering a flexible alternative to polynomial-based NGRC projections. We demonstrate the approach on benchmark tasks, including attractor reconstruction and bifurcation diagram estimation, using partial and noisy measurements. We further show that small amounts of measurement noise during training act as an effective regularizer, improving long-term autonomous stability compared to standard regression alone. Across all tests, the models remain stable over long rollouts and generalize beyond the training data. The framework offers explicit control of system state during prediction, and these properties make NGRC a natural candidate for applications such as surrogate modeling and digital-twin applications.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Binary Classification with an Unobservable Source Subpopulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an unsupervised domain adaptation problem where the source domain consists of subpopulations defined by the binary label $Y$ and a binary background (or environment) $A$. We focus on a challenging setting in which one such subpopulation in the source domain is unobservable. Naively ignoring this unobserved group can result in biased estimates and degraded predictive performance. Despite this structured missingness, we show that the prediction in the target domain can still be recovered. Specifically, we rigorously derive both background-specific and overall prediction models for the target domain. For practical implementation, we propose the distribution matching method to estimate the subpopulation proportions. We provide theoretical guarantees for the asymptotic behavior of our estimator, and establish an upper bound on the prediction error. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method outperforms the naive benchmark that does not account for this unobservable source subpopulation.</description>

      <title>Variance-Reduced Diffusion Sampling via Target Score Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study variance reduction for score estimation and diffusion-based sampling in settings where the clean (target) score is available or can be approximated. Starting from the Target Score Identity (TSI), which expresses the noisy marginal score as a conditional expectation of the target score under the forward diffusion, we develop: (i) a plug-and-play nonparametric self-normalized importance sampling estimator compatible with standard reverse-time solvers, (ii) a variance-minimizing \emph{state- and time-dependent} blending rule between Tweedie-type and TSI estimators together with an anti-correlation analysis, (iii) a data-only extension based on locally fitted proxy scores, and (iv) a likelihood-tilting extension to Bayesian inverse problems. We also propose a \emph{Critic--Gate} distillation scheme that amortizes the state-dependent blending coefficient into a neural gate. Experiments on synthetic targets and PDE-governed inverse problems demonstrate improved sample quality for a fixed simulation budget.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics for Spectral Methods in Mixed Generalized Linear Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11368v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a mixed generalized linear model, the goal is to learn multiple signals from unlabeled observations: each sample comes from exactly one signal, but it is not known which one. We consider the prototypical problem of estimating two statistically independent signals in a mixed generalized linear model with Gaussian covariates. Spectral methods are a popular class of estimators which output the top two eigenvectors of a suitable data-dependent matrix. However, despite the wide applicability, their design is still obtained via heuristic considerations, and the number of samples $n$ needed to guarantee recovery is super-linear in the signal dimension $d$. In this paper, we develop exact asymptotics on spectral methods in the challenging proportional regime in which $n, d$ grow large and their ratio converges to a finite constant. This allows us optimize the design of the spectral method, and combine it with a simple linear estimator, to minimize the estimation error. Our characterization exploits a mix of tools from random matrices, free probability and the theory of approximate message passing algorithms. Numerical simulations for mixed linear regression and phase retrieval demonstrate the advantage enabled by our analysis over existing designs of spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Simple Mechanisms for Representing, Indexing and Manipulating Concepts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supervised and unsupervised learning using deep neural networks typically aims to exploit the underlying structure in the training data; this structure is often explained using a latent generative process that produces the data, and the generative process is often hierarchical, involving latent concepts. Despite the significant work on understanding the learning of the latent structure and underlying concepts using theory and experiments, a framework that mathematically captures the definition of a concept and provides ways to operate on concepts is missing. In this work, we propose to characterize a simple primitive concept by the zero set of a collection of polynomials and use moment statistics of the data to uniquely represent the concepts; we show how this view can be used to obtain a signature of the concept. These signatures can be used to discover a common structure across the set of concepts and could recursively produce the signature of higher-level concepts from the signatures of lower-level concepts. To utilize such desired properties, we propose a method by keeping a dictionary of concepts and show that the proposed method can learn different types of hierarchical structures of the data.</description>

      <title>Scalability of Metropolis-within-Gibbs schemes for high-dimensional Bayesian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study general coordinate-wise MCMC schemes (such as Metropolis-within-Gibbs samplers), which are commonly used to fit Bayesian non-conjugate hierarchical models. We relate their convergence properties to the ones of the corresponding (potentially not implementable) Gibbs sampler through the notion of conditional conductance. This allows us to study the performances of popular Metropolis-within-Gibbs schemes for non-conjugate hierarchical models, in high-dimensional regimes where both number of datapoints and parameters increase. Given random data-generating assumptions, we establish dimension-free convergence results, which are in close accordance with numerical evidences. Applications to Bayesian models for binary regression with unknown hyperparameters and discretely observed diffusions are also discussed. Motivated by such statistical applications, auxiliary results of independent interest on approximate conductances and perturbation of Markov operators are provided.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI needs formalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14590v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of "explainable artificial intelligence" (XAI) seemingly addresses the desire that decisions of machine learning systems should be human-understandable. However, in its current state, XAI itself needs scrutiny. Popular methods cannot reliably answer relevant questions about ML models, their training data, or test inputs, because they systematically attribute importance to input features that are independent of the prediction target. This limits the utility of XAI for diagnosing and correcting data and models, for scientific discovery, and for identifying intervention targets. The fundamental reason for this is that current XAI methods do not address well-defined problems and are not evaluated against targeted criteria of explanation correctness. Researchers should formally define the problems they intend to solve and design methods accordingly. This will lead to diverse use-case-dependent notions of explanation correctness and objective metrics of explanation performance that can be used to validate XAI algorithms.</description>

      <title>Efficient Bayesian Computation Using Plug-and-Play Priors for Poisson Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies plug-and-play (PnP) Langevin sampling strategies for Bayesian inference in low-photon Poisson imaging problems, a challenging class of problems with significant applications in astronomy, medicine, and biology. PnP Langevin sampling offers a powerful framework for Bayesian image restoration, enabling accurate point estimation as well as advanced inference tasks, including uncertainty quantification and visualization analyses, and empirical Bayesian inference for automatic model parameter tuning. Herein, we leverage and adapt recent developments in this framework to tackle challenging imaging problems involving weakly informative Poisson data. Existing PnP Langevin algorithms are not well-suited for low-photon Poisson imaging due to high solution uncertainty and poor regularity properties, such as exploding gradients and non-negativity constraints. To address these challenges, we explore two strategies for extending Langevin PnP sampling to Poisson imaging models: (i) an accelerated PnP Langevin method that incorporates boundary reflections and a Poisson likelihood approximation and (ii) a mirror sampling algorithm that leverages a Riemannian geometry to handle the constraints and the poor regularity of the likelihood without approximations. The effectiveness of these approaches is evaluated and contrasted through extensive numerical experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. The source code accompanying this paper is available at https://github.com/freyyia/pnp-langevin-poisson.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral cell-count, as the model is trained.</description>

      <title>Amortized Variational Inference for Partial-Label Learning: A Probabilistic Approach to Label Disambiguation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Shorter but not Worse: Frugal Reasoning via Easy Samples as Length Regularizers in Math RLVR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with ``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer. Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is \textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on \textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly twice as short. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/MBZUAI-Paris/Frugal-AI}{GitHub}, with datasets and models on \href{https://huggingface.co/collections/MBZUAI-Paris/k2-think-mini-68dcfa8b114686a4bd3dc2bc}{Hugging Face}.</description>

      <title>What Drives Success in Physical Planning with Joint-Embedding Predictive World Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks. Code, data and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/jepa-wms.</description>

Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description>
