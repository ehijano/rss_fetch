      <title>Coloured spin-1 states in composite Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong dynamics for composite Higgs models predict spin-1 resonances which are expected to be in the same mass range as the usually considered top-partners. We study here QCD-coloured vector and axial-vector states stemming from composite Higgs dynamics in several relevant models based on an underlying gauge-fermion description. These states can come as triplet, sextet and octet representation. All models considered have a colour octet vector state in common which can be singly produced at hadron colliders as it mixes with the gluon. We explore the rich and testable phenomenology of these coloured spin-1 states at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Cosmic Neutrino Background from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use recent evidence of TeV neutrino events from NGC 1068, detected by the IceCube experiment, to constrain the overdensity of relic neutrinos locally and globally. Since these high-energy neutrinos have travelled long distances through a sea of relic neutrinos, they could have undergone scattering, altering their observed flux on Earth. Considering only Standard Model interactions, we constrain the relic overdensity to be $\eta\leq 3.85 \times 10^8 (5.39 \times 10^{11})$ at the 95$\%$ confidence level for overdensities with a radius of 14 Mpc (10 kpc), assuming the sum of neutrino masses saturates the cosmological bound, $\sum_i m_i = 0.13$ eV. We demonstrate that this limit improves with larger neutrino masses and how it depends on the scale of the overdensity region.</description>

      <title>A Scotogenic Model as a Prototype for Leptogenesis with One Single Gauge Singlet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of a minimal Scotogenic model with two additional scalar doublets and a single heavy Majorana fermion to explain neutrino masses, dark matter, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this minimal setup, Leptogenesis is purely flavored, and a second Majorana neutrino is not necessary because the Yukawa couplings of the extra doublets yield the necessary $CP$-odd phases. The mechanism we employ can also be applied to a wide range of scenarios with at least one singlet and two gauge multiplets. Despite stringent limits from the dark matter abundance, direct detection experiments, and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe, we find a parametric region consistent with all bounds which could resolve the above shortcomings of the Standard Model of particle physics. Methodically, we improve on the calculation of correlations between the mixing scalar fields given their finite width. We also present an argument to justify the kinetic equilibrium approximation for out-of-equilibrium distribution functions often used in calculations of Baryogenesis and Leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Avenues for a number density interpretation of dihadron fragmentation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this comment, we reassess the underlying physics of the number sum rule for dihadron fragmentation functions. We will argue that, currently, there are no settled constraints on what constitutes a valid number density interpretation for multihadron fragmentation functions. Imposing overly restrictive criteria might lead to misinterpretating the data. Most importantly, and on the basis of phenomenological analyses, the slightly varying definitions used in previous work are not excluded from possessing legitimate number density interpretations (up to the usual issues with ultraviolet divergences and renormalization), so long as they are paired with appropriate factorization theorems. We advocate for further theoretical analyses to be challenged with experimental data, available at JLab or at the future EIC.</description>

      <title>Muon g-2 and lepton flavor violation in supersymmetric GUTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of supersymmetric (SUSY) GUT models that can explain the apparent discrepancy between the SM predictions and experimental values of muon g-2 while providing testable signals for lepton flavor violation in charged lepton decays. Moreover, these models predict LSP neutralino abundance that is compatible with the Planck dark matter bounds. We find that scenarios in the framework of $SU(4)_c\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ unification, with additional symmetries to explain fermion masses and neutrino oscillations, provide interesting benchmarks for the search of SUSY by correlating a possible manifestation of it in dark matter, rare lepton decays and LHC signals.</description>

      <title>Net proton number cumulants from viscous hydro with equation of state including a critical end point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the SMASH-CLVisc-hybrid framework, including SMASH for the initial conditions and the hadronic rescattering stage, and CLVisc for the quark gluon plasma (QGP) evolution, we investigate net baryon number fluctuations via considering the equation of state (EoS) with and without a critical end point (CEP) in the QCD phase transition. Specifically, two distinct QCD EoS are utilized: one with smooth crossover derived from NEOS and another with a critical end point sourced from the rPNJL model. Our results show that non-monotonic behavior of $\kappa\sigma^2$ is not observed above the collision energy $7.7 {\rm GeV}$, nor are there explicit differences between the EoS characterized by crossover and that by CEP. This could be attributed to the significant deviation of the freeze-out line from the location of CEP. It is also found that the pure SMASH result of $\kappa \sigma^2$ is positive and close to zero at 3 GeV, which is different from the negative value observed from STAR.</description>

      <title>One-loop contributions for $A^0 \rightarrow \ell \bar{\ell} V$ with $\ell \equiv e, \mu$ and $V\equiv \gamma, Z$ in Higgs Extensions of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present one-loop formulas for the decay of CP-odd Higgs $A^0 \rightarrow \ell \bar{\ell} V$ with $\ell \equiv e, \mu$ and $V\equiv \gamma, Z$ in Higgs Extensions of the Standard Model, considering two higgs doublet model with a complex (and real) scalar, two higgs doublet model as well as triplet higgs model. Analytic results for one-loop amplitudes are expressed in terms of Passarino-Veltman functions following the standard notations of {\tt LoopTools}. As a result, physical results can be generated numerically by using the package. In phenomenological results, the total decay widths and the differential decay rates with respect to the invariant mass of lepton pair are analyzed for two typical models such as two higgs doublet model and triplet higgs model.</description>

      <title>Automatic generation of orthogonal multiplet bases in $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ color space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a software that automatically generates a multiplet color basis for general $2 \to n$ processes in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The construction process is guided by the decomposition of the corresponding $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ representation into a direct sum of irreducible representations. The projectors of these irreducible multiplet states are then used to construct a minimal, linearly independent basis. The software achieves highest efficiency through a combination of the Z3 satisfiability modulo theories solver and the symbolic manipulation program FORM. The resulting color basis enables the analytical execution of involved QCD calculations that require color decomposition.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for flow observables in high energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how deep convolutional neural networks can be trained to predict 2+1 D hydrodynamic simulation results for flow coefficients, mean-transverse-momentum and charged particle multiplicity from the initial energy density profile. We show that this method provides results that are accurate enough, so that one can use neural networks to reliably estimate multi-particle flow correlators. Additionally, we train networks that can take any model parameter as an additional input and demonstrate with a few examples that the accuracy remains good. The usage of neural networks can reduce the computation time needed in performing Bayesian analyses with multi-particle flow correlators by many orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Chiral symmetry restoration at finite temperature in a model with manifest confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple lattice evidences support the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD above the chiral symmetry restoration crossover at Tch ~ 155 MeV. This regime is characterised by an approximate chiral spin symmetry of the partition function, which is a symmetry of the colour charge and the confining electric part of the QCD Lagrangian. It is traditionally believed that confinement should automatically induce spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, which would preclude the existence of a confining but chirally symmetric regime of QCD at high temperatures. We employ a well-known solvable quark model for QCD in 3+1 dimensions that is chirally symmetric and manifestly confining and argue that while confinement indeed induces dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry at T=0, a chiral restoration phase transition takes place at some critical temperature Tch. Above this temperature, the spectrum of the model consists of chirally symmetric hadrons with approximate chiral spin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Sibyll$^{\bigstar}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, an increasing number of datasets have revealed a consistent discrepancy between the number of muons measured in ultra-high-energy extensive air showers (EAS) and the numbers predicted by simulations. This gap persists despite incorporating Large Hadron Collider (LHC) data into the tuning of current hadronic interaction models, leading to the phenomenon often termed the ''muon puzzle''. To gain a deeper understanding of the potential origins of this muon puzzle, we have developed Sibyll$^{\bigstar}$, a series of phenomenologically modified versions of Sibyll 2.3d. In these models, we have increased muon production by altering $\rho^0$, baryon-antibaryon pair, or kaon production in hadronic multiparticle production processes. These variants remain within bounds from provided by accelerator measurements, including those from the LHC and fixed-target experiments, notably NA49 and NA61, showing a level of consistency comparable to Sibyll 2.3d. Our findings show that these modifications can increase the muon count in EAS by up to 35%, while minimally affecting the depth of shower maximum ($X_{\rm max}$) and other shower variables. Additionally, we assess the impact of these modifications on various observables, including inclusive muon and neutrino fluxes and the multiplicities of muon bundles in deep underground and water/ice Cherenkov detectors. We aim for at least one of these model variants to offer a more accurate representation of EAS data at the highest energies, thereby enhancing the quality of Monte Carlo predictions used in training neural networks. This improvement is crucial for achieving more reliable data analyses and interpretations.</description>

      <title>Probing intractable beyond-standard-model parameter spaces armed with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article attempts to summarize the effort by the particle physics community in addressing the tedious work of determining the parameter spaces of beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) scenarios, allowed by data. These spaces, typically associated with a large number of dimensions, especially in the presence of nuisance parameters, suffer from the curse of dimensionality and thus render naive sampling of any kind -- even the computationally inexpensive ones -- ineffective. Over the years, various new sampling (from variations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to dynamic nested sampling) and machine learning (ML) algorithms have been adopted by the community to alleviate this issue. If not all, we discuss potentially the most important among them and the significance of their results, in detail.</description>

      <title>Light-quark mass dependence of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the light-quark mass dependence of the $\Lambda(1405)$ resonance at leading order in a renormalizable framework of covariant chiral effective field theory. The meson-baryon scattering amplitudes, which are obtained by solving the scattering equation within time-ordered perturbation theory, follow the quark mass trajectory of the Coordinated Lattice Simulations consortium. At $M_\pi\approx 200$ MeV and $M_K\approx 487$ MeV, our parameter-free prediction of $\Lambda(1405)$ poles is consistent with the recent lattice results of BaSc Collaboration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 051901 (2024)]. Varying the pion mass from $135$ MeV to $400$ MeV, we present the evolution of double-pole positions of $\Lambda(1405)$: the higher pole remains a resonance around the $\bar{K}N$ threshold; whereas the lower pole undergoes a transition from resonance to a virtual state, and ultimately to a bound state of the $\pi\Sigma$ system, which could serve as a prediction of the forthcoming lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <title>Probing the spatial distribution of gluons within the proton in the coherent vector meson production at large $|t|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent production of vector mesons in photon-hadron interactions is considered one of the most promising observables to probe the QCD dynamics at high energies and the transverse spatial distribution of the gluons in the hadron wave function. In this letter, we perform an exploratory study about the dependence of the transverse momentum distributions, $d\sigma/dt$, on the model assumed for the proton density profile. We consider a set of non-Gaussian profiles and include them in the forward dipole-proton scattering amplitude associated with the IP-sat model. We demonstrate that the predictions for $d\sigma/dt$ are similar in the HERA kinematical range, but are very distinct for values of $t$ that will be probed in future colliders. In particular, the presence of diffractive dips in the $t$-distributions associated with the production of $J/\Psi$ and $\rho$ mesons is strongly dependent on the model assumed for the density profile. Similar conclusions are also derived when the non-linear effects on the dipole-target interaction are disregarded. Our results indicate that a future study of the coherent vector meson production at large $t$ will be useful to constrain the spatial distribution of gluons within the proton.</description>

      <title>A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upcoming neutrino experiments will soon search for new neutrino interactions more thoroughly than ever before, boosting the prospects of extending the Standard Model. In anticipation of this, we forecast the capability of two of the leading long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE and T2HK, to look for new flavor-dependent neutrino interactions with electrons, protons, and neutrons that could affect the transitions between different flavors. We interpret their sensitivity in the context of long-range neutrino interactions, mediated by a new neutral boson lighter than $10^{-10}$ eV, and sourced by the vast amount of nearby and distant matter in the Earth, Moon, Sun, Milky Way, and beyond. For the first time, we explore the sensitivity of DUNE and T2HK to a wide variety of $U(1)^\prime$ symmetries, built from combinations of lepton and baryon numbers, each of which induces new interactions that affect oscillations differently. We find ample sensitivity: in all cases, DUNE and T2HK may constrain the existence of the new interaction even if it is supremely feeble, may discover it, and, in some cases, may identify the symmetry responsible for it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use QCD kinetic theory to compute photon and dilepton production in the chemically equilibrating out-of-equilibrium quark-gluon plasma created in the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We derive universal scaling functions for the pre-equilibrium spectra of photons and dileptons. These scaling functions can be used to make realistic predictions for the pre-equilibrium emission and consequently establish the significance of the pre-equilibrium phase for the production of electromagnetic probes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Pair production in rotating electric fields via quantum kinetic equations: Resolving helicity states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of electron-positron pair production from vacuum in the presence of a strong electric field of circular polarization. By means of a nonperturbative approach based on the quantum kinetic equations (QKEs), we numerically calculate helicity-resolved momentum distributions of the particles produced and analyze the corresponding helicity asymmetry. It is demonstrated that the external rotating field tends to generate left-handed and right-handed particles traveling in opposite directions. Generic symmetry properties of the momentum spectra are examined analytically by means of the QKEs and also confirmed and illustrated by direct numerical computations. The helicity signatures revealed in our study are expected to provide a firmer basis for possible experimental investigations of the fundamental phenomenon of vacuum pair production in strong fields.</description>

Abstract: We study future lepton collider prospects for testing predictive models of leptophilic dark matter candidates with a thermal origin. We calculate experimental milestones for testing the parameter space compatible with freeze-out and the associated collider signals at past, present, and future facilities. This analysis places new limits on such models by leveraging the utility of lepton colliders. At $e^+e^-$ machines, we make projections using precision $Z$-pole observables from $e^+e^-\to l^+l^- + $ missing energy signatures at LEP and future projections for FCC-ee in these channels. Additionally, a muon collider could also probe new thermal relic parameter space in this scenario via $\mu^+\mu^- \to X + $ missing energy where $X$ is any easy identifiable SM object. Collectively, these processes can probe much all of the parameter space for which DM direct annihilation to $l^+l^-$ yields the observed relic density in Higgs-like models with mass-proportional couplings to charged leptons.</description>

      <title>Signals for invisible matter from solar-terrestrial observations</title>

Abstract: The composition of the dark universe although hypothesised, remains one of the biggest mysteries in modern physics. On smaller scales, there are various solar puzzling phenomena which known physics cannot explain like the coronal heating problem, the origin of sunspots, the trigger mechanism of solar flares, but also the open issue since the 1850's on the planetary impact of the active Sun. At the same time, several terrestrial observations in the dynamic Earth's atmosphere such as the ionospheric ionisation around December are unexpected within conventional physics. Following this work, the suggested common solution of all these conventionally unexplained phenomena is based on an external triggering caused by low-speed streaming constituents from the dark sector, being gravitationally focused or deflected by the Sun and the orbiting planets. Evidence in support of this hypothesis and on the existence of one or more streams or clusters has been provided based on a coincidence analysis of long-term astrophysical and planetary datasets. Of note, the planetary correlation is the novel key signature. Finally, a redefined strategy for direct Dark Matter searches focused on streaming Dark Matter is proposed. This novel procedure has been successfully implemented in the CAST-CAPP detector at CERN searching for Dark Matter axions.</description>

      <title>Kaon mixing beyond the standard model with physical masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present non-perturbative results for beyond the standard model kaon mixing matrix elements in the isospin symmetric limit ($m_u=m_d$) of QCD, including a complete estimate of all dominant sources of systematic error. Our results are obtained from numerical simulations of lattice QCD with $N_f = 2+1$ flavours of dynamical domain wall fermions. For the first time, these quantities are simulated directly at the physical pion mass $m_\pi$~$\sim$~$139\,\mathrm{MeV}$ for two different lattice spacings. We include data at three lattice spacings in the range $a = 0.11 $ - $ 0.07\,\mathrm{fm}$ and with pion masses ranging from the physical value up to 450$\,\mathrm{MeV}$. Compared to our earlier work, we have added both direct calculations at physical quark masses and a third lattice spacing making the removal of discretisation effects significantly more precise and eliminating the need for any significant mass extrapolation beyond the range of simulated data. We renormalise the lattice operators non-perturbatively using RI-SMOM off-shell schemes. These schemes eliminate the need to model and subtract non-perturbative pion poles that arises in the RI-MOM scheme and, since the calculations are performed with domain wall fermions, the unphysical mixing between chirality sectors is suppressed. Our results for the bag parameters in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme at $3\,\mathrm{GeV}$ are $B_K~\equiv~\mathcal{B}_1 = 0.5240(17)(54)$, $\mathcal{B}_2 = 0.4794(25)(35)$, $\mathcal{B}_3 = 0.746(13)(17)$, $\mathcal{B}_4 = 0.897(02)(10)$ and $\mathcal{B}_5 = 0.6882(78)(94)$, where the first error is from lattice uncertainties and the second is the uncertainty due to the perturbative matching to $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$.</description>

      <title>Replica Wormholes and Quantum Hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss recent applications of Euclidean path integrals to the black hole information problem. In calculations with replica wormholes as the next-to-leading order correction to the Gibbons-Hawking saddlepoint, the radiation density matrix approaches a pure state at late times, following the Page curve. We compare unitary evaporation of black holes (in real time), mediated by calculable quantum hair effects, with the replica wormhole results. Both replica wormhole and quantum hair approaches imply that radiation states are macroscopic superpositions of spacetime backgrounds, invalidating firewall and monogamy of entanglement constructions. Importantly, identification of modes inside the horizon with radiation modes (i.e., large scale nonlocality across the horizon) is not required to provide a physical picture of unitary evaporation. Radiation modes can encode the interior information while still remaining independent degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formulation of vacuum energy density in flat spacetime and potential implications for the cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a thermodynamical definition of the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} |0\rangle = - \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, in quantum field theory in flat Minkowski space in $D$ spacetime dimensions, which can be computed in the limit of high temperature, namely in the limit $\beta = 1/T \to 0$. It takes the form $\rho_{\rm vac} = {\rm const} \cdot m^D$ where $m$ is a fundamental mass scale and ${\rm "const"}$ is a computable constant which can be positive or negative. Due to modular invariance $\rho_{\rm vac}$ can also be computed in a different non-thermodynamic channel where one spatial dimension is compactifed on a circle of circumference $\beta$ and we confirm this modularity for free massive theories for both bosons and fermions for $D=2,3,4$. We list various properties of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ that are generally required, for instance $\rho_{\rm vac}=0$ for conformal field theories, and others, such as the constraint that $\rho_{\rm vac}$ has opposite signs for free bosons verses fermions of the same mass, which is related to constraints from supersymmetry. Using the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz we compute $\rho_{\rm vac}$ exactly for 2 classes of integrable QFT's in $2D$ and interpreting some previously known results. We apply our definition of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ to Lattice QCD data with two light quarks (up and down) and one additional massive flavor (the strange quark), and find it is negative, $\rho_{\rm vac} \approx - ( 200 \, {\rm MeV} )^4$. Finally we make some remarks on the Cosmological Constant Problem since $\rho_{\rm vac}$ is central to any discussion of it.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>Searches for multi-Z boson productions and anomalous gauge boson couplings at a muon collider</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-boson productions can be exploited as novel probes either for standard model precision tests or new physics searches, and have become one of those popular topics in the ongoing LHC experiments, and in future collider studies, including those for electron-positron and muon-muon colliders. Here we focus on two examples, i.e., ZZZ direct productions through $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ annihilation at a 1 TeV muon collider, and ZZ productions through vector boson scattering at a 10 TeV muon collider, with an integrated luminosity of $1-10 \, \text{ab}^{-1}$. Various channels are considered, including, such as $ZZZ \rightarrow 4l2\nu$ and $ZZZ \rightarrow 4l + 2 \text{ jets}$, etc. Expected significance on these multi-Z boson production processes are provided based on a detailed Monte Carlo study and signal background analysis. Sensitives on anomalous gauge boson couplings are also presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanical Softening of the Hypertriton Transverse Momentum Spectrum in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the properties of hypernuclei helps to constrain the interaction between hyperon and nucleon, which is known to play an essential role in determining the properties of neutron stars. Experimental measurements have suggested that the hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$), the lightest hypernucleus, exhibits a halo structure with a deuteron core encircled by a $\Lambda$ hyperon at a distance of about 10 fm. This large $\Lambda-d$ distance in $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ wave function is found to cause a suppressed $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ yield and a softening of its transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectrum in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the coalescence model based on nucleons and $\Lambda$ hyperons from a microscopic hybrid hydro model with a hadronic afterburner for nuclear cluster production in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, we show how this softening of the hypertriton $p_T$ spectrum appears and leads to a significantly smaller mean $p_T$ for \hyt ~than for helium-3 ($^3$He). The latter is opposite to the predictions from the blast-wave model which assumes that $^3_\Lambda \text{H}$ and $^3$He are thermally produced at the kinetic freeze-out of heavy ion collisions. The discovered quantum mechanical softening of the (anti-)hypertriton spectrum can be experimentally tested in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at different collision energies and centralities and used to obtain valuable insights to the mechanisms for light (hyper-)nuclei production in these collisions.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Scalar and Fermion Interacting Field Theory for Arbitrary Loop: Heat-Kernel Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We outline a proposal, based on the Heat-Kernel method, to compute 1PI effective action up to any loop order for quantum field theory with scalar and fermion fields. We algebraically extract the divergences associated with the composite operators without explicitly performing any momentum loop integral. We perform this analysis explicitly for one and two-loop cases and pave the way for three-loop as well. Using our prescription we compute the two-loop counter terms for a theory containing higher mass dimensional effective operators that are polynomial in fields for two different cases: (i) real singlet scalar, and (ii) complex fermion-scalar interacting theories. We also discuss how the minimal Heat-Kernel fails to deal with the effective operators involving derivatives. We explicitly compute the one-loop counter terms for such a case within an $O(n)$ symmetric scalar theory employing a non-minimal Heat-Kernel. Our method computes the counter terms of the composite operators directly and is also useful for extracting infrared divergence in massless limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we determine the masses of $I(J^P)=0\left(3/2^+\right)$ and $0\left(3/2^-\right)$ $\Omega$-baryon ground states using lattice QCD. We utilise Wilson-clover ensembles with $2+1$ dynamical quark flavours generated by the CLS consortium along a trajectory with a constant trace of the quark-mass matrix. We show that N$^3$LO $\text{SU}(3)_f$ chiral perturbation theory expressions describe the ground-state masses with positive-parity well, and we use them to set the lattice scale. Methodologically, our combination of gauge-fixed wall sources and the generalized Pencil of Functions allows for high-precision determinations of the lattice spacing at a relative error of around $0.3\%$ with controlled excited-state contamination. The fit we perform allows for the continuum value of $t_0$ to vary, thereby determining this quantity with a comparable level of precision to that of the lattice scale. Using the resulting scales our measurement of the negative-parity $\Omega^{3/2^{-}}$ state is found to be consistent with the recently-discovered $\Omega(2012)^-$, which can therefore be assigned the quantum numbers $I(J^P)=0\left(3/2^-\right)$.</description>

Abstract: We provide evidence for a correspondence between the formation of primordial black holes and the stability of circular null geodesics around the collapsing perturbation. We first show that the critical threshold of the compaction function to form a black hole in radiation is well approximated by the critical threshold for the appearance of the first unstable circular orbit. We also show that the critical exponent in the scaling law of the primordial black hole mass close to the threshold is set by the inverse of the Lyapunov coefficient of the unstable orbits when a self-similar stage is developed close to criticality.</description>

      <title>Spin alignment of $K^\ast$ induced by strange-baryon density inhomogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The difference between the spin alignments of $K^\ast$ and those of $\phi$ at the low collision energies is a puzzle raised by the recent experiments. Unlike $\phi$ meson, $K^\ast$, carrying a unit strange charge, should react to strange chemical potential $\mu_S$. In this paper, we shall first convince you that $\mu_S$ is not small in a brayon-rich medium for keeping strange neutrality, and then derive the spin alignment induced by the gradient of $\mu_S$, and hence of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, using linear response theory, with the transport coefficients expressed, without any approximation, in terms of the $K^\ast$'s in-medium spectral properties by employing Ward-Takahashi identity. It turns out that such an effect applies mainly to the particles whose longitudinal and transverse modes diverge, and induces only the local spin alignment in a static medium. The magnitudes of these coefficients will be further estimated under the quasi-particle approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations hinted towards the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nHz frequency band. Still, the nature of the SGWB signal cannot be confidently inferred from current data, and the leading explanation invokes mergers of supermassive black holes. If confirmed, such discovery would not only represent a turning point in our understanding of astrophysics, but it may severely limit the capability of searching for additional cosmological sources in the nHz frequency range. In this work, we build a simple framework to forecast the sensitivity of future PTA configurations and assess the parameter estimation of SGWB, which could consist of several contributions. We release the python code fastPTA implementing this framework and ready to use.</description>

Abstract: We extend the nonrelativistic QCD framework to explore the nature of the newly discovered di-$J/\psi$ resonances. Assuming them as either molecule-like states or tetraquarks, we calculated their hadroproduction cross sections at the LHC. We find that the observed resonances are most likely spin-2 particles, and there should exist their spin-0 counterparts near these resonances. The ratio of production cross sections of the observed resonances to the latent spin-0 ones are also presented, which might help to distinguish molecule-like states from tetraquarks.</description>

In particular, generalized neutrino interactions (GNI) provide a broader framework for studying these effects compared to the commonly studied non-standard neutrino interactions. These interactions are described by higher dimensional operators while maintaining the gauge symmetries of the SM. Furthermore, the cosmic neutrino background, a predicted component of the SM and standard cosmology, has yet to be directly detected. To shed light on this elusive phenomenon, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relevant GNI, specifically focusing on their implications for the proposed cosmic neutrino detector PTOLEMY. We make an attempt to see the capabilities and the limitations of PTOLEMY in sensing GNI while remaining optimistic regarding PTOLEMY's experimental resolution. These interactions play a significant role in modifying the electron spectrum resulting from the capture of cosmic neutrinos on radioactive tritium. This work also explores how the presence of these interactions influences the differential electron spectrum, taking into account factors such as finite experimental resolution, the mass of the lightest neutrino eigenstate, the strength of the interactions, and the ordering of neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Forbidden Dark Matter under a Cannibally Co-Decaying Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a usual dark matter (DM) model without a huge mass difference between the DM and lighter mediator, using the coupling strength suitable for having the correct relic density, the resulting self-interaction becomes several orders of magnitude smaller than that required to interpret the small scale structures. We present a framework that can offer a solution for this point. We consider a model that contains the vector DM and a heavier but unstable Higgs-like scalar in the hidden sector. When the temperature drops below $\sim m_{\rm DM}$, the hidden sector, which is thermally decoupled from the visible sector, enters a cannibal phase, during which the DM density is depleted with the out-of-equilibrium decay of the scalar. The favored parameter region, giving the correct relic density and the proper size of self-interactions, shows the scalar-to-DM mass ratio $\in [1.1,1.33]$ and the scalar mass $\in[9,114]\,{\rm MeV}$. A sizable parameter space still survives the most current constraints and can be further probed by the near future NA62 beam dump experiment.</description>

      <title>Molecular components in the $J/\psi$ and the $\rho$-$\pi$ puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the large branching fractions of $J/\psi \to f_0 (1710) \omega/f_0(1710) \phi$ and the light exotic candidates, we find that there may exist molecular states composed of $f_0(1710) \omega$ and $f_0 (1710) \phi$, which correspond to $X(2440)$ and $X(2680)$ observed in a few decades before. The branching fraction of $X(2440)$ and $X(2680)$ to various $PV$ channels and $KK\omega(\phi)$ channels are estimated in the molecular scenario. In addition, the large branching fractions of $J/\psi \to f_0 (1710) \omega/f_0(1710) \phi$ indicate the sizable molecular components in the $J/\psi$ state. Thus, we consider the $J/\psi$ as the supperposition of $c\bar{c}(1S)$, $f_0(1710) \omega$ and $f_0 (1710) \phi$ molecular states, and these molecular components have significant impact on the light hadron decays of $J/\psi$, which may shield light on the long standing $\rho-\pi$ puzzle.</description>

      <title>Pre-equilibrium photons from the early stages of heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use QCD kinetic theory to compute photon production in the chemically equilibrating Quark-Gluon Plasma created in the early stages of high-energy heavy-ion collisions. We do a detailed comparison of pre-equilibrium photon rates to the thermal photon production. We show that the photon spectrum radiated from a hydrodynamic attractor evolution satisfies a simple scaling form in terms of the specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$ and entropy density $dS/d\zeta \sim {\scriptstyle \left(T\tau^{1/3}\right)^{3/2}}_\infty$. We confirm the analytical predictions with numerical kinetic theory simulations. We use the extracted scaling function to compute the pre-equilibrium photon contribution in $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\,\text{TeV}$ 0-20\% PbPb collisions. We demonstrate that our matching procedure allows for a smooth switching from pre-equilibrium kinetic to thermal hydrodynamic photon production. Finally, our publicly available implementation can be straightforwardly added to existing heavy ion models.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of axion-like particles with universal fermion couplings -- revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) emerge in many extensions of the Standard Model as pseudo-Goldstone bosons of a spontaneously broken global symmetry. Understanding their phenomenology in high-energy collisions is crucial for optimizing experimental searches and understanding the exploration potential of future experiments. In this paper, we revise the phenomenology of ALPs with universal couplings to fermions. In particular, we analyze the hierarchy and uncertainty of the various ALP production channels depending on the proton collision energy and the placement of the experiment, and provide improved calculations of the hadronic decay modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mass spectrum of the molecular pentaquarks composed of a baryon and a meson. We establish the underlying relations among the near-threshold interactions of the molecular tetraquark and pentaquark systems. We find the existence of the molecule candidates in the $\Sigma_c\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $DD^\ast$, and $D\bar{D}^\ast$ systems indicates a substantial presence of the hadronic molecules in the {\it heavy} baryon plus {\it heavy} meson systems ({\it heavy} refers to the hadrons with the $c$ and/or $s$ quarks). We make an exhaustive prediction of the possible bound/virtual molecular states in the systems: $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime,\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime,\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}K^{\ast}$, $\Sigma_{c}^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime,\ast)}K^{\ast}$, $\Xi_{c}^{(\prime,\ast)}\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}K^{\ast}$, $\Xi_{cc}^{(\ast)}\bar{K}^{\ast}$, $\Sigma^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Sigma^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi^{(\ast)}\bar{D}^{(\ast)}$, $\Xi^{(\ast)}D^{(\ast)}$, $\Sigma^{(\ast)} K^\ast$, $\Sigma^{(\ast)} \bar{K}^\ast$, $\Xi^{(\ast)} K^\ast$, $\Xi^{(\ast)} \bar{K}^\ast$. Hunting for the predicted states in experiments will significantly deepen our understanding of the formation mechanism of the hadronic molecules, and shed light on the manifestation of flavor symmetry in the low-energy residual strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Three-loop anomalous dimensions of fixed-charge operators in the SM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter we consider renormalization of a class of scalar operators with fixed hypercharge $Q$ within the Standard Model. We carry out explicit computation of the corresponding anomalous dimensions up to the three-loop order. In spite of the fact that our result is gauge-dependent, in the Landau gauge and in the limit of vanishing weak isospin coupling the expression can be matched to recent gauge-independent computation based on the large-charge method. Our result serves an important and non-trivial cross-check of new developments in large-charge expansion and applications of the latter to realistic gauge theories. We not only confirm the leading and subleading terms in perturbative $Q$ expansion up to three loops, but also provide the expressions for sub-subleading coefficients that at the moment are not captured by the large-charge approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We impose partial-wave unitarity on $2 \to 2$ tree-level scattering processes to derive constraints on the dimensions of large scalar and fermionic multiplets of arbitrary gauge groups. We apply our results to scalar and fermionic extensions of the Standard Model, and also to the Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) based on the groups $SU(5)$, $SO(10)$, and $E_6$. We find scenarios within the latter two GUTs that violate the unitarity condition; this may require a reevaluation of the validity of perturbation theory in those scenarios.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Lepton Fluxes via Two-Dimensional Matrix Cascade Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.15263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The atmospheric lepton fluxes play a crucial role in many particle and astroparticle physics experiments, e.g. in establishing the neutrino signal and the muon background for neutrino oscillation measurements, or the atmospheric background for astrophysical neutrino searches. The Matrix Cascade Equations (MCEq) code is a numerical tool used to model the atmospheric lepton fluxes by solving a system of coupled differential equations for particle production, interaction, and decay at extremely low computational costs. Previously, the MCEq framework only accommodated longitudinal development of air showers, an approximation that works well for neutrino and muon fluxes at high energies (O(10 GeV) and above). However, for accurate calculations of atmospheric lepton angular distributions at lower energies, the lateral component of hadronic cascades becomes significant, necessitating three-dimensional calculation schemes. We introduce "2D MCEq", an efficient numerical approach for combined longitudinal and angular evolution of air showers that retains the low computational complexity. The accuracy of the "2D MCEq" is affirmed by its benchmark comparison with the standard Monte Carlo code CORSIKA. This study paves the way for efficient three-dimensional calculations of atmospheric neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>Scalar induced gravity waves from ultra slow-roll Galileon inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the production of secondary gravity waves in Galileon inflation with an ultra-slow roll (USR) phase and show that the spectrum of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in this case is consistent with the recent NANOGrav 15-year data and with sensitivities of other ground and space-based missions, LISA, BBO, DECIGO, CE, ET, HLVK (consists of aLIGO, aVirgo, and KAGRA), and HLV(03). Thanks to the non-renormalization property of Galileon theory, the amplitude of the large fluctuation is controllable at the sharp transitions between SR and USR regions. We show that the behaviour of the GW spectrum, when one-loop effects are included in the scalar power spectrum, is preserved under a shift of the sharp transition scale with peak amplitude $\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6})$, and hence it can cover a wide range of frequencies within ${\cal O}(10^{-9}{\rm Hz} - 10^{7}{\rm Hz})$. An analysis of the allowed mass range for primordial black holes (PBHs) is also performed, where we find that mass values ranging from ${\cal O}(1M_{\odot} - 10^{-18}M_{\odot})$ can be generated over the corresponding allowed range of low and high frequencies.</description>

Abstract: The quantization of a massive spin $1/2$ field that satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation is studied. The framework is consistent, provided it is formulated as a pseudo-hermitian quantum field theory by the redefinition of the field dual and the identification of an operator that modifies the inner product of states in Hilbert space to preserve a real energy spectrum and unitary evolution. Since the fermion field has mass dimension one, the theory admits renormalizable fermion self-interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a four-dimensional $SU(N_c)$ gauge theory coupled to $N_f$ species of color fermions and $N_f^2$ colorless scalars. The quantum field theory possesses a weakly interacting ultraviolet fixed point that we determine from beta functions computed up to four-loop order in the gauge coupling, and up to three-loop order in the Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings. The fixed point has one relevant direction giving rise to asymptotic safety. We compute fixed point values of dimensionless couplings together with the corresponding scaling exponents up to the first three nontrivial orders in Veneziano parameter $\epsilon$, both for infinite and finite number of colors $N_c$. We also consider anomalous dimensions for fields, scalar mass squared, and a class of dimension-three operators. Contrary to previous studies, we take into account possible mixing of the latter and compute eigenvalues of the corresponding matrix. Further, we investigate the size of the conformal window in the Veneziano limit and its dependence on $N_c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the Hilbert space of non-relativistic particles moving in three spatial dimensions. This is given by the space of sections of a line bundle that can in general be topologically non-trivial. Such bundles are classified by a set of integers--one for each pair of particles--and arise physically when we describe the interactions of dyons, particles which carry both electric and magnetic charges. The choice of bundle fixes the representation of the Euclidean group carried by the Hilbert space. These representations are shown to recover the 'pairwise helicity' formalism recently discussed in the literature.</description>

      <title>The worldvolume fermion as baryon in holographic QCD with a theta angle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the worldvolume fermion on the flavor brane in the D0-D4/D8 model which is holographically equivalent to the four-dimensional QCD with a theta term. The action for the worldvolume fermion is obtained by the T-duality rules in string theory and we accordingly derive its effectively five-dimensional, canonical four-dimensional forms by using the systematical dimensional reduction and decomposition of spinor. Afterwards, we employ the AdS/CFT dictionary in order to evaluate the two-point correlation function as the spectral function for the worldvolume fermion and interpret the fermion as baryon by analyzing its quantum number with the baryon vertex in holography. In this sense, the interacted action involving the worldvolume fermion and gauge field on the flavor brane are finally derived in holography which describes the various interaction of meson and baryon with the theta angle in large-N limit. Therefore, this work provides a holographic picture to describe baryon and its interactions based on string theory, in particular, in the presence of a theta angle.</description>

      <title>A Goldstone Boson Equivalence for Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory of single-field inflation characterizes the inflationary epoch in terms of a pattern of symmetry breaking. An operator acquires a time-dependent vacuum expectation value, defining a preferred spatial slicing. In the absence of dynamical gravity, the fluctuations around the time-dependent background are described by the Goldstone boson associated with this symmetry breaking process. With gravity, the Goldstone is eaten by the metric, becoming the scalar metric fluctuation. In this paper, we will show that in general single-field inflation, the statistics of scalar metric fluctuations are given by the statistics of this Goldstone boson decoupled from gravity up to corrections that are controlled as an expansion in slow-roll parameters. This even holds in the presence of additional parameters, like the speed of sound, that naively enhance the impact of the gravitational terms. In the process, we derive expressions for leading and sub-leading gravitational corrections to all-orders in the Goldstone boson.</description>
