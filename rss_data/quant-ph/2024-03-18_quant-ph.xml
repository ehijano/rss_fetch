      <title>Impact of Decoherence on Average Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a comprehensive study of the impact of decoherence on the average correlation for pure quantum states. We explore two primary mechanisms of decoherence: phase damping and amplitude damping, each having distinct effects on quantum systems. Phase damping, which describes the loss of quantum coherence without energy loss, primarily affects the phase relationships between the components of a quantum system while amplitude damping involves energy dissipation and also affects the state's occupation probabilities. We show that the average correlation follows a predictable decaying pattern in both scenarios. Our analysis can be understood in the context of quantum computing, by focusing on how phase damping influences the entanglement and correlation between qubits, key factors in quantum computational efficiency and error correction protocols.</description>

      <title>All incompatible measurements on qubits lead to multiparticle Bell nonlocality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality is a fundamental phenomenon of quantum physics as well as an essential resource for various tasks in quantum information processing. It is known that for the observation of nonlocality the measurements on a quantum system have to be incompatible, but the question which incompatible measurements are useful, remained open. Here we prove that any set of incompatible measurements on qubits leads to a violation of a suitable Bell inequality in a multiparticle scenario, where all parties perform the same set of measurements. Since there exists incompatible measurements on qubits which do not lead to Bell nonlocality for two particles, our results demonstrate a fundamental difference between two-particle and multi-particle nonlocality, pointing at the superactivation of measurement incompatibility as a resource. In addition, our results imply that measurement incompatibility for qubits can always be certified in a device-independent manner.</description>

      <title>Towards Two Bloch Sphere Representation of Pure Two Qubit States and Unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Bloch Sphere formalism to pure two qubit systems. Combining insights from Geometric Algebra and analysis of entanglement in different conjugate bases we identify Two Bloch Sphere geometry that is suitable for representing maximally entangled states. It turns out that relative direction of coordinate axes of the two Bloch Spheres may be used to describe the states. Moreover, coordinate axes of one Bloch sphere should be rignt-handed and of the other one - left-handed. We describe and depict separable and maximally entangled states as well as entangling and non-entangling rotations. We also offer graphical representation of workings of a CNOT gate for different inputs. Finally we provide a way to also represent partially entangled states and describe entanglement measure related to the surface area of the sphere enclosing the state representation.</description>

      <title>Studying Stabilizer de Finetti Theorems and Possible Applications in Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetries are of fundamental interest in many areas of science. In quantum information theory, if a quantum state is invariant under permutations of its subsystems, it is a well-known and widely used result that its marginal can be approximated by a mixture of tensor powers of a state on a single subsystem. Applications of this quantum de Finetti theorem range from quantum key distribution (QKD) to quantum state tomography and numerical separability tests. Recently, it has been discovered by Gross, Nezami and Walter that a similar observation can be made for a larger symmetry group than permutations: states that are invariant under stochastic orthogonal symmetry are approximated by tensor powers of stabilizer states, with an exponentially smaller overhead than previously possible. This naturally raises the question if similar improvements could be found for applications where this symmetry appears (or can be enforced). Here, two such examples are investigated.</description>

      <title>Quantum memory at nonzero temperature in a thermodynamically trivial system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive error correction protects logical information forever (in the thermodynamic limit) by updating the system based only on local information and few-body interactions. A paradigmatic example is the classical two-dimensional Ising model: a Metropolis-style Gibbs sampler retains the sign of the initial magnetization (a logical bit) for thermodynamically long times in the low-temperature phase. Known models of passive quantum error correction similarly exhibit thermodynamic phase transitions to a low-temperature phase wherein logical qubits are protected by thermally stable topological order. Here, in contrast, we show that constant-rate classical and quantum low-density parity check codes have no $\textit{thermodynamic}$ phase transitions at nonzero temperature, but nonetheless exhibit $\textit{ergodicity-breaking}$ dynamical transitions: below a critical nonzero temperature, the mixing time of local Gibbs sampling diverges in the thermodynamic limit. We conjecture that the circuit complexity of preparing extensive-energy states may diverge without crossing any thermodynamic transition. Fault-tolerant passive decoders, inspired by Gibbs samplers, may be amenable to measurement-free quantum error correction and may present a desirable experimental alternative to conventional quantum error correction based on syndrome measurements and active feedback.</description>

      <title>With a Little Help from Photons: Quantum Field Theory on Continuous-Variable Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We delve into the use of photonic quantum computing to simulate quantum mechanics and extend its application towards quantum field theory. We develop and prove a method that leverages this form of Continuous-Variable Quantum Computing (CVQC) to reproduce the time evolution of quantum-mechanical states under arbitrary Hamiltonians, and we demonstrate the method's remarkable efficacy with various potentials. Our method centres on constructing an evolver-state, a specially prepared quantum state that induces the desired time-evolution on the target state. This is achieved by introducing a non-Gaussian operation using a measurement-based quantum computing approach, enhanced by machine learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework in which these methods can be extended to encode field theories in CVQC without discretising the field values, thus preserving the continuous nature of the fields. This opens new avenues for quantum computing applications in quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Universal high-fidelity quantum gates for spin-qubits in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spins associated to solid-state colour centers are a promising platform for investigating quantum computation and quantum networks. Recent experiments have demonstrated multi-qubit quantum processors, optical interconnects, and basic quantum error correction protocols. One of the key open challenges towards larger-scale systems is to realize high-fidelity universal quantum gates. In this work, we design and demonstrate a complete high-fidelity gate set for the two-qubit system formed by the electron and nuclear spin of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We use gate set tomography (GST) to systematically optimise the gates and demonstrate single-qubit gate fidelities of up to $99.999(1)\%$ and a two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.93(5) \%$. Our gates are designed to decouple unwanted interactions and can be extended to other electron-nuclear spin systems. The high fidelities demonstrated provide new opportunities towards larger-scale quantum processing with colour-center qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher information and polaron picture for identification of transition coupling in quantum Rabi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Rabi model (QRM) is a fundamental model for light-matter interactions. A fascinating feature of the QRM is that it manifests a quantum phase transition which is applicable for critical quantum metrology (CQM). Effective application for CQM needs the exact location of the transition point, however the conventional expression for the transition coupling is only valid in the extreme limit of low frequency, while apart from zero frequency an accurate location is still lacking. In the present work we conversely use the quantum Fisher information (QFI) in the CQM to identify the transition coupling, which finds out that transition coupling indeed much deviates from the conventional one once a finite frequency is turned on. Polaron picture is applied to analytically reproduce the numeric QFI. An accurate expression for the transition coupling is obtained by the inspiration from the fractional-power-law effect of polaron frequency renormalization. From the QFI in the polaron picture we find that the transition occurs around a point where the effective velocity and the susceptibility of the single-photon absorption rate reach maximum. Our result provides an accurate reference of transition couplings for quantum metrology at non-zero frequencies. The formulation of the QFI in the polaron picture also prepares an analytic method with an accurate compensation for the parameter regime difficult to access for the numerics. Besides the integer/fractional power law analysis to extract the underlying physics of transition, the QFI/velocity relation may also add some insight in bridging the QFI and transition observables.</description>

      <title>Granular Aluminum Parametric Amplifier for Low-Noise Measurements in Tesla Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junction parametric amplifiers have become essential tools for microwave quantum circuit readout with minimal added noise. Even after improving at an impressive rate in the last decade, they remain vulnerable to magnetic fields, which limits their use in many applications such as spin qubits, Andreev and molecular magnet devices, dark matter searches, etc. Kinetic inductance materials, such as granular aluminum (grAl), offer an alternative source of non-linearity with innate resilience to in-plane magnetic fields. We present a non-degenerate amplifier made of two coupled grAl resonators resilient to in-plane magnetic field up to 1 T. It operates close to the quantum limit at 20 dB amplification, with 28 MHz gain-bandwidth product and -110 dBm saturation power.</description>

      <title>QuantumLeak: Stealing Quantum Neural Networks from Cloud-based NISQ Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) have become a powerful tool for implementing Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), addressing a wide range of complex problems. Well-trained VQCs serve as valuable intellectual assets hosted on cloud-based Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers, making them susceptible to malicious VQC stealing attacks. However, traditional model extraction techniques designed for classical machine learning models encounter challenges when applied to NISQ computers due to significant noise in current devices. In this paper, we introduce QuantumLeak, an effective and accurate QNN model extraction technique from cloud-based NISQ machines. Compared to existing classical model stealing techniques, QuantumLeak improves local VQC accuracy by 4.99\%$\sim$7.35\% across diverse datasets and VQC architectures.</description>

      <title>FedQNN: Federated Learning using Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the innovative domain of Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) as a framework for training Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models via distributed networks. Conventional machine learning models frequently grapple with issues about data privacy and the exposure of sensitive information. Our proposed Federated Quantum Neural Network (FedQNN) framework emerges as a cutting-edge solution, integrating the singular characteristics of QML with the principles of classical federated learning. This work thoroughly investigates QFL, underscoring its capability to secure data handling in a distributed environment and facilitate cooperative learning without direct data sharing. Our research corroborates the concept through experiments across varied datasets, including genomics and healthcare, thereby validating the versatility and efficacy of our FedQNN framework. The results consistently exceed 86% accuracy across three distinct datasets, proving its suitability for conducting various QML tasks. Our research not only identifies the limitations of classical paradigms but also presents a novel framework to propel the field of QML into a new era of secure and collaborative innovation.</description>

      <title>Multi-controlled Phase Gate Synthesis with ZX-calculus applied to Neutral Atom Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum circuit synthesis describes the process of converting arbitrary unitary operations into a gate sequence of a fixed universal gate set, usually defined by the operations native to a given hardware platform. Most current synthesis algorithms are designed to synthesize towards a set of single qubit rotations and an additional entangling two qubit gate, such as CX, CZ, or the Molmer Sorensen gate. However, with the emergence of neutral atom based hardware and their native support for gates with more than two qubits, synthesis approaches tailored to these new gate sets become necessary. In this work, we present an approach to synthesize multi controlled phase gates using ZX calculus. By representing quantum circuits as graph like ZX diagrams, one can utilize the distinct graph structure of diagonal gates to identify multi controlled phase gates inherently present in some quantum circuits even if none were explicitly defined in the original circuit. We evaluate the approach on a wide range of benchmark circuits and compare them to the standard Qiskit synthesis regarding its circuit execution time for neutral atom based hardware with native support of multi controlled gates. Our results show possible advantages for current state of the art hardware and represent the first exact synthesis algorithm supporting arbitrary sized multi controlled phase gates.</description>

      <title>A Search for Classical Subsystems in Quantum Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence and einselection have been effective in explaining several features of an emergent classical world from an underlying quantum theory. However, the theory assumes a particular factorization of the global Hilbert space into constituent system and environment subsystems, as well as specially constructed Hamiltonians. In this work, we take a systematic approach to discover, given a fixed Hamiltonian, (potentially) several factorizations (or tensor product structures) of a global Hilbert space that admit a quasi-classical description of subsystems in the sense that certain states (the "pointer states") are robust to entanglement. We show that every Hamiltonian admits a pointer basis in the factorization where the energy eigenvectors are separable. Furthermore, we implement an algorithm that allows us to discover a multitude of factorizations that admit pointer states and use it to explore these quasi-classical "realms" for both random and structured Hamiltonians. We also derive several analytical forms that the Hamiltonian may take in such factorizations, each with its unique set of features. Our approach has several implications: it enables us to derive the division into quasi-classical subsystems, demonstrates that decohering subsystems do not necessarily align with our classical notion of locality, and challenges ideas expressed by some authors that the propensity of a system to exhibit classical dynamics relies on minimizing the interaction between subsystems. From a quantum foundations perspective, these results lead to interesting ramifications for relative-state interpretations. From a quantum engineering perspective, these results may be useful in characterizing decoherence free subspaces and other passive error avoidance protocols.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Purcell enhancement of quantum dots emitting in the telecom O-band with an open fiber-cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-photon emitters integrated in optical micro-cavities are key elements in quantum communication applications. However, for each combination of a cavity geometry with a quantum emitter system, there are specific challenges in the optimization of the emission properties and cavity-emitter interaction. Here, we present a thorough investigation of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs), emitting in the telecom O-band, integrated in an open fiber-cavity. The design provides an optical micro-cavity tunable in all spatial dimensions with intrinsic fiber-coupling. Consequently, it offers a promising approach to a high collection efficiency and the investigation of spatially and spectrally varying samples. On the other hand, the system is also susceptible to vibrational noise. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive study of the cavity and emitter properties together with an analysis of the fluctuations of the cavity length. Due to the Purcell enhancement, we observe a reduction of the decay times of up to a factor of ${2.46(2)}$.</description>

      <title>Procedurally Optimised ZX-Diagram Cutting for Efficient T-Decomposition in Classical Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum circuit may be strongly classically simulated with the aid of ZX-calculus by decomposing its $t$ T-gates into a sum of $2^{\alpha t}$ classically computable stabiliser terms. In this paper, we introduce a general procedure to find an optimal pattern of vertex cuts in a ZX-diagram to maximise its T-count reduction at the cost of the fewest cuts. Rather than reducing a Clifford+T diagram based on a fixed routine of decomposing its T-gates directly (as is the conventional approach), we focus instead on taking advantage of certain patterns and structures common to such circuits to, in effect, design by automatic procedure an arrangement of spider decompositions that is optimised for the particular circuit. In short, this works by assigning weights to vertices based on how many T-like gates they are blocking from fusing/cancelling and then appropriately propagating these weights through any neighbours which are then blocking weighted vertices from fusing, and so on. Ultimately, this then provides a set of weightings on relevant nodes, which can then each be cut, starting from the highest weighted down. While this is a heuristic approach, we show that, for circuits small enough to verify, this method achieves the most optimal set of cuts possible $71\%$ of the time. Furthermore, there is no upper bound for the efficiency achieved by this method, allowing, in principle, an effective decomposition efficiency $\alpha\rightarrow0$ for highly structured circuits. Even applied to random pseudo-structured circuits (produced from CNOTs, phase gates, and Toffolis), we record the number of stabiliser terms required to reduce all T-gates, via our method as compared to that of the more conventional T-decomposition approaches (with $\alpha\approx0.47$), and show consistent improvements of orders of magnitude, with an effective efficiency $0.1\lesssim\alpha\lesssim0.2$.</description>

      <title>Existence of strongly nonlocal sets of three states in any N-partite system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of strong nonlocality, which refers to local irreducibility of a set of orthogonal multipartite quantum states across each bipartition of the subsystems, was put forward by Halder et al. in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 040403 (2019)]. Here, we show the existence of three orthogonal quantum states in (C^2)^{\otimes N} that cannot be perfectly distinguished locally across any bipartition of the subsystems. Specifically, all these three states are genuinely entangled, among which two are the N-qubit GHZ pairs. Since any three locally indistinguishable states are always locally irreducible, the three N-partite orthogonal states we present are strongly nonlocal. Thus, the caridnality of strongly nonlocal sets here is dramatically smaller than all known ones.</description>

      <title>Coherent Acoustic Control of Defect Orbital States in the Strong-Driving Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a bulk acoustic wave resonator to demonstrate coherent control of the excited orbital states in a diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center at cryogenic temperature. Coherent quantum control is an essential tool for understanding and mitigating decoherence. Moreover, characterizing and controlling orbital states is a central challenge for quantum networking, where optical coherence is tied to orbital coherence. We study resonant multi-phonon orbital Rabi oscillations in both the frequency and time domain, extracting the strength of the orbital-phonon interactions and the coherence of the acoustically driven orbital states. We reach the strong-driving limit, where the physics is dominated by the coupling induced by the acoustic waves. We find agreement between our measurements, quantum master equation simulations, and a Landau-Zener transition model in the strong-driving limit. Using perturbation theory, we derive an expression for the orbital Rabi frequency versus acoustic drive strength that is non-perturbative in the drive strength and agrees well with our measurements for all acoustic powers. Motivated by continuous wave spin resonance-based decoherence protection schemes, we model the orbital decoherence and find good agreement between our model and our measured few-to-several nanoseconds orbital decoherence times. We discuss the outlook for orbital decoherence protection.</description>

      <title>JustQ: Automated Deployment of Fair and Accurate Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the success of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) in decision-making systems, their fairness remains unexplored, as the focus primarily lies on accuracy. This work conducts a design space exploration, unveiling QNN unfairness, and highlighting the significant influence of QNN deployment and quantum noise on accuracy and fairness. To effectively navigate the vast QNN deployment design space, we propose JustQ, a framework for deploying fair and accurate QNNs on NISQ computers. It includes a complete NISQ error model, reinforcement learning-based deployment, and a flexible optimization objective incorporating both fairness and accuracy. Experimental results show JustQ outperforms previous methods, achieving superior accuracy and fairness. This work pioneers fair QNN design on NISQ computers, paving the way for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and Resonance Fluorescence from a Superconducting Artificial Atom Doubly Driven by Quantized and Classical Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an experimental demonstration of resonance fluorescence in a two-level superconducting artificial atom under two driving fields coupled to a detuned cavity. One of the fields is classical and the other is varied from quantum (vacuum fluctuations) to classical one by controlling the photon number inside the cavity. The device consists of a transmon qubit strongly coupled to a one-dimensional transmission line and a coplanar waveguide resonator. We observe a sideband anti-crossing and asymmetry in the emission spectra of the system through a one-dimensional transmission line, which is fundamentally different from the weak coupling case. By changing the photon number inside the cavity, the emission spectrum of our doubly driven system approaches to the case when the atom is driven by two classical bichromatic fields. We also measure the dynamical evolution of the system through the transmission line and study the properties of the first-order correlation function, Rabi oscillations and energy relaxation in the system. The study of resonance fluorescence from an atom driven by two fields promotes understanding decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits and may find applications in superconducting quantum computing and quantum networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-level systems coupled to thermal baths provide useful models for quantum thermodynamics and the role of heat currents in quantum information settings. Useful operations such as cooling or thermal masers have been proposed in autonomous three-level systems. In this work, we propose the coherent coupling of two qutrits as a simultaneous refrigerator and heat pump of two reservoirs forming a system. This occurs thanks to the coupling to two other reservoirs which are out of equilibrium but do not inject heat in the system. We explore the thermodynamic performance of such operation and discuss whether it can be distinguished from the action of a Maxwell demon via measurements of current fluctuations limited to the working substance.</description>

      <title>Benefits of non-adiabatic quantum control in quantum computation through spin qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is evident that the controllable quantum systems can be the reliable building blocks for Quantum computation. In reality we are witnessing the progress towards making the idea tractable enough, though optimistic but the threshold is not very near to us. The dawn of quantum computation has begun. In the future, we hope to see a full fledged operationally stable quantum computer which can solve the problems beyond the scope of classical digital computers. We may call it quantum supremacy. Nevertheless, we should not forget that there are problems which demand classical computers to be in the game for a better performance in comparison to the same through quantum devices. In the current stage of computing technology, the most beneficial area is nothing but an hybrid approach and that is for no doubt will reign the market for the next five to ten years. This hybrid aspect has several directions such as simulating quantum computation on a classical computer. Keeping both the aspect, computation through real physical devices and simulation on a classical computer by accessing available quantum computers for cloud computing, some advantages have been discussed in this article which will be elaborated as well in future articles. These advantages are inherent if we can achieve proper non-adiabatic control over the spin system in the laboratory. Otherwise these aspects can always be simulated by using quantum algorithms to see whether they can be useful in comparison to a purely classical computing machine. This is no doubt a new window for progress in the direction of quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-consistent quadratic theory is presented to account for nonlinear contributions in quantum dynamics. Evolution equations are shown to depend on higher-order gradients of the Hamiltonian, which are incorporated via their equations of motion or through perturbative calculations. The dynamics is proven trace-preserving, with the Hamiltonian acting as a constant of motion for initial Gaussian states. Nonlinear response functions are calculated perturbatively, and sufficient conditions are provided for the existence of their classical limit.</description>

      <title>AQM: A Refresh of the Abstract Qubit Model for Quantum Co-design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubits are the fundamental building blocks of quantum information science and applications, whose concept is widely utilized in both quantum physics and quantum computation. While the significance of qubits and their implementation in physical devices have been extensively examined, we posit that now is the right time to revisit this understanding. In this paper, we introduce an abstract qubit model (AQM), offering a mathematical framework for higher-level algorithms and applications, and setting forth criteria for lower-level physical devices to enable quantum computation. We first provide a comprehensive definition of "qubits", regarded as the foundational premise for quantum algorithms (bottom-up support), and examine their requisites for devices (top-down demand). We then investigate the feasibility of moderating specific requirements, thereby broadening device support while considering techniques that tradeoff extra costs to counterbalance this moderation. Lastly, we delve into the quantum applications that only require incomplete qubits, and discuss the physical systems having restricted AQM support but are still useful in quantum applications. AQM may serve as an intermediate interface between quantum algorithms and devices, facilitating quantum algorithm-device co-design.</description>

      <title>Maximizing information obtainable by quantum sensors through the Quantum Zeno Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient quantum sensing technologies rely on precise control of quantum sensors, particularly two-level systems or qubits, to optimize estimation processes. We here exploit the Quantum Zeno Effect (QZE) as a tool for maximizing information obtainable by quantum sensors, with a specific focus on the level avoided crossing (LAC) phenomenon in qubit systems. While the estimation of the LAC energy splitting has been extensively studied, we emphasize the crucial role that the QZE can play in estimating the coupling strength. We introduce the concept of information amplification by the QZE for a LAC system under off-resonant conditions. The proposed approach has implications for AC magnetic field sensing and the caracterization of complex systems, including many-spin systems requiring the estimation of spin-spin couplings. Overall, our findings contribute to the advancement of quantum sensing by leveraging the QZE for improved control and information extraction.</description>

      <title>Kinetic inductance traveling wave amplifier designs for practical microwave readout applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kinetic Inductance Traveling Wave amplifier (KIT) utilizes the nonlinear kinetic inductance of superconducting films, particularly Niobium Titanium Nitride (NbTiN), for parametric amplification. These amplifiers achieve remarkable performance in terms of gain, bandwidth, compression power, and frequently approach the quantum limit for noise. However, most KIT demonstrations have been isolated from practical device readout systems. Using a KIT as the first amplifier in the readout chain of an unoptimized microwave SQUID multiplexer coupled to a transition-edge sensor microcalorimeter we see an initial improvement in the flux noise. One challenge in KIT integration is the considerable microwave pump power required to drive the non-linearity. To address this, we have initiated efforts to reduce the pump power by using thinner NbTiN films and an inverted microstrip transmission line design. In this article, we present the new transmission line design, fabrication procedure, and initial device characterization -- including gain and added noise. These devices exhibit over 10 dB of gain with a 3 dB bandwidth of approximately 5.5-7.25 GHz, a maximum practical gain of 12 dB and typical gain ripple under 4 dB peak-to-peak. We observe an appreciable impedance mismatch in the NbTiN transmission line, which is likely the source of the majority of the gain ripple. Finally we perform an initial noise characterization and demonstrate system-added noise of three quanta or less over nearly the entire 3 dB bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Scalable and programmable quantum computing platform for optical non-Gaussian input states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing has been pursued with various hardware platforms, and an optical system is one of the most reasonable choices for large-scale computation. In the optical continuous-variable computation scheme, the incorporation of Gaussian gates and a highly non-classical non-Gaussian state enables universal quantum computation. Although basic technologies for Gaussian gates and non-Gaussian state generations have long been developed, these building blocks have not yet been integrated in a scalable fashion. Here, we integrate them to develop a scalable and programmable optical quantum computing platform that can sequentially perform an essential Gaussian gate, the squeezing gate, on a non-Gaussian input state. The key enablers are a loop-based optical circuit with dynamical and programmable controllability and its time-synchronization with the probabilistic non-Gaussian state generation. We verify the deterministic, programmable, and repeatable quantum gates on a typical non-Gaussian state by implementing up to three-step gates. The gates implemented are so high-quality that strong evidence of the states' non-classicalities, negativities of the Wigner functions, are preserved even after multistep gates. This platform is compatible with other non-Gaussian states and realizes large-scale universal quantum computing by incorporating other existing processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Clustering theorem in 1D long-range interacting systems at arbitrary temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper delves into a fundamental aspect of quantum statistical mechanics -- the absence of thermal phase transitions in one-dimensional (1D) systems. Originating from Ising's analysis of the 1D spin chain, this concept has been pivotal in understanding 1D quantum phases, especially those with finite-range interactions as extended by Araki. In this work, we focus on quantum long-range interactions and successfully derive a clustering theorem applicable to a wide range of interaction decays at arbitrary temperatures. This theorem applies to any interaction forms that decay faster than $r^{-2}$ and does not rely on translation invariance or infinite system size assumptions. Also, we rigorously established that the temperature dependence of the correlation length is given by $e^{{\rm const.} \beta}$, which is the same as the classical cases. Our findings indicate the absence of phase transitions in 1D systems with super-polynomially decaying interactions, thereby expanding upon previous theoretical research. To overcome significant technical challenges originating from the divergence of the imaginary-time Lieb-Robinson bound, we utilize the quantum belief propagation to refine the cluster expansion method. This approach allowed us to address divergence issues effectively and contributed to a deeper understanding of low-temperature behaviors in 1D quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Measuring Quantum Information Leakage Under Detection Threat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gentle quantum leakage is proposed as a measure of information leakage to arbitrary eavesdroppers that aim to avoid detection. Gentle (also sometimes referred to as weak or non-demolition) measurements are used to encode the desire of the eavesdropper to evade detection. The gentle quantum leakage meets important axioms proposed for measures of information leakage including positivity, independence, and unitary invariance. Global depolarizing noise, an important family of physical noise in quantum devices, is shown to reduce gentle quantum leakage (and hence can be used as a mechanism to ensure privacy or security). A lower bound for the gentle quantum leakage based on asymmetric approximate cloning is presented. This lower bound relates information leakage to mutual incompatibility of quantum states. A numerical example, based on the encoding in the celebrated BB84 quantum key distribution algorithm, is used to demonstrate the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication networks are crucial for both secure communication and cryptographic networked tasks. Building quantum communication networks in a scalable and cost-effective way is essential for their widespread adoption, among which a stable and miniaturized high-quality quantum light source is a key component. Here, we establish a complete polarization entanglement-based fully connected network, which features an ultrabright integrated Bragg reflection waveguide quantum source, managed by an untrusted service provider, and a streamlined polarization analysis module, which requires only one single-photon detector for each end user. We perform a continuously working quantum entanglement distribution and create correlated bit strings between users. Within the framework of one-time universal hashing, we provide the first experimental implementation of source-independent quantum digital signatures using imperfect keys circumventing the necessity for private amplification. More importantly, we further beat the 1/3 fault-tolerance bound in Byzantine agreement, achieving unconditional security without relying on sophisticated techniques. Our results offer an affordable and practical route for addressing consensus challenges within the emerging quantum network landscape.</description>

Abstract: We report the close form expressions of the photon number statistics for a generalized coherent state and a generalized photon-added coherent state, which are shown to be crucial for proposing a variety of quantum scissor operations. The analytically obtained distributions are also capable of predicting the precise laser intensity windows for realizing a variety of quantum scissors. Truncating a photon added state overcomes the selection rule of obtaining the lower order Fock states. Photon addition also enables us to obtain a higher order Fock state in a lower order superposition. The importance of circular geometry is also demonstrated for engineering such quantum scissors.</description>

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits are attractive candidates for potential quantum advantage in the near term and beyond. At the same time, as quantum computing hardware not only continues to improve but also begins to incorporate new features such as mid-circuit measurement and adaptive control, opportunities arise for innovative algorithmic paradigms. In this work we focus on measurement-based quantum computing protocols for approximate optimization, in particular related to quantum alternating operator ans\"atze (QAOA), a popular quantum circuit model approach to combinatorial optimization. For the construction and analysis of our measurement-based protocols we demonstrate that diagrammatic approaches, specifically ZX-calculus and its extensions, are effective for adapting such algorithms to the measurement-based setting. In particular we derive measurement patterns for applying QAOA to the broad and important class of QUBO problems. We further outline how for constrained optimization, hard problem constraints may be directly incorporated into our protocol to guarantee the feasibility of the solution found and avoid the need for dealing with penalties. Finally we discuss the resource requirements and tradeoffs of our approach to that of more traditional quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Entangling Gates for Electron and Nuclear Spin Qubits in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental progress in exploring the use of a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond as a quantum computing platform, we propose schemes for fast and high-fidelity entangling gates on this platform. Using both analytical and numerical calculations, we demonstrate that synchronization effects between resonant and off-resonant transitions may be exploited such that spin-flip errors due to strong driving may be eliminated by adjusting the gate time or the driving field. This allows for fast, high fidelity entangling operations between the electron spin and one or several nuclear spins. We investigate a two-qubit system where the NV center is comprised of a $^{15}$N atom and a qubit-qutrit system for the case of a $^{14}$N atom. In both cases, we predict a complete suppression of off-resonant driving errors for two-qubit gates when addressing the NV electron spin conditioned on states of nuclear spins of the nitrogen atom of the defect. Additionally, we predict fidelities $&gt;0.99$ for multi-qubit gates when including the surrounding $^{13}$C atoms in the diamond lattice in the conditioned logic.</description>

      <title>Variable Hyperparameterized Gaussian Kernel using Displaced Squeezed Vacuum State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are schemes for realizing different types of kernels by quantum states of light. It is particularly interesting to realize the Gaussian kernel due to its wider applicability. A multimode coherent state can generate the Gaussian kernel with a constant value of hyperparameter. This constant hyperparameter has limited the application of the Gaussian kernel when it is applied to complex learning problems. We realize the variable hyperparameterized Gaussian kernel with a multimode-displaced squeezed vacuum state. The learning capacity of this kernel is tested with the support vector machines over some synthesized data sets as well as public benchmark data sets. We establish that the proposed variable hyperparameterized Gaussian kernel offers better accuracy over the constant Gaussian kernel.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study One Axis Twisting (OAT) spin squeezing for metrology in the presence of decoherence. We study Linbladian evolution in the presence of both T_1 and T_2 (longitudinal and transverse relaxation processes). We show that spin squeezing can be an effective way to improve metrological accuracy even in the presence of decoherence for OAT squeezing. We show our results are not sensitive to inhomogeneity of the squeezing strength of the many spin OAT Hamiltonian and that very general squeezed states do not have entanglement enhanced decoherence. We also extend the Kitagawa-Ueda OAT squeezing formula to finite polarization.</description>

      <title>Optimal Layout Synthesis for Deep Quantum Circuits on NISQ Processors with 100+ Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layout synthesis is mapping a quantum circuit to a quantum processor. SWAP gate insertions are needed for scheduling 2-qubit gates only on connected physical qubits. With the ever-increasing number of qubits in NISQ processors, scalable layout synthesis is of utmost importance. With large optimality gaps observed in heuristic approaches, scalable exact methods are needed. While recent exact and near-optimal approaches scale to moderate circuits, large deep circuits are still out of scope.
  In this work, we propose a SAT encoding based on parallel plans that apply 1 SWAP and a group of CNOTs at each time step. Using domain-specific information, we maintain optimality in parallel plans while scaling to large and deep circuits. From our results, we show the scalability of our approach which significantly outperforms leading exact and near-optimal approaches (up to 100x). For the first time, we can optimally map several 8, 14, and 16 qubit circuits onto 54, 80, and 127 qubit platforms with up to 17 SWAPs. While adding optimal SWAPs, we also report near-optimal depth in our mapped circuits.</description>

      <title>A tree-approach Pauli decomposition algorithm with application to quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pauli matrices are 2-by-2 matrices that are very useful in quantum computing. They can be used as elementary gates in quantum circuits but also to decompose any matrix of $\mathbb{C}^{2^n \times 2^n}$ as a linear combination of tensor products of the Pauli matrices. However, the computational cost of this decomposition is potentially very expensive since it can be exponential in $n$. In this paper, we propose an algorithm with a parallel implementation that optimizes this decomposition using a tree approach to avoid redundancy in the computation while using a limited memory footprint. We also explain how some particular matrix structures can be exploited to reduce the number of operations. We provide numerical experiments to evaluate the sequential and parallel performance of our decomposition algorithm and we illustrate how this algorithm can be applied to encode matrices in a quantum memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize click-counting theory for the reconstruction of photon statistics. Our approach employs an analytic pseudo-inversion method to estimate photon counts from measured click counts. A reconfigurable time-bin multiplexing, click-counting detector is set up that renders it possible to alter the photon-number resolution as needed. A detector tomography is carried out, yielding vital measurement features, such as quantum efficiencies, cross-talk rates, etc. We gauge the success of the pseudo-inversion by applying the Mandel and binomial parameters, resulting in an additional interpretation of these parameters for the discrimination of distinct quantum statistics. In addition, we apply a loss deconvolution technique to account for detection losses.</description>

      <title>Tight concentration inequalities for quantum adversarial setups exploiting permutation symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed new concentration inequalities for a quantum state on an $N$-qudit system or measurement outcomes on it that apply to an adversarial setup, where an adversary prepares the quantum state. Our one-sided concentration inequalities for a quantum state require the $N$-qudit system to be permutation invariant and are thus de-Finetti type, but they are tighter than the one previously obtained. We show that the bound can further be tightened if each qudit system has an additional symmetry. Furthermore, our concentration inequality for the outcomes of independent and identical measurements on an $N$-qudit quantum system has no assumption on the adversarial quantum state and is much tighter than the conventional one obtained through Azuma's inequality. We numerically demonstrate the tightness of our bounds in simple quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>One-sided DI-QKD secure against coherent attacks over long distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a technique enabling provable secure communication but faces challenges in device characterization, posing potential security risks. Device-Independent (DI) QKD protocols overcome this issue by making minimal device assumptions but are limited in distance because they require high detection efficiencies, which refer to the ability of the experimental setup to detect quantum states. It is thus desirable to find quantum key distribution protocols that are based on realistic assumptions on the devices as well as implementable over long distances. In this work, we consider a one-sided DI QKD scheme with two measurements per party and show that it is secure against coherent attacks up to detection efficiencies greater than 50.1% specifically on the untrusted side. This is almost the theoretical limit achievable for protocols with two untrusted measurements. Interestingly, we also show that, by placing the source of states close to the untrusted side, our protocol is secure over distances comparable to standard QKD protocols.</description>

      <title>Postselection technique for optical Quantum Key Distribution with improved de Finetti reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The postselection technique is an important proof technique for proving the security of quantum key distribution protocols against coherent attacks. In this work, we go through multiple steps to rigorously apply the postselection technique to optical quantum key distribution protocols. First, we place the postselection technique on a rigorous mathematical foundation by fixing a technical flaw in the original postselection paper. Second, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to prepare-and-measure protocols by using a de Finetti reduction with a fixed marginal. Third, we show how the postselection technique can be used for decoy-state protocols by tagging the source. Finally, we extend the applicability of the postselection technique to realistic optical setups by developing a new variant of the flag-state squasher. We also improve existing de Finetti reductions, which reduce the effect of using the postselection technique on the key rate. These improvements can be more generally applied to other quantum information processing tasks. As an example to demonstrate the applicability of our work, we apply our results to the time-bin encoded three-state protocol. We observe that the postselection technique performs better than all other known proof techniques against coherent attacks.</description>

Abstract: The optimal coordination rates are determined in three primary settings of multi-partite quantum networks, thus characterizing the minimal resources required in order to simulate a joint quantum state among multiple parties. We study the following models: (1) a cascade network with limited entanglement, (2) a broadcast network, which consists of a single sender and two receivers, (3) a multiple-access network with two senders and a single receiver. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions on the asymptotically-achievable communication and entanglement rates in each setting. At last, we show the implications of our results on nonlocal games with quantum strategies.</description>

      <title>Graph Algorithms with Neutral Atom Quantum Processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom technology has steadily demonstrated significant theoretical and experimental advancements, positioning itself as a front-runner platform for running quantum algorithms. One unique advantage of this technology lies in the ability to reconfigure the geometry of the qubit register, from shot to shot. This unique feature makes possible the native embedding of graph-structured problems at the hardware level, with profound consequences for the resolution of complex optimization and machine learning tasks. By driving qubits, one can generate processed quantum states which retain graph complex properties. These states can then be leveraged to offer direct solutions to problems or as resources in hybrid quantum-classical schemes. In this paper, we review the advancements in quantum algorithms for graph problems running on neutral atom Quantum Processing Units (QPUs), and discuss recently introduced embedding and problem-solving techniques. In addition, we clarify ongoing advancements in hardware, with an emphasis on enhancing the scalability, controllability and computation repetition rate of neutral atom QPUs.</description>

      <title>Fusion of deterministically generated photonic graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement has evolved from an enigmatic concept of quantum physics to a key ingredient of quantum technology. It explains correlations between measurement outcomes that contradict classical physics, and has been widely explored with small sets of individual qubits. Multi-partite entangled states build up in gate-based quantum-computing protocols, and $\unicode{x2013}$ from a broader perspective $\unicode{x2013}$ were proposed as the main resource for measurement-based quantum-information processing. The latter requires the ex-ante generation of a multi-qubit entangled state described by a graph. Small graph states such as Bell or linear cluster states have been produced with photons, but the proposed quantum computing and quantum networking applications require fusion of such states into larger and more powerful states in a programmable fashion. Here we achieve this goal by employing two individually addressable atoms in one optical resonator. Ring and tree graph states with up to eight qubits, with the names reflecting the entanglement topology, are efficiently fused from the photonic states emitted by the individual atoms. The fusion process itself employs a cavity-assisted gate between the two atoms. Our technique is in principle scalable to even larger numbers of qubits, and is the decisive step towards, for instance, a memory-less quantum repeater in a future quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Probing Site-Resolved Current in Strongly Interacting Superconducting Circuit Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport measurements are fundamental for understanding condensed matter phenomena, from superconductivity to the fractional quantum Hall effect. Analogously, they can be powerful tools for probing synthetic quantum matter in quantum simulators. Here we demonstrate the measurement of in-situ particle current in a superconducting circuit lattice and apply it to study transport in both coherent and bath-coupled lattices. Our method utilizes controlled tunneling in a double-well potential to map current to on-site density, revealing site-resolved current and current statistics. We prepare a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different lattice fillings, and observe the change in current statistics as the many-body states transition from superfluid to Mott insulator. Furthermore, we explore non-equilibrium current dynamics by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative baths that serve as tunable particle source and drain. We observe steady-state current in discrete conduction channels and interaction-assisted transport. These results establish a versatile platform to investigate microscopic quantum transport in superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A Maximum Entropy Principle in Deep Thermalization and in Hilbert-Space Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report universal statistical properties displayed by ensembles of pure states that naturally emerge in quantum many-body systems. Specifically, two classes of state ensembles are considered: those formed by i) the temporal trajectory of a quantum state under unitary evolution or ii) the quantum states of small subsystems obtained by partial, local projective measurements performed on their complements. These cases respectively exemplify the phenomena of "Hilbert-space ergodicity" and "deep thermalization." In both cases, the resultant ensembles are defined by a simple principle: the distributions of pure states have maximum entropy, subject to constraints such as energy conservation, and effective constraints imposed by thermalization. We present and numerically verify quantifiable signatures of this principle by deriving explicit formulae for all statistical moments of the ensembles; proving the necessary and sufficient conditions for such universality under widely-accepted assumptions; and describing their measurable consequences in experiments. We further discuss information-theoretic implications of the universality: our ensembles have maximal information content while being maximally difficult to interrogate, establishing that generic quantum state ensembles that occur in nature hide (scramble) information as strongly as possible. Our results generalize the notions of Hilbert-space ergodicity to time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics and deep thermalization from infinite to finite effective temperature. Our work presents new perspectives to characterize and understand universal behaviors of quantum dynamics using statistical and information theoretic tools.</description>

      <title>Universal fluctuations and noise learning from Hilbert-space ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systems reaching thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous. For classical systems, this phenomenon is typically understood statistically through ergodicity in phase space, but translating this to quantum systems is a long-standing problem of interest. Recently a quantum notion of ergodicity has been proposed, namely that isolated, global quantum states uniformly explore their available state space, dubbed Hilbert-space ergodicity. Here we observe signatures of this process with an experimental Rydberg quantum simulator and various numerical models, before generalizing to the case of a local quantum system interacting with its environment. For a closed system, where the environment is a complementary subsystem, we predict and observe a smooth quantum-to-classical transition in that observables progress from large, quantum fluctuations to small, Gaussian fluctuations as the bath size grows. This transition is universal on a quantitative level amongst a wide range of systems, including those at finite temperature, those with itinerant particles, and random circuits. Then, we consider the case of an open system interacting noisily with an external environment. We predict the statistics of observables under largely arbitrary noise channels including those with correlated errors, allowing us to discriminate candidate error models both for continuous Hamiltonian time evolution and for digital random circuits. Ultimately our results clarify the role of ergodicity in quantum dynamics, with fundamental and practical consequences.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance as a success metric for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for quantum simulation that can be run on near-term quantum hardware. A challenge in VQE -- as well as any other heuristic algorithm for finding ground states of Hamiltonians -- is to know how close the algorithm's output solution is to the true ground state, when the true ground state and ground-state energy are unknown. This is especially important in iterative algorithms, such as VQE, where one wants to avoid erroneous early termination. Recent developments in Hamiltonian reconstruction -- the inference of a Hamiltonian given an eigenstate -- give a metric can be used to assess the quality of a variational solution to a Hamiltonian-eigensolving problem. This metric can assess the proximity of the variational solution to the ground state without any knowledge of the true ground state or ground-state energy. In numerical simulations and in demonstrations on a cloud-based trapped-ion quantum computer, we show that for examples of both one-dimensional transverse-field-Ising (11 qubits) and two-dimensional J1-J2 transverse-field-Ising (6 qubits) spin problems, the Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance gives a helpful indication of whether VQE has yet found the ground state or not. Our experiments included cases where the energy plateaus as a function of the VQE iteration, which could have resulted in erroneous early stopping of the VQE algorithm, but where the Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance correctly suggests to continue iterating. We find that the Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance has a useful correlation with the fidelity between the VQE solution and the true ground state. Our work suggests that the Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance may be a useful tool for assessing success in VQE, including on noisy quantum processors in practice.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Underlying this development is the simplicity of single particle control and detection inherent to the technique. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without defining qubits or demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several key metrics associated with fundamental limitations of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Effective time-dependent temperature for fermionic master equations beyond the Markov and the secular approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system coupled to environment at a fixed temperature and describe the reduced evolution of the system by means of a Redfield equation with effective time-dependent contact temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective contact temperature appears to be much higher, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a method which includes non-Markovian effects and can be further applied to various types of GKSL equations, beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.</description>

      <title>Quantum nonlinear optics on the edge of small lattice fractional quantum Hall fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of the edge modes of lattice fractional quantum Hall liquids in response to time-dependent external potentials. We show that the nonlinear chiral Luttinger liquid theory provides a quantitatively accurate description even for the small lattice geometries away from the continuum limit that are available in state-of-the-art experiments. Experimentally accessible signatures of the quantized value of the bulk transverse Hall conductivity are identified both in the linear and the non-linear response to an external excitation. The strong nonlinearity induced by the open boundaries is responsible for sizable quantum blockade effects, leading to the generation of nonclassical states of the edge modes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement patterns of quantum chaotic Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our current understanding of quantum chaos hinges on the random matrix behavior (RMT) of typical states in quantum many-body systems, particularly eigenstates and their energy level statistics. Although RMT has been remarkably successful in describing `coarse' features of quantum states in chaotic regimes, it fails to capture their `finer' features, particularly those arising from spatial locality and symmetries. Here, we show that we can accurately describe the behavior of eigenstate ensembles in physical systems by using RMT ensembles with constraints that capture the key features of the physical system. We demonstrate our approach on local spin Hamiltonians with a scalar U(1) charge. By constructing constrained RMT ensembles that account for two local scalar charges playing the role of energy and magnetization, we describe the patterns of entanglement of mid-spectrum eigenstates at all lengthscales and beyond their average behavior, analytically and numerically. When defining the correspondence between quantum chaos and RMT, our work clarifies that RMT ensembles must be constrained to account for all the features of the underlying Hamiltonian, particularly spatial locality and symmetries.</description>

Abstract: Due to the hybridization of charged excitons with cavity photons, trion-polaritons (TP) in microcavity semiconductors are a promising avenue for realizing strong polariton interactions and many-body polariton phases. We develop a quantum field theoretical formalism to study the formation of trion-polaritons in a microcavity semiconductor doped with itinerant electrons within the ultra-strong light-matter coupling regime. We predict a new class of many-body states resulting from the intriguing interplay of polarons and virtual photons in an uncharted territory of light-matter interactions and Feshbach physics.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <title>Control of quality factor of atomic force microscopy cantilever by cavity optomechanical effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quality factor plays a fundamental role in dynamic mode atomic force microscopy. We present a technique to modify the quality factor of an atomic force microscopy cantilever within a Fabry-P\'erot optical interferometer. The experimental setup uses two separate laser sources to detect and excite the oscillation of the cantilever. While the intensity modulation of the excitation laser drives the oscillation of the cantilever, the average intensity can be used to modify the quality factor via optomechanical force, without changing the fiber-cantilever cavity length. The technique enables users to optimize the quality factor for different types of measurements without influencing the deflection measurement sensitivity. An unexpected frequency shift was also observed and modelled as temperature dependence of the cantilever's Young's modulus, which was validated using finite element simulation. The model was used to compensate for the thermal frequency shift. The simulation provided relations between optical power, temperature, and frequency shift.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic quantum Vlasov equation in spinor QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonadiabatic quantum Vlasov equation in spinor QED is derived, and its relation to the well-known adiabatic one is established by three methods. One is by an explicitly analytical expression, the second is by the Dirac equation in the V gauge, and the last is by introducing a turn-off electric field. Wherein what the first two of them are given is an instantaneous relation. Moreover, the time evolution of the distribution function for a specific momentum and the momentum distribution of created particle pairs after turning off the electric field are calculated and compared with those in scalar QED. It is found that both the oscillation periods of the distribution functions in spinor and scalar QED equal pi divided by the total energy of a particle after the electric field is turned off. The momentum distributions in spinor and scalar QED show a novel oscillation and out-of-phase behavior that cannot be explained by the Stokes phenomenon. These findings will further deepen our understanding of the quantum Vlasov equation and its application in vacuum pair production.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Graph Capacity with Quantum Mechanics and Finite Automata</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The zero-error capacity of a channel (or Shannon capacity of a graph) quantifies how much information can be transmitted with no risk of error. In contrast to the Shannon capacity of a channel, the zero-error capacity has not even been shown to be computable: we have no convergent upper bounds. In this work, we present a new quantity, the zero-error {\em unitary} capacity, and show that it can be succinctly represented as the tensor product value of a quantum game. By studying the structure of finite automata, we show that the unitary capacity is within a controllable factor of the zero-error capacity. This allows new upper bounds through the sum-of-squares hierarchy, which converges to the commuting operator value of the game. Under the conjecture that the commuting operator and tensor product value of this game are equal, this would yield an algorithm for computing the zero-error capacity.</description>

      <title>Andreev reflection mediated $\Delta_T$ noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum noise has been extensively utilized to investigate various aspects of quantum transport, such as current-current correlations and wave-particle duality. A recent focus in this field is on $\Delta_T$ quantum noise, which arises because of a finite temperature difference at vanishing charge current. This paper explores the characterization of $\Delta_T$ noise auto-correlation alongside the shot noise and thermal-noise contributions in a 1D metal/insulator/superconductor junction. We consider a finite temperature gradient with zero applied bias for reservoirs at comparable temperatures. Andreev reflection enhances the $\Delta_T$ noise in a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in contrast to a metal-insulator-superconductor junction in the transparent limit. Unlike quantum noise for which shot-noise dominates thermal-noise at large bias voltages and finite barrier strength, $\Delta_T$ thermal-noise is always higher than $\Delta_T$ shot-noise. Thus, a general bound that is independent of barrier strength is established. This investigation sheds light on the distinct behavior of $\Delta_T$ noise, alongside the ratio of shot-noise to thermal-noise contributions, offering valuable insights into the intricate interplay between finite temperature gradient, barrier strength, and Andreev reflection.</description>

      <title>Numerical Realization of Dynamical Fermionization and Bethe Rapidities in a cold quenched Bose gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this numerical investigation, we explore the non-equilibrium dynamics of a cold Lieb-Liniger (LL) Bose gas -- a well established integrable quantum system in one dimension exhibiting repulsive interactions. Our study involves the presence of a hard wall potential during the ballistic expansion of the Bose gas from its ground state within an infinite deep box of length L0 to a final length L. The Quantum Monte Carlo method, based on the Generalized Feynman-Kac approach, serves as our computational tool. Given the integrability of the Lieb-Liniger model, strongly correlated systems resist thermalization. To capture the intricate dynamics we employ the concept of Bethe Rapidities(BRs), a holistic function that extends beyond atomic or energy density considerations. Our thought experiment involves a box-to-box expansion, providing a unique opportunity for direct numerical observation of Bethe Rapidities and the phenomenon of Dynamical Fermionization(DF). This investigation aims to contribute insights into the behavior of strongly correlated quantum systems during non-equilibrium processes, offering a detailed examination of Bethe Rapidities and the dynamic evolution of Fermionization throughout the expansion.</description>

Abstract: Electric fields represent an ideal means for controlling spins at the nanoscale and, more specifically, for manipulating protected degrees of freedom in multispin systems. Here we perform low-temperature magnetic far-IR spectroscopy on a molecular spin triangle (Fe3) and provide the first experimental evidence of spin-electric transitions in polynuclear complexes. The co-presence of electric- and magnetic-dipole transitions, allows us to estimate the spin-electric coupling. Based on spin Hamiltonian simulations of the spectra, we identify the observed transitions and introduce the concept of a generalized exchange qubit. This applies to a wide class of molecular spin triangles, and includes the scalar chirality and the partial spin sum qubits as special cases.</description>

Abstract: The Dirac negative energy sea introduced the concept of antimatter, and explained it, not least in its relationship to negative-energy solutions to the wave equation. Post-war, it was largely displaced by what I shall call the 'standard formalism', dependent, among other things, on normal-ordering. A much better explanation is provided by the 'two complex structures' viewpoint, as first introduced by Irving Segal: the one ('natural') kind of complex numbers at the level of covariant, local fields; and the other ('particle') complex numbers at the level of the one-particle Hilbert space and Fock space. The former is local, the latter non-local: therein lies the fundamental difference between relativistic and non-relativistic quantum theory.</description>

Abstract: A proposal for an improved theoretical model to illuminate the quantum nature of gravity is given. This model investigates the gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) phenomena, circumventing classical communication constraints of LOCC principle. Here a non-relativistic two dimensional quantum oscillator detector is coupled to linearly polarized gravitational waves (GWs). Exploiting the quantum nature of GWs, we observe the GIE within the oscillator quantum states. Since the model satisfies ``event'' as well as ``system'' localities, the observed GIE is much robust signature for quantum nature of gravity.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the spin dissymmetry factor, a measure of the spin-selectivity in the optical transition rate of quantum particles. This spin dissymmetry factor is valid locally, including at material interfaces and within optical cavities. We design and numerically demonstrate an optical cavity with three-fold rotational symmetry that maximizes spin dissymmetry, thereby minimizing the spin dephasing of a cavity-coupled quantum particle. Our approach emphasizes the difference between spin and chirality in the nearfield and reveals a classical parameter for designing more efficient quantum optical devices.</description>

Abstract: It has been proposed that random wide neural networks near Gaussian process are quantum field theories around Gaussian fixed points. In this paper, we provide a novel map with which a wide class of quantum mechanical systems can be cast into the form of a neural network with a statistical summation over network parameters. Our simple idea is to use the universal approximation theorem of neural networks to generate arbitrary paths in the Feynman's path integral. The map can be applied to interacting quantum systems / field theories, even away from the Gaussian limit. Our findings bring machine learning closer to the quantum world.</description>

      <title>Genuine N-partite entanglement in Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum information tasks in a gravitational background require multipartite entanglement for effective processing. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the properties of multipartite entanglement in a relativistic setting. In this paper, we study genuine N-partite entanglement of massless Dirac fields in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, characterized by the presence of a black hole event horizon (BEH) and a cosmological event horizon (CEH). We obtain the general analytical expression of genuine N-partite entanglement shared by n observers near BEH and m (n+m = N) observers near CEH. It is shown that genuine N-partite entanglement monotonically decreases with the decrease of the mass of the black hole, suggesting that the Hawking effect of the black hole destroys quantum entanglement. It is interesting to note that genuine N-partite entanglement is a non-monotonic function of the cosmological constant, meaning that the Hawking effect of the expanding universe can enhance quantum entanglement. This result contrasts with multipartite entanglement in single-event horizon spacetime, offering a new perspective on the Hawking effect in multi-event horizon spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correspondence between long-range interacting quantum spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems underpins the physical motivation for adiabatic quantum computing. On one hand, in disordered (quantum) spin systems, the focus is on exact methods such as the replica trick that allow the calculation of system quantities in the limit of infinite system and ensemble size. On the other hand, when solving a given instance of an optimization problem, disorder-averaged quantities are of no relevance, as one is solely interested in instance-specific, finite-size properties, in particular the true solution. Here, we apply the nonequilibrium Green-function formalism to the spin coherent-state path integral to obtain the statistical fluctuations and the collective-excitation spectrum along the annealing path. For the example of the quantum Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass, by comparing to extensive numerically exact results, we show that this method provides access to the instance-specific bottlenecks of the annealing protocol.</description>

      <title>Many-body quantum heat engines based on free-fermion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the performances of an imperfect quantum many-body Otto engine based on free-fermion systems. Starting from the thermodynamic definitions of heat and work along ideal isothermal, adiabatic, and isochoric transformations, we generalize these expressions in the case when the hypotheses of ideality are relaxed (i.e., nonperfect thermalization with the external baths, as well as nonperfect quantum adiabaticity in the unitary dynamic protocols). These results are used to evaluate the work and the power delivered by an imperfect quantum many-body heat engine in a finite time, whose working substance is constituted by a quantum Ising chain in a transverse field: We discuss the emerging optimal working points as functions of the various model parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Python functions distributed with this article can be used for calculating the parameters of multichannel quantum defect theory models describing excited bound states of complex atoms. These parameters are obtained by fitting a model to experimental data provided by the user. The two main formulations of the theory are supported, namely the one in which the parameters of the model are a set of eigen channel quantum defects and a transformation matrix, and the one where these parameters are the elements of a reactance matrix. The distribution includes programs for calculating theoretical energy levels, calculating mixing coefficients and channel fractions and producing Lu-Fano plots.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Casimir force softening originated from surface electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between vacuum fields and quantum matter occurs at the nanoscale and broadens the horizon of light-matter interaction. Nanoscale Casimir force, as an exhibition of vacuum fields, inevitably experiences the influence of surface electrons due to their quantum character, which are ignorable in micron Casimir force. Here, we develop a three-dimensional conformal map method to tackle typical experimental configurations with surface electron contributions to Casimir force purposely and delicately included. Based on this method, we reveal that surface electrons can either enhance or suppress the nanoscale Casimir force, depending on materials and crystal facets. The mechanism is demonstrated to be the Casimir force softening, which results from surface electrons effectively altering the distance seen by the Casimir interaction. Our findings not only highlight the interaction between surface electrons and vacuum fields but also provide a recipe for theoretical and experimental investigation of nanoscale fluctuation-type problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum reference frames, measurement schemes and the type of local algebras in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an operational framework, combining relativistic quantum measurement theory with quantum reference frames (QRFs), in which local measurements of a quantum field on a background with symmetries are performed relative to a QRF. This yields a joint algebra of quantum-field and reference-frame observables that is invariant under the natural action of the group of spacetime isometries. For the appropriate class of quantum reference frames, this algebra is parameterised in terms of crossed products. Provided that the quantum field has good thermal properties (expressed by the existence of a KMS state at some nonzero temperature), one can use modular theory to show that the invariant algebra admits a semifinite trace. If furthermore the quantum reference frame has good thermal behaviour (expressed by the existence of a KMS weight) at the same temperature, this trace is finite. We give precise conditions for the invariant algebra of physical observables to be a type $\textnormal{II}_1$ factor. Our results build upon recent work of Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington and Witten [JHEP 2023, 82 (2023)], providing both a significant mathematical generalisation of these findings and a refined operational understanding of their model.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points of any order in a generalized Hatano-Nelson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are truly non-Hermitian (NH) degeneracies where matrices become defective. The order of such an EP is given by the number of coalescing eigenvectors. On the one hand, most work focusses on studying $N$th-order EPs in $N\leq4$-dimensional NH Bloch Hamiltonians. On the other hand, some works have remarked on the existence of EPs of orders scaling with systems size in models exhibiting the NH skin effect. In this letter, we introduce a new type of EP and provide a recipe on how to realize EPs of arbitrary order not scaling with system size. We introduce a generalized version of the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model with longer-range hoppings. The EPs existing in this system show remarkable physical features: Their associated eigenstates are localized on a subset of sites and are exhibiting the NH skin effect. Furthermore, the EPs are robust against generic perturbations in the hopping strengths as well as against a specific form of on-site disorder.</description>

      <title>Usefulness of adaptive strategies in asymptotic quantum channel discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptiveness is a key principle in information processing including statistics and machine learning. We investigate the usefulness of adaptive methods in the framework of asymptotic binary hypothesis testing, when each hypothesis represents asymptotically many independent instances of a quantum channel, and the tests are based on using the unknown channel and observing outputs. Unlike the familiar setting of quantum states as hypotheses, there is a fundamental distinction between adaptive and non-adaptive strategies with respect to the channel uses, and we introduce a number of further variants of the discrimination tasks by imposing different restrictions on the test strategies. The following results are obtained: (1) We prove that for classical-quantum channels, adaptive and non-adaptive strategies lead to the same error exponents both in the symmetric (Chernoff) and asymmetric (Hoeffding, Stein) settings. (2) The first separation between adaptive and non-adaptive symmetric hypothesis testing exponents for quantum channels, which we derive from a general lower bound on the error probability for non-adaptive strategies; the concrete example we analyze is a pair of entanglement-breaking channels. (3)We prove, in some sense generalizing the previous statement, that for general channels adaptive strategies restricted to classical feed-forward and product state channel inputs are not superior in the asymptotic limit to non-adaptive product state strategies. (4) As an application of our findings, we address the discrimination power of an arbitrary quantum channel and show that adaptive strategies with classical feedback and no quantum memory at the input do not increase the discrimination power of the channel beyond non-adaptive tensor product input strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.07855v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how to simplify the Molmer-Sorensen (MS) gate which is used for the trapped ion quantum computer. The original MS gate is implemented by illuminating two ions with bichromatic coherent light fields separately at the same time. In this paper, we propose a method for transforming a separable state of two ions into one of the Bell states by illuminating the two ions with monochromatic coherent light fields individually and this point is the advantage of our scheme over the original MS gate. The length of the execution time of our proposed gate is comparable to that of the original MS gate, however, numerical calculations show that our proposed gate is weakly sensitive to thermal fluctuations of the phonons. By giving another example of a simple two-ion gate that can generate entanglement but is strongly vulnerable to thermal fluctuations, we show that our simplified MS gate is more marked than usual.</description>

      <title>Quantum density estimation with density matrices: Application to quantum anomaly detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10006v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density estimation is a central task in statistics and machine learning. This problem aims to determine the underlying probability density function that best aligns with an observed data set. Some of its applications include statistical inference, unsupervised learning, and anomaly detection. Despite its relevance, few works have explored the application of quantum computing to density estimation. In this article, we present a novel quantum-classical density matrix density estimation model, called Q-DEMDE, based on the expected values of density matrices and a novel quantum embedding called quantum Fourier features. The method uses quantum hardware to build probability distributions of training data via mixed quantum states. As a core subroutine, we propose a new algorithm to estimate the expected value of a mixed density matrix from its spectral decomposition on a quantum computer. In addition, we present an application of the method for quantum-classical anomaly detection. We evaluated the density estimation model with quantum random and quantum adaptive Fourier features on different data sets on a quantum simulator and a real quantum computer. An important result of this work is to show that it is possible to perform density estimation and anomaly detection with high performance on present-day quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Photonic non-Markovianity identification by quantum process capabilities of non-CP processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Markovian quantum process can be arbitrarily divided into two or more legitimate completely-positive (CP) subprocesses. When at least one non-CP process exists among the divided processes, the dynamics is considered non-Markovian. However, how to utilize minimum experimental efforts, without examining all process input states and using entanglement resources, to identify or measure non-Markovianity is still being determined. Herein, we propose a method to quantify non-CP processes for identifying and measuring non-Markovianity without the burden of state optimization and entanglement. This relies on the non-CP processes as new quantum process capabilities and can be systematically implemented by quantum process tomography. We additionally provide an approach for witnessing non-Markovianity by analyzing at least four system states without process tomography. We faithfully demonstrate that our method can be explicitly implemented using all-optical setups and applied to identify the non-Markovianity of single-photon and two-photon dynamics in birefringent crystals. Our results can also be used to explore non-Markovianity in other dynamical systems where process or state tomography is implementable.</description>

Abstract: As a phenomenon encompassing measurement incompatibility and Bell nonlocality, quantum contextuality is not only central to our understanding of quantum mechanics, but also an essential resource in many quantum information processing tasks. The dimension-dependent feature of quantum contextuality is known ever since its discovery, but systematic methods for characterizing the quantum contextuality in systems with fixed dimension are still lacking. In this work, we solve this problem. We provide systematic and reliable methods for verifying whether or not an obtained probability distribution can result from a $d$-dimensional quantum system, as well as calculating finite-dimensional violation of a general noncontextuality inequality. As an application, our methods reveal the non-convex structure of finite-dimensional quantum contextuality.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Quantum Advantage for Sampling with Shallow Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00995v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work by Bravyi, Gosset, and Koenig showed that there exists a search problem that a constant-depth quantum circuit can solve, but that any constant-depth classical circuit with bounded fan-in cannot. They also pose the question: Can we achieve a similar proof of separation for an input-independent sampling task? In this paper, we show that the answer to this question is yes when the number of random input bits given to the classical circuit is bounded.
  We introduce a distribution $D_{n}$ over $\{0,1\}^n$ and construct a constant-depth uniform quantum circuit family $\{C_n\}_n$ such that $C_n$ samples from a distribution close to $D_{n}$ in total variation distance. For any $\delta &lt; 1$ we also prove, unconditionally, that any classical circuit with bounded fan-in gates that takes as input $kn + n^\delta$ i.i.d. Bernouli random variables with entropy $1/k$ and produces output close to $D_{n}$ in total variation distance has depth $\Omega(\log \log n)$. This gives an unconditional proof that constant-depth quantum circuits can sample from distributions that can't be reproduced by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits, even up to additive error. We also show a similar separation between constant-depth quantum circuits with advice and classical circuits with bounded fan-in and fan-out, but access to an unbounded number of i.i.d random inputs.
  The distribution $D_n$ and classical circuit lower bounds are inspired by work of Viola, in which he shows a different (but related) distribution cannot be sampled from approximately by constant-depth bounded fan-in classical circuits.</description>

Abstract: Relating to finding possible upper bounds for the probability of error for discriminating between two quantum states, it is well-known that \begin{align*}
  \mathrm{tr}(A+B) - \mathrm{tr}|A-B|\leq 2\, \mathrm{tr}\big(f(A)g(B)\big) \end{align*} holds for every positive-valued matrix monotone function $f$, where $g(x)=x/f(x)$, and all positive definite matrices $A$ and $B$. This study demonstrates that the set of functions satisfying this inequality includes additional elements and provides illustrative examples to support this claim. Furthermore, we present a characterization of matrix decreasing functions based on a matrix version of the above inequality.</description>

Abstract: Efficient ways to prepare fermionic ground states on quantum computers are in high demand and different techniques have been developed over the last years. Despite having a vast set of methods, it is still unclear which method performs well for which system. In this work, we combine interpretable circuit designs with an effective basis approach in order to optimize a multiconfigurational valence bond wavefunction. Based on selected model systems, we show how this leads to explainable performance. We demonstrate that the developed methodology outperforms related methods in terms of the size of the effective basis as well as individual quantum resources for the involved circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the power of reservoir computing with a single oscillator in learning time series using quantum and classical models. We demonstrate that this scheme learns the Mackey--Glass (MG) chaotic time series, a solution to a delay differential equation. Our results suggest that the quantum nonlinear model is more effective in terms of learning performance compared to a classical non-linear oscillator. We develop approaches for measuring the quantumness of the reservoir during the process, proving that Lee-Jeong's measure of macroscopicity is a non-classicality measure. We note that the evaluation of the Lee-Jeong measure is computationally more efficient than the Wigner negativity. Exploring the relationship between quantumness and performance by examining a broad range of initial states and varying hyperparameters, we observe that quantumness in some cases improves the learning performance. However, our investigation reveals that an indiscriminate increase in quantumness does not consistently lead to improved outcomes, necessitating caution in its application. We discuss this phenomenon and attempt to identify conditions under which a high quantumness results in improved performance.</description>

      <title>Principle of Information Increase: An Operational Perspective of Information Gain in the Foundations of Quantum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.00080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A measurement performed on a quantum system is an act of gaining information about its state, a view that is widespread in practical and foundational work in quantum theory. However, the concept of information in quantum theory reconstructions is multiply-defined, and its conceptual foundations remain surprisingly under-explored. In this paper, we investigate the gain of information in quantum measurements from an operational viewpoint. We show that the continuous extension of the Shannon entropy naturally admits two distinct measures of information gain, differential information gain and relative information gain, and that these have radically different characteristics. In particular, while differential information gain can increase or decrease as additional data is acquired, relative information gain consistently grows, and moreover exhibits asymptotic indifference to the data or choice of Bayesian prior.
  In order to make a principled choice between these measures, we articulate a Principle of Information Increase, which incorporates Summhammer's proposal that more data from measurements leads to more knowledge about the system, and also takes into consideration black swan events. This principle favors differential information gain as the more relevant metric in two-outcome quantum systems, and guides the selection of priors for these information measures. Finally, we show that, of the beta distribution priors, the Jeffreys' binomial prior is the prior ensures maximal robustness of information gain to the particular data sequence obtained in a run of experiments.</description>

      <title>BCQQ: Batch-Constraint Quantum Q-Learning with Cyclic Data Re-uploading</title>

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) often requires a large number of data and environment interactions, making the training process time-consuming. This challenge is further exacerbated in the case of batch RL, where the agent is trained solely on a pre-collected dataset without environment interactions. Recent advancements in quantum computing suggest that quantum models might require less data for training compared to classical methods. In this paper, we investigate this potential advantage by proposing a batch RL algorithm that utilizes VQC as function approximators within the discrete batch-constraint deep Q-learning (BCQ) algorithm. Additionally, we introduce a novel data re-uploading scheme by cyclically shifting the order of input variables in the data encoding layers. We evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm on the OpenAI CartPole environment and compare its performance to the classical neural network-based discrete BCQ.</description>

      <title>Classical shadows based on locally-entangled measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study classical shadows protocols based on randomized measurements in $n$-qubit entangled bases, generalizing the random Pauli measurement protocol ($n = 1$). We show that entangled measurements ($n\geq 2$) enable nontrivial and potentially advantageous trade-offs in the sample complexity of learning Pauli expectation values. This is sharply illustrated by shadows based on two-qubit Bell measurements: the scaling of sample complexity with Pauli weight $k$ improves quadratically (from $\sim 3^k$ down to $\sim 3^{k/2}$) for many operators, while others become impossible to learn. Tuning the amount of entanglement in the measurement bases defines a family of protocols that interpolate between Pauli and Bell shadows, retaining some of the benefits of both. For large $n$, we show that randomized measurements in $n$-qubit GHZ bases further improve the best scaling to $\sim (3/2)^k$, albeit on an increasingly restricted set of operators. Despite their simplicity and lower hardware requirements, these protocols can match or outperform recently-introduced "shallow shadows" in some practically-relevant Pauli estimation tasks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a learning algorithm aimed at learning states obtained from computational basis states by Clifford circuits doped with a finite number $t$ of $T$-gates. The algorithm learns an exact tomographic description of $t$-doped stabilizer states in terms of Pauli observables. This is possible because such states are countable and form a discrete set. To tackle the problem, we introduce a novel algebraic framework for $t$-doped stabilizer states, which extends beyond $T$-gates and includes doping with any kind of local non-Clifford gate. The algorithm requires resources of complexity $\text{poly}(n,2^t)$ and exhibits an exponentially small probability of failure.</description>

Abstract: Large language models, like transformers, have recently demonstrated immense powers in text and image generation. This success is driven by the ability to capture long-range correlations between elements in a sequence. The same feature makes the transformer a powerful wavefunction ansatz that addresses the challenge of describing correlations in simulations of qubit systems. Here we consider two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays to demonstrate that transformers reach higher accuracies than conventional recurrent neural networks for variational ground state searches. We further introduce large, patched transformer models, which consider a sequence of large atom patches, and show that this architecture significantly accelerates the simulations. The proposed architectures reconstruct ground states with accuracies beyond state-of-the-art quantum Monte Carlo methods, allowing for the study of large Rydberg systems in different phases of matter and at phase transitions. Our high-accuracy ground state representations at reasonable computational costs promise new insights into general large-scale quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide an explicit recursive divide and conquer approach for simulating quantum dynamics and derive a discrete first quantized non-relativistic QED Hamiltonian based on the many-particle Pauli Fierz Hamiltonian. We apply this recursive divide and conquer algorithm to this Hamiltonian and compare it to a concrete simulation algorithm that uses qubitization. Our divide and conquer algorithm, using lowest order Trotterization, scales for fixed grid spacing as $\widetilde{O}(\Lambda N^2\eta^2 t^2 /\epsilon)$ for grid size $N$, $\eta$ particles, simulation time $t$, field cutoff $\Lambda$ and error $\epsilon$. Our qubitization algorithm scales as $\widetilde{O}(N(\eta+N)(\eta +\Lambda^2) t\log(1/\epsilon)) $. This shows that even a na\"ive partitioning and low-order splitting formula can yield, through our divide and conquer formalism, superior scaling to qubitization for large $\Lambda$. We compare the relative costs of these two algorithms on systems that are relevant for applications such as the spontaneous emission of photons, and the photoionization of electrons. We observe that for different parameter regimes, one method can be favored over the other. Finally, we give new algorithmic and circuit level techniques for gate optimization including a new way of implementing a group of multi-controlled-X gates that can be used for better analysis of circuit cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-testing is a powerful certification of quantum systems relying on measured, classical statistics. This paper considers self-testing in bipartite Bell scenarios with small number of inputs and outputs, but with quantum states and measurements of arbitrarily large dimension. The contributions are twofold. Firstly, it is shown that every maximally entangled state can be self-tested with four binary measurements per party. This result extends the earlier work of Man\v{c}inska-Prakash-Schafhauser (2021), which applies to maximally entangled states of odd dimensions only. Secondly, it is shown that every single binary projective measurement can be self-tested with five binary measurements per party. A similar statement holds for self-testing of projective measurements with more than two outputs. These results are enabled by the representation theory of quadruples of projections that add to a scalar multiple of the identity. Structure of irreducible representations, analysis of their spectral features and post-hoc self-testing are the primary methods for constructing the new self-tests with small number of inputs and outputs.</description>

      <title>Microwave characterization of tantalum superconducting resonators on silicon substrate with niobium buffer layer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tantalum thin films sputtered on unheated silicon substrates are characterized with microwaves at around 10 GHz in a 10 mK environment. We show that the phase of tantalum with a body-centered cubic lattice ($\alpha$-Ta) can be grown selectively by depositing a niobium buffer layer prior to a tantalum film. The physical properties of the films, such as superconducting transition temperature and crystallinity, change markedly with the addition of the buffer layer. Coplanar waveguide resonators based on the composite film exhibit significantly enhanced internal quality factors compared with a film without the buffer layer. The internal quality factor approaches $2\times 10^7$ at a large-photon-number limit. While the quality factor decreases at the single-photon level owing to two-level system (TLS) loss, we have identified the primary cause of TLS loss to be the amorphous silicon layer at the film-substrate interface, which originates from the substrate cleaning before the film deposition rather than the film itself. The temperature dependence of the internal quality factors shows a marked rise below 200 mK, suggesting the presence of TLS-TLS interactions. The present low-loss tantalum films can be deposited without substrate heating and thus have various potential applications in superconducting quantum electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17155v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic spin defects in the environment of an optically-active spin can be used to increase the size and hence the performance of solid-state quantum registers, especially for applications in quantum metrology and quantum communication. Previous works on multi-qubit electronic-spin registers in the environment of a Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) center in diamond have only included spins directly coupled to the NV. As this direct coupling is limited by the central spin coherence time, it significantly restricts the register's maximum attainable size. To address this problem, we present a scalable approach to increase the size of electronic-spin registers. Our approach exploits a weakly-coupled probe spin together with double-resonance control sequences to mediate the transfer of spin polarization between the central NV spin and an environmental spin that is not directly coupled to it. We experimentally realize this approach to demonstrate the detection and coherent control of an unknown electronic spin outside the coherence limit of a central NV. Our work paves the way for engineering larger quantum spin registers with the potential to advance nanoscale sensing, enable correlated noise spectroscopy for error correction, and facilitate the realization of spin-chain quantum wires for quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11174v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study conducts a theoretical investigation into the signal amplification arising from multiple Rabi sideband coherence within a one-dimensional waveguide quantum electrodynamics system. We utilize a semi-infinite waveguide to drive an anharmonic multi-level transmon with a strong coherent microwave field, examining the scattering behavior by introducing a probe signal. Our findings reveal signal amplification under specific resonant conditions, presenting spectra that reveal finer details than previously documented in the literature. To elucidate the mechanisms behind this amplification, we develop a model that explicitly accounts for multiple dressed sidebands in the presence of a strong driving field. From this model, we derive the reflection amplitude of the probe signal. Notably, our results indicate that amplification can occur due to either population inversion or, in some instances, through the constructive interference of multiple sidebands even in the absence of population inversion. Additionally, we explore how qubit dephasing impacts the amplification process.</description>

Abstract: Understanding quantum systems is of significant importance for assessing the performance of quantum hardware and software, as well as exploring quantum control and quantum sensing. An efficient representation of quantum states enables realizing quantum state tomography with minimal measurements. In this study, we propose a new approach to state tomography that uses tensor network representations of mixed states through locally purified density operators and employs a classical data postprocessing algorithm requiring only local measurements. Through numerical simulations of one-dimensional pure and mixed states and two-dimensional pure states up to size $8\times 8$, we demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and robustness of our proposed methods. Experiments on the IBM and Quafu Quantum platforms complement these numerical simulations. Our study opens new avenues in quantum state tomography for two-dimensional systems using tensor network formalism.</description>

      <title>Quantum control and Berry phase of electron spins in rotating levitated diamonds in high vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Levitated diamond particles in high vacuum with internal spin qubits have been proposed for exploring macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum gravity, and precision measurements. The coupling between spins and particle rotation can be utilized to study quantum geometric phase, create gyroscopes and rotational matter-wave interferometers. However, previous efforts in levitated diamonds struggled with vacuum level or spin state readouts. To address these gaps, we fabricate an integrated surface ion trap with multiple stabilization electrodes. This facilitates on-chip levitation and, for the first time, optically detected magnetic resonance measurements of a nanodiamond levitated in high vacuum. The internal temperature of our levitated nanodiamond remains moderate below $10^{-5}$ Torr. Impressively, we have driven a nanodiamond to rotate up to 20 MHz ($1.2 \times 10^{9}$ rpm), surpassing typical nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center electron spin dephasing rates. Using these NV spins, we observe the effect of the Berry phase arising from particle rotation. In addition, we demonstrate quantum control of spins in a rotating nanodiamond. These results mark an important development in interfacing mechanical rotation with spin qubits, expanding our capacity to study quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: Investigations of the boundary of the quantum correlation set through the derivation of quantum Bell inequalities have gained increased attention in recent years, which are related to Tsirelson's problem and have significant applications in DI information processing. However, determining quantum Bell inequalities is a notoriously difficult task and only isolated examples are known. In this paper, we present families of (almost-)quantum Bell inequalities and highlight three foundational and DI applications. Firstly, quantum correlations on the non-signaling boundary are crucial in the DI randomness extraction from weak sources. In the practical Bell scenario of two players with two k-outcome measurements, we derive quantum Bell inequalities that show a separation of the quantum boundary from nonlocal faces of the non-signaling polytope of dimension $\leq 4k-4$, extending previous results. As an immediate by-product of this, we give a general proof of Aumann's Agreement theorem for quantum systems and the almost-quantum correlations, which implies Aumann's agreement theorem is a reasonable physical principle in the context of epistemics to pick out both quantum theory and almost-quantum correlations from general no-signaling theories. Secondly, we present a family of quantum Bell inequalities in the two players with m binary measurements scenarios, that serve to self-test the two-qubit singlet and 2m measurements. Interestingly, this claim generalizes the result for m=2 discovered by Tsirelson-Landau-Masanes and shows an improvement over the state-of-the-art DIRA. Lastly, we use our quantum Bell inequalities to derive the general form of the principle of no advantage in nonlocal computation, which is an information-theoretic principle that serves to characterize the quantum correlation set. With this, we provide the most precise characterization of the quantum boundary known so far.</description>

Abstract: A theory of the measurement-induced entanglement phase transition for free-fermion models in $d&gt;1$ dimensions is developed. The critical point separates a gapless phase with $\ell^{d-1} \ln \ell$ scaling of the second cumulant of the particle number and of the entanglement entropy and an area-law phase with $\ell^{d-1}$ scaling, where $\ell$ is a size of the subsystem. The problem is mapped onto an SU($R$) replica non-linear sigma model in $d+1$ dimensions, with $R\to 1$. Using renormalization-group analysis, we calculate critical indices in one-loop approximation justified for $d = 1+ \epsilon$ with $\epsilon \ll 1$. Further, we carry out a numerical study of the transition for a $d=2$ model on a square lattice, determine numerically the critical point, and estimate the critical index of the correlation length, $\nu \approx 1.4$.</description>

Abstract: Parametric gates and processes engineered from the perspective of the static effective Hamiltonian of a driven system are central to quantum technology. However, the perturbative expansions used to derive static effective models may not be able to efficiently capture all the relevant physics of the original system. In this work, we investigate the conditions for the validity of the usual low-order static effective Hamiltonian used to describe a Kerr oscillator under a squeezing drive. This system is of fundamental and technological interest. In particular, it has been used to stabilize Schr\"odinger cat states, which have applications for quantum computing. We compare the states and energies of the effective static Hamiltonian with the exact Floquet states and quasi-energies of the driven system and determine the parameter regime where the two descriptions agree. Our work brings to light the physics that is left out by ordinary static effective treatments and that can be explored by state-of-the-art experiments.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state preparation plays a crucial role in several areas of quantum information science, in applications such as quantum simulation, quantum metrology and quantum computing. However, typically state preparation requires resources that scale exponentially with the problem size, due to their probabilistic nature or otherwise, making studying such models challenging. In this article, we propose a method to prepare the ground state of the Affleck-Lieb-Kennedy-Tasaki (AKLT) model deterministically using an measurement-based imaginary time evolution (MITE) approach. By taking advantage of the special properties of the AKLT state, we show that it can be prepared efficiently using the MITE approach. Estimates based on the convergence of a sequence of local projections, as well as direct evolution of the MITE algorithm suggest a constant scaling with respect to the number of AKLT sites, which is an exponential improvement over the naive estimate for conveargence. We show that the procedure is compatible with qubit-based simulators, and show that using a variational quantum algorithm for circuit recompilation, the measurement operator required for MITE can be well approximated by a circuit with a much shallower circuit depth compared with the one obtained using the default Qiskit method.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems based on magnons in magnetic materials have made significant progress in the past decade. They are built based on the couplings of magnons with microwave photons, optical photons, vibration phonons, and superconducting qubits. In particular, the interactions among magnons, microwave cavity photons, and vibration phonons form the system of cavity magnomechanics (CMM), which lies in the interdisciplinary field of cavity QED, magnonics, quantum optics, and quantum information. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical progress of this emerging field. We first introduce the underlying theories of the magnomechanical coupling, and then some representative classical phenomena that have been experimentally observed, including magnomechanically induced transparency, magnomechanical dynamical backaction, magnon-phonon cross-Kerr nonlinearity, etc. We also discuss a number of theoretical proposals, which show the potential of the CMM system for preparing different kinds of quantum states of magnons, phonons, and photons, and hybrid systems combining magnomechanics and optomechanics and relevant quantum protocols based on them. Finally, we summarize this review and provide an outlook for the future research directions in this field.</description>

Abstract: The quantum dynamical activity constitutes a thermodynamic cost in trade-off relations such as the quantum speed limit and the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. However, calculating the quantum dynamical activity has been a challenge. In this paper, we present the exact solution for the quantum dynamical activity by deploying the continuous matrix product state method. Moreover, using the derived exact solution, we determine the upper bound of the dynamical activity, which comprises the standard deviation of the system Hamiltonian and jump operators. We confirm the exact solution and the upper bound by performing numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Amplitude-Ensemble Quantum-Inspired Tabu Search Algorithm for Solving 0/1 Knapsack Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, an improved version of QTS (Quantum-inspired Tabu Search) has been proposed, which enhances the utilization of population information, called "amplitude-ensemble" QTS (AE-QTS). This makes AE-QTS more similar to the real quantum search algorithm, Grover Search Algorithm, in abstract concept, while keeping the simplicity of the algorithm. Later, we demonstrate the AE-QTS on the classical combinatorial optimization 0/1 knapsack problem. Experimental results show that the AE-QTS outperforms other algorithms, including the QTS, by at least an average of 20% in all cases and even by 30% in some cases. Even as the problem complexity increases, the quality of the solutions found by our method remains superior to that of the QTS. These results prove that our method has better search performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing quantum utility: simulating large-scale quantum spin chains on superconducting quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the quantum simulation of the frustrated quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain with competing nearest-neighbor $(J_1)$ and next-nearest-neighbor $(J_2)$ exchange interactions in the real superconducting quantum computer with qubits ranging up to 100. In particular, we implement, for the first time, the Hamiltonian with the next-nearest neighbor exchange interaction in conjunction with the nearest neighbor interaction on IBM's superconducting quantum computer and carry out the time evolution of the spin chain by employing first-order Trotterization. Furthermore, our novel implementation of second-order Trotterization for the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain, involving only nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, enables precise measurement of the expectation values of staggered magnetization observable across a range of up to 100 qubits. Notably, in both cases, our approach results in a constant circuit depth in each Trotter step, independent of the initial number of qubits. Our demonstration of the accurate measurement of expectation values for the large-scale quantum system using superconducting quantum computers designates the quantum utility of these devices for investigating various properties of many-body quantum systems. This will be a stepping stone to achieving the quantum advantage over classical ones in simulating quantum systems before the fault tolerance quantum era.</description>

Abstract: Block encoding is a key ingredient in the recently developed quantum signal processing that forms a unifying framework for quantum algorithms. Initially showcased for simplifying and optimizing resource utilization in several problems, such as searching, amplitude estimation, and Hamiltonian simulation, the capabilities of the quantum signal processing go beyond these and offer untapped potential for devising new quantum algorithms. In this article, we utilize block encoding to substantially enhance two previously proposed quantum algorithms: largest eigenvalue estimation and quantum gradient descent. Unlike previous works that involve sophisticated procedures, our findings, using the unitary block encoding, demonstrate that even with elementary operations, these new quantum algorithms can eliminate major scaling factors present in their original counterparts. This yields much more efficient quantum algorithms capable of tackling complex computational problems with remarkable efficiency. Furthermore, we show how to extend our proposed method to different contexts, including matrix inversion and multiple eigenvalues estimation.</description>

Abstract: We report observations of discrete charge states of a coherent dielectric two-level system (TLS) that is strongly coupled to an offset-charge-sensitive superconducting transmon qubit. We measure an offset charge of 0.072$e$ associated with the two TLS eigenstates, which have a transition frequency of 2.9 GHz and a relaxation time exceeding 3 ms. Combining measurements in the strong dispersive and resonant regime, we quantify both transverse and longitudinal couplings of the TLS-qubit interaction. We further perform joint tracking of TLS transitions and quasiparticle tunneling dynamics but find no intrinsic correlations. This study demonstrates microwave-frequency TLS as a source of low-frequency charge noise.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase for a nonstatic coherent light-wave: nonlinear evolution harmonized with the dynamical phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Properties of the geometric phase for a nonstatic coherent light-wave arisen in a static environment are analyzed from various angles. The geometric phase varies in a regular nonlinear way, where the center of its variation increases constantly with time. This consequence is due to the effects of the periodic wave collapse and expansion on the evolution of the geometric phase. Harmonization of such a geometric-phase evolution with the dynamical phase makes the total phase evolve with a unique pattern that depends on the degree of nonstaticity. The total phase exhibits a peculiar behavior for the case of extreme nonstaticity, which is that it precipitates periodically in its evolution, owing to a strong response of the geometric phase to the wave nonstaticity. It is confirmed that the geometric phase in the coherent state is mostly more prominent compared to that in the Fock states. For a simple case where the wave nonstaticity disappears, our description of the geometric phase recovers to the well-known conventional one which no longer undergoes periodical change. While the familiar dynamical phase is just related to the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, the geometric phase that we have managed reflects a delicate nonstaticity difference in the evolution of quantum states.</description>

      <title>Theory of Supervibronic Transitions via Casimir Polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A remote energy transfer pathway from electronic to vibrational degrees of freedom is identified inside an infrared optical cavity under vibrational strong coupling conditions. This mechanism relies on the dynamical Casimir effect, whereby real infrared photons are generated due to a sudden electronic transition of anisotropic molecules. Moreover, the formation of vibrational polaritons enables the excited photon energy to be transferred to the vibrational degrees of freedom before any dissipation occurs. Both analytic solutions and numerical simulations reveal that the magnitude of this electronic to vibrational energy transfer depends quadratically on the number of molecules and resonantly on the vibration-cavity detuning. During this "supervibronic" transition process, because the vibrational energy gain per molecule can be meaningful in the macroscopic limit, this process may potentially be observed using conventional vibrational strong coupling devices.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emergence of quantum state designs in systems with symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state t-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state t-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with periodic boundary conditions. We find faster convergence of the trace distance in the initial time, however, it saturates to a finite value deviating from random matrix prediction at a late time, in contrast to the case with open boundary condition. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: Combining resonant excitation with Purcell-enhanced single quantum dots (QDs) stands out as a prominent strategy for realizing high performance solid-state single photon sources. However, optimizing photon efficiency requires addressing challenges associated with effectively separating the excitation laser from QDs' emission. Traditionally, this involves polarization filtering, which limits the achievable polarization directions and the scalability of photonic states. In this study, we have successfully tackled this challenge by employing spatially-orthogonal resonant excitation of QDs, deterministically coupled to monolithic Fabry-Perot microcavities. Leveraging the membrane cavity structures, we have achieved filter-free single photon resonant fluorescence. The resulting source produces single photons with a simultaneous high extraction efficiency of 0.87, purity of 0.9045(4), and indistinguishability of 0.963(4).</description>

      <title>QAOA with random and subgraph phase operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a promising quantum algorithm that can be used to approximately solve combinatorial optimization problems. The usual QAOA ansatz consists of an alternating application of the cost and mixer Hamiltonians. In this work, we study how using Hamiltonians other than the usual cost Hamiltonian, dubbed custom phase operators, can affect the performance of QAOA. We derive an expected value formula for QAOA with custom phase operators at p = 1 and show numerically that some of these custom phase operators can achieve higher approximation ratio than the original algorithm implementation. Out of all the graphs tested, 0.036\% of the random custom phase operators, 75.9\% of the subgraph custom phase operators, 95.1\% of the triangle-removed custom phase operators, and 93.9\% of the maximal degree edge-removed custom phase operators have a higher approximation ratio than the original QAOA implementation. This finding opens up the question of whether better phase operators can be designed to further improve the performance of QAOA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent demonstrations of the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) computer architecture, circuit times are dominated by cooling. Some motional modes of multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results. We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta temperatures starting as high as n~200.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The echo state property (ESP) represents a fundamental concept in the reservoir computing (RC) framework that ensures output-only training of reservoir networks by being agnostic to the initial states and far past inputs. However, the traditional definition of ESP does not describe possible non-stationary systems in which statistical properties evolve. To address this issue, we introduce two new categories of ESP: $\textit{non-stationary ESP}$, designed for potentially non-stationary systems, and $\textit{subspace/subset ESP}$, designed for systems whose subsystems have ESP. Following the definitions, we numerically demonstrate the correspondence between non-stationary ESP in the quantum reservoir computer (QRC) framework with typical Hamiltonian dynamics and input encoding methods using non-linear autoregressive moving-average (NARMA) tasks. We also confirm the correspondence by computing linear/non-linear memory capacities that quantify input-dependent components within reservoir states. Our study presents a new understanding of the practical design of QRC and other possibly non-stationary RC systems in which non-stationary systems and subsystems are exploited.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we provide some categorical perspectives on the relativization construction arising from quantum measurement theory in the presence of symmetries and occupying a central place in the operational approach to quantum reference frames. This construction provides, for any quantum system, a quantum channel from the system's algebra to the invariant algebra on the composite system also encompassing the chosen reference, contingent upon a choice of the pointer observable. These maps are understood as relativizing observables on systems upon the specification of a quantum reference frame. We begin by extending the construction to systems modelled on subspaces of algebras of operators to then define a functor taking a pair consisting of a reference frame and a system and assigning to them a subspace of relative operators defined in terms of an image of the corresponding relativization map. When a single frame and equivariant channels are considered, the relativization maps can be understood as a natural transformation. Upon fixing a system, the functor provides a novel kind of frame transformation that we call external. Results achieved provide a deeper structural understanding of the framework of interest and point towards its categorification and potential application to local systems of algebraic quantum field theories.</description>

Abstract: Achieving high-performance computation on quantum systems presents a formidable challenge that necessitates bridging the capabilities between quantum hardware and classical computing resources. This study introduces an innovative distribution-aware Quantum-Classical-Quantum (QCQ) architecture, which integrates cutting-edge quantum software framework works with high-performance classical computing resources to address challenges in quantum simulation for materials and condensed matter physics. At the heart of this architecture is the seamless integration of VQE algorithms running on QPUs for efficient quantum state preparation, Tensor Network states, and QCNNs for classifying quantum states on classical hardware.
  For benchmarking quantum simulators, the QCQ architecture utilizes the cuQuantum SDK to leverage multi-GPU acceleration, integrated with PennyLane's Lightning plugin, demonstrating up to tenfold increases in computational speed for complex phase transition classification tasks compared to traditional CPU-based methods. This significant acceleration enables models such as the transverse field Ising and XXZ systems to accurately predict phase transitions with a 99.5% accuracy. The architecture's ability to distribute computation between QPUs and classical resources addresses critical bottlenecks in Quantum-HPC, paving the way for scalable quantum simulation.
  The QCQ framework embodies a synergistic combination of quantum algorithms, machine learning, and Quantum-HPC capabilities, enhancing its potential to provide transformative insights into the behavior of quantum systems across different scales. As quantum hardware continues to improve, this hybrid distribution-aware framework will play a crucial role in realizing the full potential of quantum computing by seamlessly integrating distributed quantum resources with the state-of-the-art classical computing infrastructure.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we engineer the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction mediated by photons to emulate ground-state chiral current based on three-level atoms driven by quantum and classical fields. We employ adiabatic elimination techniques to derive an effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction Hamiltonian of two-level systems, which can address the challenges arising from the finite lifetime of excited states. Furthermore, we can ensure to achieve desired dynamics through the implementation of periodic modulation on the atomic ground states. Besides, three-state and multi-state chiral current can be obtained by choosing appropriate driving frequencies and phases. We also design the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction for the other components based on a toggling frame. The numerical simulation results further indicate that our proposal can generate a perfectly reliable ground-state chiral current and open up possibilities for quantum state transfer and the development of future quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: Efficient control of stochastic dynamics in quantum systems is pivotal for various applications, including quantum information processing and metrology. This paper introduces a Lyapunov-based control approach with homodyne-mediated filtering. We employ a modified extended Kalman filtering method to directly estimate the evolution of the quantum density operator $\rho$, considering sequential homodyne current measurements. Our method explicitly addresses the dynamics of a stochastic master equation with correlated noise, ensuring by construction the quantum properties of the estimated state variable $\hat\rho$. Moreover, our proposed switching based Lyapunov control scheme that is fed with $\hat\rho$, guarantees noise-to-state practically stable in probability of the desired stationary target set with respect to the estimation error variance. We demonstrate our approach's efficacy in stabilizing a qubit coupled to a leaky cavity under homodyne detection.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Variational Quantum Eigensolver to detect Phase Transitions through Energy Level Crossings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Level spectroscopy stands as a powerful method for identifying the transition point that delineates distinct quantum phases. Since each quantum phase exhibits a characteristic sequence of excited states, the crossing of energy levels between low-lying excited states offers a reliable mean to estimate the phase transition point. While approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver are useful for approximating ground states of interacting systems using quantum computing, capturing low-energy excitations remains challenging. In our study, we introduce an equivariant quantum circuit that preserves the total spin and the translational symmetry to accurately describe singlet and triplet excited states in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a chain, which are crucial for characterizing its transition point. Additionally, we assess the impact of noise on the variational state, showing that conventional mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation reliably restore its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Quantum Subspace Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an iterative generalisation of the quantum subspace expansion algorithm used with a Krylov basis. The iterative construction connects a sequence of subspaces via their lowest energy states. Diagonalising a Hamiltonian in a given Krylov subspace requires the same quantum resources in both the single step and sequential cases. We propose a variance-based criterion for determining a good iterative sequence and provide numerical evidence that these good sequences display improved numerical stability over a single step in the presence of finite sampling noise. Implementing the generalisation requires additional classical processing with a polynomial overhead in the subspace dimension. By exchanging quantum circuit depth for additional measurements the quantum subspace expansion algorithm appears to be an approach suited to near term or early error-corrected quantum hardware. Our work suggests that the numerical instability limiting the accuracy of this approach can be substantially alleviated beyond the current state of the art.</description>

Abstract: Many-body localized phases retain memory of their initial conditions in disordered interacting systems with unitary dynamics. The stability of the localized phase due to the breakdown of unitarity is of relevance to experiment in the presence of dissipation. Here we investigate the impact of non-Hermitian perturbations on many-body localization. We focus on the interacting Hatano-Nelson model which breaks unitarity via asymmetric hopping. We explore the phase diagram for the mid-spectrum eigenstates as a function of the interaction strength and the non-Hermiticity. In contrast to the non-interacting case, our findings are consistent with a two-step approach to the localized regime. We also study the dynamics of the particle imbalance. We show that the distribution of relaxation time scales differs qualitatively between the localized and ergodic phases. Our findings suggest the possibility of an intermediate dynamical regime in disordered open systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast artificial intelligence: Machine learning with atomic-scale quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We train a model atom to recognize hand-written digits between 0 and 9, employing intense light--matter interaction as a computational resource. For training, individual images of hand-written digits in the range 0-9 are converted into shaped laser pulses (data input pulses). Simultaneously with an input pulse, another shaped pulse (program pulse), polarized in the orthogonal direction, is applied to the atom and the system evolves quantum mechanically according to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The purpose of the optimal program pulse is to direct the system into specific atomic final states that correspond to the input digits. A success rate of about 40\% is demonstrated here for a basic optimization scheme, so far limited by the computational power to find the optimal program pulse in a high-dimensional search space. This atomic-intelligence image-recognition scheme is scalable towards larger (e.g. molecular) systems, is readily reprogrammable towards other learning/classification tasks and operates on time scales down to tens of femtoseconds. It has the potential to outpace other currently implemented machine-learning approaches, including the fastest optical on-chip neuromorphic systems and optical accelerators, by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Communication protocols and QECCs from the perspective of TQFT, Part I: Constructing LOCC protocols and QECCs from TQFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption language for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. Here we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols generically induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs). Using multi-observer scenarios described by quantum Darwinism and Bell/EPR experiments as examples, we show how these LOCC-induced QECCs effectively convert entanglement into classical redundancy. In the accompanying Part II, we show that such QECCs can be regarded as implementing, or inducing the emergence of, spacetimes on the boundaries between interacting systems. We investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime using BF and Chern-Simons theories, and then using topological M-theory.</description>

      <title>Parsing skin effect in a non-Hermitian spinless BHZ-like model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work comprehensively investigates the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in a spinless Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ)-like model in one dimension. It is generally believed that a system with non-reciprocal hopping amplitudes demonstrates NHSE. However, we show that there are exceptions, and more in-depth analyses are required to decode the presence of NHSE or its variants in a system. The fascinating aspects of our findings, depending on the inclusion of non-reciprocity in the inter-orbital hopping terms, concede the existence of conventional or bi-directional NHSE and even a surprising absence of NHSE. The topological properties and the (bi-orthogonal) bulk-boundary correspondence, enumerated via computation of the (complex) Berry phase, the winding number, and spatial localization of the edge modes, highlight the topological phase transitions occurring therein. Further, to facilitate a structured discussion of the non-Hermitian model, we split the results into PT symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases with a view to comparing the two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04777v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dimensionality plays a crucial role in long-range dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs). We demonstrate that a resonant nanophotonic structure modifies the apparent dimensionality in an interacting ensemble of emitters, as revealed by population decay dynamics. Our measurements on a dense ensemble of interacting quantum emitters in a resonant nanophotonic structure with long-range DDIs reveal an effective dimensionality reduction to $\bar{d} = 2.20 (12)$, despite the emitters being distributed in 3D. This contrasts the homogeneous environment, where the apparent dimension is $\bar{d} = 3.00$. Our work presents a promising avenue to manipulate dimensionality in an ensemble of interacting emitters.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots operated dynamically are the basis of many quantum technologies such as quantum sensors and computers. Hence, modelling their electrical properties at microwave frequencies becomes essential to simulate their performance in larger electronic circuits. Here, we develop a self-consistent quantum master equation formalism to obtain the admittance of a quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir under the effect of a coherent photon bath. We find a general expression for the admittance that captures the well-known semiclassical (thermal) limit, along with the transition to lifetime and power broadening regimes due to the increased coupling to the reservoir and amplitude of the photonic drive, respectively. Furthermore, we describe two new photon-mediated regimes: Floquet broadening, determined by the dressing of the QD states, and broadening determined by photon loss in the system. Our results provide a method to simulate the high-frequency behaviour of QDs in a wide range of limits, describe past experiments, and propose novel explorations of QD-photon interactions.</description>

Abstract: By replacing the spatial derivative with the Dunkl derivative, we generalize the Fokker-Planck equation in (1+1) dimensions. We obtain the Dunkl-Fokker-Planck eigenvalues equation and solve it for the harmonic oscillator plus a centrifugal-type potential. Furthermore, when the drift function is odd, we reduce our results to those of the recently developed Wigner-Dunkl supersymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The long-range electrostatic interactions between molecules depend strongly on their relative orientation, which manifests as a rotational state dependence. Interactions between molecules in the same rotational quantum state are well-known attractive rotational van der Waals interactions. Interactions in rotational states that differ by one quantum show resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We show that where molecules are in rotational states that differ by more than one quantum, they exhibit repulsive van der Waals interactions. At temperatures below a millikelvin, this effect can reduce collisional loss by multiple orders of magnitude. These repulsive interactions lead to applications in quantum simulation and impurity physics with ultracold polar molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to repeatedly load laser-cooled molecules into optical tweezers, and transfer them to storage states that are rotationally excited by two additional quanta. Collisional loss of molecules in these storage states is suppressed, and a dipolar blockade prevents the accumulation of more than one molecule. Applying three cycles loads tweezers with single molecules at an 80~\% success rate, limited by residual collisional loss. This improved loading efficiency reduces the time needed for rearrangement of tweezer arrays, which would otherwise limit the scalability of neutral molecule quantum computers.</description>

Abstract: We give complete presentations for the dagger-compact props of affine Lagrangian and coisotropic relations over an arbitrary field. This provides a unified family of graphical languages for both affinely constrained classical mechanical systems, as well as odd-prime-dimensional stabiliser quantum circuits. To this end, we present affine Lagrangian relations by a particular class of undirected coloured graphs. In order to reason about composite systems, we introduce a powerful scalable notation where the vertices of these graphs are themselves coloured by graphs. In the setting of stabiliser quantum mechanics, this scalable notation gives an extremely concise description of graph states, which can be composed via ``phased spider fusion.'' Likewise, in the classical mechanical setting of electrical circuits, we show that impedance matrices for reciprocal networks are presented in essentially the same way.</description>

Abstract: Quantum metaphotonics has emerged as a cutting-edge subfield of meta-optics employing subwavelength resonators and their planar structures such as metasurfaces to generate, manipulate, and detect quantum states of light. It holds a great potential for the miniaturization of current bulky quantum optical elements by developing a design of on-chip quantum systems for various applications of quantum technologies. Over the past few years, this field has witnessed a surge of intriguing theoretical ideas, groundbreaking experiments, and novel application proposals. This perspective paper aims to summarize the most recent advancements and also provide a perspective on the further progress in this rapidly developing field of research.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Microscopy: Tomography and Entanglement Measures via Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

Abstract: We are concerned with log-majorization for matrices in connection with the multivariate Golden--Thompson trace inequality and the Karcher mean (i.e., a multivariate extension of the weighted geometric mean). We show an extension of Araki's log-majorization and apply it to the $\alpha$-$z$-R\'enyi divergence in quantum information. We discuss the equality cases in the multivariate trace inequality of Golden--Thompson type and in the norm inequality for the Karcher mean. The paper includes an appendix to correct the proof of the author's old result on the equality case in the norm inequality for the weighted geometric mean.</description>

      <title>Alternant Hydrocarbon Diradicals as Optically Addressable Molecular Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-spin molecules allow for bottom-up qubit design and are promising platforms for magnetic sensing and quantum information science. Optical addressability of molecular electron spins has also been proposed in first-row transition metal complexes via optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) mechanisms analogous to the diamond-NV colour centre. However, significantly less progress has been made on the front of metal-free molecules, which can deliver lower costs and milder environmental impacts. At present, most luminescent open-shell organic molecules are $\pi$-diradicals, but such systems often suffer from poor ground-state open-shell characters necessary to realise a stable ground-state molecular qubit. In this work, we use alternancy symmetry to selectively minimise radical-radical interactions in the ground state, generating $\pi$-systems with high diradical characters. We call them m-dimers, referencing the need to covalently link two benzylic radicals at their meta carbon atoms for the desired symmetry. Through a detailed electronic structure analysis, we find that the excited states of alternant hydrocarbon m-diradicals contain important symmetries that can be used to construct ODMR mechanisms leading to ground-state spin polarisation. The molecular parameters are set in the context of a tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl (TTM) radical dimer covalently tethered at the meta position, demonstrating the feasibility of alternant m-diradicals as molecular colour centres.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give generators and relations for the hypergraph props of Gaussian relations and positive affine Lagrangian relations. The former extends Gaussian probabilistic processes by completely-uninformative priors, and the latter extends Gaussian quantum mechanics with infinitely-squeezed states. These presentations are given by adding a generator to the presentation of real affine relations and of real affine Lagrangian relations which freely codiscards effects, as well as certain rotations.
  The presentation of positive affine Lagrangian relations provides a rigorous justification for many common yet informal calculations in the quantum physics literature involving infinite-squeezing. Our presentation naturally extends Menicucci et al.'s graph-theoretic representation of Gaussian quantum states with a representation for Gaussian transformations. Using this graphical calculus, we also give a graphical proof of Braunstein and Kimble's continuous-variable quantum teleportation protocol. We also interpret the LOv-calculus, a diagrammatic calculus for reasoning about passive linear-optical quantum circuits in our graphical calculus. Moreover, we show how our presentation allows for additional optical operations such as active squeezing.</description>
