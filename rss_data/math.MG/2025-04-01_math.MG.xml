      <title>On the number of defects in optimal quantizers on closed surfaces: the hexagonal torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strategy for proving an asymptotic upper bound on the number of defects (non-hexagonal Voronoi cells) in the $n$ generator optimal quantizer on a closed surface (i.e., compact 2-manifold without boundary). The program is based upon a general lower bound on the optimal quantization error and related upper bounds for the L\"oschian numbers $n$ (the norms of the Eisenstein integers) based upon the Goldberg-Coxeter construction. A gap lemma is used to reduce the asymptotics of the number of defects to precisely the asymptotics for the gaps between L\"oschian numbers. We apply this strategy on the hexagonal torus and prove that the number of defects is at most $O(n^{1/4})$ -- strictly fewer than surfaces with boundary -- and conjecture (based upon the number-theoretic L\"oschian gap conjecture) that it is in fact $O(\log n)$. Incidentally, the method also yields a related upper bound on the variance of the areas of the Voronoi cells. We show further that the bound on the number of defects holds in a neighborhood of the optimizers. Finally, we remark on the remaining issues for implementation on the 2-sphere.</description>

      <title>Critical modular lattices in the Gaussian core model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the local analysis of Gaussian potential energy of modular lattices. We show for instance that the $3$-modular $12$-dimensional Coxeter-Todd lattice and the $2$-modular $16$-dimensional Barnes-Wall lattice, which both provide excellent sphere packings, are not, even locally, universally optimal (in the sense of Cohn and Kumar).</description>

      <title>Construction of graph-directed invariant sets of weak contractions on semi-metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a construction of graph-directed invariant sets of weak contractions ni the sense of Matkowski on semi-metric spaces. We follow the approach by Bessenyei and P\'enzes, which applies the Kuratowski noncompactness measure without relying on Blascke's completeness theorem. We also establish a relationship between this approach and a generalized de Rham's functional equation indexed by a finite directed graph.</description>

      <title>Hypergenerated Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an algebraic characterization of those stratified groups in which boundaries with locally constant normal are locally flat. We show that these groups, which we call hypergenerated, are exactly the stratified groups where embeddings of non-characteristic hypersurfaces are locally bi-Lipschitz. Finally, we extend these results to submanifolds of arbitrary codimension.</description>

      <title>Functions positively associated with integral transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G\subset R^n$ be a compact origin-symmetric set, and let $T:C_{e}(G)\to C_{e}(G)$ be a linear operator on the space of real valued even continuous functions on $G$. Suppose that $f,g\in C_e(G)$ are positive functions, and $Tf(x)\le Tg(x)$ for every $x\in G.$ Does this condition alone allow to compare the $L_p$-norms of the functions $f$ and $g$ for a given $p&gt;1$? We introduce a class of functions ${\rm Pos}(T)$ that controls this problem in the sense that if $f^{p-1}\in {\rm Pos}(T)$, then $\|f\|_{L_p(G)}\le \|g\|_{L_p(G)}$ provided that $Tf\le Tg$ pointwise. On the other hand, if $g^{p-1} \notin {\rm Pos}(T)$, then one can construct a function $f$ giving together with $g$ a counterexample. We provide analytic characterizations of ${\rm Pos}(T)$ in the cases where $T$ is the spherical Radon transform or the cosine transform. These characterizations represent analytic versions of the functional analytic characterizations of intersection and projection bodies established by Goodey, Lutwak and Weil.</description>

      <title>Approximation of spherical convex bodies of constant width $\pi/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C\subset \mathbb{S}^2$ be a spherical convex body of constant width $\tau$. It is known that (i) if $\tau&lt;\pi/2$ then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists a spherical convex body $C_\varepsilon$ of constant width $\tau$ whose boundary consists only of arcs of circles of radius $\tau$ such that the Hausdorff distance between $C$ and $C_\varepsilon$ is at most $\varepsilon$; (ii) if $\tau&gt;\pi/2$ then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists a spherical convex body $C_\varepsilon$ of constant width $\tau$ whose boundary consists only of arcs of circles of radius $\tau-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and great circle arcs such that the Hausdorff distance between $C$ and $C_\varepsilon$ is at most $\varepsilon$. In this paper, we present an approximation of the remaining case $\tau=\pi/2$, that is, if $\tau=\pi/2$ then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists a spherical polytope $\mathcal{P}_\varepsilon$ of constant width $\pi/2$ such that the Hausdorff distance between $C$ and $\mathcal{P}_\varepsilon$ is at most $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>A Toponogov globalisation result for Lorentzian length spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the synthetic geometric setting introduced by Kunzinger and S\"amann, we present an analogue of Toponogov's Globalisation Theorem which applies to Lorentzian length spaces with lower (timelike) curvature bounds. Our approach utilises a "cat's cradle" construction akin to that which appears in several proofs in the metric setting. On the road to our main result, we also provide a lemma regarding the subdivision of triangles in spaces with a local lower curvature bound and a synthetic Lorentzian version of the Lebesgue Number Lemma. Several properties of time functions and the null distance on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces are also highlighted. We conclude by presenting several applications of our results, including versions of the Bonnet--Myers Theorem and the Splitting Theorem for Lorentzian length spaces with local lower curvature bounds, as well as discussion of stability of curvature bounds under Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>Entropic curvature not comparable to other curvatures -- or is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider global $\theta$-curvatures of finite Markov chains with associated means $\theta$ in the spirit of the entropic curvature (based on the logarithmic mean) by Erbar-Maas and Mielke. As in the case of Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we also allow for a finite dimension parameter by making use of an adapted $\Gamma$ calculus for $\theta$-curvatures. We prove explicit positive lower curvature bounds (both finite- and infinite-dimensional) for finite abelian Cayley graphs. In the case of cycles, we provide also an upper curvature bound which shows that our lower bounds are asymptotically sharp (up to a logarithmic factor). Moreover, we prove new universal lower curvature bounds for finite Markov chains as well as curvature perturbation results (allowing, in particular, to compare entropic and Bakry-\'Emery curvatures). Finally, we present examples where entropic curvature differs significantly from other curvature notions like Bakry-\'Emery curvature or Ollivier Ricci and sectional curvatures.</description>
