      <title>Shoot-through layers in upright proton arcs unlock advantages in plan quality and range verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and purpose: Upright proton therapy with compact delivery systems has the potential to reduce costs for treatments but could also lead to broadening of the beam penumbra. This study aims at combining upright static proton arcs with additional layers of shoot-through (ST) protons to sharpen the beam penumbra and improve plan quality for such systems. An additional advantage of the method is that it provides a straightforward approach for range verification.
  Methods: We examined various treatment plans for a virtual phantom: 3-beam IMPT, static arc (Arc) with/without ST (Arc+ST), and with/without collimation (+Coll). In the virtual phantom three different targets were utilized to study the effect on conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), robustness and mean dose to the phantom volume. The phantom study was complemented with a head-and-neck (H&amp;N) patient case with a similar set of plans. A range verification concept that determines residual ranges of the ST protons was studied in simulated scenarios for the H&amp;N case.
  Results: The Arc+ST plans show superior CI, HI and target robustness compared to the Arc+Coll plans. For the Arc plans without ST, the collimated plans perform better than the uncollimated plans. For Arc+ST, on the other hand, collimation has little impact on CI, HI and robustness. However, a small increase in the mean dose to the phantom volume is seen without collimation. For the H&amp;N case, similar improvements for Arc+ST can be seen with only a marginal increase of the mean dose to the patient volume. The range verification simulation shows that the method is suitable to detect range errors.
  Conclusions: Combining proton arcs and ST layers can enhance compact upright proton solutions by improving plan quality. It is also tailored for the inclusion of a fast and straightforward residual range verification method.</description>

Abstract: Image-based modeling is essential for understanding cardiovascular hemodynamics and advancing the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Constructing patient-specific vascular models remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and time-consuming, limiting their clinical applications. This study introduces a deep-learning framework that automates the creation of simulation-ready vascular models from medical images. The framework integrates a segmentation module for accurate voxel-based vessel delineation with a surface deformation module that performs anatomically consistent and unsupervised surface refinements guided by medical image data. By unifying voxel segmentation and surface deformation into a single cohesive pipeline, the framework addresses key limitations of existing methods, enhancing geometric accuracy and computational efficiency. Evaluated on publicly available datasets, the proposed approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in segmentation and mesh quality while significantly reducing manual effort and processing time. This work advances the scalability and reliability of image-based computational modeling, facilitating broader applications in clinical and research settings.</description>

      <title>In vivo validation of Wireless Power Transfer System for Magnetically Controlled Robotic Capsule Endoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the in vivo validation of an inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) system integrated for the first time into a magnetically controlled robotic capsule endoscopy platform. The proposed system enables continuous power delivery to the capsule without the need for onboard batteries, thus extending operational time and reducing size constraints. The WPT system operates through a resonant inductive coupling mechanism, based on a transmitting coil mounted on the end effector of a robotic arm that also houses an external permanent magnet and a localization coil for precise capsule manipulation. To ensure robust and stable power transmission in the presence of coil misalignment and rotation, a 3D receiving coil is integrated within the capsule. Additionally, a closed-loop adaptive control system, based on load-shift keying (LSK) modulation, dynamically adjusts the transmitted power to optimize efficiency while maintaining compliance with specific absorption rate (SAR) safety limits. The system has been extensively characterized in laboratory settings and validated through in vivo experiments using a porcine model, demonstrating reliable power transfer and effective robotic navigation in realistic gastrointestinal conditions: the average received power was 110 mW at a distance of 9 cm between the coils, with variable capsule rotation angles. The results confirm the feasibility of the proposed WPT approach for autonomous, battery-free robotic capsule endoscopy, paving the way for enhanced diagnostic in gastrointestinal medicine.</description>

      <title>Joint estimation of activity, attenuation and motion in respiratory-self-gated time-of-flight PET</title>

Abstract: Whole-body PET imaging is often hindered by respiratory motion during acquisition, causing significant degradation in the quality of reconstructed activity images. An additional challenge in PET/CT imaging arises from the respiratory phase mismatch between CT-based attenuation correction and PET acquisition, leading to attenuation artifacts. To address these issues, we propose two new, purely data-driven methods for the joint estimation of activity, attenuation, and motion in respiratory self-gated TOF PET. These methods enable the reconstruction of a single activity image free from motion and attenuation artifacts.
  The proposed methods were evaluated using data from the anthropomorphic Wilhelm phantom acquired on a Siemens mCT PET/CT system, as well as 3 clinical FDG PET/CT datasets acquired on a GE DMI PET/CT system. Image quality was assessed visually to identify motion and attenuation artifacts. Lesion uptake values were quantitatively compared across reconstructions without motion modeling, with motion modeling but static attenuation correction, and with our proposed methods.
  For the Wilhelm phantom, the proposed methods delivered image quality closely matching the reference reconstruction from a static acquisition. The lesion-to-background contrast for a liver dome lesion improved from 2.0 (no motion correction) to 5.2 (proposed methods), matching the contrast from the static acquisition (5.2). In contrast, motion modeling with static attenuation correction yielded a lower contrast of 3.5. In patient datasets, the proposed methods successfully reduced motion artifacts in lung and liver lesions and mitigated attenuation artifacts, demonstrating superior lesion to background separation.
  Our proposed methods enable the reconstruction of a single, high-quality activity image that is motion-corrected and free from attenuation artifacts, without the need for external hardware.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic cesium iodide as a potential PET material</title>

Abstract: Total Body PET (TBPET) scanners have recently demonstrated the ability to significantly reduce both acquisition time and the administered radioactive dose, thanks to their increased sensitivity. However, their widespread adoption is limited by the high costs associated with the current available systems. Cesium iodide (CsI), though historically less favored for PET due to its lower stopping power and light yield compared to crystals like LYSO, shows remarkable improvement when operated at cryogenic temperatures ($\sim$100 K). Under these conditions, CsI light yield rises dramatically to about 100 photons/keV, providing excellent energy resolution and good coincidence time resolution at a lower cost - typically 3 to 5 times cheaper than other crystals at parity of radiation length. In our study, we measured the light yield, the energy resolution and the coincidence time resolution as a function of temperature for two pure CsI crystals read out by a pair of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). An energy resolution of 6.3% FWHM and a coincidence time resolution of 1.84 ns at 511 keV were achieved at a temperature of 104 K. These results point towards the potential of cryogenic CsI as a cost-effective, high-performance material for TBPET scanners.</description>

      <title>A Plug-and-Play Method for Guided Multi-contrast MRI Reconstruction based on Content/Style Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since multiple MRI contrasts of the same anatomy contain redundant information, one contrast can be used as a prior for guiding the reconstruction of an undersampled subsequent contrast. To this end, several learning-based guided reconstruction methods have been proposed. However, a key challenge is the requirement of large paired training datasets comprising raw data and aligned reference images. We propose a modular two-stage approach for guided reconstruction addressing this issue, which additionally provides an explanatory framework for the multi-contrast problem in terms of the shared and non-shared generative factors underlying two given contrasts. A content/style model of two-contrast image data is learned from a largely unpaired image-domain dataset and is subsequently applied as a plug-and-play operator in iterative reconstruction. The disentanglement of content and style allows explicit representation of contrast-independent and contrast-specific factors. Based on this, incorporating prior information into the reconstruction reduces to simply replacing the aliased content of the image estimate with high-quality content derived from the reference scan. Combining this component with a data consistency step and introducing a general corrective process for the content yields an iterative scheme. We name this novel approach PnP-MUNIT. Various aspects like interpretability and convergence are explored via simulations. Furthermore, its practicality is demonstrated on the NYU fastMRI DICOM dataset and two in-house multi-coil raw datasets, obtaining up to 32.6% more acceleration over learning-based non-guided reconstruction for a given SSIM. In a radiological task, PnP-MUNIT allowed 33.3% more acceleration over clinical reconstruction at diagnostic quality.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Mitigation of Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning-Based MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods, especially those based on physics-driven DL, have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Our framework is based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency. The output of the model is mapped to another set of MRI measurements for a different sub-sampling pattern, and this synthesized data is reconstructed with the same model. Intuitively, without an attack, the second reconstruction is expected to be consistent with the first, while with an attack, disruptions are present. A novel objective function is devised based on this idea, which is minimized within a small ball around the attack input for mitigation. Experimental results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining. Finally, we extend our mitigation method to two important practical scenarios: a blind setup, where the attack strength or algorithm is not known to the end user; and an adaptive attack setup, where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense strategy. Our approach remains effective in both cases.</description>
