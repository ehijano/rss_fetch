      <title>Sublinear Time Algorithms for Abelian Group Isomorphism and Basis Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his paper, we study the problems of abelian group isomorphism and basis construction in two models. In the {\it partially specified model} (PS-model), the algorithm does not know the group size but can access randomly chosen elements of the group along with the Cayley table of those elements, which provides the result of the binary operation for every pair of selected elements. In the stronger {\it fully specified model} (FS-model), the algorithm knows the size of the group and has access to its elements and Cayley table.
  Given two abelian groups, $G$, and $H$, we present an algorithm in the PS-model (and hence in the FS-model) that runs in time $\tilde O(\sqrt{|G|})$ and decides if they are isomorphic. This improves on Kavitha's linear-time algorithm and gives the first sublinear-time solution for this problem. We then prove the lower bound $\Omega(|G|^{1/4})$ for the FS-model and the tight bound $\Omega(\sqrt{|G|})$ for the PS-model. This is the first known lower bound for this problem. We obtain similar results for finding a basis for abelian groups. For deterministic algorithms, a simple $\Omega(|G|)$ lower bound is given.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap? Not for SVP Hardness under ETH!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove new hardness results for fundamental lattice problems under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Building on a recent breakthrough by Bitansky et al. [BHIRW24], who gave a polynomial-time reduction from $\mathsf{3SAT}$ to the (gap) $\mathsf{MAXLIN}$ problem-a class of CSPs with linear equations over finite fields-we derive ETH-hardness for several lattice problems.
  First, we show that for any $p \in [1, \infty)$, there exists an explicit constant $\gamma &gt; 1$ such that $\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\gamma}$ (the $\ell_p$-norm approximate Closest Vector Problem) does not admit a $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm unless ETH is false. Our reduction is deterministic and proceeds via a direct reduction from (gap) $\mathsf{MAXLIN}$ to $\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\gamma}$.
  Next, we prove a randomized ETH-hardness result for $\mathsf{SVP}_{p,\gamma}$ (the $\ell_p$-norm approximate Shortest Vector Problem) for all $p &gt; 2$. This result relies on a novel property of the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ in the $\ell_p$ norm and a randomized reduction from $\mathsf{CVP}_{p,\gamma}$ to $\mathsf{SVP}_{p,\gamma'}$.
  Finally, we improve over prior reductions from $\mathsf{3SAT}$ to $\mathsf{BDD}_{p, \alpha}$ (the Bounded Distance Decoding problem), yielding better ETH-hardness results for $\mathsf{BDD}_{p, \alpha}$ for any $p \in [1, \infty)$ and $\alpha &gt; \alpha_p^{\ddagger}$, where $\alpha_p^{\ddagger}$ is an explicit threshold depending on $p$.
  We additionally observe that prior work implies ETH hardness for the gap minimum distance problem ($\gamma$-$\mathsf{MDP}$) in codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithms through graph composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the graph composition framework, a generalization of the st-connectivity framework for generating quantum algorithms, where the availability of each of the graph's edges is computed by a span program. We provide an exact characterization of the resulting witness sizes in terms of effective resistances of related graphs. We also provide less-powerful, but easier-to-use upper bounds on these witness sizes. We give generic time-efficient implementations of algorithms generated through the graph composition framework, in the quantum read-only memory model, which is a weaker assumption than the more common quantum random-access model. Along the way, we simplify the span program algorithm, and remove the dependence of its analysis on the effective spectral gap lemma.
  We unify the quantum algorithmic frameworks that are based on span programs or the quantum adversary bound. In particular, we show how the st-connectivity framework subsumes the learning graph framework, the weighted-decision-tree framework, and a zero-error version of the latter. We show that the graph composition framework subsumes part of the quantum divide and conquer framework, and that it is itself subsumed by the multidimensional quantum walk framework. Moreover, we show that the weighted-decision-tree complexity is quadratically related to deterministic query complexity, and to the GT-bound with polynomial exponent 3/2. For the latter, we also provide a matching separation.
  We apply our techniques to give improved algorithms for various string-search problems, namely the Dyck-language recognition problem of depth 3, the 3-increasing subsequence problem, and the OR $\circ$ pSEARCH problem. We also simplify existing quantum algorithms for the space-efficient directed st-connectivity problem, the pattern-matching problem and the infix-search problem.</description>

      <title>Finding Diverse Solutions in Combinatorial Problems with a Distributive Lattice Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the polynomial-time solvability of $k$-\textsc{Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts} (De Berg et al., ISAAC'23) to a wider class of combinatorial problems whose solution sets have a distributive lattice structure. We identify three structural conditions that, when met by a problem, ensure that a $k$-sized multiset of maximally-diverse solutions -- measured by the sum of pairwise Hamming distances -- can be found in polynomial time. We apply this framework to obtain polynomial time algorithms for finding diverse minimum $s$-$t$ cuts and diverse stable matchings. Moreover, we show that the framework extends to two other natural measures of diversity. Lastly, we present a simpler algorithmic framework for finding a largest set of pairwise disjoint solutions in problems that meet these structural conditions.</description>

      <title>Beating full state tomography for unentangled spectrum estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many copies of a mixed state $\rho \in \mathbb{C}^{d \times d}$ are needed to learn its spectrum? To date, the best known algorithms for spectrum estimation require as many copies as full state tomography, suggesting the possibility that learning a state's spectrum might be as difficult as learning the entire state. We show that this is not the case in the setting of unentangled measurements, by giving a spectrum estimation algorithm that uses $n = O(d^3\cdot (\log\log(d) / \log(d))^4 )$ copies of $\rho$, which is asymptotically fewer than the $n = \Omega(d^3)$ copies necessary for full state tomography. Our algorithm is inspired by the technique of local moment matching from classical statistics, and shows how it can be applied in the quantum setting.
  As an important subroutine in our spectrum estimation algorithm, we give an estimator of the $k$-th moment $\operatorname{tr}(\rho^k)$ which performs unentangled measurements and uses $O(d^{3-2/k})$ copies of $\rho$ in order to achieve a constant multiplicative error. This directly translates to an additive-error estimator of quantum Renyi entropy of order $k$ with the same number of copies.
  Finally, we present numerical evidence that the sample complexity of spectrum estimation can only improve over full state tomography by a sub-polynomial factor. Specifically, for spectrum learning with fully entangled measurements, we run simulations which suggest a lower bound of $\Omega(d^{2 - \gamma})$ copies for any constant $\gamma &gt; 0$. From this, we conclude the current best lower bound of $\Omega(d)$ is likely not tight.</description>

      <title>Condensing and Extracting Against Online Adversaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tasks of deterministically condensing and extracting randomness from Online Non-Oblivious Symbol Fixing (oNOSF) sources, a natural model of defective random sources for which extraction is impossible in many parameter regimes [AORSV, EUROCRYPT'20]. A $(g,\ell)$-oNOSF source is a sequence of $\ell$ blocks where $g$ of the blocks are good (are independent and have some min-entropy), and the remaining bad blocks are controlled by an online adversary - can be arbitrarily correlated with any block that appears before it.
  The existence of condensers for oNOSF sources was recently studied in [CGR, FOCS'24]. They proved various condensing impossibility results, and showed the existence of condensers when $n\gg\ell$.
  We make significant progress on proving the existence of condensers in almost all parameter regimes, even when $n$ is a large constant and $\ell$ is growing. We next construct the first explicit condensers for oNOSF sources, matching the existential results of [CGR, FOCS'24]. We also obtain a much improved construction for transforming low-entropy oNOSF sources into uniform oNOSF sources.
  We find interesting applications of our results to collective coin flipping and collective sampling, problems that are well-studied in fault-tolerant distributed computing. We use our condensers to provide very simple protocols for these problems.
  Next, we turn to understanding the possibility of extraction from oNOSF sources. We initiate the study of a new, natural notion of the influence of functions, which we call online influence. We establish tight bounds on the online influence of functions, which imply extraction lower bounds. Lastly, we give explicit extractor constructions for oNOSF sources, using novel connections to leader election protocols. These extractors achieve parameters that go beyond standard resilient functions [AL, Combinatorica'93].</description>

      <title>A Note on Quantum-Secure PRPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05564</link>
      <description>arXiv:1611.05564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to construct pseudorandom permutations (PRPs) that remain secure even if the adversary can query the permutation, both in the forward and reverse directions, on a quantum superposition of inputs. Such quantum-secure PRPs have found numerous applications in cryptography and complexity theory. Our construction combines a quantum-secure pseudorandom function together with constructions of classical format preserving encryption. By combining known results, we show how to construct quantum-secure PRP in this model whose security relies only on the existence of one-way functions.</description>

      <title>Variants of VC dimension and their applications to dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since its introduction by Vapnik and Chervonenkis in the 1960s, the VC dimension and its variants have played a central role in numerous fields. In this paper, we investigate several variants of the VC dimension and their applications to dynamical systems. First, we prove a new bound for a recently introduced generalization of VC dimension, which unifies and extends various extremal results on the VC, Natarajan, and Steele dimensions. This new bound allows us to strengthen one of the main theorems of Huang and Ye [Adv. Math., 2009] in dynamical systems. Second, we refine a key lemma of Huang and Ye related to a variant of VC dimension by providing a more concise and conceptual proof. We also highlight a surprising connection among this result, combinatorics, dynamical systems, and recent advances in communication complexity.</description>
