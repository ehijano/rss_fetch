      <title>A Criterion for Categories on which every Grothendieck Topology is Rigid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{C}$ be a Cauchy-complete category. The subtoposes of $[\mathbf{C}^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Set}]$ are sometimes all of the form $[\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{op}}, \mathbf{Set}]$ where $\mathbf{D}$ is a full Cauchy-complete subcategory of $\mathbf{C}$. This is the case for instance when $\mathbf{C}$ is finite, an Artinian poset, or the simplex category. In order to unify these situations, we give two formulations of a sufficient condition. The first formulation involves a two-player game, and the second formulation combines two "local" properties of $\mathbf{C}$.</description>

      <title>The stabilized bounded N-derived category of an exact category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Buchweitz related the singularity category of a (strongly) Gorenstein ring and the stable category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules by a triangle equivalence. We phrase his result in a relative categorical setting based on N-complexes instead of classical 2-complexes. The role of Cohen-Macaulay modules is played by chains of monics in a Frobenius subcategory of an exact category. As a byproduct, we provide foundational results on derived categories of N-complexes over exact categories known from the Abelian case or for 2-complexes.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries: (1+1)d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework to characterize gapped infra-red (IR) phases of theories with non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries. In this paper we focus on (1+1)d gapped phases with fusion category symmetries. The approach that we propose uses the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) as a key input: associated to a field theory in d spacetime dimensions, the SymTFT lives in one dimension higher and admits a gapped boundary, which realizes the categorical symmetries. It also admits a second, physical, boundary, which is generically not gapped. Upon interval compactification of the SymTFT by colliding the gapped and physical boundaries, we regain the original theory. In this paper, we realize gapped symmetric phases by choosing the physical boundary to be a gapped boundary condition as well. This set-up provides computational power to determine the number of vacua, the symmetry breaking pattern, and the action of the symmetry on the vacua. The SymTFT also manifestly encodes the order parameters for these gapped phases, thus providing a generalized, categorical Landau paradigm for (1+1)d gapped phases. We find that for non-invertible symmetries the order parameters involve multiplets containing both untwisted and twisted sector local operators, and hence can be interpreted as mixtures of conventional and string order parameters. We also observe that spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to vacua that are physically distinguishable: unlike the standard symmetries described by groups, non-invertible symmetries can have different actions on different vacua of an irreducible gapped phase. This leads to the presence of relative Euler terms between physically distinct vacua. We also provide a mathematical description of symmetric gapped phases as 2-functors from delooping of fusion category characterizing the symmetry to Euler completion of 2-vector spaces.</description>
