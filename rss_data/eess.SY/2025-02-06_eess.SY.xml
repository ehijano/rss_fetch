      <title>Distributed Prescribed-Time Observer for Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed prescribed-time observer for nonlinear systems representable in a block-triangular observable canonical form. Using a weighted average of neighbor estimates exchanged over a strongly connected digraph, each observer estimates the system state despite limited local sensor measurements. The proposed design guarantees that distributed state estimation errors converge to zero at a user-specified convergence time, irrespective of observers' initial conditions. To achieve this prescribed-time convergence, distributed observers implement time-varying local output injection gains that asymptotically approach infinity as the prescribed time is approached. The theoretical convergence is rigorously proven and validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>NDKF: A Neural-Enhanced Distributed Kalman Filter for Nonlinear Multi-Sensor Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Neural-Enhanced Distributed Kalman Filter (NDKF) for multi-sensor state estimation in nonlinear systems. Unlike traditional Kalman filters that rely on explicit, linear models and centralized data fusion, the NDKF leverages neural networks to learn both the system dynamics and measurement functions directly from data. Each sensor node performs local prediction and update steps using these learned models and exchanges only compact summary information with its neighbors via a consensus-based fusion process, which reduces communication overhead and eliminates a single point of failure. Our theoretical convergence analysis establishes sufficient conditions under which the local linearizations of the neural models guarantee overall filter stability and provides a solid foundation for the proposed approach. Simulation studies on a 2D system with four partially observing nodes demonstrate that the NDKF significantly outperforms a distributed Extended Kalman Filter. These outcomes, as yielded by the proposed NDKF method, highlight its potential to improve the scalability, robustness, and accuracy of distributed state estimation in complex nonlinear environments.</description>

      <title>A Modal-Based Approach for System Frequency Response and Frequency Nadir Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel approach for predicting system frequency response and frequency nadir by leveraging modal information. It significantly differentiates from traditional methods rooted in the average system frequency model. The proposed methodology targets system modes associated with the slower dynamics of the grid, enabling precise predictions through modal decomposition applied to the full system model. This decomposition facilitates an analytical solution for the frequency at the center of inertia, resulting in highly accurate predictions of both frequency response and nadir. Numerical results from a 39-bus, 10-machine test system verify the method's effectiveness and accuracy. This methodology represents a shift from observing a simplified average system frequency response to a more detailed analysis focusing on system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Runway capacity expansion planning for public airports under demand uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flight delay is a significant issue affecting air travel. The runway system, frequently falling short of demand, serves as a bottleneck. As demand increases, runway capacity expansion becomes imperative to mitigate congestion. However, the decision to expand runway capacity is challenging due to inherent uncertainties in demand forecasts. This paper presents a novel approach to modeling air traffic demand growth as a jump diffusion process, incorporating two layers of uncertainty: Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) for continuous variability and a Poisson process to capture the impact of crisis events, such as natural disasters or public health emergencies, on decision-making. We propose a real options model to jointly evaluate the interrelated factors of optimal runway capacity and investment timing under uncertainty, with investment timing linked to trigger demand. The findings suggest that increased uncertainty indicates more conservative decision-making. Furthermore, the relationship between optimal investment timing and expansion size is complex: if the expansion size remains unchanged, the trigger demand decreases as the demand growth rate increases; if the expansion size experiences a jump, the trigger demand also exhibits a sharp rise. This work provides valuable insights for airport authorities for informed capacity expansion decision-making.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Electric Vehicles Charging using Large Language Models and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining grid stability amid widespread electric vehicle (EV) adoption is vital for sustainable transportation. Traditional optimization methods and Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches often struggle with the high dimensionality and dynamic nature of real-time EV charging, leading to sub-optimal solutions. To address these challenges, this study demonstrates that combining Large Language Models (LLMs), for sequence modeling, with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), for relational information extraction, not only outperforms conventional EV smart charging methods, but also paves the way for entirely new research directions and innovative solutions.</description>

      <title>Levelised Cost of Demand Response: Estimating the Cost-Competitiveness of Flexible Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To make well-informed investment decisions, energy system stakeholders require reliable cost frameworks for demand response (DR) and storage technologies. While the levelised cost of storage (LCOS) permits comprehensive cost comparisons between different storage technologies, no generic cost measure for the comparison of different DR schemes exists. This paper introduces the levelised cost of demand response (LCODR) which is an analogous measure to the LCOS but crucially differs from it by considering consumer reward payments. Additionally, the value factor from cost estimations of variable renewable energy is adapted to account for the variable availability of DR. The LCODRs for four direct load control (DLC) schemes and twelve storage applications are estimated and contrasted against LCOS literature values for the most competitive storage technologies. The DLC schemes are vehicle-to-grid, smart charging, smart heat pumps, and heat pumps with thermal storage. The results show that only heat pumps with thermal storage consistently outcompete storage technologies with EV-based DR schemes being competitive for some applications. The results and the underlying methodology offer a tool for energy system stakeholders to assess the competitiveness of DR schemes even with limited user data.</description>

      <title>Model Reference-Based Control with Guaranteed Predefined Performance for Uncertain Strict-Feedback Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the complexities posed by time- and state-varying uncertainties and the computation of analytic derivatives in strict-feedback form (SFF) systems, this study introduces a novel model reference-based control (MRBC) framework which applies locally to each subsystem (SS), to ensure output tracking performance within the specified transient and steady-state response criteria. This framework includes 1) novel homogeneous adaptive estimators (HAEs) designed to match the uncertain nonlinear SFF system to a reference model, enabling easier analysis and control design at the $SS$ level, and 2) model-based homogeneous adaptive controllers enhanced by logarithmic barrier Lyapunov functions (HAC-BLFs), intended to control the reference model provided by HAEs in each SS, while ensuring the prescribed tracking responses under control amplitude saturation. The inherently robust MRBC achieves uniformly exponential stability using a generic stability connector term, which addresses dynamic interactions between the adjacent SSs. The parameter sensitivities of HAEs and HAC-BLFs in the MRBC framework are analyzed, focusing on the system's robustness and responsiveness. The proposed MRBC framework is experimentally validated through several scenarios involving an electromechanical linear actuator system with an uncertain SFF, subjected loading disturbance forces challenging 0-95% of its capacity.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Control for System Availability and Continuous Operation in Heavy-Duty Wheeled Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the control system in a heavy-duty wheeled mobile robot (HD-WMR) malfunctions, deviations from ideal motion occur, significantly heightening the risks of off-road instability and costly damage. To meet the demands for safety, reliability, and controllability in HD-WMRs, the control system must tolerate faults to a certain extent, ensuring continuous operation. To this end, this paper introduces a model-free hierarchical control with fault accommodation (MFHCA) framework designed to address sensor and actuator faults in hydraulically powered HD-WMRs with independently controlled wheels. To begin, a novel mathematical representation of the motion dynamics of HD-WMRs, incorporating both sensor and actuator fault modes, is investigated. Subsequently, the MFHCA framework is proposed to manage all wheels under various fault modes, ensuring that each wheel tracks the reference driving velocities and steering angles, which are inverse kinematically mapped from the angular and linear velocities commanded in the HD-WMR's base frame. To do so, this framework generates appropriate power efforts in independently valve-regulated wheels to accommodate the adaptively isolated faults, thereby ensuring exponential stability. The experimental analysis of a 6,500-kg hydraulic-powered HD-WMR under various fault modes and rough terrains demonstrates the validity of the MFHCA framework.</description>

      <title>Optimal PMU Placement for Kalman Filtering of DAE Power System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal sensor placement is essential for minimizing costs and ensuring accurate state estimation in power systems. This paper introduces a novel method for optimal sensor placement for dynamic state estimation of power systems modeled by differential-algebraic equations. The method identifies optimal sensor locations by minimizing the steady-state covariance matrix of the Kalman filter, thus minimizing the error of joint differential and algebraic state estimation. The problem is reformulated as a mixed-integer semidefinite program and effectively solved using off-the-shelf numerical solvers. Numerical results demonstrate the merits of the proposed approach by benchmarking its performance in phasor measurement unit placement in comparison to greedy algorithms.</description>

      <title>Verification and Synthesis Methods for High-Order Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order control barrier functions (HOCBFs) can be used to provide autonomous systems with safety, though computational methods to verify and synthesize these functions remain lacking. In this work, we address this need by formulating SOS programs that verify and synthesize HOCBFs, such that continued safety is always guaranteed forward in time. We first propose a verification SOS program for systems with (i) one or multiple HOCBFs, (ii) a control Lyapunov function (CLF), and (iii) input constraints, and we show that a solution to this problem guarantees that the online implementation of the system is always safe. Next, we propose a sequence of SOS programs that synthesize the class K functions used in an HOCBF, and we show that this sequence of problems ensures that a system is guaranteed to remain safe while running. After that, a synthesis framework is given that ensures real-time safety for systems with (i) multiple HOCBFs, (ii) a CLF, and (iii) input constraints. Our developments are illustrated in numerical simulations for a system with seven HOCBFs of maximum relative degree two, with 14 total unknown class K functions, all of which are successfully synthesized in a way that produces safe autonomy.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Optimization of Second-Life Battery Utilization in Electric Vehicles Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid rise in electric vehicle (EV) adoption presents significant challenges in managing the vast number of retired EV batteries. Research indicates that second-life batteries (SLBs) from EVs typically retain considerable residual capacity, offering extended utility. These batteries can be effectively repurposed for use in EV charging stations (EVCS), providing a cost-effective alternative to new batteries and reducing overall planning costs. Integrating battery energy storage systems (BESS) with SLBs into EVCS is a promising strategy to alleviate system overload. However, efficient operation of EVCS with integrated BESS is hindered by uncertainties such as fluctuating EV arrival and departure times and variable power prices from the grid. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) planning framework for EV charging stations with BESS, leveraging SLBs. We employ the advanced soft actor-critic (SAC) approach, training the model on a year's worth of data to account for seasonal variations, including weekdays and holidays. A tailored reward function enables effective offline training, allowing real-time optimization of EVCS operations under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Offshore Wind Turbine Tower Design and Optimization: A Review and AI-Driven Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offshore wind energy leverages the high intensity and consistency of oceanic winds, playing a key role in the transition to renewable energy. As energy demands grow, larger turbines are required to optimize power generation and reduce the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCoE), which represents the average cost of electricity over a project's lifetime. However, upscaling turbines introduces engineering challenges, particularly in the design of supporting structures, especially towers. These towers must support increased loads while maintaining structural integrity, cost-efficiency, and transportability, making them essential to offshore wind projects' success. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest advancements, challenges, and future directions driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the design optimization of Offshore Wind Turbine (OWT) structures, with a focus on towers. It provides an in-depth background on key areas such as design types, load types, analysis methods, design processes, monitoring systems, Digital Twin (DT), software, standards, reference turbines, economic factors, and optimization techniques. Additionally, it includes a state-of-the-art review of optimization studies related to tower design optimization, presenting a detailed examination of turbine, software, loads, optimization method, design variables and constraints, analysis, and findings, motivating future research to refine design approaches for effective turbine upscaling and improved efficiency. Lastly, the paper explores future directions where AI can revolutionize tower design optimization, enabling the development of efficient, scalable, and sustainable structures. By addressing the upscaling challenges and supporting the growth of renewable energy, this work contributes to shaping the future of offshore wind turbine towers and others supporting structures.</description>

      <title>Backcasting the Optimal Decisions in Transport Systems: An Example with Electric Vehicle Purchase Incentives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study represents a first attempt to build a backcasting methodology to identify the optimal policy roadmaps in transport systems. In this methodology, desired objectives are set by decision makers at a given time horizon, and then the optimal combinations of policies to achieve these objectives are computed as a function of time (i.e., ``backcasted''). This approach is illustrated on the transportation sector by considering a specific subsystem with a single policy decision. The subsystem describes the evolution of the passenger car fleet within a given region and its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The optimized policy is a monetary incentive for the purchase of electric vehicles while minimizing the total budget of the state and achieving a desired CO$_2$ target. A case study applied to Metropolitan France is presented to illustrate the approach. Additionally, alternative policy scenarios are also analyzed to provide further insights.</description>

This article mainly reveals the relevant properties of the evader's dominance region, especially in non-anticipative information patterns. We can use these properties to research pursuit-evasion games in non-anticipative information patterns. The core problem is under what condition the pursuer has a non-anticipative strategy to prevent the evader leaving its initial dominance region before being captured regardless of the evader's strategy. We first define the evader's dominance region by the shortest path distance, and we rigorously prove for the first time that the initial dominance region of the evader is the reachable region of the evader in the open-loop sense. Subsequently, we prove that there exists a non-anticipative strategy by which the pursuer can capture the evader before the evader leaves its initial dominance region's closure in the absence of obstacles. For cases with obstacles, we provide a counter example to illustrate that such a non-anticipative strategy does not always exist, and provide a necessary condition for the existence of such strategy. Finally, we consider a scenario with a single corner obstacle and provide a sufficient condition for the existence of such a non-anticipative strategy. At the end of this article, we discuss the application of the evader's dominance region in target defense games. This article has important reference significance for the design of non-anticipative strategies in pursuit-evasion games with obstacles.</description>

      <title>Gait-Net-augmented Implicit Kino-dynamic MPC for Dynamic Variable-frequency Humanoid Locomotion over Discrete Terrains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current optimization-based control techniques for humanoid locomotion struggle to adapt step duration and placement simultaneously in dynamic walking gaits due to their reliance on fixed-time discretization, which limits responsiveness to terrain conditions and results in suboptimal performance in challenging environments. In this work, we propose a Gait-Net-augmented implicit kino-dynamic model-predictive control (MPC) to simultaneously optimize step location, step duration, and contact forces for natural variable-frequency locomotion. The proposed method incorporates a Gait-Net-augmented Sequential Convex MPC algorithm to solve multi-linearly constrained variables by iterative quadratic programs. At its core, a lightweight Gait-frequency Network (Gait-Net) determines the preferred step duration in terms of variable MPC sampling times, simplifying step duration optimization to the parameter level. Additionally, it enhances and updates the spatial reference trajectory within each sequential iteration by incorporating local solutions, allowing the projection of kinematic constraints to the design of reference trajectories. We validate the proposed algorithm in high-fidelity simulations and on small-size humanoid hardware, demonstrating its capability for variable-frequency and 3-D discrete terrain locomotion with only a one-step preview of terrain data.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a Control Framework for Physical Human-Robot Interaction Toward Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-Robot Interaction (pHRI) is critical for implementing Industry 5.0 which focuses on human-centric approaches. However, few studies explore the practical alignment of pHRI to industrial grade performance. This paper introduces a versatile control framework designed to bridge this gap by incorporating the torque-based control modes: compliance control, null-space compliance, dual compliance, all in static and dynamic scenarios. Thanks to our second-order Quadratic Programming (QP) formulation, strict kinematic and collision constraints are integrated into the system as safety features, and a weighted hierarchy guarantees singularity-robust task tracking performance. The framework is implemented on a Kinova Gen3 collaborative robot (cobot) equipped with a Bota force/torque sensor. A DualShock 4 game controller is attached at the robot's end-effector to demonstrate the framework's capabilities. This setup enables seamless dynamic switching between the modes, and real-time adjustment of parameters, such as transitioning between position and torque control or selecting a more robust custom-developed low-level torque controller over the default one.Built on the open-source robotic control software mc_rtc, to ensure reproducibility for both research and industrial deployment, this framework demonstrates industrial-grade performance and repeatability, showcasing its potential as a robust pHRI control system for industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Efficient Flocking Control based on Gibbs Random Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flocking control is essential for multi-robot systems in diverse applications, yet achieving efficient flocking in congested environments poses challenges regarding computation burdens, performance optimality, and motion safety. This paper addresses these challenges through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework built on Gibbs Random Fields (GRFs). With GRFs, a multi-robot system is represented by a set of random variables conforming to a joint probability distribution, thus offering a fresh perspective on flocking reward design. A decentralized training and execution mechanism, which enhances the scalability of MARL concerning robot quantity, is realized using a GRF-based credit assignment method. An action attention module is introduced to implicitly anticipate the motion intentions of neighboring robots, consequently mitigating potential non-stationarity issues in MARL. The proposed framework enables learning an efficient distributed control policy for multi-robot systems in challenging environments with success rate around $99\%$, as demonstrated through thorough comparisons with state-of-the-art solutions in simulations and experiments. Ablation studies are also performed to validate the efficiency of different framework modules.</description>

      <title>SPARK: A Modular Benchmark for Humanoid Robot Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Safe Protective and Assistive Robot Kit (SPARK), a comprehensive benchmark designed to ensure safety in humanoid autonomy and teleoperation. Humanoid robots pose significant safety risks due to their physical capabilities of interacting with complex environments. The physical structures of humanoid robots further add complexity to the design of general safety solutions. To facilitate the safe deployment of complex robot systems, SPARK can be used as a toolbox that comes with state-of-the-art safe control algorithms in a modular and composable robot control framework. Users can easily configure safety criteria and sensitivity levels to optimize the balance between safety and performance. To accelerate humanoid safety research and development, SPARK provides a simulation benchmark that compares safety approaches in a variety of environments, tasks, and robot models. Furthermore, SPARK allows quick deployment of synthesized safe controllers on real robots. For hardware deployment, SPARK supports Apple Vision Pro (AVP) or a Motion Capture System as external sensors, while also offering interfaces for seamless integration with alternative hardware setups. This paper demonstrates SPARK's capability with both simulation experiments and case studies with a Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Leveraging these advantages of SPARK, users and researchers can significantly improve the safety of their humanoid systems as well as accelerate relevant research. The open-source code is available at https://github.com/intelligent-control-lab/spark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Passive wireless sensors are crucial in modern medical and industrial settings to monitor procedures and conditions. We demonstrate a circuit to inductively excite passive resonators and to conduct their decaying signal response to a low noise amplifier. Two design variations of a generic transmit-receive signal chain are proposed, measured, and described in detail for the purpose of facilitating replication. Instrumentation and design aim to be scalable for multi-channel array configurations, using either off-the-shelf class-D audio amplifiers or a custom full H-bridge. Measurements are conducted on miniature magneto-mechanical resonators in the ultra low frequency range to enable sensing and tracking applications of such devices in different environments.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time-series using Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate time-series data using reinforcement learning (RL) in the latent space of an autoencoder. A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</description>

      <title>Capacity Credit Evaluation of Generalized Energy Storage Considering Strategic Capacity Withholding and Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel capacity credit evaluation framework to accurately quantify the contribution of generalized energy storage (GES) to resource adequacy, considering both strategic capacity withholding and decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU). To this end, we establish a market-oriented risk-averse coordinated dispatch method to capture the cross-market reliable operation of GES. The proposed method is sequentially implemented along with the Monte Carlo simulation process, coordinating the pre-dispatched price arbitrage and capacity withholding in the energy market with adequacy-oriented re-dispatch during capacity market calls. In addition to decision-independent uncertainties in operational states and baseline behavior, we explicitly address the inherent DDU of GES (i.e., the uncertainty of available discharge capacity affected by the incentives and accumulated discomfort) during the re-dispatch stage using the proposed distributional robust chance-constrained approach. Furthermore, a capacity credit metric called equivalent storage capacity substitution is introduced to quantify the equivalent deterministic storage capacity of uncertain GES. Simulations on the modified IEEE RTS-79 benchmark system with 20 years real-world data from Elia demonstrate that the proposed method yields accurate capacity credit and improved economic performance. We show that the capacity credit of GES increases with more strategic capacity withholding but decreases with more DDU levels. Key factors, such as capacity withholding and DDU structure impacting GES's capacity credit are analyzed with insights into capacity market decision-making.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Generic Robust Control for Servo-Driven Actuation Mechanisms with Layered Insight into Energy Conversions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11828v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To advance theoretical solutions and address limitations in modeling complex servo-driven actuation systems experiencing high non-linearity and load disturbances, this paper aims to design a practical model-free generic robust control (GRC) framework for these mechanisms. This framework is intended to be applicable across all actuator systems encompassing electrical, hydraulic, or pneumatic servomechanisms, while also functioning within complex interactions among dynamic components and adhering to control input constraints. In this respect, the state-space model of actuator systems is decomposed into smaller subsystems that incorporate the first principle equation of actuator motion dynamics and interactive energy conversion equations. This decomposition operates under the assumption that the comprehensive model of the servo-driven actuator system and energy conversion, uncertainties, load disturbances, and their bounds are unknown. Then, the GRC employs subsystem-based adaptive control strategies for each state-variant subsystem separately. Despite control input constraints and the unknown interactive system model, the GRC-applied actuator mechanism ensures uniform exponential stability and robustness in tracking desired motions. It features straightforward implementation, experimentally evaluated by applying it to two industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System and Its Application in Road Transportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous real-world systems, including manufacturing processes, supply chains, and robotic systems, involve multiple independent entities with diverse objectives. The potential for conflicts arises from the inability of these entities to accurately predict and anticipate each other's actions. To address this challenge, we propose the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) framework. By enabling information sharing and collaborative planning among independent entities, the PHCS facilitates the preemptive resolution of potential conflicts. We apply the PHCS framework to the specific context of road transportation, resulting in the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative Road Transportation System (PHCRTS). This system leverages shared driving intentions and pre-planned trajectories to optimize traffic flow and enhance safety. Simulation experiments in a two-lane merging scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of PHCRTS, reducing vehicle time delays by 90%, increasing traffic capacity by 300%, and eliminating accidents. The PHCS framework offers a promising approach to optimize the performance and safety of complex systems with multiple independent entities.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Subspace Identification for Stochastic Systems Using Multiple Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the analysis of identification errors for $n$-dimensional discrete-time Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems with $m$ outputs and no external inputs, using Subspace Identification Methods (SIM) with finite sample data. We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{-\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</description>

      <title>Mixed-integer linear programming approaches for tree partitioning of power networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In transmission networks, power flows and network topology are deeply intertwined due to power flow physics. Recent literature shows that a specific more hierarchical network structure can effectively inhibit the propagation of line failures across the entire system. In particular, a novel approach named tree partitioning has been proposed, which seeks to bolster the robustness of power networks through strategic alterations in network topology, accomplished via targeted line switching actions. Several tree partitioning problem formulations have been proposed by considering different objectives, among which power flow disruption and network congestion. Furthermore, various heuristic methods based on a two-stage and recursive approach have been proposed. The present work provides a general framework for tree partitioning problems based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). In particular, we present a novel MILP formulation to optimally solve tree partitioning problems and also propose a two-stage heuristic based on MILP. We perform extensive numerical experiments to solve two tree partitioning problem variants, demonstrating the excellent performance of our solution methods. Lastly, through exhaustive cascading failure simulations, we compare the effectiveness of various tree partitioning strategies and show that, on average, they can achieve a substantial reduction in lost load compared to the original topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. Data-driven techniques to learn the Koopman operator typically assume that the chosen function space is closed under system dynamics. In this paper, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and explore the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen function space. We relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator and then present an operator stochastic approximation algorithm to learn the Koopman operator iteratively with control over the complexity of the representation. We provide both asymptotic and finite-time last-iterate guarantees of the online sparse learning algorithm with trajectory-based sampling with an analysis that is substantially more involved than that for finite-dimensional stochastic approximation. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Managing O-RAN Networks: xApp Development from Zero to Hero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09619v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Alliance proposes an open architecture that disaggregates the RAN and supports executing custom control logic in near-real time from third-party applications, the xApps. Despite O-RAN's efforts, the creation of xApps remains a complex and time-consuming endeavor, aggravated by the sometimes fragmented, outdated, or deprecated documentation from the O-RAN Software Community (OSC). These challenges hinder academia and industry from developing and validating solutions and algorithms on O-RAN networks. This tutorial addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive guide for developing xApps to manage the O-RAN ecosystem from theory to practice. We provide a thorough theoretical foundation of the O-RAN architecture and detail the functionality offered by Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) components. We examine the xApp design and configuration. We explore the xApp lifecycle and demonstrate how to deploy and manage xApps on a Near-RT RIC. We address the xApps' interfaces and capabilities, accompanied by practical examples. We provide comprehensive details on how xApps can control the RAN. We discuss debugging strategies and good practices to aid the xApp developers in testing their xApps. Finally, we review the current landscape and open challenges for creating xApps.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have received considerable interest recently due to their outstanding reasoning and comprehension capabilities. This work explores applying LLMs to vehicular networks, aiming to jointly optimize vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and autonomous driving (AD) policies. We deploy LLMs for AD decision-making to maximize traffic flow and avoid collisions for road safety, and a double deep Q-learning algorithm (DDQN) is used for V2I optimization to maximize the received data rate and reduce frequent handovers. In particular, for LLM-enabled AD, we employ the Euclidean distance to identify previously explored AD experiences, and then LLMs can learn from past good and bad decisions for further improvement. Then, LLM-based AD decisions will become part of states in V2I problems, and DDQN will optimize the V2I decisions accordingly. After that, the AD and V2I decisions are iteratively optimized until convergence. Such an iterative optimization approach can better explore the interactions between LLMs and conventional reinforcement learning techniques, revealing the potential of using LLMs for network optimization and management. Finally, the simulations demonstrate that our proposed hybrid LLM-DDQN approach outperforms the conventional DDQN algorithm, showing faster convergence and higher average rewards.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Holographic Surface-aided Distributed MIMO Radar Systems</title>

Abstract: Distributed phased Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (phased-MIMO) radar systems have attracted wide attention in target detection and tracking. However, the phase-shifting circuits in phased subarrays contribute to high power consumption and hardware cost. To address this issue, an energy-efficient and cost-efficient metamaterial antenna array, i.e., reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS), has been developed. In this letter, we propose RHS-aided distributed MIMO radar systems to achieve more accurate multi-target detection under equivalent power consumption and hardware cost as that of distributed phased-MIMO radar systems. Different from phased arrays, the RHS achieves beam steering by regulating the radiation amplitude of its elements, and thus conventional beamforming schemes designed for phased arrays are no longer applicable. Aiming to maximize detection accuracy, we design an amplitude-controlled beamforming scheme for multiple RHS transceiver subarrays. The simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over the distributed phased-MIMO radar scheme and reveal the optimal allocation of spatial diversity and coherent processing gain that leads to the best system performance when hardware resources are fixed.</description>

      <title>CVaR-Based Variational Quantum Optimization for User Association in Handoff-Aware Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08418</link>

Abstract: Efficient resource allocation is essential for optimizing various tasks in wireless networks, which are usually formulated as generalized assignment problems (GAP). GAP, as a generalized version of the linear sum assignment problem, involves both equality and inequality constraints that add computational challenges. In this work, we present a novel Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) framework to address GAP in vehicular networks (VNets). Our approach leverages a hybrid quantum-classical structure, integrating a tailored cost function that balances both objective and constraint-specific penalties to improve solution quality and stability. Using the CVaR-VQE model, we handle the GAP efficiently by focusing optimization on the lower tail of the solution space, enhancing both convergence and resilience on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We apply this framework to a user-association problem in VNets, where our method achieves 23.5% improvement compared to the deep neural network (DNN) approach.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models for CPS-IoT: Opportunities and Challenges</title>

Abstract: Methods from machine learning (ML) have transformed the implementation of Perception-Cognition-Communication-Action loops in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), replacing mechanistic and basic statistical models with those derived from data. However, the first generation of ML approaches, which depend on supervised learning with annotated data to create task-specific models, faces significant limitations in scaling to the diverse sensor modalities, deployment configurations, application tasks, and operating dynamics characterizing real-world CPS-IoT systems. The success of task-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language models (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language, computer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and exploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics pipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering.
  Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of FMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be viable for CPS-IoT applications. In this paper, we analyze and characterize this gap through a thorough examination of the state of the art and our research, which extends beyond it in various dimensions. Based on the results of our analysis and research, we identify essential desiderata that CPS-IoT domain-specific FMs and LLMs must satisfy to bridge this gap. We also propose actions by CPS-IoT researchers to collaborate in developing key community resources necessary for establishing FMs and LLMs as foundational tools for the next generation of CPS-IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Sparse Online Learning of the Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. Data-driven techniques to learn the Koopman operator typically assume that the chosen function space is closed under system dynamics. In this paper, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and explore the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen function space. We relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator and then present an operator stochastic approximation algorithm to learn the Koopman operator iteratively with control over the complexity of the representation. We provide both asymptotic and finite-time last-iterate guarantees of the online sparse learning algorithm with trajectory-based sampling with an analysis that is substantially more involved than that for finite-dimensional stochastic approximation. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>
