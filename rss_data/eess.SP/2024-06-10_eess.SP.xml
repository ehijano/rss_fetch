      <title>Using Machine Learning to predict Characteristics of Microstrip Line and Microstrip Patch Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study, conducted in 2017, explores the use of Machine learning algorithms to predict Characteristics of Transmission Lines such as Impedance or resonance frequency using design parameters of Transmission Lines. Using formulas and equations that define the characteristics of Transmission lines, training data was generated. We trained different models for this dataset. The extent of deviation of predicted output from the actual output was measured in terms of maximum error and average error. This helped determine how well an algorithm worked for a particular transmission line. Further, the best-suited algorithm for each transmission line under consideration was found based on the error</description>

      <title>Learning Optimal Linear Precoding for Cell-Free Massive MIMO with GNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a graph neural network (GNN) to compute, within a time budget of 1 to 2 milliseconds required by practical systems, the optimal linear precoder (OLP) maximizing the minimal downlink user data rate for a Cell-Free Massive MIMO system - a key 6G wireless technology. The state-of-the-art method is a bisection search on second order cone programming feasibility test (B-SOCP) which is a magnitude too slow for practical systems. Our approach relies on representing OLP as a node-level prediction task on a graph. We construct a graph that accurately captures the interdependence relation between access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs), and the permutation equivariance of the Max-Min problem. Our neural network, named OLP-GNN, is trained on data obtained by B-SOCP. We tailor the OLP-GNN size, together with several artful data preprocessing and postprocessing methods to meet the runtime requirement. We show by extensive simulations that it achieves near optimal spectral efficiency in a range of scenarios with different number of APs and UEs, and for both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight radio propagation environments.</description>

      <title>MIMO with 1-bit Pre/Post-Coding Resolution: A Quantum Annealing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of digital pre/post-coding design in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with 1-bit resolution per complex dimension. The optimal solution that maximizes the received signal-to-noise ratio relies on an NP-hard combinatorial problem that requires exhaustive searching with exponential complexity. By using the principles of alternating optimization and quantum annealing (QA), an iterative QA-based algorithm is proposed that achieves near-optimal performance with polynomial complexity. The algorithm is associated with a rigorous mathematical framework that casts the pre/post-coding vector design to appropriate real-valued quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Experimental results in a state-of-the-art D-WAVE QA device validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. To further improve the efficiency of the D-WAVE quantum device, a new pre-processing technique which preserves the quadratic QUBO matrix from the detrimental effects of the Hamiltonian noise through non-linear companding, is proposed. The proposed pre-processing technique significantly improves the quality of the D-WAVE solutions as well as the occurrence probability of the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>A Deep Automotive Radar Detector using the RaDelft Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of multiple extended targets in complex environments using high-resolution automotive radar is considered. A data-driven approach is proposed where unlabeled synchronized lidar data is used as ground truth to train a neural network with only radar data as input. To this end, the novel, large-scale, real-life, and multi-sensor RaDelft dataset has been recorded using a demonstrator vehicle in different locations in the city of Delft. The dataset, as well as the documentation and example code, is publicly available for those researchers in the field of automotive radar or machine perception. The proposed data-driven detector is able to generate lidar-like point clouds using only radar data from a high-resolution system, which preserves the shape and size of extended targets. The results are compared against conventional CFAR detectors as well as variations of the method to emulate the available approaches in the literature, using the probability of detection, the probability of false alarm, and the Chamfer distance as performance metrics. Moreover, an ablation study was carried out to assess the impact of Doppler and temporal information on detection performance. The proposed method outperforms the different baselines in terms of Chamfer distance, achieving a reduction of 75% against conventional CFAR detectors and 10% against the modified state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Fast-Fading Channel and Power Optimization of the Magnetic Inductive Cellular Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cellular network of magnetic Induction (MI) communication holds promise in long-distance underground environments. In the traditional MI communication, there is no fast-fading channel since the MI channel is treated as a quasi-static channel. However, for the vehicle (mobile) MI (VMI) communication, the unpredictable antenna vibration brings the remarkable fast-fading. As such fast-fading cannot be modeled by the central limit theorem, it differs radically from other wireless fast-fading channels. Unfortunately, few studies focus on this phenomenon. In this paper, using a novel space modeling based on the electromagnetic field theorem, we propose a 3-dimension model of the VMI antenna vibration. By proposing ``conjugate pseudo-piecewise functions'' and boundary $p(x)$ distribution, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF), probability density function (PDF) and the expectation of the VMI fast-fading channel. We also theoretically analyze the effects of the VMI fast-fading on the network throughput, including the VMI outage probability which can be ignored in the traditional MI channel study. We draw several intriguing conclusions different from those in wireless fast-fading studies. For instance, the fast-fading brings more uniformly distributed channel coefficients. Finally, we propose the power control algorithm using the non-cooperative game and multiagent Q-learning methods to optimize the throughput of the cellular VMI network. Simulations validate the derivation and the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Holographic Intelligence Surface Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional discrete-array-based systems fail to exploit interactions between closely spaced antennas, resulting in inadequate utilization of the aperture resource. In this paper, we propose a holographic intelligence surface (HIS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (HISAC) system, wherein both the transmitter and receiver are fabricated using a continuous-aperture array. A continuous-discrete transformation of the HIS pattern based on the Fourier transform is proposed, converting the continuous pattern design into a discrete beamforming design. We formulate a joint transmit-receive beamforming optimization problem for the HISAC system, aiming to balance the performance of multi-target sensing while fulfilling the performance requirement of multi-user communication. To solve the non-convex problem with coupled variables, an alternating optimization-based algorithm is proposed to optimize the HISAC transmit-receive beamforming in an alternate manner. Specifically, the transmit beamforming design is solved by decoupling into a series of feasibility-checking sub-problems while the receive beamforming is determined by the Rayleigh quotient-based method. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed HISAC system over traditional discrete-array-based ISAC systems, achieving significantly higher sensing performance while guaranteeing predetermined communication performance.</description>

      <title>OFDM-Standard Compatible SC-NOFS Waveforms for Low-Latency and Jitter-Tolerance Industrial IoT Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional communications focus on regular and orthogonal signal waveforms for simplified signal processing and improved spectral efficiency. In contrast, the next-generation communications would aim for irregular and non-orthogonal signal waveforms to introduce new capabilities. This work proposes a spectrally efficient irregular Sinc (irSinc) shaping technique, revisiting the traditional Sinc back to 1924, with the aim of enhancing performance in industrial Internet of things (IIoT). In time-critical IIoT applications, low-latency and time-jitter tolerance are two critical factors that significantly impact the performance and reliability. Recognizing the inevitability of latency and jitter in practice, this work aims to propose a waveform technique to mitigate these effects via reducing latency and enhancing the system robustness under time jitter effects. The utilization of irSinc yields a signal with increased spectral efficiency without sacrificing error performance. Integrating the irSinc in a two-stage framework, a single-carrier non-orthogonal frequency shaping (SC-NOFS) waveform is developed, showcasing perfect compatibility with 5G standards, enabling the direct integration of irSinc in existing industrial IoT setups. Through 5G standard signal configuration, our signal achieves faster data transmission within the same spectral bandwidth. Hardware experiments validate an 18% saving in timing resources, leading to either reduced latency or enhanced jitter tolerance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the receiver to transmitter antenna coupling in near-field communications with massive arrays. Although most works in the literature consider that it is negligible and approximate it by zero, there is no rigorous analysis on its relevance for practical systems. In this work, we leverage multiport communication theory to obtain conditions for the aforementioned approximation to be valid in MISO and SIMO systems. These conditions are then particularized for arrays with fixed inter-element spacing and arrays with fixed size.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Beamforming Design for RSMA-assisted mmWave Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) has been considered one of the new paradigms for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In the millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC system, hybrid beamforming (HBF) is considered an emerging technology to exploit the limited number of radio frequency (RF) chains in order to reduce the system hardware cost and power consumption. However, the HBF structure reduces the spatial degrees of freedom for the ISAC system, which further leads to increased interference between multiple users and between users and radar sensing. To solve the above problem, rate split multiple access (RSMA), which is a flexible and robust interference management strategy, is considered. We investigate the joint common rate allocation and HBF design problem for the HBF-based RSMA-assisted mmWave ISAC scheme. We propose the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method coupled with the weighted mean squared error (WMMSE) minimization method to solve this high-dimensional non-convex problem, which converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the original problem. Then, we extend the proposed algorithm to the HBF design based on finite-resolution phase shifters (PSs) to further improve the energy efficiency of the system. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and show that the RSMA-ISAC scheme outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twin has emerged as a promising paradigm for accurately representing the electromagnetic (EM) wireless environments. The resulting virtual representation of the reality facilitates comprehensive insights into the propagation environment, empowering multi-layer decision-making processes at the physical communication level. This paper investigates the digitization of wireless communication propagation, with particular emphasis on the indispensable aspect of ray-based propagation simulation for real-time Digital Twins. A benchmark for ray-based propagation simulations is presented to evaluate computational time, with two urban scenarios characterized by different mesh complexity, single and multiple wireless link configurations, and simulations with/without diffuse scattering. Exhaustive empirical analyses are performed showing and comparing the behavior of different ray-based solutions. By offering standardized simulations and scenarios, this work provides a technical benchmark for practitioners involved in the implementation of real-time Digital Twins and optimization of ray-based propagation models.</description>

      <title>FOOD: Facial Authentication and Out-of-Distribution Detection with Short-Range FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a short-range FMCW radar-based facial authentication and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection framework. Our pipeline jointly estimates the correct classes for the in-distribution (ID) samples and detects the OOD samples to prevent their inaccurate prediction. Our reconstruction-based architecture consists of a main convolutional block with one encoder and multi-decoder configuration, and intermediate linear encoder-decoder parts. Together, these elements form an accurate human face classifier and a robust OOD detector. For our dataset, gathered using a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar, our network achieves an average classification accuracy of 98.07% in identifying in-distribution human faces. As an OOD detector, it achieves an average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve of 98.50% and an average False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate (FPR95) of 6.20%. Also, our extensive experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms previous OOD detectors in terms of common OOD detection metrics.</description>

      <title>Monotone Lipschitz-Gradient Denoiser: Explainability of Operator Regularization Approaches and Convergence to Optimal Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses explainability of the operator-regularization approach under the use of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser -- an operator that can be expressed as the Lipschitz continuous gradient of a differentiable convex function. We prove that an operator is a MoL-Grad denoiser if and only if it is the ``single-valued'' proximity operator of a weakly convex function. An extension of Moreau's decomposition is also shown with respect to a weakly convex function and the conjugate of its convexified function. Under these arguments, two specific algorithms, the forward-backward splitting algorithm and the primal-dual splitting algorithm, are considered, both employing MoL-Grad denoisers. These algorithms generate a sequence of vectors converging weakly, under conditions, to a minimizer of a certain cost function which involves an ``implicit regularizer'' induced by the denoiser. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations.</description>

      <title>Winner-takes-all learners are geometry-aware conditional density estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Winner-takes-all training is a simple learning paradigm, which handles ambiguous tasks by predicting a set of plausible hypotheses. Recently, a connection was established between Winner-takes-all training and centroidal Voronoi tessellations, showing that, once trained, hypotheses should quantize optimally the shape of the conditional distribution to predict. However, the best use of these hypotheses for uncertainty quantification is still an open question.In this work, we show how to leverage the appealing geometric properties of the Winner-takes-all learners for conditional density estimation, without modifying its original training scheme. We theoretically establish the advantages of our novel estimator both in terms of quantization and density estimation, and we demonstrate its competitiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets, including audio data.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Design of Polar Coded Integrated Data and Energy Networking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to transmit data and transfer energy to the low-power Internet of Things (IoT) devices, integrated data and energy networking (IDEN) system may be harnessed. In this context, we propose a bitwise end-to-end design for polar coded IDEN systems, where the conventional encoding/decoding, modulation/demodulation, and energy harvesting (EH) modules are replaced by the neural networks (NNs). In this way, the entire system can be treated as an AutoEncoder (AE) and trained in an end-to-end manner. Hence achieving global optimization. Additionally, we improve the common NN-based belief propagation (BP) decoder by adding an extra hypernetwork, which generates the corresponding NN weights for the main network under different number of iterations, thus the adaptability of the receiver architecture can be further enhanced. Our numerical results demonstrate that our BP-based end-to-end design is superior to conventional BP-based counterparts in terms of both the BER and power transfer, but it is inferior to the successive cancellation list (SCL)-based conventional IDEN system, which may be due to the inherent performance gap between the BP and SCL decoders.</description>

      <title>Throughput and Fairness Trade-off Balancing for UAV-Enabled Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the imperative of 6G networks' ubiquitous connectivity, along with the inherent mobility and cost-effectiveness of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), UAVs play a critical role within 6G wireless networks. Despite advancements in enhancing the UAV-enabled communication systems' throughput in existing studies, there remains a notable gap in addressing issues concerning user fairness and quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning and lacks an effective scheme to depict the trade-off between system throughput and user fairness. To solve the above challenges, in this paper we introduce a novel fairness control scheme for UAV-enabled wireless communication systems based on a new weighted function. First, we propose a throughput combining model based on a new weighted function with fairness considering. Second, we formulate the optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of all users' throughput. Third, we decompose the optimization problem and propose an efficient iterative algorithm to solve it. Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the considerable potential of our proposed scheme in fairness and QoS provisioning.</description>

      <title>MIMO Capacity Analysis and Channel Estimation for Electromagnetic Information Theory</title>

Abstract: Electromagnetic information theory (EIT) is an interdisciplinary subject that serves to integrate deterministic electromagnetic theory with stochastic Shannon's information theory. Existing EIT analysis operates in the continuous space domain, which is not aligned with the practical algorithms working in the discrete space domain. This mismatch leads to a significant difficulty in application of EIT methodologies to practical discrete space systems, which is called as the discrete-continuous gap in this paper. To bridge this gap, we establish the discrete-continuous correspondence with a prolate spheroidal wave function (PSWF)-based ergodic capacity analysis framework. Specifically, we state and prove some discrete-continuous correspondence lemmas to establish a firm theoretical connection between discrete information-theoretic quantities to their continuous counterparts. With these lemmas, we apply the PSWF ergodic capacity bound to advanced MIMO architectures such as continuous-aperture MIMO (CAP-MIMO) and extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO). From this PSWF capacity bound, we discover the capacity saturation phenomenon both theoretically and empirically. Although the growth of MIMO performance is fundamentally limited in this EIT-based analysis framework, we reveal new opportunities in MIMO channel estimation by exploiting the EIT knowledge about the channel. Inspired by the PSWF capacity bound, we utilize continuous PSWFs to improve the pilot design of discrete MIMO channel estimators, which is called as the PSWF channel estimator (PSWF-CE). Simulation results demonstrate improved performances of the proposed PSWF-CE, compared to traditional minimum mean squared error (MMSE) and compressed sensing-based estimators.</description>

Abstract: This study explored an indoor system for tracking multiple humans and detecting falls, employing three Millimeter-Wave radars from Texas Instruments. Compared to wearables and camera methods, Millimeter-Wave radar is not plagued by mobility inconveniences, lighting conditions, or privacy issues. We conducted an initial evaluation of radar characteristics, covering aspects such as interference between radars and coverage area. Then, we established a real-time framework to integrate signals received from these radars, allowing us to track the position and body status of human targets non-intrusively. Additionally, we introduced innovative strategies, including dynamic Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering based on signal SNR levels, a probability matrix for enhanced target tracking, target status prediction for fall detection, and a feedback loop for noise reduction. We conducted an extensive evaluation using over 300 min of data, which equated to approximately 360,000 frames. Our prototype system exhibited a remarkable performance, achieving a precision of 98.9% for tracking a single target and 96.5% and 94.0% for tracking two and three targets in human-tracking scenarios, respectively. Moreover, in the field of human fall detection, the system demonstrates a high accuracy rate of 96.3%, underscoring its effectiveness in distinguishing falls from other statuses.</description>

      <title>Rechargeable UAV Trajectory Optimization for Real-Time Persistent Data Collection of Large-Scale Sensor Networks</title>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received plenty of attention due to their high flexibility and enhanced communication ability, nonetheless, the limited onboard energy restricts UAVs' application on persistent data collection missions in large areas. In this paper, we propose a rechargeable UAV-assisted periodic data collection scheme, where a UAV is dispatched to periodically collect data from sensor nodes (SNs) in the mission area and charged by a wireless charging platform. Specifically, the periodic data collection completion time is minimized by optimizing the UAV trajectory to reach the optimal balance among the collection time, flight time, and recharging time. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve directly. To tackle this problem, we divide the main problem into two sub-problems and address them by leveraging successive convex approximation (SCA), bisection search, and heuristic methods. Then, we propose a periodic trajectory optimization algorithm to iteratively solve the two sub-problems to minimize the completion time. Furthermore, to deal with the dynamics of SNs, we propose a low-complexity trajectory adjustment strategy, where the trajectory can be maintained or adjusted locally at the SNs change, which significantly mitigates the computation cost of re-optimization. The simulation results show the superiority and robustness of the proposed scheme and the completion time is on average 39% and 33% lower than the two benchmarks, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Accurate prediction of financial time series is a key concern for market economy makers and investors. The article selects online store sales and Australian beer sales as representatives of non-stationary, trending, and seasonal financial time series, and constructs a new SGVMD-ARIMA combination model in a non-linear combination way to predict financial time series. The ARIMA model, LSTM model, and other classic decomposition prediction models are used as control models to compare the accuracy of different models. The empirical results indicate that the constructed combination prediction model has universal advantages over the single prediction model and linear combination prediction model of the control group. Within the prediction interval, our proposed combination model has improved advantages over traditional decomposition prediction control group models.</description>

      <title>RF-Photonic Deep Learning Processor with Shannon-Limited Data Movement</title>

Abstract: Edholm's Law predicts exponential growth in data rate and spectrum bandwidth for communications and is forecasted to remain true for the upcoming deployment of 6G. Compounding this issue is the exponentially increasing demand for deep neural network (DNN) compute, including DNNs for signal processing. However, the slowing of Moore's Law due to the limitations of transistor-based electronics means that completely new paradigms for computing will be required to meet these increasing demands for advanced communications. Optical neural networks (ONNs) are promising DNN accelerators with ultra-low latency and energy consumption. Yet state-of-the-art ONNs struggle with scalability and implementing linear with in-line nonlinear operations. Here we introduce our multiplicative analog frequency transform ONN (MAFT-ONN) that encodes the data in the frequency domain, achieves matrix-vector products in a single shot using photoelectric multiplication, and uses a single electro-optic modulator for the nonlinear activation of all neurons in each layer. We experimentally demonstrate the first hardware accelerator that computes fully-analog deep learning on raw RF signals, performing single-shot modulation classification with 85% accuracy, where a 'majority vote' multi-measurement scheme can boost the accuracy to 95% within 5 consecutive measurements. In addition, we demonstrate frequency-domain finite impulse response (FIR) linear-time-invariant (LTI) operations, enabling a powerful combination of traditional and AI signal processing. We also demonstrate the scalability of our architecture by computing nearly 4 million fully-analog multiplies-and-accumulates for MNIST digit classification. Our latency estimation model shows that due to the Shannon capacity-limited analog data movement, MAFT-ONN is hundreds of times faster than traditional RF receivers operating at their theoretical peak performance.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical optimization is now widely regarded as an indispensable modeling and solution tool for the design of wireless communications systems. While optimization has played a significant role in the revolutionary progress in wireless communication and networking technologies from 1G to 5G and onto the future 6G, the innovations in wireless technologies have also substantially transformed the nature of the underlying mathematical optimization problems upon which the system designs are based and have sparked significant innovations in the development of methodologies to understand, to analyze, and to solve those problems. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of recent advances in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for wireless communication system design. We begin by illustrating common features of mathematical optimization problems arising in wireless communication system design. We discuss various scenarios and use cases and their associated mathematical structures from an optimization perspective. We then provide an overview of recently developed optimization techniques in areas ranging from nonconvex optimization, global optimization, and integer programming, to distributed optimization and learning-based optimization. The key to successful solution of mathematical optimization problems is in carefully choosing or developing suitable algorithms (or neural network architectures) that can exploit the underlying problem structure. We conclude the paper by identifying several open research challenges and outlining future research directions.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing for Reciprocal MIMO Channels</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the design of transmit precoder and receive combiner matrices to support $N_{\rm s}$ independent data streams over a time-division duplex (TDD) point-to-point massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel with either a fully digital or a hybrid structure. The optimal precoder and combiner design amounts to finding the top-$N_{\rm s}$ singular vectors of the channel matrix, but the explicit estimation of the entire high-dimensional channel would require significant pilot overhead. Alternatively, prior works suggest to find the precoding and combining matrices directly by exploiting channel reciprocity and by using the power iteration method, but its performance degrades in the low SNR regime. To tackle this challenging problem, this paper proposes a learning-based active sensing framework, where the transmitter and the receiver send pilots alternately using sensing beamformers that are actively designed as functions of previously received pilots. This is accomplished by using recurrent neural networks to summarize information from the historical observations into hidden state vectors, then using fully connected neural networks to learn the appropriate sensing beamformers in the next pilot stage and finally the transmit precoding and receive combiner matrices for data communications. Simulations demonstrate that the learning-based method outperforms existing approaches significantly and maintains superior performance even in the low SNR regime for both the fully digital and hybrid MIMO scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Gull, a generative multifunctional audio codec. Gull is a general purpose neural audio compression and decompression model which can be applied to a wide range of tasks and applications such as real-time communication, audio super-resolution, and codec language models. The key components of Gull include (1) universal-sample-rate modeling via subband modeling schemes motivated by recent progress in audio source separation, (2) gain-shape representations motivated by traditional audio codecs, (3) improved residual vector quantization modules, (4) elastic decoder network that enables user-defined model size and complexity during inference time, (5) built-in ability for audio super-resolution without the increase of bitrate. We compare Gull with existing traditional and neural audio codecs and show that Gull is able to achieve on par or better performance across various sample rates, bitrates and model complexities in both subjective and objective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Scalability and Implementation Aspects of Cell-Free Massive MIMO for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of scalability for a cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) system that performs integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Specifically, the case where a large number of access points (APs) are deployed to perform simultaneous communication with mobile users and monitoring of the surrounding environment in the same time-frequency slot is considered, and a target-centric approach on top of the user-centric architecture used for communication services is introduced. In the paper, other practical aspects such as the fronthaul load and scanning protocol are also considered. The proposed scalable ISAC-enabled CF-mMIMO network has lower levels of system complexity, permits managing the scenario in which multiple targets are to be tracked/sensed by the APs, and achieves performance levels superior or, in some cases, close to those of the non-scalable solutions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Geological Prediction for Tunnel Excavation Using Full Waveform Inversion Integrating Sobolev Space Regularization with a Quadratic Penalty Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the process of tunnel excavation, advance geological prediction technology has become indispensable for safe, economical, and efficient tunnel construction. Although traditional methods such as drilling and geological analysis are effective, they typically involve destructive processes, carry high risks, and incur significant costs. In contrast, non-destructive geophysical exploration offers a more convenient and economical alternative. However, the accuracy and precision of these non-destructive methods can be severely compromised by complex geological structures and environmental noise. To address these challenges effectively, a novel approach using frequency domain full waveform inversion, based on a penalty method and Sobolev space regularization, has been proposed to enhance the performance of non-destructive predictions. The proposed method constructs a soft-constrained optimization problem by restructuring the misfit function into a combination of data misfit and wave equation drive terms to enhance convexity. Additionally, it semi-extends the search space to both the wavefield and the model parameters to mitigate the strong nonlinearity of the optimization, facilitating high-resolution inversion. Furthermore, a Sobolev space regularization algorithm is introduced to flexibly adjust the regularization path, addressing issues related to noise and artefacts to enhance the robustness of the algorithm. We evaluated the modified full waveform inversion with several tunnel fault models by comparing the results of the enhanced method with those of traditional least squares-based Tikhonov regularization and total variation regularization full waveform inversion methods. The verification results confirm the superior capabilities of the proposed method as expected.</description>
