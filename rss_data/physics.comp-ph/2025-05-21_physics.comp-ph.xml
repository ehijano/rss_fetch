      <title>Data-driven Design of Isotropic and High-Stiffness TPMS-based Amorphousness-Induced Architected Material (TAAM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For their excellent stiffness-to-weight characteristics, triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) are widely adopted in architected materials. However, their geometric regularity often leads to elastic anisotropy, limiting their effectiveness under complex loading. To address this, we propose TPMS-based amorphousness-induced architected materials (TAAMs), which incorporate controllable geometric disorder as a tunable design variable. This concept of designable amorphousness broadens the geometric design space, enabling the simultaneous optimization of stiffness and isotropy. A data-driven framework integrating computational homogenization with multi-objective Bayesian optimization is employed to discover high-performance TAAMs. Selected designs were fabricated using fused deposition modeling and validated through uniaxial compression tests, showing strong agreement with numerical predictions. Compared to conventional TPMS, TAAMs exhibit significantly improved elastic isotropy while maintaining high stiffness across various relative densities. This approach offers a robust and scalable pathway for developing architected materials tailored to applications requiring isotropic performance, such as biomedical implants, protective systems, and aerospace components.</description>

      <title>RT-APNN for Solving Gray Radiative Transfer Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gray Radiative Transfer Equations (GRTEs) are high-dimensional, multiscale problems that pose significant computational challenges for traditional numerical methods. Current deep learning approaches, including Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Asymptotically Preserving Neural Networks (APNNs), are largely restricted to low-dimensional or linear GRTEs. To address these challenges, we propose the Radiative Transfer Asymptotically Preserving Neural Network (RT-APNN), an innovative framework extending APNNs. RT-APNN integrates multiple neural networks into a cohesive architecture, reducing training time while ensuring high solution accuracy. Advanced techniques such as pre-training and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) adaptive sampling are employed to tackle the complexities of long-term simulations and intricate boundary conditions. RT-APNN is the first deep learning method to successfully simulate the Marshak wave problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods, including APNNs and MD-APNNs, in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, RT-APNN excels at solving high-dimensional, nonlinear problems, underscoring its potential for diverse applications in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Time domain analysis of microstructured materials through the reduced relaxed micromorphic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microstructured materials, such as architected metamaterials and phononic crystals, exhibit complex wave propagation phenomena due to their internal structure. While full-scale numerical simulations can capture these effects, they are computationally demanding, especially in time-domain analyses. To overcome this limitation, effective continuum models have been developed to approximate the macroscopic behavior of these materials while retaining key microscale effects. In this work we investigate the time-domain dynamic response of microstructured materials and focus on their effective micromorphic counterparts. We compare direct numerical simulations of discrete microstructures with predictions from micromorphic models to assess their accuracy in capturing transient wave phenomena. Our findings provide new insights into the applicability and limitations of micromorphic models in time-dependent analyses, contributing to the development of improved predictive tools for metamaterial design and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>An adaptive, data-driven multiscale approach for dense granular flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of coarse-grained continuum models of dense granular flows is limited by the lack of high-fidelity closure models for granular rheology. One approach to addressing this issue, referred to as the hierarchical multiscale method, is to use a high-fidelity fine-grained model to compute the closure terms needed by the coarse-grained model. The difficulty with this approach is that the overall model can become computationally intractable due to the high computational cost of the high-fidelity model. In this work, we describe a multiscale modeling approach for dense granular flows that utilizes neural networks trained using high-fidelity discrete element method (DEM) simulations to approximate the constitutive granular rheology for a continuum incompressible flow model. Our approach leverages an ensemble of neural networks to estimate predictive uncertainty that allows us to determine whether the rheology at a given point is accurately represented by the neural network model. Additional DEM simulations are only performed when needed, minimizing the number of additional DEM simulations required when updating the rheology. This adaptive coupling significantly reduces the overall computational cost of the approach while controlling the error. In addition, the neural networks are customized to learn regularized rheological behavior to ensure well-posedness of the continuum solution. We first validate the approach using two-dimensional steady-state and decelerating inclined flows. We then demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by modeling three-dimensional sub-aerial granular column collapse for varying initial column aspect ratios, where our multiscale method compares well with the computationally expensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD)-DEM simulation.</description>

      <title>SPIEDiff: robust learning of long-time macroscopic dynamics from short-time particle simulations with quantified epistemic uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data-driven discovery of long-time macroscopic dynamics and thermodynamics of dissipative systems with particle fidelity is hampered by significant obstacles. These include the strong time-scale limitations inherent to particle simulations, the non-uniqueness of the thermodynamic potentials and operators from given macroscopic dynamics, and the need for efficient uncertainty quantification. This paper introduces Statistical-Physics Informed Epistemic Diffusion Models (SPIEDiff), a machine learning framework designed to overcome these limitations in the context of purely dissipative systems by leveraging statistical physics, conditional diffusion models, and epinets. We evaluate the proposed framework on stochastic Arrhenius particle processes and demonstrate that SPIEDiff can accurately uncover both thermodynamics and kinetics, while enabling reliable long-time macroscopic predictions using only short-time particle simulation data. SPIEDiff can deliver accurate predictions with quantified uncertainty in minutes, drastically reducing the computational demand compared to direct particle simulations, which would take days or years in the examples considered. Overall, SPIEDiff offers a robust and trustworthy pathway for the data-driven discovery of thermodynamic models.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Self-Healing at Tungsten Grain Boundaries from Ab Initio Machine Learning Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanostructured tungsten has been reported as a possible alternative plasma-facing material due to its potential ability to self-heal radiation-induced defects, a property that is attributed to its high density of grain boundaries (GB). Here, we study the initial stages of self-healing at tungsten interfaces with molecular dynamics simulations driven by a machine-learning interatomic potential tailored to one of the most common GBs found in experiments. Our model accurately reproduces the ab initio potential energy surface derived from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and outperforms previously reported empirical interatomic potentials in predicting defect energetics. The simulations reveal low-temperature defect migration to GBs driven by rapid dumbbell-like ordering and subsequent accommodation along GB grooves. In contrast to empirical potentials, which predict unexpected GB degradation at high temperatures after defect migration, our model maintains stable GB motifs over the investigated temperature range. The temperature-dependent defect counts, evaluated using an Arrhenius-like fit, yield an average interstitial migration energy of 0.048 eV, in agreement with experiment.
  This work underscores the capabilities of ab initio machine learning simulations in accurately modeling defect-GB interactions and highlights their potential to contribute to the development of radiation tolerant materials.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Sequence Modeling for Fast Simulation and Design Exploration of 2D Memristive Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling hysteretic switching dynamics in memristive devices is computationally demanding due to coupled ionic and electronic transport processes. This challenge is particularly relevant for emerging two-dimensional (2D) devices, which feature high-dimensional design spaces that remain largely unexplored. We introduce a physics-guided modeling framework that integrates high-fidelity finite-volume (FV) charge transport simulations with a long short-term memory (LSTM) artificial neural network (ANN) to predict dynamic current-voltage behavior. Trained on physically grounded simulation data, the ANN surrogate achieves more than four orders of magnitude speedup compared to the FV model, while maintaining direct access to physically meaningful input parameters and high accuracy with typical normalized errors &lt;1%. This enables iterative tasks that were previously computationally prohibitive, including inverse modeling from experimental data, design space exploration via metric mapping and sensitivity analysis, as well as constrained multi-objective design optimization. Importantly, the framework preserves physical interpretability via access to detailed spatial dynamics, including carrier densities, vacancy distributions, and electrostatic potentials, through a direct link to the underlying FV model. Our approach establishes a scalable framework for efficient exploration, interpretation, and model-driven design of emerging 2D memristive and neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigation of interface atomic structure of graphene on NiFe alloy substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two processes have been proposed to fabricate graphene/NiFe alloy interfaces for tunneling magnetoresistance devices. One is the transfer of graphene and the other is the evaporation of alloys onto graphene. The formation energy of a NiFe alloy substrate and the adsorption energy of graphene on the NiFe alloy substrate are investigated by a density functional theory calculations to reveal the difference in the atomic structure of the interface between the two processes. It is found that Ni-rich surfaces are preferable for the bare substrate, whereas Fe surfaces are stable for the graphene adsorbed on the substrate. This result indicates that the composition ratio of the surface layer depends on the interface fabrication process.</description>

      <title>A marching cubes based method for topology changes in three-dimensional two-phase flows with front tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The handling of topology changes in two-phase flows, such as breakup or coalescence of interfaces, with front tracking is a well-known problem that requires an additional effort to perform explicit manipulations of the Lagrangian front. In this work, we present an approach that allows to perform topology changes with interfaces made of connected triangular elements. The methodology consists of replacing the fluid entities that undergo breakup/coalescence with the iso-surface corresponding to the indicator function value I = 0.5, which automatically returns the shape of the bodies after topology changes. The generation and triangulation of such surface is obtained by exploiting the marching cubes algorithm. Since we perform the reconstruction of the interface only for the bodies that experience breakup/coalescence, the increase in computational cost with respect to a classic front tracking scheme without topology changes is small. Using validation cases, we show that the proposed reconstruction procedure is second-order accurate for volume conservation and able to capture the physics of several two-phase flow configurations undergoing topology changes. The validation cases include the breakup of a droplet in simple shear flow and two rising bubbles in different regimes (peripheral and central breakups). Coalescence is tested by modelling the binary collision between two droplets. For the selected validation cases, an excellent agreement between the numerical results and experiments is observed. The proposed methodology is able to capture the details of such interfacial flows, by predicting accurately the coalescence/breakup dynamics, as well as the number, size and shapes of satellite droplets/bubbles after topology changes.</description>

      <title>Path-integral molecular dynamics with actively-trained and universal machine learning force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accounting for nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can significantly alter material properties at finite temperatures. Atomic modeling using the path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) method can fully account for such effects, but requires computationally efficient and accurate models of interatomic interactions. Empirical potentials are fast but may lack sufficient accuracy, whereas quantum-mechanical calculations are highly accurate but computationally expensive. Machine-learned interatomic potentials offer a solution to this challenge, providing near-quantum-mechanical accuracy while maintaining high computational efficiency compared to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In this context, an interface was developed to integrate moment tensor potentials (MTPs) from the MLIP-2 software package into PIMD calculations using the i-PI software package. This interface was then applied to active learning of potentials and to investigate the influence of NQEs on material properties, namely the temperature dependence of lattice parameters and thermal expansion coefficients, as well as radial distribution functions, for lithium hydride (LiH) and silicon (Si) systems. The results were compared with experimental data, quasi-harmonic approximation calculations, and predictions from the universal machine learning force field MatterSim. These comparisons demonstrated the high accuracy and effectiveness of the MTP-PIMD approach.</description>

      <title>Electrostatics from Laplacian Eigenbasis for Neural Network Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in neural network interatomic potentials have emerged as a promising research direction. However, popular deep learning models often lack auxiliary constraints grounded in physical laws, which could accelerate training and improve fidelity through physics-based regularization. In this work, we introduce $\Phi$-Module, a universal plugin module that enforces Poisson's equation within the message-passing framework to learn electrostatic interactions in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, each atom-wise representation is encouraged to satisfy a discretized Poisson's equation, making it possible to acquire a potential $\boldsymbol{\phi}$ and a corresponding charge density $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ linked to the learnable Laplacian eigenbasis coefficients of a given molecular graph. We then derive an electrostatic energy term, crucial for improved total energy predictions. This approach integrates seamlessly into any existing neural potential with insignificant computational overhead. Experiments on the OE62 and MD22 benchmarks confirm that models combined with $\Phi$-Module achieve robust improvements over baseline counterparts. For OE62 error reduction ranges from 4.5\% to 17.8\%, and for MD22, baseline equipped with $\Phi$-Module achieves best results on 5 out of 14 cases. Our results underscore how embedding a first-principles constraint in neural interatomic potentials can significantly improve performance while remaining hyperparameter-friendly, memory-efficient and lightweight in training.

      <description>arXiv:2502.18314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial approaches, which intentionally challenge machine learning models by generating difficult examples, are increasingly being adopted to improve machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While already providing great practical value, little is known about the actual prediction errors of MLIPs on adversarial structures and whether these errors can be controlled. We propose the Calibrated Adversarial Geometry Optimization (CAGO) algorithm to discover adversarial structures with user-assigned errors. Through uncertainty calibration, the estimated uncertainty of MLIPs is unified with real errors. By performing geometry optimization for calibrated uncertainty, we reach adversarial structures with the user-assigned target MLIP prediction error. Integrating with active learning pipelines, we benchmark CAGO, demonstrating stable MLIPs that systematically converge structural, dynamical, and thermodynamical properties for liquid water and water adsorption in a metal-organic framework within only hundreds of training structures, where previously many thousands were typically required.</description>

Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing nanophotonic structures traditionally grapples with the complexities of discrete parameters, such as real materials, often resorting to costly global optimization methods. This paper introduces an approach that leverages generative deep learning to map discrete parameter sets into a continuous latent space, enabling direct gradient-based optimization. For scenarios with non-differentiable physics evaluation functions, a neural network is employed as a differentiable surrogate model. The efficacy of this methodology is demonstrated by optimizing the directional scattering properties of core-shell nanoparticles composed of a selection of realistic materials. We derive suggestions for core-shell geometries with strong forward scattering and minimized backscattering. Our findings reveal significant improvements in computational efficiency and performance when compared to global optimization techniques. Beyond nanophotonics design problems, this framework holds promise for broad applications across all types of inverse problems constrained by discrete variables.</description>

Abstract: Understanding and predicting the adhesive properties of viscoelastic Hertzian contacts is crucial for diverse engineering applications, including robotics, biomechanics, and advanced material design. The maximum adherence force of a Hertzian indenter unloaded from a viscoelastic substrate has been studied with analytical and numerical models. Analytical models are valid within their assumptions, numerical methods offer precision but can be computationally expensive, necessitating alternative solutions. This study introduces a novel physics-augmented machine learning (PA-ML) framework as a hybrid approach, bridging the gap between analytical models and data-driven solutions, which is capable of rapidly predicting the pull-off force in an Hertzian profile unloaded from a broad band viscoelastic material, with varying Tabor parameter, preload and retraction rate. Compared to previous models, the PA-ML approach provides fast yet accurate predictions in a wide range of conditions, properly predicting the effective surface energy and the work-to-pull-off. The integration of the analytical model provides critical guidance to the PA-ML framework, supporting physically consistent predictions. We demonstrate that physics augmentation enhances predictive accuracy, reducing mean squared error (MSE) while increasing model efficiency and interpretability. We provide data-driven and PA-ML models for real-time predictions of the adherence force in soft materials like silicons and elastomers opening to the possibility to integrate PA-ML into materials and interface design. The models are openly available on Zenodo and GitHub.</description>
