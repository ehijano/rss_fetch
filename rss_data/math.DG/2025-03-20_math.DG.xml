      <title>Upper bounds for the Alexandrov-Fenchel deficit via integral formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a number of sharp upper bounds for the deficit in the Alexandrov-Fenchel inequality using a weighted Minkowski integral formula and an integral formula for the deficit in Jensen's inequality. Our estimates yield results under weaker convexity assumptions compared to approaches based on inverse curvature flows. The use of weighted formulas provides flexibility in deriving inequalities with different weight functions. Furthermore, our estimates are more quantitative as they include a distance term measuring the domain's deviation from a reference ball. We also analyze the stability of a weighted geometric inequality from a recent paper \cite{kwong2023geometric} via analysis of the support function on the sphere and show that, with an optimal choice of the origin, this inequality is stronger than the classical isoperimetric inequality.</description>

      <title>Ternary associator, ternary commutator and ternary Lie algebra at cube roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the concepts of the associator and commutator from algebras with a binary multiplication law to algebras with a ternary multiplication law using cube roots of unity. By analogy with the Jacobi identity for the binary commutator, we derive an identity for the proposed ternary commutator. While the Jacobi identity is based on the cyclic permutation group of three elements $\mathbb Z_3$, the identity we establish for the ternary commutator is based on the general affine group $GA(1,5)$. We introduce the notion of a ternary Lie algebra at cube roots of unity. A broad class of such algebras is constructed using associative ternary multiplications of rectangular and cubic matrices. Furthermore, a complete classification of non-isomorphic two-dimensional ternary Lie algebras at cube roots of unity is obtained.</description>

      <title>A note on $\tmd$-operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In almost K\"ahler manifolds, one of the challenges is to construct an elliptic operator on functions that plays a role analogous to the $\partial\bar{\partial}$ operator in complex or K\"ahler manifolds. One of the aims of this paper is to revisit the $\tmd$-operator introduced in \cite{TWZZ}. We will provide some local analysis estimates and highlight several difficulties that remain to be addressed. Additionally, we use the Atiyah-Hitchin-Singer operator to demonstrate that every $d$-exact $(1,1)$-form is globally $\tmd$-exact for any compact taming symplectic $4$-manifold.</description>

      <title>Contractibility of spaces of positive scalar curvature metrics with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the contractibility of spaces of invariant Riemannian metrics of positive scalar curvature on compact manifolds with and without boundary and equipped with compact Lie group actions. On manifolds without boundary, we assume that the center of the Lie group contains an $S^1$-subgroup whose fixed-point set has components of codimension two. In this situation, Wiemeler has shown previously that invariant metrics of positive scalar curvature exist.
  For the proof, we combine equivariant Morse theory with conformal deformations near unstable manifolds. On manifolds without boundary, we also use local flexibility properties of positive scalar curvature metrics and the smoothing of mean-convex singularities.</description>

      <title>A Nash-Kuiper theorem for isometric immersions beyond Borisov's exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any given short immersion from an $n$-dimensional bounded domain into $(n+1)$-dimensional Euclidean space and any H\"older exponent $\alpha&lt;(1+n^2-n)^{-1}$, we construct a $C^{1, \alpha}$ isometric immersion within any $C^0$ neighbourhood of the given short immersion using convex integration. This refines the classical Nash--Kuiper theorem and extends the flexibility of $C^{1, \alpha}$ isometric immersion beyond Borisov's exponent. In particular, the regularity threshold aligns with the Onsager exponent $\frac13$ for the incompressible Euler equations in the case $n=2$. The convex integration scheme relies on a new corrugation ansatz, which allows the cancellation of leading order error terms by a novel "integration by parts" technique.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. In particular, it admits a good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form.
  Our key idea is to relate Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties. We also prove results on the local behaviour of (singular) hyperKahler metrics. For instance, we show that the singular hyperKahler metric of any smoothable projective symplectic variety around isolated singularity is close to a Riemannian cone in a polynomial order.
  Most of our results also work for symplectic singularities on hyperKahler quotients under some conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from Joyce's generalised Kummer construction, we exhibit non-trivial families of $\mathrm{G}_2$-manifolds over the two dimensional sphere by resolving singularities with a twisted family of Eguchi-Hanson spaces. We establish that the comparison map $\mathcal{G}_2^{\mathrm{tf}}(M) /\!\!/ \mathrm{Diff}(M)_0 \rightarrow \mathcal{G}_2^{\mathrm{tf}}(M) / \mathrm{Diff}(M)_0$ is a fibration over each path components with Eilenberg Mac Lane spaces as fibres, which allows us to show that these families remain non-trivial in $\mathcal{G}_2^{\mathrm{tf}}(M) / \mathrm{Diff}(M)_0$. In addition, we construct a new invariant based on characteristic classes that allows us to show that different resolutions give rise to different elements in the moduli space.</description>

      <title>Topological Kleene Field Theories: A new model of computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the foundations of a computational field theory, which we term Topological Kleene Field Theory (TKFT), inspired by Stephen Kleene's seminal work on partial recursive functions. Our central result shows that any computable function can be simulated by the flow on a smooth bordism of a vector field with good local properties. More precisely, we prove that reaching functions on clean dynamical bordisms are exactly equivalent to computable functions, setting an alternative model of computation to Turing machines. The use of non-trivial topologies for the bordisms involved is essential for this equivalence, suggesting interesting connections between the topological structure of these flows and the computational complexity inherent in the functions. We emphasize that TKFT has the potential to surpass the computational complexity of both Turing machines and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Notes on Correlation Stress Tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note outlines an approach to stress testing of covariance of financial time series, in the context of financial risk management. It discusses how the geodesic distance between covariance matrices implies a notion of plausibility of covariance stress tests. In this approach, correlation stress tests span a submanifold of constant determinant of the Fisher--Rao manifold of covariance matrices. A parsimonious geometrically invariant definition of arbitrarily large correlation stress tests is proposed, and a few examples are discussed.</description>

      <title>Counting $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections on Seifert-fibered spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ character variety of a Seifert-fibered homology $3$-sphere from the point of view of gauge theory. Namely, we introduce a class of perturbations of the $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern--Simons functional and prove a localisation result: the perturbed critical points either approach a compact subset of the $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ character variety or else `escape to infinity'. Furthermore, the Euler characteristic and Poincar\'e polynomial of the stable locus of the character variety are obtained by suitably counting the localising critical points.
  As an application, we obtain formulae for the Euler characteristic and Poincar\'e polynomial of the stable locus of the $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$ character variety of a Seifert-fibered homology $3$-sphere. In particular, we prove that the Euler characteristic equals the Milnor number (divided by four) of any weighted-homogeneous isolated complete intersection singularity whose link is the given $3$-manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the standard Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics, we show that the existence of causal incomplete geodesics is a $C^\infty$-generic feature within the class of spacetimes of a given dimension $n\geq 3$ that are stably causal, satisfy the timelike convergence condition (``strong energy condition'') and contain a codimension-two spacelike weakly trapped closed submanifold such as, e.g., a marginally outer trapped surface (MOTS). By using a singularity theorem of Galloway and Senovilla for spacetimes containing trapped closed submanifolds of codimension higher than two we also prove an analogous $C^\infty$-genericity result for stably causal spacetimes with a suitably modified curvature condition and weakly trapped closed spacelike submanifold of any codimension $k&gt; 2$.</description>

Abstract: Harmonic manifolds of hypergeometric type form a class of non-compact harmonic manifolds that includes rank one symmetric spaces of non-compact type and Damek-Ricci spaces. When normalizing the metric of a harmonic manifold of hypergeometric type to satisfy the Ricci curvature $\mathrm{Ric} = -(n-1)$, we show that the volume entropy of this manifold satisfies a certain inequality. Additionally, we show that manifolds yielding the upper bound of volume entropy are only real hyperbolic spaces with sectional curvature $-1$, while examples of Damek-Ricci spaces yielding the lower bound exist in only four cases.</description>

      <title>On the genericity of singularities in spacetimes with weakly trapped submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate suitable, physically motivated conditions on spacetimes containing certain submanifolds - the so-called {weakly trapped submanifolds} - that ensure, in a set of neighboring metrics with respect to a convenient topology, that the phenomenon of nonspacelike geodesic incompleteness (i.e., the existence of singularities) is generic in a precise technical sense. We obtain two sets of results. First, we use strong Whitney topologies on spaces of Lorentzian metrics on a manifold $M$, in the spirit of Lerner and obtain that while the set of singular Lorentzian metrics around a fiducial one possessing a weakly trapped submanifold $\Sigma$ is not really generic, it is nevertheless prevalent in a sense we define, and thus still quite ``large'' in this sense. We prove versions of that result both for the case when $\Sigma$ has codimension 2, and for the case of higher codimension.
  The second set of results explore a similar question, but now for initial data sets containing MOTS. For this case, we use certain well-known infinite dimensional, Hilbert manifold structures on the space of initial data and use abstract functional-analytic methods based on the work of Biliotti, Javaloyes, and Piccione to obtain a true genericity of null geodesic incompleteness around suitable initial data sets containing MOTS.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear d'Alembert comparison theorem and causal differential calculus on metric measure spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a variational first-order Sobolev calculus on metric measure spacetimes. The key object is the maximal weak subslope of an arbitrary causal function, which plays the role of the (Lorentzian) modulus of its differential. It is shown to satisfy certain chain and Leibniz rules, certify a locality property, and be compatible with its smooth analog. In this setup, we propose a quadraticity condition termed infinitesimal Minkowskianity, which singles out genuinely Lorentzian structures among Lorentz-Finsler spacetimes. Moreover, we establish a comparison theorem for a nonlinear yet elliptic $p$-d'Alembertian in a weak form under the timelike measure contraction property. As a particular case, this extends Eschenburg's classical estimate past the timelike cut locus.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Duality for Supermanifolds, Higher Cartan Structures and Geometric Supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05224v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study relative differential and integral forms on families of supermanifolds and investigate their cohomology. In particular, we establish a relative version of Poincar\'e-Verdier duality, relating the cohomology of differential and integral forms, and provide a concrete interpretation via Berezin fiber integration, which we introduce. To complement Poincar\'e duality, we prove compactly supported Poincar\'e lemmas for both differential and integral forms, filling a gap in the literature. We then apply our results to the mathematical foundations of supergravity. Specifically, we rigorously define picture-changing operators via relative Poincar\'e duality and use them to formulate a general action principle for geometric supergravity in a mathematically rigorous manner. As an example, we explicitly describe three-dimensional supergravity via higher Cartan structures, which are defined by certain classes of connections valued in $L_\infty$-superalgebras. Our construction provides a unified framework interpolating between two equivalent formulations of supergravity in the physics literature: the superspace approach and the group manifold approach.</description>

Abstract: Dynamical formulations of optimal transport (OT) frame the task of comparing distributions as a variational problem which searches for a path between distributions minimizing a kinetic energy functional. In applications, it is frequently natural to require paths of distributions to satisfy additional conditions. Inspired by this, we introduce a model for dynamical OT which incorporates constraints on the space of admissible paths into the framework of unbalanced OT, where the source and target measures are allowed to have a different total mass. Our main results establish, for several general families of constraints, the existence of solutions to the variational problem which defines this path constrained unbalanced optimal transport framework. These results are primarily concerned with distributions defined on a Euclidean space, but we extend them to distributions defined over parallelizable Riemannian manifolds as well. We also consider metric properties of our framework, showing that, for certain types of constraints, our model defines a metric on the relevant space of distributions. This metric is shown to arise as a geodesic distance of a Riemannian metric, obtained through an analogue of Otto's submersion in the classical OT setting.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Fuchsian flows and the coupled vortex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an alternative construction of the quasi-Fuchsian flows introduced by Ghys in \cite{Ghys-92}. Our approach is based on the coupled vortex equations that allows to see these flows as thermostats on the unit tangent bundle of the Blaschke metric uniquely determined by a conformal class and a holomorphic quadratic differential. We also give formulas for the marked length spectrum of a quasi-Fuchsian flow in the thermostat parametrization.</description>
