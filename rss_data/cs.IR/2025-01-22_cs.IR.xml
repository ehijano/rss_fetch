      <title>Diffusion Models in Recommendation Systems: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems remain an essential topic due to its wide application in various domains and the business potential behind them. With the rise of deep learning, common solutions have leveraged neural networks to facilitate collaborative filtering, and some have turned to generative adversarial networks to augment the dataset and tackle the data sparsity issue. However, they are limited in learning the complex user and item distribution and still suffer from model collapse. Given the great generation capability exhibited by diffusion models in computer vision recently, many recommender systems have adopted diffusion models and found improvements in performance for various tasks. Diffusion models in recommender systems excel in managing complex user and item distributions and do not suffer from mode collapse. With these advantages, the amount of research in this domain have been growing rapidly and calling for a systematic survey. In this survey paper, we present and propose a taxonomy on past research papers in recommender systems that utilize diffusion models. Distinct from a prior survey paper that categorizes based on the role of the diffusion model, we categorize based on the recommendation task at hand. The decision originates from the rationale that after all, the adoption of diffusion models is to enhance the recommendation performance, not vice versa: adapting the recommendation task to enable diffusion models. Nonetheless, we offer a unique perspective for diffusion models in recommender systems complementary to existing surveys. We present the foundation algorithms in diffusion models and their applications in recommender systems to summarize the rapid development in this field. Finally, we discuss open research directions to prepare and encourage further efforts to advance the field. We compile the relevant papers in a public GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Enhancing User Intent for Recommendation Systems via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommendation systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience and engagement in various online platforms. Traditional methods, such as Collaborative Filtering (CF) and Content-Based Filtering (CBF), rely heavily on past user interactions or item features. However, these models often fail to capture the dynamic and evolving nature of user preferences. To address these limitations, we propose DUIP (Dynamic User Intent Prediction), a novel framework that combines LSTM networks with Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically capture user intent and generate personalized item recommendations. The LSTM component models the sequential and temporal dependencies of user behavior, while the LLM utilizes the LSTM-generated prompts to predict the next item of interest. Experimental results on three diverse datasets ML-1M, Games, and Bundle show that DUIP outperforms a wide range of baseline models, demonstrating its ability to handle the cold-start problem and real-time intent adaptation. The integration of dynamic prompts based on recent user interactions allows DUIP to provide more accurate, context-aware, and personalized recommendations. Our findings suggest that DUIP is a promising approach for next-generation recommendation systems, with potential for further improvements in cross-modal recommendations and scalability.</description>

      <title>Generative Retrieval for Book search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In book search, relevant book information should be returned in response to a query. Books contain complex, multi-faceted information such as metadata, outlines, and main text, where the outline provides hierarchical information between chapters and sections. Generative retrieval (GR) is a new retrieval paradigm that consolidates corpus information into a single model to generate identifiers of documents that are relevant to a given query. How can GR be applied to book search? Directly applying GR to book search is a challenge due to the unique characteristics of book search: The model needs to retain the complex, multi-faceted information of the book, which increases the demand for labeled data. Splitting book information and treating it as a collection of separate segments for learning might result in a loss of hierarchical information. We propose an effective Generative retrieval framework for Book Search (GBS) that features two main components: data augmentation and outline-oriented book encoding. For data augmentation, GBS constructs multiple query-book pairs for training; it constructs multiple book identifiers based on the outline, various forms of book contents, and simulates real book retrieval scenarios with varied pseudo-queries. This includes coverage-promoting book identifier augmentation, allowing the model to learn to index effectively, and diversity-enhanced query augmentation, allowing the model to learn to retrieve effectively. Outline-oriented book encoding improves length extrapolation through bi-level positional encoding and retentive attention mechanisms to maintain context over long sequences. Experiments on a proprietary Baidu dataset demonstrate that GBS outperforms strong baselines, achieving a 9.8\% improvement in terms of MRR@20, over the state-of-the-art RIPOR method...</description>

      <title>PlotEdit: Natural Language-Driven Accessible Chart Editing in PDFs via Multimodal LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chart visualizations, while essential for data interpretation and communication, are predominantly accessible only as images in PDFs, lacking source data tables and stylistic information. To enable effective editing of charts in PDFs or digital scans, we present PlotEdit, a novel multi-agent framework for natural language-driven end-to-end chart image editing via self-reflective LLM agents. PlotEdit orchestrates five LLM agents: (1) Chart2Table for data table extraction, (2) Chart2Vision for style attribute identification, (3) Chart2Code for retrieving rendering code, (4) Instruction Decomposition Agent for parsing user requests into executable steps, and (5) Multimodal Editing Agent for implementing nuanced chart component modifications - all coordinated through multimodal feedback to maintain visual fidelity. PlotEdit outperforms existing baselines on the ChartCraft dataset across style, layout, format, and data-centric edits, enhancing accessibility for visually challenged users and improving novice productivity.</description>

      <title>Disentangled Modeling of Preferences and Social Influence for Group Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The group recommendation (GR) aims to suggest items for a group of users in social networks. Existing work typically considers individual preferences as the sole factor in aggregating group preferences. Actually, social influence is also an important factor in modeling users' contributions to the final group decision. However, existing methods either neglect the social influence of individual members or bundle preferences and social influence together as a unified representation. As a result, these models emphasize the preferences of the majority within the group rather than the actual interaction items, which we refer to as the preference bias issue in GR. Moreover, the self-supervised learning (SSL) strategies they designed to address the issue of group data sparsity fail to account for users' contextual social weights when regulating group representations, leading to suboptimal results. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel model based on Disentangled Modeling of Preferences and Social Influence for Group Recommendation (DisRec). Concretely, we first design a user-level disentangling network to disentangle the preferences and social influence of group members with separate embedding propagation schemes based on (hyper)graph convolution networks. We then introduce a socialbased contrastive learning strategy, selectively excluding user nodes based on their social importance to enhance group representations and alleviate the group-level data sparsity issue. The experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two realworld datasets.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Language Models in Neural News Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural news recommender systems (RSs) have integrated language models (LMs) to encode news articles with rich textual information into representations, thereby improving the recommendation process. Most studies suggest that (i) news RSs achieve better performance with larger pre-trained language models (PLMs) than shallow language models (SLMs), and (ii) that large language models (LLMs) outperform PLMs. However, other studies indicate that PLMs sometimes lead to worse performance than SLMs. Thus, it remains unclear whether using larger LMs consistently improves the performance of news RSs. In this paper, we revisit, unify, and extend these comparisons of the effectiveness of LMs in news RSs using the real-world MIND dataset. We find that (i) larger LMs do not necessarily translate to better performance in news RSs, and (ii) they require stricter fine-tuning hyperparameter selection and greater computational resources to achieve optimal recommendation performance than smaller LMs. On the positive side, our experiments show that larger LMs lead to better recommendation performance for cold-start users: they alleviate dependency on extensive user interaction history and make recommendations more reliant on the news content.</description>

      <title>Ontology Matching with Large Language Models and Prioritized Depth-First Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays a key role in enabling data interoperability and knowledge sharing, but it remains challenging due to the need for large training datasets and limited vocabulary processing in machine learning approaches. Recently, methods based on Large Language Model (LLMs) have shown great promise in OM, particularly through the use of a retrieve-then-prompt pipeline. In this approach, relevant target entities are first retrieved and then used to prompt the LLM to predict the final matches. Despite their potential, these systems still present limited performance and high computational overhead. To address these issues, we introduce MILA, a novel approach that embeds a retrieve-identify-prompt pipeline within a prioritized depth-first search (PDFS) strategy. This approach efficiently identifies a large number of semantic correspondences with high accuracy, limiting LLM requests to only the most borderline cases. We evaluated MILA using the biomedical challenge proposed in the 2023 and 2024 editions of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Our method achieved the highest F-Measure in four of the five unsupervised tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art OM systems by up to 17%. It also performed better than or comparable to the leading supervised OM systems. MILA further exhibited task-agnostic performance, remaining stable across all tasks and settings, while significantly reducing LLM requests. These findings highlight that high-performance LLM-based OM can be achieved through a combination of programmed (PDFS), learned (embedding vectors), and prompting-based heuristics, without the need of domain-specific heuristics or fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>KEIR @ ECIR 2025: The Second Workshop on Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pretrained language models (PLMs) like BERT and GPT-4 have become the foundation for modern information retrieval (IR) systems. However, existing PLM-based IR models primarily rely on the knowledge learned during training for prediction, limiting their ability to access and incorporate external, up-to-date, or domain-specific information. Therefore, current information retrieval systems struggle with semantic nuances, context relevance, and domain-specific issues. To address these challenges, we propose the second Knowledge-Enhanced Information Retrieval workshop (KEIR @ ECIR 2025) as a platform to discuss innovative approaches that integrate external knowledge, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of information retrieval in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers from academia and industry to discuss various aspects of knowledge-enhanced information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Scalability of Approximate Sparse Retrieval Algorithms to Massive Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned sparse text embeddings have gained popularity due to their effectiveness in top-k retrieval and inherent interpretability. Their distributional idiosyncrasies, however, have long hindered their use in real-world retrieval systems. That changed with the recent development of approximate algorithms that leverage the distributional properties of sparse embeddings to speed up retrieval. Nonetheless, in much of the existing literature, evaluation has been limited to datasets with only a few million documents such as MSMARCO. It remains unclear how these systems behave on much larger datasets and what challenges lurk in larger scales. To bridge that gap, we investigate the behavior of state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms on massive datasets. We compare and contrast the recently-proposed Seismic and graph-based solutions adapted from dense retrieval. We extensively evaluate Splade embeddings of 138M passages from MsMarco-v2 and report indexing time and other efficiency and effectiveness metrics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Preference-Guided Diffusion Model for Cross-Domain Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) has been proven as a promising way to alleviate the cold-start issue, in which the most critical problem is how to draw an informative user representation in the target domain via the transfer of user preference existing in the source domain. Prior efforts mostly follow the embedding-and-mapping paradigm, which first integrate the preference into user representation in the source domain, and then perform a mapping function on this representation to the target domain. However, they focus on mapping features across domains, neglecting to explicitly model the preference integration process, which may lead to learning coarse user representation. Diffusion models (DMs), which contribute to more accurate user/item representations due to their explicit information injection capability, have achieved promising performance in recommendation systems. Nevertheless, these DMs-based methods cannot directly account for valuable user preference in other domains, leading to challenges in adapting to the transfer of preference for cold-start users. Consequently, the feasibility of DMs for CDR remains underexplored. To this end, we explore to utilize the explicit information injection capability of DMs for user preference integration and propose a Preference-Guided Diffusion Model for CDR to cold-start users, termed as DMCDR. Specifically, we leverage a preference encoder to establish the preference guidance signal with the user's interaction history in the source domain. Then, we explicitly inject the preference guidance signal into the user representation step by step to guide the reverse process, and ultimately generate the personalized user representation in the target domain, thus achieving the transfer of user preference across domains. Furthermore, we comprehensively explore the impact of six DMs-based variants on CDR.</description>

      <title>Poison-RAG: Adversarial Data Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents Poison-RAG, a framework for adversarial data poisoning attacks targeting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based recommender systems. Poison-RAG manipulates item metadata, such as tags and descriptions, to influence recommendation outcomes. Using item metadata generated through a large language model (LLM) and embeddings derived via the OpenAI API, we explore the impact of adversarial poisoning attacks on provider-side, where attacks are designed to promote long-tail items and demote popular ones. Two attack strategies are proposed: local modifications, which personalize tags for each item using BERT embeddings, and global modifications, applying uniform tags across the dataset. Experiments conducted on the MovieLens dataset in a black-box setting reveal that local strategies improve manipulation effectiveness by up to 50\%, while global strategies risk boosting already popular items. Results indicate that popular items are more susceptible to attacks, whereas long-tail items are harder to manipulate. Approximately 70\% of items lack tags, presenting a cold-start challenge; data augmentation and synthesis are proposed as potential defense mechanisms to enhance RAG-based systems' resilience. The findings emphasize the need for robust metadata management to safeguard recommendation frameworks. Code and data are available at https://github.com/atenanaz/Poison-RAG.</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-Fine Lightweight Meta-Embedding for ID-Based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-of-the-art recommendation systems have shifted the attention to efficient recommendation, e.g., on-device recommendation, under memory constraints. To this end, the existing methods either focused on the lightweight embeddings for both users and items, or involved on-device systems enjoying the compact embeddings to enhance reusability and reduces space complexity. However, they focus solely on the coarse granularity of embedding, while overlook the fine-grained semantic nuances, to adversarially downgrade the efficacy of meta-embeddings in capturing the intricate relationship over both user and item, consequently resulting into the suboptimal recommendations. In this paper, we aim to study how the meta-embedding can efficiently learn varied grained semantics, together with how the fine-grained meta-embedding can strengthen the representation of coarse-grained meta-embedding. To answer these questions, we develop a novel graph neural networks (GNNs) based recommender where each user and item serves as the node, linked directly to coarse-grained virtual nodes and indirectly to fine-grained virtual nodes, ensuring different grained semantic learning, while disclosing: 1) In contrast to coarse-grained semantics, fine-grained semantics are well captured through sparse meta-embeddings, which adaptively 2) balance the embedding uniqueness and memory constraint. Additionally, the initialization method come up upon SparsePCA, along with a soft thresholding activation function to render the sparseness of the meta-embeddings. We propose a weight bridging update strategy that focuses on matching each coarse-grained meta-embedding with several fine-grained meta-embeddings based on the users/items' semantics. Extensive experiments substantiate our method's superiority over existing baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/htyjers/C2F-MetaEmbed.</description>

      <title>Integrate Temporal Graph Learning into LLM-based Temporal Knowledge Graph Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting (TKGF) aims to predict future events based on the observed events in history. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities, generating significant research interest in their application for reasoning over temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs). Existing LLM-based methods have integrated retrieved historical facts or static graph representations into LLMs. Despite the notable performance of LLM-based methods, they are limited by the insufficient modeling of temporal patterns and ineffective cross-modal alignment between graph and language, hindering the ability of LLMs to fully grasp the temporal and structural information in TKGs. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework TGL-LLM to integrate temporal graph learning into LLM-based temporal knowledge graph model. Specifically, we introduce temporal graph learning to capture the temporal and relational patterns and obtain the historical graph embedding. Furthermore, we design a hybrid graph tokenization to sufficiently model the temporal patterns within LLMs. To achieve better alignment between graph and language, we employ a two-stage training paradigm to finetune LLMs on high-quality and diverse data, thereby resulting in better performance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our approach outperforms a range of state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <title>Generating with Fairness: A Modality-Diffused Counterfactual Framework for Incomplete Multimodal Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incomplete scenario is a prevalent, practical, yet challenging setting in Multimodal Recommendations (MMRec), where some item modalities are missing due to various factors. Recently, a few efforts have sought to improve the recommendation accuracy by exploring generic structures from incomplete data. However, two significant gaps persist: 1) the difficulty in accurately generating missing data due to the limited ability to capture modality distributions; and 2) the critical but overlooked visibility bias, where items with missing modalities are more likely to be disregarded due to the prioritization of items' multimodal data over user preference alignment. This bias raises serious concerns about the fair treatment of items. To bridge these two gaps, we propose a novel Modality-Diffused Counterfactual (MoDiCF) framework for incomplete multimodal recommendations. MoDiCF features two key modules: a novel modality-diffused data completion module and a new counterfactual multimodal recommendation module. The former, equipped with a particularly designed multimodal generative framework, accurately generates and iteratively refines missing data from learned modality-specific distribution spaces. The latter, grounded in the causal perspective, effectively mitigates the negative causal effects of visibility bias and thus assures fairness in recommendations. Both modules work collaboratively to address the two aforementioned significant gaps for generating more accurate and fair results. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MoDiCF in terms of both recommendation accuracy and fairness</description>

      <title>A Contrastive Framework with User, Item and Review Alignment for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning effective latent representations for users and items is the cornerstone of recommender systems. Traditional approaches rely on user-item interaction data to map users and items into a shared latent space, but the sparsity of interactions often poses challenges. While leveraging user reviews could mitigate this sparsity, existing review-aware recommendation models often exhibit two key limitations. First, they typically rely on reviews as additional features, but reviews are not universal, with many users and items lacking them. Second, such approaches do not integrate reviews into the user-item space, leading to potential divergence or inconsistency among user, item, and review representations. To overcome these limitations, our work introduces a Review-centric Contrastive Alignment Framework for Recommendation (ReCAFR), which incorporates reviews into the core learning process, ensuring alignment among user, item, and review representations within a unified space. Specifically, we leverage two self-supervised contrastive strategies that not only exploit review-based augmentation to alleviate sparsity, but also align the tripartite representations to enhance robustness. Empirical studies on public benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ReCAFR.</description>

      <title>Less is More: Information Bottleneck Denoised Multimedia Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empowered by semantic-rich content information, multimedia recommendation has emerged as a potent personalized technique. Current endeavors center around harnessing multimedia content to refine item representation or uncovering latent item-item structures based on modality similarity. Despite the effectiveness, we posit that these methods are usually suboptimal due to the introduction of irrelevant multimedia features into recommendation tasks. This stems from the fact that generic multimedia feature extractors, while well-designed for domain-specific tasks, can inadvertently introduce task-irrelevant features, leading to potential misguidance of recommenders. In this work, we propose a denoised multimedia recommendation paradigm via the Information Bottleneck principle (IB). Specifically, we propose a novel Information Bottleneck denoised Multimedia Recommendation (IBMRec) model to tackle the irrelevant feature issue. IBMRec removes task-irrelevant features from both feature and item-item structure perspectives, which are implemented by two-level IB learning modules: feature-level (FIB) and graph-level (GIB). In particular, FIB focuses on learning the minimal yet sufficient multimedia features. This is achieved by maximizing the mutual information between multimedia representation and recommendation tasks, while concurrently minimizing it between multimedia representation and pre-trained multimedia features. Furthermore, GIB is designed to learn the robust item-item graph structure, it refines the item-item graph based on preference affinity, then minimizes the mutual information between the original graph and the refined one. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, showcasing high performance, and applicability to various multimedia recommenders.</description>

      <title>DataPro -- A Standardized Data Understanding and Processing Procedure: A Case Study of an Eco-Driving Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic pipeline for data processing and knowledge discovery is essential to extracting knowledge from big data and making recommendations for operational decision-making. The CRISP-DM model is the de-facto standard for developing data-mining projects in practice. However, advancements in data processing technologies require enhancements to this framework. This paper presents the DataPro (a standardized data understanding and processing procedure) model, which extends CRISP-DM and emphasizes the link between data scientists and stakeholders by adding the "technical understanding" and "implementation" phases. Firstly, the "technical understanding" phase aligns business demands with technical requirements, ensuring the technical team's accurate comprehension of business goals. Next, the "implementation" phase focuses on the practical application of developed data science models, ensuring theoretical models are effectively applied in business contexts. Furthermore, clearly defining roles and responsibilities in each phase enhances management and communication among all participants. Afterward, a case study on an eco-driving data science project for fuel efficiency analysis in the Danish public transportation sector illustrates the application of the DataPro model. By following the proposed framework, the project identified key business objectives, translated them into technical requirements, and developed models that provided actionable insights for reducing fuel consumption. Finally, the model is evaluated qualitatively, demonstrating its superiority over other data science procedures.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Leaky Private Information Retrieval Codes to Achieve ${O}(\log K)$ Leakage Ratio Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of leaky private information retrieval (L-PIR), where the amount of privacy leakage is measured by the pure differential privacy parameter, referred to as the leakage ratio exponent. Unlike the previous L-PIR scheme proposed by Samy et al., which only adjusted the probability allocation to the clean (low-cost) retrieval pattern, we optimize the probabilities assigned to all the retrieval patterns jointly. It is demonstrated that the optimal retrieval pattern probability distribution is quite sophisticated and has a layered structure: the retrieval patterns associated with the random key values of lower Hamming weights should be assigned higher probabilities. This new scheme provides a significant improvement, leading to an ${O}(\log K)$ leakage ratio exponent with fixed download cost $D$ and number of servers $N$, in contrast to the previous art that only achieves a $\Theta(K)$ exponent, where $K$ is the number of messages.</description>

      <title>Making Software FAIR: A machine-assisted workflow for the research software lifecycle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key issue hindering discoverability, attribution and reusability of open research software is that its existence often remains hidden within the manuscript of research papers. For these resources to become first-class bibliographic records, they first need to be identified and subsequently registered with persistent identifiers (PIDs) to be made FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable). To this day, much open research software fails to meet FAIR principles and software resources are mostly not explicitly linked from the manuscripts that introduced them or used them. SoFAIR is a 2-year international project (2024-2025) which proposes a solution to the above problem realised over the content available through the global network of open repositories. SoFAIR will extend the capabilities of widely used open scholarly infrastructures (CORE, Software Heritage, HAL) and tools (GROBID) operated by the consortium partners, delivering and deploying an effective solution for the management of the research software lifecycle, including: 1) ML-assisted identification of research software assets from within the manuscripts of scholarly papers, 2) validation of the identified assets by authors, 3) registration of software assets with PIDs and their archival.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the successful application of Off-Policy Evaluation (OPE) to accelerate recommender system development and optimization at Adyen, a global leader in financial payment processing. Facing the limitations of traditional A/B testing, which proved slow, costly, and often inconclusive, we integrated OPE to enable rapid evaluation of new recommender system variants using historical data. Our analysis, conducted on a billion-scale dataset of transactions, reveals a strong correlation between OPE estimates and online A/B test results, projecting an incremental 9--54 million transactions over a six-month period. We explore the practical challenges and trade-offs associated with deploying OPE in a high-volume production environment, including leveraging exploration traffic for data collection, mitigating variance in importance sampling, and ensuring scalability through the use of Apache Spark. By benchmarking various OPE estimators, we provide guidance on their effectiveness and integration into the decision-making systems for large-scale industrial payment systems.</description>

      <title>Lossless Compression of Vector IDs for Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximate nearest neighbor search for vectors relies on indexes that are most often accessed from RAM. Therefore, storage is the factor limiting the size of the database that can be served from a machine. Lossy vector compression, i.e., embedding quantization, has been applied extensively to reduce the size of indexes. However, for inverted file and graph-based indices, auxiliary data such as vector ids and links (edges) can represent most of the storage cost. We introduce and evaluate lossless compression schemes for these cases. These approaches are based on asymmetric numeral systems or wavelet trees that exploit the fact that the ordering of ids is irrelevant within the data structures. In some settings, we are able to compress the vector ids by a factor 7, with no impact on accuracy or search runtime. On billion-scale datasets, this results in a reduction of 30% of the index size. Furthermore, we show that for some datasets, these methods can also compress the quantized vector codes losslessly, by exploiting sub-optimalities in the original quantization algorithm. The source code for our approach available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/vector_db_id_compression.</description>

      <title>A Resource-Efficient Training Framework for Remote Sensing Text--Image Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote sensing text--image retrieval (RSTIR) aims to retrieve the matched remote sensing (RS) images from the database according to the descriptive text. Recently, the rapid development of large visual-language pre-training models provides new insights for RSTIR. Nevertheless, as the complexity of models grows in RSTIR, the previous studies suffer from suboptimal resource efficiency during transfer learning. To address this issue, we propose a computation and memory-efficient retrieval (CMER) framework for RSTIR. To reduce the training memory consumption, we propose the Focus-Adapter module, which adopts a side branch structure. Its focus layer suppresses the interference of background pixels for small targets. Simultaneously, to enhance data efficacy, we regard the RS scene category as the metadata and design a concise augmentation technique. The scene label augmentation leverages the prior knowledge from land cover categories and shrinks the search space. We propose the negative sample recycling strategy to make the negative sample pool decoupled from the mini-batch size. It improves the generalization performance without introducing additional encoders. We have conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on public datasets and expanded the benchmark with some advanced approaches, which demonstrates the competitiveness of the proposed CMER. Compared with the recent advanced methods, the overall retrieval performance of CMER is 2%--5% higher on RSITMD. Moreover, our proposed method reduces memory consumption by 49% and has a 1.4x data throughput during training. The code of the CMER and the dataset will be released at https://github.com/ZhangWeihang99/CMER.</description>

      <title>LD-DETR: Loop Decoder DEtection TRansformer for Video Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection aim to find corresponding content in the video based on a text query. Existing models usually first use contrastive learning methods to align video and text features, then fuse and extract multimodal information, and finally use a Transformer Decoder to decode multimodal information. However, existing methods face several issues: (1) Overlapping semantic information between different samples in the dataset hinders the model's multimodal aligning performance; (2) Existing models are not able to efficiently extract local features of the video; (3) The Transformer Decoder used by the existing model cannot adequately decode multimodal features. To address the above issues, we proposed the LD-DETR model for Video Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks. Specifically, we first distilled the similarity matrix into the identity matrix to mitigate the impact of overlapping semantic information. Then, we designed a method that enables convolutional layers to extract multimodal local features more efficiently. Finally, we fed the output of the Transformer Decoder back into itself to adequately decode multimodal information. We evaluated LD-DETR on four public benchmarks and conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our approach. Our model outperforms the State-Of-The-Art models on QVHighlight, Charades-STA and TACoS datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/qingchen239/ld-detr.</description>

      <title>LegalGuardian: A Privacy-Preserving Framework for Secure Integration of Large Language Models in Legal Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise for advancing legal practice by automating complex tasks and improving access to justice. However, their adoption is limited by concerns over client confidentiality, especially when lawyers include sensitive Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in prompts, risking unauthorized data exposure. To mitigate this, we introduce LegalGuardian, a lightweight, privacy-preserving framework tailored for lawyers using LLM-based tools. LegalGuardian employs Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques and local LLMs to mask and unmask confidential PII within prompts, safeguarding sensitive data before any external interaction. We detail its development and assess its effectiveness using a synthetic prompt library in immigration law scenarios. Comparing traditional NER models with one-shot prompted local LLM, we find that LegalGuardian achieves a F1-score of 93% with GLiNER and 97% with Qwen2.5-14B in PII detection. Semantic similarity analysis confirms that the framework maintains high fidelity in outputs, ensuring robust utility of LLM-based tools. Our findings indicate that legal professionals can harness advanced AI technologies without compromising client confidentiality or the quality of legal documents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video Copy Detection (VCD) plays a crucial role in copyright protection and content verification by identifying duplicates and near-duplicates in large-scale video databases. The META AI Challenge on video copy detection provided a benchmark for evaluating state-of-the-art methods, with the Dual-level detection approach emerging as a winning solution. This method integrates Video Editing Detection and Frame Scene Detection to handle adversarial transformations and large datasets efficiently. However, our analysis reveals significant limitations in the VED component, particularly in its ability to handle exact copies. Moreover, Dual-level detection shows vulnerability to temporal attacks. To address it, we propose an improved frame selection strategy based on local maxima of interframe differences, which enhances robustness against adversarial temporal modifications while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our method achieves an increase of 1.4 to 5.8 times in efficiency over the standard 1 FPS approach. Compared to Dual-level detection method, our approach maintains comparable micro-average precision ($\mu$AP) while also demonstrating improved robustness against temporal attacks. Given 56\% reduced representation size and the inference time of more than 2 times faster, our approach is more suitable to real-world resource restriction.</description>

      <title>Verifying Cross-modal Entity Consistency in News using Vision-language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The web has become a crucial source of information, but it is also used to spread disinformation, often conveyed through multiple modalities like images and text. The identification of inconsistent cross-modal information, in particular entities such as persons, locations, and events, is critical to detect disinformation. Previous works either identify out-of-context disinformation by assessing the consistency of images to the whole document, neglecting relations of individual entities, or focus on generic entities that are not relevant to news. So far, only few approaches have addressed the task of validating entity consistency between images and text in news. However, the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has not been explored yet. In this paper, we propose an LVLM-based framework for verifying Cross-modal Entity Consistency~(LVLM4CEC), to assess whether persons, locations and events in news articles are consistent across both modalities. We suggest effective prompting strategies for LVLMs for entity verification that leverage reference images crawled from web. Moreover, we extend three existing datasets for the task of entity verification in news providing manual ground-truth data. Our results show the potential of LVLMs for automating cross-modal entity verification, showing improved accuracy in identifying persons and events when using evidence images. Moreover, our method outperforms a baseline for location and event verification in documents. The datasets and source code are available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/TIBHannover/LVLM4CEC}.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Estimation in the Real World: A Study on Music Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any data annotation for subjective tasks shows potential variations between individuals. This is particularly true for annotations of emotional responses to musical stimuli. While older approaches to music emotion recognition systems frequently addressed this uncertainty problem through probabilistic modeling, modern systems based on neural networks tend to ignore the variability and focus only on predicting central tendencies of human subjective responses. In this work, we explore several methods for estimating not only the central tendencies of the subjective responses to a musical stimulus, but also for estimating the uncertainty associated with these responses. In particular, we investigate probabilistic loss functions and inference-time random sampling. Experimental results indicate that while the modeling of the central tendencies is achievable, modeling of the uncertainty in subjective responses proves significantly more challenging with currently available approaches even when empirical estimates of variations in the responses are available.</description>

Abstract: Biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) have emerged as powerful tools for organizing and leveraging the vast and complex data found across the biomedical field. Yet, current reviews of BKGs often limit their scope to specific domains or methods, overlooking the broader landscape and the rapid technological progress reshaping it. In this survey, we address this gap by offering a systematic review of BKGs from three core perspectives: domains, tasks, and applications. We begin by examining how BKGs are constructed from diverse data sources, including molecular interactions, pharmacological datasets, and clinical records. Next, we discuss the essential tasks enabled by BKGs, focusing on knowledge management, retrieval, reasoning, and interpretation. Finally, we highlight real-world applications in precision medicine, drug discovery, and scientific research, illustrating the translational impact of BKGs across multiple sectors. By synthesizing these perspectives into a unified framework, this survey not only clarifies the current state of BKG research but also establishes a foundation for future exploration, enabling both innovative methodological advances and practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Evolution of ESG-focused DLT Research: An NLP Analysis of the Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging technologies, such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), face growing scrutiny for their environmental impact, especially when it comes to the energy use of the Proof of Work (PoW) consensus mechanism and broader Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) considerations. Yet, much of the existing systematic literature reviews of DLT rely on the limited analyses of citations, abstracts, and keywords, failing to fully capture the field's complexity and ESG concerns.
  To address these challenges, we analyze the full text of 24,539 publications using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with our manually labeled Named Entity Recognition (NER) dataset of 39,427 entities for DLT. This method identifies 505 key publications connecting DLT and ESG domains, providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the field.
  Our combined NLP and temporal graph analysis reveals critical trends in DLT evolution and ESG impacts, including the pivotal role of research in cryptography and peer-to-peer networks, Bitcoin's persistent impact on research and environmental concerns (a "Lindy effect"), Ethereum's influence on Proof of Stake (PoS) and smart contracts adoption, and a shift towards energy-efficient consensus mechanisms. Our contributions include the first DLT-specific NER dataset, addressing the scarcity of high-quality labeled NLP data for blockchain research; a methodology integrating NLP and temporal graph analysis for interdisciplinary literature review at large scale; and the first NLP-driven DLT literature review emphasizing ESG aspects.</description>

      <title>Positional encoding is not the same as context: A study on positional encoding for sequential recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming media and e-commerce has driven advancements in recommendation systems, particularly Sequential Recommendation Systems (SRS). These systems employ users' interaction histories to predict future preferences. While recent research has focused on architectural innovations like transformer blocks and feature extraction, positional encodings, crucial for capturing temporal patterns, have received less attention. These encodings are often conflated with contextual, such as the temporal footprint, which previous works tend to treat as interchangeable with positional information. This paper highlights the critical distinction between temporal footprint and positional encodings, demonstrating that the latter offers unique relational cues between items, which the temporal footprint alone cannot provide. Through extensive experimentation on eight Amazon datasets and subsets, we assess the impact of various encodings on performance metrics and training stability. We introduce new positional encodings and investigate integration strategies that improve both metrics and stability, surpassing state-of-the-art results at the time of this work's initial preprint. Importantly, we demonstrate that selecting the appropriate encoding is not only key to better performance but also essential for building robust, reliable SRS models.</description>

      <title>NoteLLM-2: Multimodal Large Representation Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in text understanding and embedding tasks. However, their potential in multimodal representation, particularly for item-to-item (I2I) recommendations, remains underexplored. While leveraging existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for such tasks is promising, challenges arise due to their delayed release compared to corresponding LLMs and the inefficiency in representation tasks. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end fine-tuning method that customizes the integration of any existing LLMs and vision encoders for efficient multimodal representation. Preliminary experiments revealed that fine-tuned LLMs often neglect image content. To counteract this, we propose NoteLLM-2, a novel framework that enhances visual information. Specifically, we propose two approaches: first, a prompt-based method that segregates visual and textual content, employing a multimodal In-Context Learning strategy to balance focus across modalities; second, a late fusion technique that directly integrates visual information into the final representations. Extensive experiments, both online and offline, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Code is available at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/NoteLLM.</description>

      <title>An Investigation of Prompt Variations for Zero-shot LLM-based Rankers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a systematic understanding of the impact of specific components and wordings used in prompts on the effectiveness of rankers based on zero-shot Large Language Models (LLMs). Several zero-shot ranking methods based on LLMs have recently been proposed. Among many aspects, methods differ across (1) the ranking algorithm they implement, e.g., pointwise vs. listwise, (2) the backbone LLMs used, e.g., GPT3.5 vs. FLAN-T5, (3) the components and wording used in prompts, e.g., the use or not of role-definition (role-playing) and the actual words used to express this. It is currently unclear whether performance differences are due to the underlying ranking algorithm, or because of spurious factors such as better choice of words used in prompts. This confusion risks to undermine future research. Through our large-scale experimentation and analysis, we find that ranking algorithms do contribute to differences between methods for zero-shot LLM ranking. However, so do the LLM backbones -- but even more importantly, the choice of prompt components and wordings affect the ranking. In fact, in our experiments, we find that, at times, these latter elements have more impact on the ranker's effectiveness than the actual ranking algorithms, and that differences among ranking methods become more blurred when prompt variations are considered.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Performance Benchmarking on Lightweight Embedding-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17335v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the creation of the Web, recommender systems (RSs) have been an indispensable mechanism in information filtering. State-of-the-art RSs primarily depend on categorical features, which ecoded by embedding vectors, resulting in excessively large embedding tables. To prevent over-parameterized embedding tables from harming scalability, both academia and industry have seen increasing efforts in compressing RS embeddings. However, despite the prosperity of lightweight embedding-based RSs (LERSs), a wide diversity is seen in evaluation protocols, resulting in obstacles when relating LERS performance to real-world usability. Moreover, despite the common goal of lightweight embeddings, LERSs are evaluated with a single choice between the two main recommendation tasks -- collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This lack of discussions on cross-task transferability hinders the development of unified, more scalable solutions. Motivated by these issues, this study investigates various LERSs' performance, efficiency, and cross-task transferability via a thorough benchmarking process. Additionally, we propose an efficient embedding compression method using magnitude pruning, which is an easy-to-deploy yet highly competitive baseline that outperforms various complex LERSs. Our study reveals the distinct performance of LERSs across the two tasks, shedding light on their effectiveness and generalizability. To support edge-based recommendations, we tested all LERSs on a Raspberry Pi 4, where the efficiency bottleneck is exposed. Finally, we conclude this paper with critical summaries of LERS performance, model selection suggestions, and underexplored challenges around LERSs for future research. To encourage future research, we publish source codes and artifacts at \href{this link}{https://github.com/chenxing1999/recsys-benchmark}.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Graph Diffusion with Applications in Personalized PageRanks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph diffusion, which iteratively propagates real-valued substances among the graph, is used in numerous graph/network-involved applications. However, releasing diffusion vectors may reveal sensitive linking information in the data such as transaction information in financial network data. However, protecting the privacy of graph data is challenging due to its interconnected nature. This work proposes a novel graph diffusion framework with edge-level differential privacy guarantees by using noisy diffusion iterates. The algorithm injects Laplace noise per diffusion iteration and adopts a degree-based thresholding function to mitigate the high sensitivity induced by low-degree nodes. Our privacy loss analysis is based on Privacy Amplification by Iteration (PABI), which to our best knowledge, is the first effort that analyzes PABI with Laplace noise and provides relevant applications. We also introduce a novel Infinity-Wasserstein distance tracking method, which tightens the analysis of privacy leakage and makes PABI more applicable in practice. We evaluate this framework by applying it to Personalized Pagerank computation for ranking tasks. Experiments on real-world network data demonstrate the superiority of our method under stringent privacy conditions.</description>

      <title>Redefining POI Popularity: Integrating User Preferences and Recency for Enhanced Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is to predict users' immediate future movements based on their previous records and present circumstances. Popularity is considered as one of the primary deciding factors for selecting the next place to visit. Existing approaches mainly focused on the number of check-ins to model the popularity of a POI. However, not enough attention is paid to the temporal impact or number of people check-ins for a particular POI. Thus, to prioritize more on recent check-ins, we propose recency-oriented definition of POI's popularity by considering the temporal effect of the POIs, the number of check-ins, as well as the number of users who registered in those check-ins. Our experimental results on real dataset show the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Look Into News Avoidance Through AWRS: An Avoidance-Aware Recommender System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, journalists have expressed concerns about the increasing trend of news article avoidance, especially within specific domains. This issue has been exacerbated by the rise of recommender systems. Our research indicates that recommender systems should consider avoidance as a fundamental factor. We argue that news articles can be characterized by three principal elements: exposure, relevance, and avoidance, all of which are closely interconnected. To address these challenges, we introduce AWRS, an Avoidance-Aware Recommender System. This framework incorporates avoidance awareness when recommending news, based on the premise that news article avoidance conveys significant information about user preferences. Evaluation results on three news datasets in different languages (English, Norwegian, and Japanese) demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Customizing Language Models with Instance-wise LoRA for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10159v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation systems predict the next interaction item based on users' past interactions, aligning recommendations with individual preferences. Leveraging the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge comprehension and reasoning, recent approaches are eager to apply LLMs to sequential recommendation. A common paradigm is converting user behavior sequences into instruction data, and fine-tuning the LLM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA). However, the uniform application of LoRA across diverse user behaviors is insufficient to capture individual variability, resulting in negative transfer between disparate sequences. To address these challenges, we propose Instance-wise LoRA (iLoRA). We innovatively treat the sequential recommendation task as a form of multi-task learning, integrating LoRA with the Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. This approach encourages different experts to capture various aspects of user behavior. Additionally, we introduce a sequence representation guided gate function that generates customized expert participation weights for each user sequence, which allows dynamic parameter adjustment for instance-wise recommendations. In sequential recommendation, iLoRA achieves an average relative improvement of 11.4\% over basic LoRA in the hit ratio metric, with less than a 1\% relative increase in trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of iLoRA, highlighting its superior performance compared to existing methods in mitigating negative transfer and improving recommendation accuracy. Our data and code are available at https://github.com/AkaliKong/iLoRA.</description>

      <title>On Explaining Recommendations with Large Language Models: A Review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and ChatGPT, has opened new opportunities for enhancing recommender systems through improved explainability. This paper provides a systematic literature review focused on leveraging LLMs to generate explanations for recommendations -- a critical aspect for fostering transparency and user trust. We conducted a comprehensive search within the ACM Guide to Computing Literature, covering publications from the launch of ChatGPT (November 2022) to the present (November 2024). Our search yielded 232 articles, but after applying inclusion criteria, only six were identified as directly addressing the use of LLMs in explaining recommendations. This scarcity highlights that, despite the rise of LLMs, their application in explainable recommender systems is still in an early stage. We analyze these select studies to understand current methodologies, identify challenges, and suggest directions for future research. Our findings underscore the potential of LLMs improving explanations of recommender systems and encourage the development of more transparent and user-centric recommendation explanation solutions.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Representation for Interactive Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive Recommendation (IR) has gained significant attention recently for its capability to quickly capture dynamic interest and optimize both short and long term objectives. IR agents are typically implemented through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), because DRL is inherently compatible with the dynamic nature of IR. However, DRL is currently not perfect for IR. Due to the large action space and sample inefficiency problem, training DRL recommender agents is challenging. The key point is that useful features cannot be extracted as high-quality representations for the recommender agent to optimize its policy. To tackle this problem, we propose Contrastive Representation for Interactive Recommendation (CRIR). CRIR efficiently extracts latent, high-level preference ranking features from explicit interaction, and leverages the features to enhance users' representation. Specifically, the CRIR provides representation through one representation network, and refines it through our proposed Preference Ranking Contrastive Learning (PRCL). The key insight of PRCL is that it can perform contrastive learning without relying on computations involving high-level representations or large potential action sets. Furthermore, we also propose a data exploiting mechanism and an agent training mechanism to better adapt CRIR to the DRL backbone. Extensive experiments have been carried out to show our method's superior improvement on the sample efficiency while training an DRL-based IR agent.</description>

      <title>FlipedRAG: Black-Box Opinion Manipulation Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses hallucination and real-time constraints by dynamically retrieving relevant information from a knowledge database to supplement the LLMs' input. When presented with a query, RAG selects the most semantically similar texts from its knowledge bases and uses them as context for the LLMs to generate more accurate responses. RAG also creates a new attack surface, especially since RAG databases are frequently sourced from public domains. While existing studies have predominantly focused on optimizing RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging research has begun addressing the security concerns associated with RAG. However, these works have some limitations, typically focusing on either white-box methodologies or heuristic-based black-box attacks. Furthermore, prior research has mainly targeted simple factoid question answering, which is neither practically challenging nor resistant to correction. In this paper, we unveil a more realistic and threatening scenario: opinion manipulation for controversial topics against RAG. Particularly, we propose a novel RAG black-box attack method, termed FlipedRAG, which is transfer-based. By leveraging instruction engineering, we obtain partial retrieval model outputs from black-box RAG system, facilitating the training of surrogate models to enhance the effectiveness of opinion manipulation attack. Extensive experimental results confirms that our approach significantly enhances the average success rate of opinion manipulation by 16.7%. It achieves an average of a 50% directional change in the opinion polarity of RAG responses across four themes. Additionally, it induces a 20% shift in user cognition. Furthermore, we discuss the efficacy of potential defense mechanisms and conclude that they are insufficient in mitigating this type of attack, highlighting the urgent need to develop novel defensive strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present S+t-SNE, an adaptation of the t-SNE algorithm designed to handle infinite data streams. The core idea behind S+t-SNE is to update the t-SNE embedding incrementally as new data arrives, ensuring scalability and adaptability to handle streaming scenarios. By selecting the most important points at each step, the algorithm ensures scalability while keeping informative visualisations. By employing a blind method for drift management, the algorithm adjusts the embedding space, which facilitates the visualisation of evolving data dynamics. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of S+t-SNE, whilst highlighting its ability to capture patterns in a streaming scenario. We hope our approach offers researchers and practitioners a real-time tool for understanding and interpreting high-dimensional data.</description>

Abstract: Multi-objective learning aims to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously with a single model for achieving a balanced and satisfying performance on all these objectives. However, it suffers from the difficulty to formalize and conduct the exact learning process, especially considering the possible conflicts between objectives. Existing approaches explores to resolve this primarily in two directions: adapting modeling structure or constraining optimization with certain assumptions. However, a primary issue is that their presuppositions for the effectiveness of their design are insufficient to guarantee the its generality in real-world applications. What's worse, the high space and computation complexity issue makes it even harder to apply them in large-scale, complicated environment such as the recommender systems. To address these issues, we propose a general framework for automatically learning to achieve multiple objectives based on the existing sequential data. We apply the goal-conditioned supervised learning (GCSL) framework to multi-objective learning, by extending the definition of goals from one-dimensional scalar to multi-dimensional vector that perfectly disentangle the representation of different objectives. Meanwhile, GCSL enables the model to simultaneously learn to achieve each objective in a concise supervised learning way, simply guided by existing sequences in the offline data. No additional constraint, special model structure design, or complex optimization algorithms are further required. Apart from that, we formally analyze the property of the goals in GCSL and then firstly propose a goal-generation framework to gain achievable and reasonable goals for inference. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world recommendation datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method and exploring the feasibility of the goal-generation strategies in GCSL.</description>

      <title>LLM-MedQA: Enhancing Medical Question Answering through Case Studies in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05464</link>

Abstract: Accurate and efficient question-answering systems are essential for delivering high-quality patient care in the medical field. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides across various domains, they continue to face significant challenges in medical question answering, particularly in understanding domain-specific terminologies and performing complex reasoning. These limitations undermine their effectiveness in critical medical applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach incorporating similar case generation within a multi-agent medical question-answering (MedQA) system. Specifically, we leverage the Llama3.1:70B model, a state-of-the-art LLM, in a multi-agent architecture to enhance performance on the MedQA dataset using zero-shot learning. Our method capitalizes on the model's inherent medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities, eliminating the need for additional training data. Experimental results show substantial performance gains over existing benchmark models, with improvements of 7% in both accuracy and F1-score across various medical QA tasks. Furthermore, we examine the model's interpretability and reliability in addressing complex medical queries. This research not only offers a robust solution for medical question answering but also establishes a foundation for broader applications of LLMs in the medical domain.</description>
