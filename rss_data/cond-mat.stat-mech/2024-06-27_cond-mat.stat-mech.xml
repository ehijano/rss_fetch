      <title>Symmetry classes of classical stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic symmetry classification of the Markov generators of classical stochastic processes. Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time thermodynamic speed limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a fundamental thermodynamic principle, speed limits reveal the lower bound of entropy production (EP) required for a system to transition from a given initial state to a final state. While various speed limits have been developed for continuous-time Markov processes, their application to discrete-time Markov chains remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the speed limits in discrete-time Markov chains, focusing on two types of EP commonly used to measure the irreversibility of a discrete-time process: time-reversed EP and time-backward EP. We find that time-reversed EP satisfies the speed limit for the continuous-time Markov processes, whereas time-backward EP does not. Additionally, for time-reversed EP, we derive practical speed limits applicable to systems driven by cyclic protocols or with unidirectional transitions, where conventional speed limits become meaningless or invalid. We show that these relations also hold for continuous-time Markov processes by taking the time-continuum limit of our results. Finally, we validate our findings through several examples.</description>

      <title>A new quadrature for the generalized hydrodynamics equation and absence of shocks in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional fluids, it is well known that Euler-scale equations are plagued by ambiguities and instabilities. Smooth initial conditions may develop shocks, and weak solutions, such as for domain wall initial conditions (the paradigmatic Riemann problem of hydrodynamics), are not unique. The absence of shock formation experimentally observed in quasi-one-dimensional cold-atomic gases, which are described by the Lieb-Liniger model, provides perhaps the strongest pointer to a modification of the hydrodynamic equation due to integrability. Generalised hydrodynamics (GHD) is the required hydrodynamic theory, taking into account the infinite number of conserved quantities afforded by integrability. We provide a new quadrature for the GHD equation -- a solution in terms of a Banach fixed-point problem where time has been explicitly integrated. In the Lieb-Liniger model, this allows us to rigorously show for the first time that, from a wide class of initial conditions including zero- and finite-entropy states, no shock may appear at all times, and weak solutions are unique and entropy-preserving. This extends known results for finite-component linearly-degenerate hydrodynamics, to the continuum of hydrodynamic modes present in GHD. The new quadrature is also an efficient solution tool, which, combined with recent hydrodynamic fluctuation theories, gives rise to new expressions for correlations in non-stationary states.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Combinatorial Self-Assembly through Kinetic-Trap Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like the letters in the alphabet forming words, reusing components of a heterogeneous mixture is an efficient strategy for assembling a large number of target structures. Examples range from synthetic DNA origami to proteins self-assembling into complexes. The standard self-assembly paradigm views target structures as free-energy minima of a mixture. While this is an appealing picture, at high speed structures may be kinetically trapped in local minima, reducing self-assembly accuracy. How then can high speed, high accuracy, and combinatorial usage of components coexist? We propose to reconcile these three concepts not by avoiding kinetic traps, but by exploiting them to encode target structures. This can be achieved by sculpting the kinetic pathways of the mixture, instead of its free-energy landscape. We formalize these ideas in a minimal toy model, for which we analytically estimate the encoding capacity and kinetic characteristics, in agreement with simulations. Our results may be generalized to other soft-matter systems capable of computation, such as liquid mixtures or elastic networks, and pave the way for high-dimensional information processing far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Numerical exploration of the bootstrap in spin chain models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the bootstrap approach (a dual optimization method to the variational approach) to one-dimensional spin chains, leveraging semidefinite programming to extract numerical results. We study how correlation functions in the ground state converge to their true values at and away from criticality and at relaxed optimality. We consider the transverse Ising model, the three state Potts model, and other non-integrable spin chains and investigate to what extent semidefinite methods can reliably extract numerical emergent physical data, including conformal central charges, correlation lengths and scaling dimensions. We demonstrate procedures to extract these data and show preliminary results in the various models considered. We compare to exact analytical results and to exact diagonalization when the system volume is small enough. When we attempt to go to the thermodynamic limit, the semidefinite numerical method with translation invariance imposed as a constraint finds the solution with periodic boundary conditions even if these have not been specified. This implies that the determination of all conformal data in correlators has to be handled at finite volume. Our investigation reveals that the approach has practical challenges. In particular, the correlation functions extracted from the optimal solution, which function as slack variables in the optimization, have convergence issues that suggest an underlying exponential complexity in the system size.</description>

      <title>Local/Short-range conformal field theories from long-range perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that by imposing the conformal Wald identity, one can extract conformal data of the corresponding short-range/local CFT from the long-range perturbation theory. We first apply this to the O(N) vector model. We demonstrate that by properly re-sum the perturbative series, one gets reasonable estimations of the critical exponents of the local/short-range CFTs. We then apply this method to study fermionic models with four-fermion interactions. In 2+1 dimensions, the model has the Gross-Neveu coupling and the Thirring coupling. We also consider a 4+1 dimensional theory with a generalized Thirring coupling.</description>

      <title>Connected Network Model for the Mechanical Loss of Amorphous Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical loss in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to thermally activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with a mechanical wave. Using atomistic modeling of amorphous silicon, we observe instead that the inherent structures that constitute the TLS form a sparsely connected network with thermodynamic pathways between states. An analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network is derived from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We show that the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct temperature and frequency profiles when compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many new avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials for applications in gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of quantum state transport in one-dimensional topological chain under nonadiabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a system is driven across a continuous phase transition, the density of topological defects demonstrates a power-law scaling behavior versus the quenching rate, as predicted by Kibble-Zurek mechanism. In this study, we generalized this idea and address the scaling of quantum state transport in a one-dimensional topological system subject to a linear drive through its topological quantum phase transition point. We illustrate the power-law dependencies of the quantum state's transport distance, width, and peak magnitude on the driving velocity. Crucially, the power-law exponents are distinct for the edge state and bulk state. Our results offer a novel perspective on quantum state transfer and enriches the field of Kibble-Zurek behaviors and nonadiabatic quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Gibbs Ensemble as the Unique Steady State in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct unique non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of Lindblad master equation characterized by a Gibbs ensemble $\rho_{\text{NESS}} \propto e^{-\beta \tilde{H}}$, where the effective Hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ consists only of $U(1)$ conserved charges of the original Hamiltonian. Specifically, when the original Hamiltonian has multiple charges, it is possible to couple them with bathes at different temperature respectively, but still leads to an equilibrium state. To access the Gibbs NESS, the jump operators need to be properly chosen to fulfill quantum detailed balance condition (qDBC). These jump operators are ladder operators for $\tilde{H}$ and jump process they generate form a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph (wDAG). By studying the XX model and Fredkin model, we showcase how the Gibbs state emerges as the unique steady state.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Spectral Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that noisy quantum dynamics exposed to weak measurements exhibit a spectral transition between gapless and gapped phases. To this end, we employ the Lyapunov spectrum obtained through singular values of a non-unitary matrix describing the dynamics. We discover that the gapless and gapped phases respectively correspond to the volume-law and area-law phases of the entanglement entropy for the dominant Lyapunov vector. This correspondence between the spectral gap and the scaling of entanglement offers an intriguing analogy with ground-state phase transitions. We also discuss some crucial differences from ground-state transitions, such as the scaling law of the entanglement and the exponentially small gaps. Furthermore, we show that the spectral transition leads to the transition of the timescale for the memory loss of initial states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the energy transfer process in the recently proposed sunburst quantum Ising model, which consists of two interacting integrable systems: a transverse Ising chain with a very small transverse field and a finite number of external isolated qubits. We show that in this model of the quantum battery, coupling between the battery and charger can be used to optimize the ergotropy, which is the maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from the battery. At the same time, maximum charging power increases with the coupling strength, allowing for the simultaneous optimization of both ergotropy and charging power in the strong coupling limit. Furthermore, we show that both ergotropy and charging power are independent of the initial state of the charger.</description>

Abstract: Given an appetizer bowl full of $N$ pistachios, what is the optimal size of the container -- neither too small, nor too big -- needed for accommodating the resulting $2N$ non-edible pistachio shells? Performing a simple experiment we find that, provided the shells are densely packed, such container needs only be slightly more than half ($\approx 0.57$) that of the original pistachio bowl. If loosely packed this number increases to $\approx 0.73$. Our results are discussed in light of existing literature on packing ellipsoids and spherical caps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai, to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, and to exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Surprisingly, there is no simple analytical theory for the viscosity of relativistic fluids that is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic gases as one of its analytical limits. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement of viscosity, which is a fundamental relativistic effect that has been overlooked so far. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with previous estimates for the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wave turbulence in systems with two special properties: a large number of fields (large $N$) and a nonlinear interaction that is strongly local in momentum space. The first property allows us to find the kinetic equation at all interaction strengths -- both weak and strong, at leading order in $1/N$. The second allows us to turn the kinetic equation -- an integral equation -- into a differential equation. We find stationary solutions for the occupation number as a function of wave number, valid at all scales. As expected, on the weak coupling end the solutions asymptote to Kolmogorov-Zakharov scaling. On the strong coupling end, they asymptote to either the widely conjectured generalized Phillips spectrum (also known as critical balance), or a Kolmogorov-like scaling exponent.</description>

      <title>Mesoscopic Impurities in Generalized Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study impurities in integrable models from the viewpoint of generalized hydrodynamics (GHD). An impurity can be thought of as a boundary condition for the GHD equation, relating the state on the left and right side. We find that in interacting models it is not possible to disentangle incoming and outgoing states, which means that it is not possible to think of scattering as a mapping which maps the incoming state to the outgoing state. We then introduce a novel class of impurities, dubbed mesoscopic impurities, whose spatial size is mesoscopic (i.e.\ their size $L_{\mathrm{micro}} \ll L_{\mathrm{imp}} \ll L$ is much larger than the microscopic length scale $L_{\mathrm{micro}}$, but much smaller than the macroscopic scale $L$). Due to their large size it is possible to describe mesoscopic impurities via GHD. This simplification allows one to study these impurities both analytically and numerically. These impurities show interesting non-perturbative scattering behavior, for instance non-uniqueness of solutions and a non-analytic dependence on the impurity strength. In models with one quasi-particle species and a scattering phase shift that depends on the difference of momenta only, we find that one can describe the scattering using an effective Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian is dressed due to the interaction between particles and satisfies a self consistency fixed point equation. On the example of the hard rods model we demonstrate how this fixed point equation can be used to find almost explicit solutions to the scattering problem by reducing it to a two-dimensional system of equations which can be solved numerically.</description>

      <title>Time crystal embodies chimeralike state in periodically driven quantum spin system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chimera states are a captivating occurrence in which a system composed of multiple interconnected elements exhibits a distinctive combination of synchronized and desynchronized behavior. The emergence of these states can be attributed to the complex interdependence between quantum entanglement and the delicate balance of interactions among system constituents. The emergence of discrete-time crystal (DTC) in typical many-body periodically driven systems occurs when there is a breaking of time translation symmetry. Coexisting coupled DTC and a ferromagnetic dynamically many-body localized (DMBL) phase at distinct regions have been investigated under the controlled spin rotational error of a disorder-free spin-1/2 chain for different types of spin-spin interactions. We contribute a novel approach for the emergence of the DTC-DMBL-chimeralike state, which is robust against external static fields in a periodically driven quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Simulation Method for Fractional Order Compartment Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our study focuses on fractional order compartment models derived from underlying physical stochastic processes, providing a more physically grounded approach compared to models that use the dynamical system approach by simply replacing integer-order derivatives with fractional order derivatives. In these models, inherent stochasticity becomes important, particularly when dealing with the dynamics of small populations far from the continuum limit of large particle numbers. The necessity for stochastic simulations arises from deviations of the mean states from those obtained from the governing equations in these scenarios. To address this, we introduce an exact stochastic simulation algorithm designed for fractional order compartment models, based on a semi-Markov process. We have considered a fractional order resusceptibility SIS model and a fractional order recovery SIR model as illustrative examples, highlighting significant disparities between deterministic and stochastic dynamics when the total population is small. Beyond its modeling applications, the algorithm presented serves as a versatile tool for solving fractional order differential equations via Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Symplectic quantization III: Non-relativistic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First of all we shortly illustrate how the symplectic quantization scheme [Gradenigo and Livi, 2021] can be applied to a relativistic field theory with self-interaction. Taking inspiration from the stochastic quantization method by Parisi and Wu, this procedure is based on considering explicitly the role of an intrinsic time variable, associated with quantum fluctuations. The major part of this paper is devoted to showing how the symplectic quantization scheme can be extended to the non-relativistic limit for a Schr\"odinger-like field. Then we also discuss how one can obtain from this non-relativistic theory a linear Schr\"odinger equation for the single-particle wavefunction. This further passage is based on a suitable coarse-graining procedure, when self-interaction terms can be neglected, with respect to interactions with any external field. In the Appendix we complete our survey on symplectic quantization by discussing how this scheme applies to a non-relativistic particle under the action of a generic external potential.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic bounds on generalized transport: From single-molecule to bulk observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00048v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the transport of any differentiable scalar observable in $d$-dimensional non-equilibrium systems is bounded from above by the total entropy production scaled by the amount the observation "stretches" microscopic coordinates. The result--a time-integrated generalized speed limit--reflects the thermodynamic cost of transport of observables, and places underdamped and overdamped stochastic dynamics on equal footing with deterministic motion. Our work allows for stochastic thermodynamics to make contact with bulk experiments, and fills an important gap in thermodynamic inference, since microscopic dynamics is, at least for short times, underdamped. Requiring only averages but not sample-to-sample fluctuations, the proven transport bound is practical and applicable not only to single-molecule but also bulk experiments where only averages are observed, which we demonstrate by examples. Our results may facilitate thermodynamic inference on molecular machines without an obvious directionality from bulk observations of transients probed, e.g.\ in time-resolved X-ray scattering.</description>

Abstract: Robert May famously used random matrix theory to predict that large, complex systems cannot admit stable fixed points. However, this general conclusion is not always supported by empirical observation: from cells to biomes, biological systems are large, complex and, often, stable. In this paper, we revisit May's argument in light of recent developments in both ecology and random matrix theory. Using a non-linear generalization of the competitive Lotka-Volterra model, we show that there are, in fact, two kinds of complexity-stability relationships in disordered dynamical systems: if self-interactions grow faster with density than cross-interactions, complexity is destabilizing; but if cross-interactions grow faster than self-interactions, complexity is stabilizing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an autocatalytic aggregation model in which the rate at which two clusters merge to form a cluster is controlled by the presence of a third "catalytic" cluster whose mass must equal to the mass of one of the reaction partners. The catalyst is unaffected by the joining event and is available to either participate in or catalyze subsequent reactions. This model is meant to mimic the self-replicating reactions that occur in models for the origin of life. We solve the kinetics of this catalytic coagulation model for the case of mass-independent rates and show that the total cluster density decays as $t^{-1/3}$, while the density of clusters of any fixed mass decays as $t^{-2/3}$. These behaviors contrast with the corresponding $t^{-1}$ and $t^{-2}$ scalings for classic aggregation. We extend our model to mass-dependent reaction rates, to situations where only "magic" mass clusters can catalyze reactions, and to include steady monomer input.</description>

      <title>Critical exponents of correlated percolation of sites not visited by a random walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a $d$-dimensional correlated percolation problem of sites {\em not} visited by a random walk on a hypercubic lattice $L^d$ for $d=3$, 4 and 5. The length of the random walk is ${\cal N}=uL^d$. Close to the critical value $u=u_c$, many geometrical properties of the problem can be described as powers (critical exponents) of $u_c-u$, such as $\beta$, which controls the strength of the spanning cluster, and $\gamma$, which characterizes the behavior of the mean finite cluster size $S$. We show that at $u_c$ the ratio between the mean mass of the largest cluster $M_1$ and the mass of the second largest cluster $M_2$ is independent of $L$ and can be used to find $u_c$. We calculate $\beta$ from the $L$-dependence of $M_2$ and $\gamma$ from the finite size scaling of $S$. The resulting exponent $\beta$ remains close to 1 in all dimensions. The exponent $\gamma$ decreases from $\approx 3.9$ in $d=3$ to $\approx1.9$ in $d=4$ and $\approx 1.3$ in $d=5$ towards $\gamma=1$ expected in $d=6$, which is close to $\gamma=4/(d-2)$.</description>

      <title>Conformable Derivative Approach to Granular Gases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proper modeling of complex systems requires innovative mathematical tools. In this sense, we sought to use deformed or fractal derivatives for studying the dynamics of systems, particularly those, such as granular gases, in which the description of the dynamics can be done by using the stretched exponential probability densities. In this contribution we draw up three results of this application of mathematical tools. The first result shows that when we use constraints with finite momentum and the principle of maximum entropy, the Kohlrausch--Williams--Watts function, known as stretched exponential, emerges naturally and in a simpler way, when compared to results in the literature. Next, we obtain generalized expressions for the Langevin equation, as well as its solutions for three different deformed derivatives, including those connected with nonaddictive statistical mechanics. The Haff's-like law for granular gases are obtained. Next, we calculate the partition function $Z$ for a granular gas system by building up the probability density in terms of the stretched exponential function. From this partition function, we determine the internal energy of the system as well as the specific heat, both dependent on temperature. The consistency with classical approach of kinetic theory for ideal gases was verified.</description>

      <title>Real-space model for activated processes in rejuvenation and memory behavior of glassy systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We offer an alternative real-space description, based purely on activated processes, for the understanding of relaxation dynamics in hierarchical landscapes. To this end, we use the cluster model, a coarse-grained lattice model of a jammed system, to analyze rejuvenation and memory effects during aging after a hard quench. In this model, neighboring particles on a lattice aggregate through local interactions into clusters that fragment with a probability based on their size. Despite the simplicity of the cluster model, it has been shown to reproduce salient observables of the aging dynamics in colloidal systems, such as those accounting for particle mobility and displacements. Here, we probe the model for more complex quench protocols and show that it exhibits rejuvenation and memory effects similar to those attributed to the complex hierarchical structure of a glassy energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling in far-from-equilibrium quantum systems: an equivalent differential approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in out-of-equilibrium closed quantum systems has significantly advanced the understanding of mechanisms behind their evolution towards thermalization. Notably, the concept of non-thermal fixed points (NTFPs) - responsible for the emergence of spatio-temporal universal scaling in far-from-equilibrium systems - has played a crucial role in both theoretical and experimental investigations. In this work, we introduce a differential equation that has the universal scaling associated with NTFPs as a solution. The advantage of working with a differential equation, rather than only with its solution, is that we can extract several insightful properties not necessarily present in the solution alone. How the differential equation is derived allows physical interpretation of the universal exponents in terms of the time dependence of the amplitude of the distributions and their momentum scaling. Employing two limiting cases of the equation, we determined the universal exponents related to the scaling using the distributions near just two momentum values. We established a solid agreement with previous investigations by validating this approach with three distinct physical systems. This consistency highlights the universal nature of scaling due to NTFPs and emphasizes the predictive capabilities of the proposed differential equation. Moreover, under specific conditions, the equation predicts a power-law related to the ratio of the two universal exponents, leading to implications concerning particle and energy transport. This suggests that the observed power-laws in far-from-equilibrium turbulent fluids could be related to the universal scaling due to NTFPs, potentially offering new insights into the study of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Dots: Range Expansions across Landscapes with Quenched Noise</title>

Abstract: When biological populations expand into new territory, the evolutionary outcomes can be strongly influenced by genetic drift, the random fluctuations in allele frequencies. Meanwhile, spatial variability in the environment can also significantly influence the competition between sub-populations vying for space. Little is known about the interplay of these intrinsic and extrinsic sources of noise in population dynamics: When does environmental heterogeneity dominate over genetic drift or vice versa, and what distinguishes their population genetics signatures? Here, in the context of neutral evolution, we examine the interplay between a population's intrinsic, demographic noise and an extrinsic, quenched random noise provided by a heterogeneous environment. Using a multi-species Eden model, we simulate a population expanding over a landscape with random variations in local growth rates and measure how this variability affects genealogical tree structure, and thus genetic diversity. We find that, for strong heterogeneity, the genetic makeup of the expansion front is to a great extent predetermined by the set of fastest paths through the environment. The landscape-dependent statistics of these optimal paths then supersede those of the population's intrinsic noise as the main determinant of evolutionary dynamics. Remarkably, the statistics for coalescence of genealogical lineages, derived from those deterministic paths, strongly resemble the statistics emerging from demographic noise alone in uniform landscapes. This cautions interpretations of coalescence statistics and raises new challenges for inferring past population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Duality analysis in symmetric group and its application to random tensor network model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ising model is the simplest to describe many-body effects in classical statistical mechanics. Duality analysis leads to a critical point under several assumptions. The Ising model itself has $Z(2)$ symmetry. The basis of the duality analysis is a nontrivial relationship between low and high-temperature expansions. However, the discrete Fourier transformation finds the hidden relationship automatically. The duality analysis can be naturally generalized into the case with the degrees of freedom with $Z(q)$ symmetry and random spin systems. We further obtain the duality in a series of permutation models in the present study by considering the symmetric group $S_q$ and its Fourier transformation. The permutation model in the symmetric group is closely related to the random quantum circuits and random tensor network model, often discussed in the context of quantum computing and the holographic principle, a property of string theories and quantum gravity. We provide a systematic way by our duality analysis to analyze the phase transition in these models.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the spectrum of field theories with non-integer $O(N)$ symmetry from quantum evanescence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify constraints in the energy spectra of quantum theories that have a global $O(N)$ symmetry, where $N$ is treated as a continuous parameter. We point out that a class of evanescent states fall out of the spectrum at integer values of $N$ in pairs, via an annihilation mechanism. This forces the energies of the states in such a pair to approach equality as $N$ approaches a certain integer, with both states disappearing at precisely integer $N$ and the point of would-be degeneracy. These constraints occur between different irreducible representations of the analytic continuation of $O(N)$ and hold non-perturbatively. We give examples in the spectra of the critical $O(N)$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17357v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$ that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of $d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d&gt;1$. The anomaly-nonseparability connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in $d=1$ we found an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also briefly discuss mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly.</description>
