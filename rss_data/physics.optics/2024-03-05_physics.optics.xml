      <title>Controlling radiative heat flow through cavity electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity electrodynamics is emerging as a promising tool to control chemical processes and quantum material properties. In this work we develop a formalism to describe the cavity mediated energy exchange between a material and its electromagnetic environment. We show that coplanar cavities can significantly affect the heat load on the sample if the cavity resonance lies within the frequency region where free-space radiative heat dominates, typically the mid-IR at ambient temperature, while spectral filtering is necessary for having an effect with lower frequency cavities.</description>

      <title>Dispersive-wave-agile optical frequency division</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable frequency stability of resonant systems in the optical domain (optical cavities and atomic transitions) can be harnessed at frequency scales accessible by electronics using optical frequency division. This capability is revolutionizing technologies spanning time keeping to high-performance electrical signal sources. A version of the technique called 2-point optical frequency division (2P-OFD) is proving advantageous for application to high-performance signal sources. In 2P-OFD, an optical cavity anchors two spectral endpoints defined by lines of a frequency comb. The comb need not be self-referenced, which greatly simplifies the system architecture and reduces power requirements. Here, a 2P-OFD microwave signal source is demonstrated with record-low phase noise using a microcomb. Key to this advance is a spectral endpoint defined by a frequency agile single-mode dispersive wave that is emitted by the microcomb soliton. Moreover, the system frequency reference is a compact all-solid-state optical cavity with a record Q-factor. The results advance integrable microcomb-based signal sources into the performance realm of much larger microwave sources.</description>

      <title>Two-photon absorption in silicon using real density matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon absorption in indirect gap semiconductors is an frequently encountered, but not well-understood phenomenon. To address this, the Real Density Matrix Approach is applied to describe two-photon absorption in silicon through the excitonic response to the interacting fields. This approach produces an analytical expression for the dispersion of the two-photon absorption coefficient for indirect-gap materials, and can be used to explain trends in reported experimental data for bulk silicon both old and new with minimal fitting.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of orbital angular momentum in spatiotemporal optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal Optical Vortices (STOVs) are structured electromagnetic fields propagating in free space with phase singularities in the space-time domain. Depending on the tilt of the helical phase front, STOVs can carry both longitudinal and transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM). Although STOVs have gained significant interest in the recent years, the current understanding is limited to the semi-classical picture. Here, we develop a quantum theory for STOVs with an arbitrary tilt, extending beyond the paraxial limit. We demonstrate that quantum STOV states, such as Fock and coherent twisted photon pulses, display non-vanishing longitudinal OAM fluctuations that are absent in conventional monochromatic twisted pulses. We show that these quantum fluctuations exhibit a unique texture, i.e. a spatial distribution which can be used to experimentally isolate these quantum effects. Our findings represent a step towards the exploitation of quantum effects of structured light for various applications such as OAM-based encoding protocols and platforms to explore novel light-matter interaction in 2D material systems.</description>

      <title>Octave-spanning Kerr soliton microcombs on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr solitons from optical microresonators, commonly referred to as soliton microcombs, have been developed for a broad range of applications, including precision measurement, optical frequency synthesis, and ultra-stable microwave and millimeter wave generation, all on a chip. An important goal for microcombs is self referencing, which requires octave-spanning bandwidths to detect and stabilize the comb carrier envelope offset frequency. Further, detection and locking of the comb spacings are often achieved using frequency division by electro-optic modulation. The thin-film lithium niobate photonic platform, with its low loss, strong second-order nonlinearity, and large Pockels effect, is ideally suited for these tasks. However, octave-spanning soliton microcombs are challenging to demonstrate on this platform, largely complicated by strong Raman effects hindering reliable fabrication of soliton devices. Here, we demonstrate entirely connected and octave-spanning soliton microcombs on thin-film lithium niobate. With appropriate control over microresonator free spectral range and dissipation spectrum, we show that soliton-inhibiting Raman effects are suppressed, and soliton devices are fabricated with near-unity yield. Our work offers an unambiguous method for soliton generation on strongly Raman-active materials. Further, it anticipates monolithically integrated, self-referenced frequency standards in conjunction with established technologies, such as periodically poled waveguides and electro-optic modulators, on thin-film lithium niobate.</description>

      <title>Tunable double notch filter on thin-film lithium niobate platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable optical filter at the chip scale plays a crucial role in fulfilling the need for the reconfigurability in channel routing, optical switching, and wavelength division multiplexing systems. In this letter, we propose a tunable double notch filter on thin-film lithium niobate using dual micro-ring architecture. This unique integrated filter is essential for complex photonic integrated circuits, along with multiple channels and various frequency spacing. With only one loaded voltage, the device demonstrates a wide frequency spacing tunability from 16.1 GHz to 89.9 GHz by reversely tunning the resonances of the two micro-rings while the center wavelength between the two resonances remains unaltered. Moreover, by utilizing the pronounced electro-optic properties of lithium niobate, associated with the tight light confinement nanophotonic waveguides, the device demonstrates a spacing tunability of 0.82 GHz/V and a contrast of 10~16 dB. In addition, the device has an ultracompact footprint of 0.0248 mm2.</description>

      <title>Quasi-calibration method for structured light system with auxiliary camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structured light projection technique is a representative active method for 3-D reconstruction, but many researchers face challenges with the intricate projector calibration process. To address this complexity, we employs an additional camera, temporarily referred to as the auxiliary camera, to eliminate the need for projector calibration. The auxiliary camera aids in constructing rational model equations, enabling the generation of world coordinates based on absolute phase information. Once calibration is complete, the auxiliary camera can be removed, mitigating occlusion issues and allowing the system to maintain its compact single-camera, single-projector design. Our approach not only resolves the common problem of calibrating projectors in digital fringe projection systems but also enhances the feasibility of diverse-shaped 3D imaging systems that utilize fringe projection, all without the need for the complex projector calibration process.</description>

      <title>Broadband transmissive polarization rotator by gradiently-twisted $\alpha$-MoO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization engineering has been proven to enhance the capabilities of light manipulation and thus facilitate the development of integrated photonic devices. In this study, we introduce a polarization rotator based on gradiently-twisted $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ thin film, that works for the mid infrared range and functions in a transmission mode. To be specific, the proposed device is constructed by gradiently-twisted $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ multilayers with a subwavelength thickness of only 5 microns, namely, one-third of the working wavelength. Our analytical calculation demonstrates the efficacy of this subwavelength thin film rotator in converting a linearly polarized wave into its orthogonal counterpart, thanks to its chiral nature. The twisted $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ multilayers exhibit the capability to significantly manipulate dispersion characteristics while maintaining low optical losses, thereby enabling a wide bandwidth exceeding 2.5 THz with a polarization ratio surpassing 17 dB. Moreover, the operational frequency can be adjusted across a 3.4 THz range by altering the incident angle of the incident waves. This adaptable design, characterized by its polarization versatility, can be customized to suit practical applications within wireless communication, radar systems, optical switching, and imaging technologies.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high numerical aperture waveguide-integrated meta beam shaper</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of metasurfaces with guided mode sources like waveguides have opened new frontiers for on-chip optical integration. However, the state-of-the-art in the field has targeted applications where long focal distances over thousands of light wavelengths are needed. This regime where the paraxial approximation holds enables inverse design of the metasurfaces with weakly confining elements that are typically thicker than the wavelength in the material. For short-focal length applications at distances less than 100{\lambda} where the paraxial approximation fails, and high numerical apertures (NA) are necessary, a different approach is required. Here we designed and experimentally demonstrated single-mode waveguide-integrated meta beam shapers capable of redirecting the confined light into the free space and focusing it at focal distances less than 100{\lambda} above the chip surface into a tightly focused spot. Focal spot characteristics measured at 460nm operating wavelength are approaching diffraction limited focusing across a range of focal lengths, device footprints, and numerical apertures demonstrating the robustness of our approach. Focal volumes smaller than 1{\mu}m^3 are demonstrated for a range of focal distances below 50{\mu}m. For a device with some of the highest NA amongst integrated metasurfaces of 0.95 the measured focal volume is as small as just 0.06{\mu}m^3 at a focal distance of 13{\mu}m. These on-chip integrated ultra-high NA meta beam shapers have the potential to unlock new applications in quantum optical computing with trapped ions, localized optogenetic neurostimulation, and high resolution in-situ microscopy.</description>

      <title>A Polychromatic Theory of Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of thermal radiation by means of micro-structured materials is an active area of research with applications such as thermophotovoltaics and radiative cooling. The original theories of thermal radiation, derived for electromagnetically large objects, predict unpolarized, omnidirectional and uncorrelated radiation. Microstructures, however, exhibit thermal emissions that can be polarized, highly directional, and spatially and temporally correlated. The original theories are also restricted to thermal equilibrium situations. In particular, they do not apply to steady-state emissions of electromagnetically small objects under a stationary illumination, where one expects significant differences in the shape and number of photons of the illuminating and emitted spectra, much as what happens when an object is under the sun. In here, we establish a polychromatic framework to predict thermal radiation in the stationary regime, which includes thermal equilibrium. After identifying an object-dependent set of independent polychromatic absorption modes, we assume that the emission also occurs independently through the outgoing versions of each polychromatic mode. Energy conservation leads then to a Kirchhoff-like law for each polychromatic mode. The salient properties of the polychromatic theory are: Emission in frequencies absent in the illumination, change in the number of photons, and applicability to both thermal radiation and luminescence upon illumination with a continuous wave laser, as long as the emitted power depends linearly on the input intensity. These properties are independent of the chosen set of polychromatic modes. In this work, we chose the absorption modes derived from the scattering operator of a given object. Some counter-intuitive results motivate the future search for a different set of modes.</description>

      <title>Single-Beam Velocimetry with Dual Frequency Comb Absorption Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser absorption Doppler velocimeters use a crossed-beam configuration to cancel error due to laser frequency drift and absorption model uncertainty. This configuration complicates the spatial interpretation of the measurement since the two beams sample different volumes of gas. Here, we achieve single-beam velocimetry with a portable dual comb spectrometer (DCS) with high frequency accuracy and stability enabled by GPS-referencing, and a new high-temperature water vapor absorption database. We measure the inlet flow in a supersonic ramjet engine and demonstrate single-beam measurements that are on average within 19 m/s of concurrent crossed-beam measurements. We estimate that the DCS and the new database contribute 1.6 and 13 m/s to this difference respectively.</description>

      <title>Microcavity induced by few-layer GaSe crystal on silicon photonic crystal waveguide for efficient optical frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the post-induction of high-quality microcavity on silicon photonic crystal (PC) waveguide by integrating few-layer GaSe crystal, which promises highly efficient on-chip optical frequency conversions. The integration of GaSe shifts the dispersion bands of the PC waveguide mode into the bandgap, resulting in localized modes confined by the bare PC waveguides. Thanks to the small contrast of refractive index at the boundaries of microcavity, it is reliably to obtain quality (Q) factors exceeding 10^4. With the enhanced light-GaSe interaction by the microcavity modes and high second-order nonlinearity of GaSe, remarkable second-harmonic generation (SHG) and sum-frequency generation (SFG) are achieved. A record-high on-chip SHG conversion efficiency of 131100% W^-1 is obtained, enabling the clear SHG imaging of the resonant modes with the pump of sub-milliwatts continuous-wave (CW) laser. Driven by a pump of on-resonance CW laser, strong SFGs are successfully carried out with the other pump of a CW laser spanning over the broad telecom-band. Broadband frequency conversion of an incoherent superluminescent light-emitting diode with low spectral power density is also realized in the integrated GaSe-PC waveguide. Our results are expected to provide new strategies for high-efficiency light-matter interactions, nonlinear photonics and light source generation in silicon photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically report that high-order sideband generation (HSG) from Floquet matters driven by a strong terahertz light while engineered by weak infrared light can achieve multiple plateau HSG. The Floquet-engineering systems exhibit distinctive spectroscopic characteristics that go beyond the HSG processes in field-free band-structure systems. The spatial-temporal dynamics analyses under Floquet-Bloch and time-reversal-symmetry theories clarify the spectral and its odd-even characteristics in the HSG spectrum. Our work demonstrates the HSG of Floquet matters via Floquet engineering and indicates a promising way to extract Floquet material parameters in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Defect-Induced Strain-Tunable Photoluminescence in AgScP$_2$S$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal thiophosphates (MTPs) are a large family of 2D materials that exhibit large structural and chemical diversity. They also show promise for applications in energy harvesting and photodetection. Strain and defect engineering have previously been demonstrated as useful mechanisms to tune several properties of MTPs such as resistivity, magnetic state, and electronic band gap. However, the effect of these stimuli on engineering tunable light emission in MTPs remains unexplored. Here, we show experimentally that structural defects in metal thiophosphate AgScP$_2$S$_6$ are prominent in exhibiting photoluminescence, which is likely driven by the defect-state-to-conduction-band transitions and can be further tuned by temperature-induced strain gradients.</description>

      <title>Giant second harmonic generation in supertwisted WS2 spirals grown in step edge particle induced non-Euclidean surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In moir\'e crystals resulting from the stacking of twisted two-dimensional (2D) layered materials, a subtle adjustment in the twist angle surprisingly gives rise to a wide range of correlated optical and electrical properties. Herein, we report the synthesis of supertwisted WS2 spirals and the observation of giant second harmonic generation (SHG) in these spirals. Supertwisted WS2 spirals featuring different twist angles are synthesized on a Euclidean or step-edge particle-induced non-Euclidean surface using a carefully designed water-assisted chemical vapor deposition deposition. We observed an oscillatory dependence of SHG intensity on layer number, attributed to atomically phase-matched nonlinear dipoles within layers of supertwisted spiral crystals where inversion symmetry is restored. Through an investigation into the twist angle evolution of SHG intensity, we discovered that the stacking model between layers plays a crucial role in determining the nonlinearity, and the SHG signals in supertwisted spirals exhibit enhancements by a factor of 2 to 136 when compared with the SHG of the single-layer structure. These findings provide an efficient method for the rational growth of 2D twisted structures and the implementation of twist angle adjustable endowing them great potential for exploring strong coupling correlation physics and applications in the field of twistronics.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal optical vortices: principles of description and basic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These notes appeared as a summary during the initial acquaintance with the structure and properties of spatio-temporal optical vortices (STOV), as these are presented in the current literature. The general approach to the STOV description and characterization is based on the model of scalar paraxial Gaussian wave packet. On this ground, the STOV structures of arbitrary orders are considered as superpositions of spatio-temporal Hermite-Gaussian modes. This representation enables the direct and physically meaningful characterization of the STOV amplitude and phase distributions, their evolution upon free propagation and in optical systems, internal energy flows and the orbital angular momentum. The topologically determined asymmetry and the difference between the "energy center" and "probability center" [Phys. Rev. A 107, L031501 (2023)] is discussed and qualitatively interpreted. Methods for the STOV generation and diagnostics are outlined, and the main properties of non-Gaussian (Bessel-type) STOVs are briefly described. The notes may be useful as initial introduction to the STOV-associated ideas and their extraordinary properties.</description>

      <title>Twisted hyperbolic van der Waals crystals for full Stokes mid-infrared polarization detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the polarization properties of light in the mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectrum is crucial for molecular sensing, biomedical diagnostics, and IR imaging system technologies. Traditional methods, limited by bulky size and intricate fabrication, utilize large rotating optics for full Stokes polarization detection, impeding miniaturization and accuracy. Van der Waals materials (vdW) based devices can address these challenges due to their lithography-free fabrication, ease of integration with chip-scale platforms and room-temperature operation. This study introduces a chip-integrated polarimeter device leveraging the in-plane biaxial hyperbolic vdW crystal properties for mid-infrared light manipulation. The spatial division measurement scheme incorporates six meticulously designed linear and circular polarization filters, achieving high extinction ratios exceeding 30 dB and transmittance surpassing 50%, with fabrication tolerance of film thickness up to 100 nm. The proposed device represents a significant advancement in polarimetric detection, providing a compact, cost-effective solution and opens new avenues for on-chip mid-IR polarimetric detection in next-generation ultra-compact optical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated total internal reflection is analyzed from an unusual point of view Unlike most similar works, incident angles are used here as the scanning variable, instead of the tunneled film thickness. The theoretical framework is presented defining our own normalized variables, better adapted to the problem at hand. A straightforward and captivating experiment, appropriate for undergraduate classroom demonstrations is also presented. The experiment involves measuring the reflection and transmission of light through a pair of prisms separated by an air or water layer, and the results are in fair agreement with theory.</description>

      <title>Heterodyne dispersive cavity ring-down spectroscopy exploiting eigenmode frequencies for high-fidelity measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring low light absorption with combined uncertainty &lt; 1 permille is crucial in a wide range of applications. Popular cavity ring-down spectroscopy can provide ultra-high precision, below 0.01 permille, but its accuracy is strongly dependent on the measurement capabilities of the detection system and typically is about 10 permille. Here, we exploit the optical frequency information carried by the ring-down cavity electromagnetic field, not explored in conventional CRDS, for high-fidelity spectroscopy. Instead of measuring only the decaying light intensity, we perform heterodyne detection of ring-downs followed by Fourier analysis to provide exact frequencies of optical cavity modes and a dispersive spectrum of a gas sample from them. This approach is insensitive to inaccuracies in light intensity measurements and eliminates the problem of detector band nonlinearity, the main cause of measurement error in traditional CRDS. Using the CO and HD line intensities as examples, we demonstrate the sub-permille accuracy of our method, confirmed by the best ab initio results, and the long-term repeatability of our dispersion measurements at 10^(-4) level. Such results have not been achieved in optical spectroscopy before. The high accuracy of the presented method indicates its potential in atmospheric studies, isotope ratio metrology, thermometry, and the establishment of primary gas standards.</description>

      <title>Guiding Trojan light beams via Lagrange points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The guided transmission of optical waves is critical for light-based applications in modern communication, information processing, and energy generation systems. Traditionally, guiding light waves in structures like optical fibres is predominantly achieved through the use of total internal reflection. In periodic platforms, a variety of other physical mechanisms can also be deployed to transport optical waves. However, transversely confining light in fully dielectric, non-periodic and passive configurations remains a challenge in situations where total internal reflection is not supported. Here, we present an approach to trapping light that utilizes the exotic features of Lagrange points, a special class of equilibrium positions akin to those responsible for capturing trojan asteroids in celestial mechanics. This is achieved in twisted arrangements in which optical Coriolis forces induce guiding channels even at locations where the refractive index landscape is defocusing or entirely unremarkable. These findings may have implications beyond standard optical waveguiding schemes and could also apply to other physical systems such as acoustics, electron beams and ultracold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a deep-learning-based scatterer density estimator (SDE) that processes local speckle patterns of optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and estimates the scatterer density behind each speckle pattern. The SDE is trained using large quantities of numerically simulated OCT images and their associated scatterer densities. The numerical simulation uses a noise model that incorporates the spatial properties of three types of noise, i.e., shot noise, relative-intensity noise, and non-optical noise. The SDE's performance was evaluated numerically and experimentally using two types of scattering phantom and in vitro tumor spheroids. The results confirmed that the SDE estimates scatterer densities accurately. The estimation accuracy improved significantly when compared with our previous deep-learning-based SDE, which was trained using numerical speckle patterns generated from a noise model that did not account for the spatial properties of noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical studies demonstrate that magneto-chiral (MCh) metasurfaces consisting of double Z-type gammadions with perpendicularly magnetized substrate exhibit bianisotropy for microwaves. Effective polarizability tensors of the metasurfaces, extracted from the reflection and transmission coefficients, have components corresponding to non-reciprocal moving-type bianisotropy as well as reciprocal chiral-type bianisotropy and non-reciprocal magneto-optical effects. The combination of the metasurfaces and contraposition MCh metasurfaces cancels the chiral-type bianisotropy and magneto-optical effect, leading to pure moving electromagnetic media. Achieved perfect transmission with phase difference of {\pi} realizes an ideal gyrator for arbitrary spatial and polarization modes.</description>

      <title>A clear case for dust obscuration of the lunar retroreflectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The passive retroreflector arrays placed on the moon by Apollo 11, 14 and 15 astronauts continue to produce valuable Earth-Moon range measurements that enable high-precision tests of gravitational physics, as well as studies of geo- and selenophysics. The optical throughput of these retroreflectors has declined since their deployment, with an additional signal loss at full moon when the reflectors experience direct solar illumination. We show that the loss in return rate can be attributed to the accumulation of a thin layer of lunar dust on the surfaces of the corner cube retroreflectors. First, a careful analysis of the optical link budget for the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) experiment reveals that the lunar return rate is 15--20 times smaller than predicted, a deficit that can be explained by a reflector dust covering fraction of ${\sim} 50$\%. Second, range measurements taken during a lunar eclipse indicate that the solar illumination of the retroreflectors degrades their throughput by an additional factor of ${\sim}15$. Finally, a numerical simulation of heat transfer in dust-coated reflectors is able to model the resulting thermal lensing effect, in which thermal gradients in the retroreflectors degrade their far-field diffraction pattern. A comparison of this simulation to eclipse measurements finds a dust coverage fraction of ${\sim}50$%. Taken together, the link analysis, eclipse observations and thermal modeling support the claim that the retroreflectors are obscured by lunar dust, with both link budget and simulation independently finding the dust fraction to be $\sim$50%.</description>

      <title>A genetic algorithm for the response of twisted nematic liquid crystals to an applied field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When an external field is applied across a liquid-crystal cell, the twist and tilt distributions cannot be calculated analytically and must be extracted numerically. In the standard approach, the Euler-Lagrange equations are derived from the minimization of the free energy of the system and then solved via finite-difference methods, often implemented in commercial software. These tools iterate from initial solutions that are compatible with the boundary conditions, providing limited to no flexibility for customization. Here, we present a genetic algorithm that outputs fast and accurate solutions to the integral form of the equations. In our approach, the evolutionary routine is sequentially applied at each position within the bulk of the cell, thus overcoming the necessity of assuming trial solutions. The predictions of our routine strongly support the experimental observations on different instances of spatially varying twisted nematic liquid-crystal cells, patterned with different topologies on the two alignment layers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate (both analytically and numerically) total angular momentum conservation for a molecular system subject to circularly polarized light (CPL) field moving along a single Born-Oppenheimer surface, where all of the angular momentum transfer is embodied in a Berry force. Moreover, we demonstrate that the model Hamiltonian proposed in [J. Chem. Phys. 150, 124101 (2019)] in fact corresponds physically to a homonuclear diatomic in a CPL field. Our results not only reveal an interesting microscopic mechanism for angular momentum transfer between a molecule and a radiation field, but they also provide new insight into the nature of novel semiclassical non-adiabatic dynamics methods that conserve the total angular momentum (including, e.g., phase-space surface-hopping methods).</description>

      <title>Temperature, Pressure, Velocity, and Water Vapor Mole Fraction Profiles in a Ramjet Combustor using Dual Frequency Comb Spectroscopy and a High Temperature Absorption Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate diagnostics of the combustor region of ramjet engines can improve engine design and create benchmarks for computational fluid dynamics models. Previous works demonstrate that dual frequency comb spectroscopy can provide low uncertainty diagnostics of multiple flow parameters in the non-combusting regions of ramjets. However, the high temperatures present in the combustor present a challenge for broadband spectroscopic absorption models that are used to interpret measurements in these regions. Here, we utilize a new water vapor absorption database created for high temperature water-air mixtures to fit spectra measured in a ground-test ramjet engine with a broadband near-infrared dual comb absorption spectrometer. We extract 2D profiles of pressure, temperature, water mole fraction, and velocity using this new database. We demonstrate that the new database provides the lowest fit residuals compared to other water vapor absorption databases. We compare computational fluid dynamics simulations of the combustor with the measured data to demonstrate that the simulations overpredict heat release and water vapor production.</description>

      <title>Continuously and widely tunable frequency-stabilized laser based on an optical frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuously and widely tunable lasers actively stabilized on a frequency reference are broadly employed in atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics. The frequency-stabilized optical frequency comb (OFC) provides a novel optical frequency reference with a broadband spectrum that meets the requirement of laser frequency stabilization. Therefore, we demonstrate a frequency-stabilized and precisely tunable laser system based on it. In this scheme, the laser frequency locked to the OFC is driven to jump over the ambiguity zones, which blocks the wide tuning of the locked laser, and tuned until the mode hopping happens with the always-activated feedback loop. Meanwhile, we compensate the gap of the frequency jump with a synchronized acoustic optical modulator to ensure the continuity. This scheme is applied to an external cavity diode laser (ECDL) and we achieve tuning at a rate of about 7 GHz/s with some readily available commercial electronics. Furthermore, we tune the frequency-stabilized laser only with the feedback of diode current and its average tuning speed can exceed 100 GHz/s. Due to the resource-efficient configuration and the simplicity of completion, this scheme can be referenced and find wide applications in AMO experiments.</description>

      <title>Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavities controlled by Casimir forces in electrolyte solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a design for tuning the resonant spectra of Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavities mediated by the Casimir force. The system involves a suspended gold nanoplate approaching to a dielectric-coated gold substrate in a univalent electrolyte solution. The gold nanoplate can be stably suspended due to the delicate balance between repulsive and attractive components of the Casimir forces. In an electrolyte solution, the presence of ionic-charge fluctuations can partially or totally screen the thermal $n$=0 Matsubara term, resulting in strongly modified interactions. As a result, the separation between the gold nanoplate and the substrate experiences a significant modulation in response to variations in salt concentration. Under proper conditions, we find that the modulation of the Casimir force would strongly shift the resonances of Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavities at the optical frequencies, when the Debye length of the electrolyte decreases from 1000 nm to 10 nm. Finally, the temperature dependence of the thermal Casimir force would provide an additional modulation of Fabry-P\'{e}rot nanocavity resonances for their eventual fine tuning. These results open up a promising venue for general tuning of the optical resonances with potential applications in re-configurable microfluidic nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Universal spectral moment theorem and its applications in non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high sensitivity of the spectrum and wavefunctions to boundary conditions, termed the non-Hermitian skin effect, represents a fundamental aspect of non-Hermitian systems. While it endows non-Hermitian systems with unprecedented physical properties, it presents notable obstacles in grasping universal properties that are robust against microscopic details and boundary conditions. In this Letter, we introduce a pivotal theorem: in the thermodynamic limit, for any non-Hermitian systems with finite-range interactions, all spectral moments are invariant quantities, independent of boundary conditions, posing strong constraints on the spectrum. Utilizing this invariance, we propose an analytic criterion for parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) exactness that is applicable in any dimensions with any boundary conditions. we find that the $\mathcal{PT}$ transition identified using this method captures dynamical signatures observable in experiments, aligns with the exceptional point, and is distinct from the real-to-complex spectral transition, contrary to traditional expectations. We verify these findings in 1D and 2D lattice models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate multimode optomechanical sensing of individual nanoparticles with radius of a hundred of nanometers. A semiconductor optomechanical disk resonator is optically driven and detected under ambient conditions, as nebulized nanoparticles land on it. Multiple mechanical and optical resonant signals of the disk are tracked simultaneously, providing access to several physical informations about the landing analyte in real-time. Thanks to a fast camera registering the time and position of landing, these signals can be employed to weigh each nanoparticle with precision. Sources of error and deviation are discussed and modeled, indicating a path to evaluate the elasticity of the nanoparticles on top of their mere mass. The device is optimized for future investigation of biological particles in the high megadalton range, such as large viruses.</description>

Abstract: Photons do not carry sufficient momentum to induce indirect optical transitions in semiconducting materials such as silicon, necessitating the assistance of lattice phonons to conserve momentum. Compared to direct bandgap semiconductors, this renders silicon a less attractive material for a wide variety of optoelectronic applications. In this work, we introduce an alternative strategy to fulfill the momentum-matching requirement in indirect optical transitions. We demonstrate that when confined to scales below ~3 nm, photons acquire sufficient momentum to allow electronic transitions at the band edge of Si without the assistance of a phonon. Confined photons allow simultaneous energy and momentum conservation in two-body photon-electron scattering; in effect, converting silicon into a direct bandgap semiconductor. We show that this less-explored concept of light-matter interaction leads to a marked increase in the absorptivity of Si from the UV to the near-IR. The strategy provides opportunities for more efficient use of indirect semiconductors in photovoltaics, energy conversion, light detection and emission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an energy transfer model with a cubic atomic population dependence to accurately model the behavior of various reported high-power erbium-doped fluoride fiber lasers operating near 2.8 microns. We first show that the previously introduced weakly interacting (WI) and strongly interacting (SI) models are not adequate for precisely modeling such high-power erbium-doped fluoride fiber lasers. We compare results obtained with the WI and SI models to the proposed model by simulating 4 different highly doped (7 mol.%) fiber lasers previously reported in the literature. Laser efficiencies and powers are reproduced with great accuracy. In addition, four other independent fiber laser systems based on erbium doping concentrations varying from 1-6 mol.% are also simulated with good accuracy using the proposed model with the exact same set of spectroscopic parameters, which confirms its validity for various erbium doping concentrations. Redshifting of laser wavelength is also taken into account by considering the full cross section spectra and computing signal powers over several wavelength channels.</description>

      <title>Suppressing electromagnetic local density of states via slow light in lossy quasi-1d gratings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a spectral-averaging procedure that enables computation of bandwidth-integrated local density of states (LDOS) from a single scattering calculation, and exploit it to investigate the minimum extinction achievable from dipolar sources over finite bandwidths in structured media. Structure-agnostic extinction bounds are derived, providing analytical insights into scaling laws and fundamental design tradeoffs with implications to bandwidth and material selection. We find that perfect LDOS suppression over a finite bandwidth $\Delta\omega$ is impossible. Inspired by limits which predict nontrivial $\sqrt{\Delta\omega}$ scaling in systems with material dissipation, we show that pseudogap edge states of quasi-1d bullseye gratings can -- by simultaneously minimizing material absorption and radiation -- yield arbitrarily close to perfect LDOS suppression in the limit of vanishing bandwidth.</description>

Abstract: Refractive index is a fundamental optical property of powder and a key input to the measurement of the size distribution using light scattering and the measurement of the absorption and scattering coefficients using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. In this work, we demonstrate a method that combines index matching with phase imaging to determine the refractive index of complex powder particles at high accuracy without relying on any assumptions. Index matching is robust, but the accuracy is not high by relying on ocular observation of the interface. Phase imaging using interferometry improves the accuracy of determining the match by an order of magnitude. Using the proposed method, we determine the refractive index of four types of pharmaceutical powder in the short-wave infrared range of 1100-1650 nm.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Pancharatnam-Berry Metasurface for Unidirectional Wavefront Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces have been widely used for manipulating electromagnetic waves due to their low intrinsic loss and easy fabrication. The metasurfaces employing the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phase, called PB metasurfaces, have been extensively applied to realize spin-dependent functionalities, such as beam steering, focusing, holography, etc. The demand for PB metasurfaces in complex environments has brought about one challenging problem, i.e., the interference of multiple wave channels that limits the performance of PB metasurfaces. A promising solution is developing nonreciprocal PB metasurfaces that can isolate undesired wave channels and exhibit unidirectional functionalities. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize nonreciprocal PB metasurfaces of subwavelength thickness by using the magneto-optical effect of YIG material in synergy with the PB geometric phase of spatially rotating meta-atoms. Using full-wave numerical simulations, we show that the metasurface composed of dielectric cylinders and a thin YIG layer can achieve nearly 92% and 81% isolation of circularly polarized lights at 5.5 GHz and 6.5 GHz, respectively, attributed to the enhancement of the magneto-optical effect by the resonant Mie modes and Fabry-P\'erot cavity mode. In addition, the metasurface can enable efficient unidirectional wavefront manipulations of circularly polarized lights, including nonreciprocal beam steering and nonreciprocal beam focusing. The proposed metasurface can find highly useful applications in optical communications, optical sensing, and quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: Silicon photonics with the advantages of low power consumption, low cost, and high yield is a crucial technology for facilitating high-capacity optical communications and interconnects. The graphene photodetectors (GPDs) featuring broadband operation, high speed, and low integration cost can be good additions to the conventional SiGe photodetectors, supporting silicon-integrated on-chip photodetection in new wavelength bands beyond 1.6 microns (e.g., U-band and 2 microns). Here we realize a silicon-integrated four-channel wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) optical receiver based on a micro-ring resonator (MRR) array and four p-n homojunction GPDs. These GPDs based on the photo-thermoelectric (PTE) effect operating under zero (current) bias exhibit responsivities of about 1.1 V/W and flat frequency responses up to 67 GHz which is set-up limited. The GPDs show good consistence benefiting from the compact active region array (0.006 mm^2) covered by a single mechanically exfoliated hBN/graphene/hBN stack. Moreover, the WDM graphene optical receiver realized the 4 x 16 Gbps non-return to zero (NRZ) optical signal transmission. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first GPD-array-based optical receiver using high-quality mechanically exfoliated graphene and edge graphene-metal conduct with low resistance. Apparently, our design is also compatible with CVD-grown graphene, which can also result in a good consistence of the GPDs. This work shed light on the large-scale integration of GPDs with high consistency and uniformity, enabling the application of high-quality mechanically exfoliated graphene, and promoting the development of the graphene photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Probing macroscopic temperature changes with non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multilayered metal-dielectric nanostructures display both strong plasmonic behavior and hyperbolic optical dispersion. The latter is responsible for the appearance of two separated radiative and non-radiative channels in the extinction spectrum of these structures. This unique property can open a wealth of opportunities towards the development of multifunctional systems that simultaneously can behave as optimal scatterers and absorbers at different wavelengths, an important feature to achieve multiscale control light-matter interactions in different spectral regions for different types of applications, such as optical computing or detection of thermal radiation. Nevertheless, the temperature dependence of the optical properties of these multilayered systems has never been investigated. In this work we study how radiative and non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas can probe temperature changes of the surrounding medium. We show that, while radiative processes are essentially not affected by a change in the external temperature, the non-radiative ones are strongly affected by a temperature variation. By combining experiments and temperature dependent effective medium theory, we find that this behavior is connected to enhanced damping effects due to electron-phonon scattering. Contrary to standard plasmonic systems, a red-shift of the non-radiative mode occurs for small variations of the environment temperature. Our study shows that to probe temperature changes it is essential to exploit non-radiative processes in systems supporting plasmonic excitations, which can be used as very sensitive thermometers via linear absorption spectroscopy.</description>

Abstract: Modern medicine aims to diagnose diseases at early stages which constitutes a relevant task of biomedical research. The present investigation focuses on myasthenia, a disease that takes the third place in terms of frequency worldwide, has complex symptoms and is difficult to treat. It is early diagnostics that allows for providing competent medical assistance and, sometimes, curing the patient. To detect the cause of the disease, the Raman spectroscopy was used to study blood serum samples covered with quartz glass with gold clusters embedded. The Raman cross-section has been amplified with the gold nanoparticles which made it possible to detect Botulotoxin-A in blood serum of patients suffering from myasthenia</description>

Abstract: We present a formally exact and simulation-free approach for the normalization of X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) spectra based on the f-sum rule of the imaginary-time correlation function (ITCF). Our method works for any degree of collectivity, over a broad range of temperatures, and is applicable even in nonequilibrium situations. In addition to giving us model-free access to electronic correlations, this new approach opens up the intriguing possibility to extract a plethora of physical properties from the ITCF based on XRTS experiments.</description>

      <title>Floquet systems with continuous dynamical symmetries: characterization, time-dependent Noether charge, and integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum Floquet (periodically-driven) systems having continuous dynamical symmetry (CDS) consisting of a time translation and a unitary transformation on the Hilbert space. Unlike the discrete ones, the CDS strongly constrains the possible Hamiltonians $H(t)$ and allows us to obtain all the Floquet states by solving a finite-dimensional eigenvalue problem. Besides, Noether's theorem leads to a time-dependent conservation charge, whose expectation value is time-independent throughout evolution. We exemplify these consequences of CDS in the seminal Rabi model, an effective model of a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds without strain terms, and Heisenberg spin models in rotating fields. Our results provide a systematic way of solving for Floquet states and explain how they avoid hybridization in quasienergy diagrams.</description>

      <title>Ions-induced Epitaxial Growth of Perovskite Nanocomposites for Highly Efficient Light-Emitting Diodes with EQE Exceeding 30%</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites, a class of cost-effective semiconductor materials, are of great interest for modern and upcoming display technologies that prioritize the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) with high efficiency and excellent color purity. The prevailing approach to achieving efficient luminescence from pervoskites is enhancing exciton binding effect and confining carriers by reducing their dimensionality or grain size. However, splitting pervoskite lattice into smaller ones generates abundant boundaries in solid films and results in more surface trap states, needing exact passivation to suppress trap-assisted nonradiative losses. Here, an ions-induced heteroepitaxial growth method is employed to assembe perovskite lattices with different structures into large-sized grains to produce lattice-anchored nanocomposites for efficient LEDs with high color purity. This approach enables the nanocomposite thin films, composed of three-dimensional (3D) CsPbBr3 and its variant of zero-dimensional (0D) Cs4PbBr6, to feature significant low trap-assisted nonradiative recombination, enhanced light out-coupling with a corrugated surface, and well-balanced charge carrier transport. Based on the resultant 3D/0D perovskite nanocomposites, we demonstrate the perovskite LEDs achieving an remarkable external quantum efficiency of 31.0% at the emission peak of 521 nm with a narrow full width at half-maximum of only 18 nm. This research introduces a novel approach to the development of well-assembled nanocomposites for perovskite LEDs, demonstrating high efficiency comparable to that of state-of-the-art organic LEDs.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast all-optical toggle writing of magnetic bits without relying on heat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While in accordance with Curie's principle, one would intuitively expect that symmetry of the cause has to be found in the symmetry of the effect, ultrafast excitation of matter is able to violate this principle. For instance, it is believed that heating alone, obviously not having the symmetry of a magnetic field, cannot result in a deterministic reversal of magnetization. However, if the heating is induced by a femtosecond laser pulse and thus ultrafast, it does facilitate toggle switching of magnetization between stable bit-states without any magnetic field at all. Here we show that the regime of ultrafast toggle switching can be also realized via a mechanism without relying on any heat. The obvious mismatch between symmetries of the cause and the response can thus be seen as a violation of Curie's principle. In particular, ultrafast laser excitation of iron-garnet with linearly polarized light modifies magnetic anisotropy and thus causes toggling magnetization between two stable bit states. In contrast to the laser-heat-induced magnetization reversal, this new regime of 'cold' toggle switching can be observed in ferrimagnets without the compensation point and in an exceptionally broad temperature range. The control of magnetic anisotropy required for the toggle switching is accompanied by lower dissipations, than in the mechanism of laser-induced-heating, but the dissipations and the switching-time are shown to be competing parameters.</description>

      <title>Angular control noise in Advanced Virgo and implications for the Einstein Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With significantly improved sensitivity, the Einstein Telescope (ET), along with other upcoming gravitational wave detectors, will mark the beginning of precision gravitational wave astronomy. However, the pursuit of surpassing current detector capabilities requires careful consideration of technical constraints inherent in existing designs. The significant improvement of ET lies in the low-frequency range, where it anticipates a one million-fold increase in sensitivity compared to current detectors. Angular control noise is a primary limitation for LIGO detectors in this frequency range, originating from the need to maintain optical alignment. Given the expected improvements in ET's low-frequency range, precise assessment of angular control noise becomes crucial for achieving target sensitivity. To address this, we developed a model of the angular control system of Advanced Virgo, closely matching experimental data and providing a robust foundation for modeling future-generation detectors. Our model, for the first time, enables replication of the measured coupling level between angle and length. Additionally, our findings confirm that Virgo, unlike LIGO, is not constrained by alignment control noise, even if the detector were operating at full power.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Environmental Stability of Perovskite Thin Films via PMMA and AZ5214-Photoresist Coatings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a pioneering strategy to enhance the environmental stability of perovskite thin films, a critical step forward in advancing their application in optoelectronics. Through the innovative application of matrix encapsulation techniques, we focus on the stabilization of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and methylammonium lead bromide (MAPbBr3) films. These films are meticulously prepared via a two-step solution deposition method under controlled ambient conditions. Our approach involves the application of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and AZ5214 photoresist layers through spin-coating, aimed at singularly encapsulating the perovskite films. This encapsulation acts as a robust hydrophobic barrier, significantly mitigating moisture ingress and simultaneously addressing the challenge of pinhole presence within the perovskite structure. Through a series of detailed characterizations-spanning scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy-we demonstrate that, despite the thicker nature of the AZ5214 photoresist compared to the PMMA layer, it exhibits markedly enhanced stability. Notably, the integrity and optical properties of the perovskite films are preserved for extended periods of up to 960 hours under environmental exposure. This breakthrough highlights the superior performance of AZ5214 photoresist over PMMA in prolonging the operational life of perovskite thin films, thereby offering a promising avenue for their deployment in a wide range of optoelectronic devices.</description>
