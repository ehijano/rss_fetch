      <title>TLOB: A Novel Transformer Model with Dual Attention for Stock Price Trend Prediction with Limit Order Book Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock Price Trend Prediction (SPTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and struggle to reliably predict short-term trends. Surprisingly, by adapting a simple MLP-based architecture to LOB, we show that we surpass SoTA performance; thus, challenging the necessity of complex architectures. Unlike past work that shows robustness issues, we propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data. This allows it to adaptively focus on the market microstructure, making it particularly effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We also introduce a new labeling method that improves on previous ones, removing the horizon bias. To assess TLOB's effectiveness, we evaluate it on the well-known FI-2010 benchmark (F1 of 92.8\%) and on Tesla (+2.67\% on F1) and Intel (+14.16\% on F1). Additionally, we empirically show how stock price predictability has declined over time (-6.68 absolute points in F1), highlighting the growing market efficiencies. Predictability must be considered in relation to transaction costs, so we experimented with defining trends using an average spread, reflecting the primary transaction cost. The resulting performance deterioration underscores the complexity of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies. We argue that our work provides new insights into the evolving landscape of stock price trend prediction and sets a strong foundation for future advancements in financial AI. We release the code at github.com/LeonardoBerti00/TLOB.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Impact of the Union Budget Announcements on the Indian Stock Market: A Fractal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stock market closely monitors macroeconomic policy announcements, such as annual budget events, due to their substantial influence on various economic participants. These events tend to impact the stock markets initially before affecting the real sector. Our study aims to analyze the effects of the budget on the Indian stock market, specifically focusing on the announcement for the year 2024. We will compare this with the years 2023, 2022, and 2020, assessing its impact on the NIFTY50 index using average abnormal return (AAR) and cumulative average abnormal return (CAAR) over a period of -15 and +15 days, including the budget day. This study utilizes an innovative approach involving the fractal interpolation function, paired with fractal dimensional analysis, to study the fluctuations arising from budget announcements. The fractal perspective on the data offers an effective framework for understanding complex variations.</description>

      <title>Stock Price Prediction Using a Hybrid LSTM-GNN Model: Integrating Time-Series and Graph-Based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel hybrid model that integrates long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to significantly enhance the accuracy of stock market predictions. The LSTM component adeptly captures temporal patterns in stock price data, effectively modeling the time series dynamics of financial markets. Concurrently, the GNN component leverages Pearson correlation and association analysis to model inter-stock relational data, capturing complex nonlinear polyadic dependencies influencing stock prices. The model is trained and evaluated using an expanding window validation approach, enabling continuous learning from increasing amounts of data and adaptation to evolving market conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on historical stock data demonstrate that our hybrid LSTM-GNN model achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.00144, representing a substantial reduction of 10.6% compared to the MSE of the standalone LSTM model of 0.00161. Furthermore, the hybrid model outperforms traditional and advanced benchmarks, including linear regression, convolutional neural networks (CNN), and dense networks. These compelling results underscore the significant potential of combining temporal and relational data through a hybrid approach, offering a powerful tool for real-time trading and financial analysis.</description>

      <title>Financial fraud detection system based on improved random forest and gradient boosting machine (GBM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a financial fraud detection system based on improved Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). Specifically, the system introduces a novel model architecture called GBM-SSRF (Gradient Boosting Machine with Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest), which cleverly combines the powerful optimization capabilities of the gradient boosting machine (GBM) with improved randomization. The computational efficiency and feature extraction capabilities of the Simplified and Strengthened Random Forest (SSRF) forest significantly improve the performance of financial fraud detection. Although the traditional random forest model has good classification capabilities, it has high computational complexity when faced with large-scale data and has certain limitations in feature selection. As a commonly used ensemble learning method, the GBM model has significant advantages in optimizing performance and handling nonlinear problems. However, GBM takes a long time to train and is prone to overfitting problems when data samples are unbalanced. In response to these limitations, this paper optimizes the random forest based on the structure, reducing the computational complexity and improving the feature selection ability through the structural simplification and enhancement of the random forest. In addition, the optimized random forest is embedded into the GBM framework, and the model can maintain efficiency and stability with the help of GBM's gradient optimization capability. Experiments show that the GBM-SSRF model not only has good performance, but also has good robustness and generalization capabilities, providing an efficient and reliable solution for financial fraud detection.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Similarity Learning for Market Forecasting: The ContraSim Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Contrastive Similarity Space Embedding Algorithm (ContraSim), a novel framework for uncovering the global semantic relationships between daily financial headlines and market movements. ContraSim operates in two key stages: (I) Weighted Headline Augmentation, which generates augmented financial headlines along with a semantic fine-grained similarity score, and (II) Weighted Self-Supervised Contrastive Learning (WSSCL), an extended version of classical self-supervised contrastive learning that uses the similarity metric to create a refined weighted embedding space. This embedding space clusters semantically similar headlines together, facilitating deeper market insights. Empirical results demonstrate that integrating ContraSim features into financial forecasting tasks improves classification accuracy from WSJ headlines by 7%. Moreover, leveraging an information density analysis, we find that the similarity spaces constructed by ContraSim intrinsically cluster days with homogeneous market movement directions, indicating that ContraSim captures market dynamics independent of ground truth labels. Additionally, ContraSim enables the identification of historical news days that closely resemble the headlines of the current day, providing analysts with actionable insights to predict market trends by referencing analogous past events.</description>

      <title>A data-driven econo-financial stress-testing framework to estimate the effect of supply chain networks on financial systemic risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supply chain disruptions constitute an often underestimated risk for financial stability. As in financial networks, systemic risks in production networks arises when the local failure of one firm impacts the production of others and might trigger cascading disruptions that affect significant parts of the economy. Here, we study how systemic risk in production networks translates into financial systemic risk through a mechanism where supply chain contagion leads to correlated bank-firm loan defaults. We propose a financial stress-testing framework for micro- and macro-prudential applications that features a national firm level supply chain network in combination with interbank network layers. The model is calibrated by using a unique data set including about 1 million firm-level supply links, practically all bank-firm loans, and all interbank loans in a small European economy. As a showcase we implement a real COVID-19 shock scenario on the firm level. This model allows us to study how the disruption dynamics in the real economy can lead to interbank solvency contagion dynamics. We estimate to what extent this amplifies financial systemic risk. We discuss the relative importance of these contagion channels and find an increase of interbank contagion by 70% when production network contagion is present. We then examine the financial systemic risk firms bring to banks and find an increase of up to 28% in the presence of the interbank contagion channel. This framework is the first financial systemic risk model to take agent-level dynamics of the production network and shocks of the real economy into account which opens a path for directly, and event-driven understanding of the dynamical interaction between the real economy and financial systems.</description>

      <title>Bankruptcy analysis using images and convolutional neural networks (CNN)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The marketing departments of financial institutions strive to craft products and services that cater to the diverse needs of businesses of all sizes. However, it is evident upon analysis that larger corporations often receive a more substantial portion of available funds. This disparity arises from the relative ease of assessing the risk of default and bankruptcy in these more prominent companies. Historically, risk analysis studies have focused on data from publicly traded or stock exchange-listed companies, leaving a gap in knowledge about small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Addressing this gap, this study introduces a method for evaluating SMEs by generating images for processing via a convolutional neural network (CNN). To this end, more than 10,000 images, one for each company in the sample, were created to identify scenarios in which the CNN can operate with higher assertiveness and reduced training error probability. The findings demonstrate a significant predictive capacity, achieving 97.8% accuracy, when a substantial number of images are utilized. Moreover, the image creation method paves the way for potential applications of this technique in various sectors and for different analytical purposes.</description>
