      <title>Self-dispersion-managed adiabatic frequency conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersion management of few-cycle pulses is crucial for ultrafast optics and photonics. Often, nontrivial dispersion is compensated using complex optical systems or minimized through careful design of waveguides. Here, we present dispersion-managed adiabatic frequency conversion enabling efficient downconversion of an 11.1-fs near-IR pulse to an 11.6-fs mid-IR pulse spanning an octave of bandwidth from 2-4 $\mu$m. The adiabatic frequency converter is designed to impart a constant group delay over the entire bandwidth, eliminating the need for complex dispersion management and opening a new avenue for dispersion engineering in ultrafast optics and photonics. Notably, dispersion engineering through the position-dependent conversion position of an adiabatic conversion device constitutes an additional mechanism for dispersion control in ultrafast optics and photonics while maintaining high conversion efficiency for broadband pulses.</description>

      <title>Enhanced infrared vision by nonlinear up-conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to detect and image short-wave infrared light has important applications in surveillance, autonomous navigation, and biological imaging. However, the current infrared imaging technologies often pose challenges due to their large footprints, large thermal noise, and the inability to augment infrared and visible imaging. Here, we demonstrate infrared imaging by nonlinear up conversion to the visible on an ultra-compact, high-quality lithium niobate resonant metasurface. Images with high conversion efficiency and resolution quality are obtained despite the strong nonlocality of the metasurface. We further show the possibility of edge-detection image processing augmented with direct-up conversion imaging for advanced night vision applications.</description>

      <title>Laser-scanning optical-frequency-comb microscopy for multimodal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel laser-scanning optical microscopy technique that employs optical-frequency-comb (OFC) lasers. This method facilitates multimodal spectroscopic imaging by analyzing interferograms produced via a dual-comb spectroscopic approach. Such interferograms capture comprehensive light information, including amplitude, phase, polarization, frequency, and time of flight information, enabling multimodal imaging from a single measurement. We demonstrate the potential of this technique across several spectroscopic imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Attosecond spectroscopy using vacuum-ultraviolet pulses emitted from laser-driven semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly laser-driven semiconductor crystals offer substantial advantages for the study of many-body physics and ultrafast optoelectronics via the high harmonic generation process. While this phenomenon has been employed to investigate the dynamics of solids in the presence of strong laser fields, its potential to be utilized as an attosecond light source has remained unexploited. Here, we demonstrate that the high harmonics generated through the interaction of mid--infrared pulses with a ZnO crystal leads to the production of attosecond pulses, that can be used to trace the ultrafast ionization dynamics of alkali metals. In a cross--correlation approach, we photoionize Cesium atoms with the vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) high-harmonics in the presence of a mid-infrared laser field. We observe strong oscillations of the photoelectron yield originating from the instantaneous polarization of the atoms by the laser field. The phase of the oscillations encodes the attosecond synchronization of the ionizing high-harmonics and is used for attosecond pulse metrology. This light source opens a new spectral window for attosecond spectroscopy, paving the way for studies of systems with low ionization potentials including neutral atoms, molecules and solids. Additionally, our results highlight the significance of the source for generating non--classical massively entangled light states in the visible--VUV spectral region.</description>

      <title>Detection of carbon monoxide using a polarization-multiplexed erbium dual-comb fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a compact, reliable, and robust free-running all-polarization-maintaining erbium (Er) single-cavity dual-comb laser generated via polarization multiplexing with gain sharing. Polarization multiplexing exploits the fast and slow axes of the fiber, while modelocking is achieved through a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror scheme using readily available components. The laser operates at a repetition rate of around 74.74 MHz with a tuning capability in the difference in repetition rates from 500 Hz to 200 kHz. This tunability makes the system more flexible for dual-comb spectroscopy experiments. Consequently, using this laser, we demonstrated a proof-of-principle dual-comb spectroscopy of carbon monoxide (CO), operating without any active stabilization.</description>

      <title>Elucidating nanostructural organisation and photonic properties of butterfly wing scales using hyperspectral microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophotonic nanostructures in butterfly wing scales remain fascinating examples of biological functional materials, with intriguing open questions in regards to formation and evolutionary function. One particularly interesting butterfly species, Erora opisena (Lycaenidae: Theclinae), develops wing scales that contain three-dimensional photonic crystals that closely resemble a single gyroid geometry. Unlike most other gyroid forming butterflies, E. opisena develops discrete gyroid crystallites with a pronounced size gradient hinting at a developmental sequence frozen in time. Here, we use a hyperspectral (wavelength-resolved) microscopy technique to investigate the ultrastructural organisation of these gyroid crystallites in dry, adult wing scales. We show that reflectance corresponds to crystallite size, where larger crystallites reflect green wavelengths more intensely; this relationship could be used to infer size from the optical signal. We further successfully resolve the red-shifted reflectance signal from wing scales immersed in refractive index oils with varying refractive index, including values similar to water or cytosol. Such photonic crystals with lower refractive index contrast may be similar to the hypothesized nanostructural forms in the developing butterfly scales. The ability to resolve these fainter signals hints at the potential of this facile light microscopy method for in vivo analysis of nanostructure formation in developing butterflies.</description>

      <title>All-mirror wavefront division interferometer for mid-infrared spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we address the core of any Fourier transform (FT) spectrometer$\unicode{x2013}$the interferometer$\unicode{x2013}$in perspective of the recent emergence of spatially coherent broadband infrared (IR) sources. As a result, we report on the design of a wavefront-division interferometer for spectroscopic applications in the mid-IR and beyond. The theoretical framework of the proposed wavefront division interferometer is discussed, and an analytical solution to determine the far-field interference pattern is derived. The solution is verified by both optical propagation simulations and experimentally. In view of the practical significance, we apply the wavefront division interferometer for FTIR spectroscopy. It features a simple architecture, ultra-broad achromaticity (limited only by the spectral profiles of the mirrors), high optical throughput, variable arms split ratio, and a two-fold increase in scan length and spectral resolution (demonstrated up to 0.2 $cm^{-1}$), respectively. Further, the employed design inherently enables the measurement of the complex refractive index. Experimental verification of the mentioned properties is provided by coupling the spectrometer with a mid-IR supercontinuum source for various applied spectroscopic studies: high-resolution transmission measurements of polymers (polypropylene) and gas (methane), as well as reflectance measurements of dried pharmaceuticals (insulin products on a metal surface).</description>

      <title>Hybrid Multi-Head Physics-informed Neural Network for Depth Estimation in Terahertz Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging is one of the hotspots in the field of optics, where the depth information retrieval is a key factor to restore the three-dimensional appearance of objects. Impressive results for depth extraction in visible and infrared wave range have been demonstrated through deep learning (DL). Among them, most DL methods are merely data-driven, lacking relevant physical priors, which thus request for a large amount of experimental data to train the DL models.However, large training data acquirement in the THz domain is challenging due to the requirements of environmental and system stability, as well as the time-consuming data acquisition process. To overcome this limitation, this paper incorporates a complete physical model representing the THz image formation process into traditional DL networks to retrieve the depth information of objects. The most significant advantage is the ability to use it without pre-training, thereby eliminating the need for tens of thousands of labeled data. Through experiments validation, we demonstrate that by providing diffraction patterns of planar objects with their upper and lower halves individually masked, the proposed physics-informed neural network (NN) can automatically optimize and, ultimately, reconstruct the depth of the object through interaction between the NN and a physical model. The obtained results represent the initial steps towards achieving fast holographic THz imaging using reference-free beams and low-cost power detection.</description>

      <title>Full Silicon Pillar-based 1D Optomechanical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomechanical resonators can serve as ultrasensitive, miniaturized force probes. While vertical structures like nanopillars are ideal for this purpose, transducing their motion is challenging. Pillar-based photonic crystals (PhCs) offer a potential solution by integrating optical transduction within the pillars. However, achieving high-quality PhCs is hindered by inefficient vertical light confinement. Here, we present a full-silicon 1D photonic crystal cavity based on nanopillars as a new platform with great potential for applications in force sensing and biosensing areas. Its unit cell consists of a silicon pillar with larger diameter at its top portion than at the bottom, which allows vertical light confinement and an energy bandgap in the near infrared range for transverse-magnetic (TM) polarization. We experimentally demonstrate optical cavities with Q-factors exceeding 1e3 constructed by inserting a defect within a periodic arrangement of this type of pillars. Given the fact that that each nanopillar naturally behaves as a nanomechanical cantilever, the fabricated geometries are excellent optomechanical (OM) photonic crystal cavities in which the mechanical motion of each nanopillar composing the cavity can be optically transduced. These novel geometries display enhanced mechanical properties, cost-effectiveness, integration possibilities, and scalability, and opens and new path in front of the widely used suspended Si beam OM cavities made on silicon-on-insulator.</description>

      <title>Capturing dynamics and thermodynamics of a three-level quantum heat engine via programmable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research employs the Kraus representation and Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem to model a three-level quantum heat on quantum circuits, investigating its dynamic evolution and thermodynamic performance. The feasibility of the dynamic model is validated by tracking the changes of population. On the basis of reinforcement learning algorithm, the optimal cycle of the quantum heat engine for maximal average power is proposed and verified by the thermodynamic model. The stability of quantum circuit simulations is scrutinized through a comparative analysis of theoretical and simulated results, predicated on an orthogonal test. These results affirm the practicality of simulating quantum heat engines on quantum circuits, offering potential for substantially curtailing the experimental expenses associated with the construction of such engines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our analysis suggests strongly that stationary pulses exist in nonlinear media with second-, third-, and fourth-order dispersion. A theory, based on the variational approach, is developed for finding approximate parameters of such solitons. It is obtained that the soliton velocity in the retarded reference frame can be different from the inverse of the group velocity of linear waves. It is shown that the interaction of the pulse spectrum with that of linear waves can affect the existence of stationary solitons. These theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations. Transformations between solitons of different systems are derived. A generalization for solitons in media with the highest even-order dispersion is suggested.</description>

      <title>Advances in laser-plasma interactions using intense vortex laser beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-intensity light beams carrying Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM), commonly known as vortex beams, have garnered significant attention due to promising applications in areas ranging from optical trapping to communication. In recent years, there has been a surge in global research exploring the potential of high-intensity vortex laser beams and specifically their interactions with plasmas. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent advances in this area. Compared to conventional laser beams, intense vortex beams exhibit unique properties such as twisted phase fronts, OAM delivery, hollow intensity distribution, and spatially isolated longitudinal fields. These distinct characteristics give rise to a multitude of rich phenomena, profoundly influencing laser-plasma interactions and offering diverse applications. The paper also discusses future prospects and identifies promising general research areas involving vortex beams. These areas include low-divergence particle acceleration, instability suppression, high-energy photon delivery with OAM, and the generation of strong magnetic fields. With growing scientific interest and application potential, the study of intense vortex lasers is poised for rapid development in the coming years.</description>

Abstract: Electric field-induced modulation of the optical properties is crucial for amplitude and phase modulators used in photonic devices. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the band geometry-induced electro-optic effect, specifically focusing on the Fermi surface and disorder-induced contributions. These contributions are crucial for metallic and semimetallic systems and for optical frequencies comparable to or smaller than the scattering rates. We highlight the importance of the quantum metric and metric connection in generating the electro-optic effect in parity-time reversal ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric systems such as CuMnAs. Our findings establish the electro-optic effect as a novel tool to probe band geometric effects and open new avenues to design electrically controlled efficient amplitude and phase modulators for photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Letter of Intent: Towards a Vacuum Birefringence Experiment at the Helmholtz International Beamline for Extreme Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum field theory predicts a nonlinear response of the vacuum to strong electromagnetic fields of macroscopic extent. This fundamental tenet has remained experimentally challenging and is yet to be tested in the laboratory. A particularly distinct signature of the resulting optical activity of the quantum vacuum is vacuum birefringence. This offers an excellent opportunity for a precision test of nonlinear quantum electrodynamics in an uncharted parameter regime. Recently, the operation of the high-intensity laser ReLaX provided by the Helmholtz International Beamline for Extreme Fields (HIBEF) has been inaugurated at the High Energy Density (HED) scientific instrument of the European XFEL. We make the case that this worldwide unique combination of an x-ray free-electron laser and an ultra-intense near-infrared laser together with recent advances in high-precision x-ray polarimetry, refinements of prospective discovery scenarios, and progress in their accurate theoretical modelling have set the stage for performing an actual discovery experiment of quantum vacuum nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling at room temperature with a centimeter-scale quartz crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brillouin-based optomechanical systems with high-frequency acoustic modes provide a promising platform for implementing quantum-information processing and wavelength conversion applications, and for probing macroscopic quantum effects. Achieving strong coupling through electrostrictive Brillouin interaction is essential for coupling the massive mechanical mode to an optical field, thereby controlling and characterizing the mechanical state. However, achieving strong coupling at room temperature has proven challenging due to fast mechanical decay rates, which increase the pumping power required to surpass the coupling threshold. Here, we report an optomechanical system with independent control over pumping power and frequency detuning to achieve and characterize the strong-coupling regime of a bulk acoustic-wave resonator. Through spectral analysis of the cavity reflectivity, we identify clear signatures of strong coupling, i.e., normal-mode splitting and an avoided crossing in the detuned spectra, while estimating the mechanical linewidth $\Gamma_m/2\pi~=~7.13MHz$ and the single-photon coupling rate $g_0/2\pi~=~7.76Hz$ of our system. Our results provide valuable insights into the performances of room-temperature macroscopic mechanical systems and their applications in hybrid quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a 783-MHz fundamental repetition rate mode-locked Er-doped all-fiber ring laser with a pulse width of 623 fs. By using carbon nanotubes (CNT) saturable absorber (SA), a relatively low self-starting pump threshold of 108 mW is achieved. The laser has a very compact footprint less than 10 cm * 10 cm, benefiting from the all-active-fiber cavity design. The robust mode-locking is confirmed by the low relative intensity noise (RIN) and a long-term stability test. We propose a new scheme for generating high repetition rate femtosecond optical pulses from a compact and stable all-active-fiber ring oscillator.</description>

      <title>A silicon photonics waveguide-coupled colloidal quantum dot photodiode sensitive beyond 1.6 um</title>

Abstract: Silicon photonics faces a persistent challenge in extending photodetection capabilities beyond the 1.6 um wavelength range, primarily due to the lack of appropriate epitaxial materials. Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) present a promising solution here, offering distinct advantages such as infrared wavelength tunability, cost-effectiveness, and facile deposition. Their unique properties position them as a potential candidate for enabling photodetection in silicon photonics beyond the conventional telecom wavelength, thereby expanding the potential applications and capabilities within this domain. In this study, we have successfully integrated lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot photodiodes (QDPDs) onto silicon waveguides using standard process techniques. The integrated photodiodes exhibit a remarkable responsivity of 1.3 A/W (with an external quantum efficiency of 74.8%) at a wavelength of 2.1 um, a low dark current of only 106 nA and a bandwidth of 1.1 MHz under a -3 V bias. To demonstrate the scalability of our integration approach, we have developed a compact 8-channel spectrometer incorporating an array of QDPDs. This achievement marks a significant step toward realizing a cost-effective photodetector solution for silicon photonics, particularly tailored for a wide range of sensing applications around the 2 um wavelength range.</description>

      <title>Dispersion and absorption effects in the linearized Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics under an external magnetic field</title>

Abstract: The effects of the Ohmic and magnetic density currents are investigated in the linearized Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics. The linearization is introduced through an external magnetic field, in which the vector potential of the Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics is expanded around of a magnetic background field, that we consider uniform and constant in this paper. From the Euler-Heisenberg linearized equations, we obtain the solutions for the refractive index associated with the electromagnetic wave superposition, when the current density is ruled by the Ohm law, and in the second case, when the current density is set by a isotropic magnetic conductivity. These solutions are functions of the magnetic background $({\bf B})$, of the wave propagation direction $({\bf k})$, it also depends on the conductivity, and on the wave frequency. As consequence, the dispersion and the absorption of plane waves change when ${\bf B}$ is parallel to ${\bf k}$ in relation to the case of ${\bf B}$ perpendicular to ${\bf k}$ in the medium. The characteristics of the refraction index related to directions of ${\bf B}$ and of the wave polarization open a discussion for the birefringence in this medium.</description>

      <title>Intensity product-based optical sensing to beat the diffraction limit in an interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classically defined minimum uncertainty of the optical phase is known as the standard quantum limit or shot-noise limit (SNL) originating in the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics. Based on SNL, the phase sensitivity is inversely proportional to the square root K, where K is the number of interfering photons or statistically measured events. Thus, using a high-power laser is advantageous to enhance sensitivity due to the square root K gain in the signal-to-noise ratio. In a typical interferometer, however, the resolution remains in the diffraction limit of the K=1 case unless the interfering photons are resolved as in quantum sensing. Here, a projection-measurement method in quantum sensing is adapted for an interferometer to achieve an additional square root K gain in resolution. For the projection measurement, the interference fringe of an interferometer can be Kth-powered to replace the Kth-order intensity product. To understand many-wave interference-caused enhanced resolution, several types of interferometers are numerically compared to draw corresponding resolution parameters. As a result, the achieved resolution by the Kth power to an N-slit interferometer exceeds the diffraction limit and the Heisenberg limit in quantum sensing.</description>
