      <title>Impact of the history force on the motion of droplets in shaken liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets and solid particles in unsteady flows are affected by the Basset-Boussinesq history force (BBH), in addition to stationary viscous friction, inertia, and gravity. The BBH is often neglected, not because this is generally justified, but because its inclusion in calculations is usually difficult. To assess the significance of BBH for particle dynamics, we revisit unsteady Stokes flows around spherical particles or droplets and derive from first-principles the analytical expressions for the velocity around the particles and the forces acting on them. This includes the case of time-varying radii for gas bubbles and also graphical representations of how the BBH force arises from transient, diffusion-driven vortex structures around particles. Applying these results to sedimentation of heavy or rising light particles or droplets in horizontally shaken fluids (i.e., periodically accelerated), we find that within certain parameter ranges, BBH can reduce the particle deflection amplitude by more than 60\% relative to the fluid motion. Our (analytical) results show that the BBH effects become large in the transition region between the low-frequency viscous Stokes regime and the regime dominated by high-frequency inertia. On this basis, we also derive a power law for the amplitude of the periodic particle displacement, which can be unambiguously attributed to the BBH and directly identified in experiments. For light particles such as gas bubbles, the dominant contribution to inertial forces comes from the added mass, and the BBH acting on gas bubbles is more important for their dynamics than in the case of heavy particles such as droplets in air or metal beads in water.</description>

      <title>Computational simulation of thermal processes in ncs production plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a computational simulation of the fluid dynamics and heat transfer phenomena that occur inside combustion chamber, and flat and semispherical open evaporators used in NCS non-centrifugal sugar industry. The study estimates the effect of primary/secondary air ratio and excess air in the combustion chamber performance resulting in an optimal value of 1.3 for the equivalence ratio in the lower section of combustion chamber. The influence of both mechanisms of heat transfer in the evaporating and concentrating steps of the production process were studied as well as other parameters like geometric configuration, composition of heating gases and flux regimes. To provide a tool for designers, some correlations for Nusselts number were developed. Several assumptions were made to reduce the computers capacity required, like surface at constant temperature, properties of gases modelled by polynomials and negligible radiation at low temperatures. The mechanism of boiling in the liquid that is being heated was not studied. With this model, the authors found that a specific geometric configuration yielded the best results for evaporating and concentrating sugar in the flat-with-fins open evaporator.</description>

      <title>Topological Entropy of Stationary Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological entropy serves as a viable candidate for quantifying mixing and complexity of a highly chaotic system. Particularly in turbulence, this is determined as the exponential stretching rate of a fluid material line that typically necessitates a Lagrangian description. We extend the recent work [A. Manoharan, S. Subramanian, and A. Joy, arXiv:2412.08996] to three dimensions, and present an exact Eulerian framework for the topological entropy in stationary turbulent flows that is devoid of free parameters. The only prerequisite is a distribution of eigenvalues of the local strain-rate tensor and their decorrelation times. This can be easily obtained from a single wire probe at a fixed location, thereby eliminating the need for Lagrangian particle tracking, which remains formidable due to chaotic nature of the flow. We believe that our results lend great utility in experiments aimed at understanding transport and mixing in many industrial and natural flows.</description>

      <title>Static Contact Angles of Mixtures: Classical Density Functional Theory and Experimental Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work assesses a classical density functional theory (DFT) model for predicting macroscopic static contact angles of pure substances and mixtures by comparison to own experimental data. We employ a DFT with a Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT) for the fluid-fluid interactions and an effective external potential for the solid-fluid interactions. The solid substrate is characterized by adjusting a single solid-solid interaction energy parameter to a single contact angle value of $n$-octane, while all other results are predictions based on Berthelot-Lorentz combining rules. The surface tensions between solid, liquid and vapor phases are determined from one-dimensional DFT calculations, and Young's equation is used to calculate the contact angle. A non-polar polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, Teflon) substrate is used, and experiments are carried out using the sessile droplet method with graphical evaluation of the contact angle. Accurate results are obtained for pure substances except for monohydric alcohols. Contact angles for monohydric alcohols are systematically overestimated, and we show that this is partially due to neglecting orientational effects. The approach provides accurate results for mixtures whenever the respective pure substance contact angle is described well. This comprises mixtures of non-polar, polar, and hydrogen bonding substances, including mixtures with water. Our results suggest that DFT based on PC-SAFT provides a fast and accurate method for prediction of contact angles for a wide range of pure substances and mixtures.</description>

      <title>Vortex-Induced Drag Forecast for Cylinder in Non-uniform Inflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, a physics-based data-driven strategy is developed to predict vortex-induced drag on a circular cylinder under non-uniform inflow conditions - a prevalent issue for engineering applications at moderate Reynolds numbers. Traditional pressure-signal-based models exhibit limitations due to complex vortex dynamics coupled with non-uniform inflow. To address this issue, a modified fully connected neural network (FCNN) architecture is established that integrates upstream velocity measurements (serving as an inflow calibration) with pressure-signal-based inputs to enhance predictive capability (R^2 ~ 0 to 0.75). Direct numerical simulations (DNS) at Reynolds number Re = 4000 are implemented for model training and validation. Iterative optimizations are conducted to derive optimized input configurations of pressure sensor placements and velocity components at upstream locations. The optimized model achieves an R^2 score of 0.75 in forecasting high-amplitude drag coefficient fluctuations (C_d=0.2 - 1.2) within a future time window of one time unit. An exponential scaling between model performance and optimized pressure signal inputs is observed, and the predictive capability of sparsely distributed but optimized sensors is interpreted by the scaling. The optimized sensor placements correspond to the physical mechanism that the flow separation dynamics play a governing role in vortex-induced drag generation. This work advances machine learning applications in fluid-structure interaction systems, offering a scalable strategy for forecasting statistics in turbulent flows under real-world engineering conditions.</description>

      <title>Surrogate normal-forms for the numerical bifurcation and stability analysis of navier-stokes flows via machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the Equation-Free multiscale modeling approach, we demonstrate how the embed-learn-lift framework enables the construction of surrogate normal-forms, namely minimal-dimensional reduced-order models (ROMs), from high-fidelity Navier-Stokes simulations. These surrogate models are then used for efficient and accurate bifurcation and stability analysis. The framework proceeds in four steps. First, manifold learning reveals the intrinsic latent dimension of the high-dimensional spatio-temporal Navier-Stokes dynamics across parameter space. Second, we construct low-dimensional "normal-form" like ROMs on this latent space using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), capturing the emergent dynamics. Third, using these models, we apply numerical bifurcation tools to compute bifurcation diagrams and perform stability analysis in the latent space. This includes tracing branches of limit cycles arising from Andronov-Hopf bifurcations - tasks intractable in full space due to computational cost. Finally, solving the pre-image problem allows reconstruction of the bifurcation structure in the original high-dimensional space. We demonstrate the methodology on two canonical flows: wake flow past an infinite circular cylinder and planar sudden-expansion channel flow. These exhibit Andronov-Hopf and pitchfork bifurcations, respectively, as Reynolds number increases. Our method identifies the latent dimensionality and constructs GPR-based surrogate normal-forms that enable the tracing and stability analysis of bifurcating solutions, including limit cycles, their period, and stability via Floquet multipliers.</description>

      <title>Boundary integral equation analysis for spheroidal suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a fast, spectrally accurate method for the evaluation of boundary integral operators (BIOs) on a suspension of prolate and oblate spheroids. We first derive formulas for the standard layer potential operators for the Laplace equation applied to an expansion of the integral densities in the appropriate spheroidal harmonic basis. These then lead to analytical expressions in solid harmonics that allow spectrally accurate evaluation of near-field particle interactions. Finally, a standard quadrature scheme is used to evaluate smooth, far-field interactions; these are then accelerated using the fast multipole method.
  Through a number of numerical test cases, we verify the accuracy and efficiency of our BIO evaluation framework for dense, polydisperse suspensions of spheroids. Through the use of standard formulas linking Stokes and Laplace potentials, we show our scheme can be readily applied to problems involving particulate suspension flows. For both Laplace and Stokes, our method allows us to evaluate BIOs for suspensions up to hundreds of particles on a single processor.</description>

      <title>A generic framework for extending Miles' approach to wind-wave interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the energy transfer from wind to waves is an important but complex topic, typically based on phenomenology, on pure numerics, or on technically challenging analysis, carried out on a case by case basis. Here we show that the approach by Miles, initially proposed for a still and infinitely deep ocean of inviscid water, is in fact generic: it can easily be adapted, as we demonstrate directly from the mathematical structure of the arguments put forward by Miles. We establish simple transformations, which infer wave growth rates in complex hydrodynamic situations directly from those in Miles' conditions, without any adjustable parameters. The corresponding conversion factors are determined from the hydrodynamic water pressure produced by a propagating surface wave, and can be determined without requiring to further analyse wind and air flow. We reproduce a variety of results for different hydrodynamic situations to show how such generalisations can be achieved with surprisingly simple calculations and without any additional numerical effort, which should make the approach interesting for real-life applications.</description>

      <title>Exact solution for the passive scalar in decaying turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the exact analytic solution for the one-point distribution of a passive scalar in decaying homogeneous turbulence, in the limit of vanishing viscosity and diffusivity at fixed Schmidt number. The velocity statistics are governed by the Euler ensemble, obtained previously as the spontaneously stochastic solution to the loop equation derived from the Navier-Stokes equations in the extreme turbulent limit. The resulting advection-diffusion problem is solved explicitly via loop calculus. For an initially localized scalar distribution, the solution develops a sequence of concentric spherical shells with a quantized, piecewise-parabolic radial profile of temperature with a finite limit at the center -- an outcome not predicted by conventional theories. This shell structure is a unique solution of the transport equation within the Euler ensemble, but may be smeared by finite diffusivity or forcing. It represents the geometric skeleton of scalar transport in ideal turbulence, and may be relevant in astrophysical or quantum-fluid regimes where dissipation is negligible. This work redefines expectations for scalar mixing in the high-Reynolds-number limit.</description>

      <title>On the influence of electrolytic gradient orientation on phoretic transport in dead-end pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrolytic diffusiophoresis refers to directional migration of colloids due to interfacial forces that develop in response to local electrolytic concentration ($c$) gradients. This physicochemical transport provides an efficient alternative in numerous microscale applications where advection-induced transport is infeasible. Phoretic withdrawal and injection in dead-end pores can be controlled by orienting salt gradients into or out of the pore; however, the extent to which this orientation influences spatiotemporal transport patterns is not thoroughly explored. In this study, we find that it has a significant influence: colloidal withdrawal in solute-out mode ($\beta=c_\infty/c_{\text{pore}}&lt;1$) is faster and shallower, whereas the solute-in mode enables deeper withdrawal. Similarly, solute-out injection features rapidly propagating wavefronts, whereas the solute-in mode ($\beta &gt;1$) promotes uniform and gradual injection. Each mode's transport is found to evolve and persist over different time scales. We characterize the performance of these modes and find that while persistence of the solute-out mode strengthens with a growing electrolytic gradient [$\sim \ln(\beta^{-0.4})$], solute-in mode diminishes and eventually its persistence is insensitive to $\beta$. We also incorporate the variable mobility model to examine the impact of large zeta potentials, which intensifies the transport of solute-out mode further and weakens the solute-in mode. Additionally, we investigate how osmotic flows of the two modes affect injection and withdrawal patterns. We find that osmosis-induced mixing can counterintuitively inhibit injection effectiveness in solute-out mode. These insights bring attention to the distinctions between different phoretic transport modes and contribute to the rational design and setup of electrolytic gradients in numerous microscale applications.</description>
