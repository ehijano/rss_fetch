      <title>Geophysics-informed neural network for model-based seismic inversion using surrogate point spread functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based seismic inversion is a key technique in reservoir characterization, but traditional methods face significant limitations, such as relying on 1D average stationary wavelets and assuming an unrealistic lateral resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a Geophysics-Informed Neural Network (GINN) that integrates deep learning with seismic modeling. This novel approach employs a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) to simultaneously estimate Point Spread Functions (PSFs) and acoustic impedance (IP). PSFs are divided into zero-phase and residual components to ensure geophysical consistency and to capture fine details. We used synthetic data from the SEAM Phase I Earth Model to train the GINN for 100 epochs (approximately 20 minutes) using a 2D UNet architecture. The network's inputs include positional features and a low-frequency impedance (LF-IP) model. A self-supervised loss function combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) was employed to ensure accurate results. The GINN demonstrated its ability to generate high-resolution IP and realistic PSFs, aligning with expected geological features. Unlike traditional 1D wavelets, the GINN produces PSFs with limited lateral resolution, reducing noise and improving accuracy. Future work will aim to refine the training process and validate the methodology with real seismic data.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Nanoscale Friction on Illite Clay: Effects of Solvent Salt Ions and Electric Double Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quick clay is a highly sensitive soil that transforms rapidly from solid to liquid under minor stress, as a result of long-term salt leaching that drastically reduces shear strength. Stabilizing it is both costly and carbon-intensive, significantly impacting construction emissions in regions like Norway. Developing greener stabilization methods is challenging due to limited understanding of the weakening mechanisms and the specific roles of different salts. In this study, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the sliding behavior of illite platelets, the key component in Norwegian quick clay, and how it is affected by the different ions in the solution surrounding the surface. We examine the impact of monovalent (NaCl, KCl, CsCl) and divalent (MgCl2 and CaCl2) salts on platelet-surface interactions, focusing on the friction enhancement brought by divalent salts and how the electric double layer (EDL) structure mediates frictional behavior. We find that divalent cations sit higher on top of the surface, and lead to an increase in friction, while monovalent cations sit closer to the surface. By providing a detailed analysis of these interactions, the study offers a novel framework for understanding the role of salts in clay mechanics and highlights opportunities to design environmentally friendly stabilizers as alternatives to traditional lime and cement.</description>

      <title>Integrating Newton's Laws with deep learning for enhanced physics-informed compound flood modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coastal communities increasingly face compound floods, where multiple drivers like storm surge, high tide, heavy rainfall, and river discharge occur together or in sequence to produce impacts far greater than any single driver alone. Traditional hydrodynamic models can provide accurate physics-based simulations but require substantial computational resources for real-time applications or risk assessments, while machine learning alternatives often sacrifice physical consistency for speed, producing unrealistic predictions during extreme events. This study addresses these challenges by developing ALPINE (All-in-one Physics Informed Neural Emulator), a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework to enforce complete shallow water dynamics in compound flood modeling. Unlike previous approaches that implement partial constraints, our framework simultaneously enforces mass conservation and both momentum equations, ensuring full adherence to Newton's laws throughout the prediction process. The model integrates a convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with ConvLSTM temporal processing, trained using a composite loss function that balances data fidelity with physics-based residuals. Using six historical storm events (four for training, one for validation, and one held-out for unseen testing), we observe substantial improvements over baseline neural networks. ALPINE reduces domain-averaged prediction errors and improves model skill metrics for water surface elevation and velocity components. Physics-informed constraints prove most valuable during peak storm intensity, when multiple flood drivers interact and reliable predictions matter most. This approach yields a physically consistent emulator capable of supporting compound-flood forecasting and large-scale risk analyses while preserving physical realism essential for coastal emergency management.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Surface Wave Inversion for 3D Shear Wave Velocity Structure Beneath the British Isles: comparing Direct-3D Variational Inversion to Two-step (2D+1D) Inversion Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test the extent to which surface wave inversion results for three-dimensional shear wave velocity structure depend on the tomography scheme employed, by comparing two standard two-step 2D+1D inversion methods which use variational inversion, Metropolis-Hastings and reversible jump Monte Carlo, against a direct-3D inversion method. While it is possible to calculate a Monte Carlo based solution for the 2-step methods since they neglect lateral spatial correlations, a direct-3D Monte Carlo inversion proved too high-dimensional to achieve statistical convergence. We therefore created a new variational method which can solve the direct-3D tomographic problem efficiently. We tested the methods in an inversion for 3D seismic velocity models of the subsurface of the British Isles extending to a depth of 20km, given surface Love wave dispersion data derived from ambient seismic noise. We repeated the tests using a 3D synthetic velocity model consisting of a checkerboard of lower and higher shear velocities. The direct-3D and one of the two-step methods used the same order of computations to achieve apparently acceptable subsurface images. However, the direct-3D scheme preserved better lateral continuity, and produced synthetic data simulations that align more closely with observed data than those from the two-step inversions, thus demonstrating higher inversion accuracy. The inversion results are consistent with the known geology of the British Isles, and for the first time provide clear seismologically imaged evidence that seismic structure related to the Great Glen Fault extends to depths of at least 9 km. On the basis of these and other previous results, we suggest that direct-3D inversion schemes should be adopted for surface wave inversion as they provide improved results at little or no additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models for multivariate subsurface generation and efficient probabilistic inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance. Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data, individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <title>Universal path decomposition of transfer and scattering matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a universal identity: any entry of a one-dimensional transfer or scattering matrix comprising N layers equals a coherent sum of 2**(N-1) directed paths representing wave patterns with pre-defined amplitude and phase evolutions. Treating those paths as analytic building blocks, we derive closed-form results for arbitrary stratified media - optical, acoustic, elastic, or electronic - without resorting to matrix products or recursion. The combinatorial construction of paths turns layered system design into rule-based path engineering, illustrated with a design example that offers a reinterpretation of the quarter-wavelength principle. We also quantify the computational speed-up of the path method over classical transfer-matrix chaining and showcase two more cross-disciplinary applications (site-response seismology and quantum superlattices). This paradigm replaces numerical sweeps that employ the transfer matrix method with physically-transparent path-construction rules; its applicability spans across physical disciplines and scales: from nanometer optical coatings to kilometer-scale seismic strata.</description>

      <title>Automated Classification of Volcanic Earthquakes Using Transformer Encoders: Insights into Data Quality and Model Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precisely classifying earthquake types is crucial for elucidating the relationship between volcanic earthquakes and volcanic activity. However, traditional methods rely on subjective human judgment, which requires considerable time and effort. To address this issue, we developed a deep learning model using a transformer encoder for a more objective and efficient classification. Tested on Mount Asama's diverse seismic activity, our model achieved high F1 scores (0.930 for volcano tectonic, 0.931 for low-frequency earthquakes, and 0.980 for noise), superior to a conventional CNN-based method. To enhance interpretability, attention weight visualizations were analyzed, revealing that the model focuses on key waveform features similarly to human experts. However, inconsistencies in training data, such as ambiguously labeled B-type events with S-waves, were found to influence classification accuracy and attention weight distributions. Experiments addressing data selection and augmentation demonstrated the importance of balancing data quality and diversity. In addition, stations within 3 km of the crater played an important role in improving model performance and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of Transformer-based models for automated volcanic earthquake classification, particularly in improving efficiency and interpretability. By addressing challenges such as data imbalance and subjective labeling, our approach provides a robust framework for understanding seismic activity at Mount Asama. Moreover, this framework offers opportunities for transfer learning to other volcanic regions, paving the way for enhanced volcanic hazard assessments and disaster mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Carbon removal capacity estimation of taiga reforestation and afforestation at the western boreal edge using spatially explicit carbon budget modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Canada's northern boreal forest edge offers considerable potential for climate change mitigation through large-scale tree planting. Afforestation in these sparsely forested regions could assist the natural northward migration of forests while capitalizing on their carbon removal capacity. However, the sequestration potential is uncertain due to a lack of spatially explicit models. This study uses Monte Carlo estimates and a carbon budget model to quantify the carbon removal capacity of afforestation at the northwestern boreal edge from 2025 to 2100. We combined satellite inventory data and probabilistic fire regime representations to simulate total ecosystem carbon under scenarios considering fire return intervals, land classes, planting mortality, and climate variables. Our results indicate that afforesting ~6.4-32 million hectares could sequester ~3.88-19.4 Gigatonnes of $CO_{2}$e over the next 75 years, with the Taiga Shield West ecozone showing the most potential. Even the conservative estimate (3.88 Gt$CO_{2}$e) is over five times Canada's total annual greenhouse gas emissions, making it a substantial contribution toward the nation's 2050 net-zero goal. Further research is needed to refine these estimates, assess economic viability, and investigate impacts on regional processes like permafrost thaw and surface albedo.</description>
