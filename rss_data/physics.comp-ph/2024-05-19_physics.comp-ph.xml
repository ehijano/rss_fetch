      <title>First principles simulations of dense hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the properties of hydrogen at high compression is crucial for astrophysics (e.g. planetary and stellar interiors, brown dwarfs, atmosphere of compact stars) and laboratory experiments, including inertial confinement fusion. There exists experimental data for the equation of state, conductivity, and Thomson scattering spectra. However, the analysis of the measurements at extreme pressures and temperatures typically involves additional model assumptions, which makes it difficult to assess the accuracy of the experimental data. rigorously. On the other hand, theory and modeling have produced extensive collections of data. They originate from a very large variety of models and simulations including path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations, density functional theory (DFT), chemical models, machine-learned models, and combinations thereof. At the same time, each of these methods has fundamental limitations (fermion sign problem in PIMC, approximate exchange-correlation functionals of DFT, inconsistent interaction energy contributions in chemical models, etc.), so for some parameter ranges accurate predictions are difficult. Recently, a number of breakthroughs in first principle PIMC and DFT simulations were achieved which are discussed in this review. Here we use these results to benchmark different simulation methods. We present an update of the hydrogen phase diagram at high pressures, the expected phase transitions, and thermodynamic properties including the equation of state and momentum distribution. Furthermore, we discuss available dynamic results for warm dense hydrogen, including the conductivity, dynamic structure factor, plasmon dispersion, imaginary-time structure, and density response functions. We conclude by outlining strategies to combine different simulations to achieve accurate theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical transient undisturbed velocity correction scheme for wall-bounded two-way coupled Euler-Lagrange simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper, we model the velocity disturbance generated by a regularized forcing near a planar wall, which, along with the temporal nature of the forcing, provides an estimate of the unsteady velocity disturbance of the particle near a planar wall. We use the analytical solution for a singular in-time transient Stokeslet near a planar wall (Felderhof, 2009) and derive the corresponding time-persistent Stokeslets. The velocity disturbance due to a regularized forcing is then obtained numerically via a discrete convolution with the regularization kernel. The resulting Green's functions for parallel and perpendicular regularized forcing to the wall are stored as pre-computed temporal correction maps. By storing the time-dependent particle force on the fluid as fictitious particles, we estimate the unsteady velocity disturbance generated by the particle as a scalar product between the stored forces and the pre-computed Green's functions. Since the model depends on the analytical Green's function solution of the singular Stokeslet near a planar wall, the obtained velocity disturbance exactly satisfies the no-slip condition and does not require any fitted parameters to account for the rapid decay of the disturbance near the wall. The numerical evaluation of the convolution integral makes the present method suitable for arbitrary regularization kernels. Additionally, the generation of parallel and perpendicular correction maps enables to estimate the velocity disturbance due to particle motion in arbitrary directions relative to the local flow. The convergence of the method is studied on a fixed particle near a planar wall, and verification tests are performed on a settling particle parallel to a wall and a free-falling particle perpendicular to the wall.</description>

      <title>Dynamic In-context Learning with Conversational Models for Data Extraction and Materials Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the extraction of data from unstructured scholarly papers. However, ensuring data trustworthiness remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce PropertyExtractor, an open-source tool that leverages advanced conversational LLMs like Google Gemini-Pro and OpenAI GPT-4, blends zero-shot with few-shot in-context learning, and employs engineered prompts for the dynamic refinement of structured information hierarchies, enabling autonomous, efficient, scalable, and accurate identification, extraction, and verification of material property data. Our tests on material data demonstrate precision and recall exceeding 93% with an error rate of approximately 10%, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the toolkit. We apply PropertyExtractor to generate a database of 2D material thicknesses, a critical parameter for device integration. The rapid evolution of the field has outpaced both experimental measurements and computational methods, creating a significant data gap. Our work addresses this gap and showcases the potential of PropertyExtractor as a reliable and efficient tool for the autonomous generation of diverse material property databases, advancing the field.</description>

      <title>Building imaginary-time thermal filed theory with artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel approach in quantum field theories to estimate the action using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). The estimation is achieved by learning on system configurations governed by the Boltzmann factor, $e^{-S}$ at different temperatures within the imaginary time formalism of thermal field theory. We focus on 0+1 dimensional quantum field with kink/anti-kink configurations to demonstrate the feasibility of the method. The continuous-mixture autoregressive networks (CANs) enable the construction of accurate effective actions with tractable probability density estimation. Our numerical results demonstrate that this methodology not only facilitates the construction of effective actions at specified temperatures but also adeptly estimates the action at intermediate temperatures using data from both lower and higher temperature ensembles. This capability is especially valuable for the detailed exploration of phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>Local Time-Stepping for the Shallow Water Equations using CFL Optimized Forward-Backward Runge-Kutta Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is a well known, necessary condition for the stability of explicit time-stepping schemes that effectively places a limit on the size of the largest admittable time-step for a given problem. We formulate and present a new local time-stepping (LTS) scheme optimized, in the CFL sense, for the shallow water equations (SWEs). This new scheme, called FB-LTS, is based on the CFL optimized forward-backward Runge-Kutta schemes from Lilly et al. (2023). We show that FB-LTS maintains exact conservation of mass and absolute vorticity when applied to the TRiSK spatial discretization (Ringler et al., 2010), and provide numerical experiments showing that it retains the temporal order of the scheme on which it is based (second order). In terms of computational performance, we show that when applied to a real-world test case on a highly-variable resolution mesh, the MPAS-Ocean implementation of FB-LTS is up to 10 times faster than the classical four-stage, fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4), and 2.3 times faster than an existing strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta based LTS scheme (LTS3). Despite this significant increase in efficiency, the solutions produced by FB-LTS are qualitatively equivalent to those produced by both RK4 and LTS3.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning of Accurate Surrogates for Simulations of Complex Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.12855v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly used to build computationally inexpensive surrogates for complex physical models. The predictive capability of these surrogates suffers when data are noisy, sparse, or time-dependent. As we are interested in finding a surrogate that provides valid predictions of any potential future model evaluations, we introduce an online learning method empowered by optimizer-driven sampling. The method has two advantages over current approaches. First, it ensures that all turning points on the model response surface are included in the training data. Second, after any new model evaluations, surrogates are tested and "retrained" (updated) if the "score" drops below a validity threshold. Tests on benchmark functions reveal that optimizer-directed sampling generally outperforms traditional sampling methods in terms of accuracy around local extrema, even when the scoring metric favors overall accuracy. We apply our method to simulations of nuclear matter to demonstrate that highly accurate surrogates for the nuclear equation of state can be reliably auto-generated from expensive calculations using a few model evaluations.</description>

      <title>Mapping flagellated swimmers to surface-slip driven swimmers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05121v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flagellated microswimmers are ubiquitous in natural habitats. Understanding the hydrodynamic behavior of these cells is of paramount interest, owing to their applications in bio-medical engineering and disease spreading. Since the last two decades, computational efforts have been continuously improved to accurately capture the complex hydrodynamic behavior of these model systems. However, modeling the dynamics of such swimmers with fine details is computationally expensive due to the large number of unknowns and the small time-steps required to solve the equations. In this work we propose a method to map fully resolved flagellated microswimmers to coarse, active slip driven swimmers which can be simulated at a reduced computational cost. Using the new method, the slip driven swimmers move with the same velocity, to machine precision, as the flagellated swimmers and generate a similar flow field with a controlled accuracy. The method is validated for swimming patterns near a no-slip boundary, interactions between swimmers and scattering with large obstacles.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Quantum Turbulence: Pushing the Limits of High-Performance Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultracold atoms provide a platform for analog quantum computer capable of simulating the quantum turbulence that underlies puzzling phenomena like pulsar glitches in rapidly spinning neutron stars. Unlike other platforms like liquid helium, ultracold atoms have a viable theoretical framework for dynamics, but simulations push the edge of current classical computers. We present the largest simulations of fermionic quantum turbulence to date and explain the computing technology needed, especially improvements in the ELPA library that enable us to diagonalize matrices of record size (millions by millions). We quantify how dissipation and thermalization proceed in fermionic quantum turbulence by using the internal structure of vortices as a new probe of the local effective temperature. All simulation data and source codes are made available to facilitate rapid scientific progress in the field of ultracold Fermi gases.</description>

      <title>Noise-Tolerant Quantum Algorithm for Ground State Energy Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is to simulate physical systems, leveraging their inherent quantum behavior to achieve an advantage over classical computation. In this work, we present a noise-tolerant Hamiltonian simulation algorithm for ground-state energy estimation. Our method surmounts stochastic sampling limitations to estimate expectation values. It is based on an adaptive sequence of fuzzy bisection searches to estimate the ground state energy digit by digit, with a trade-off between increasing the simulation time and decreasing the absolute error rate. It builds upon the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) algorithm, and it delivers good approximations in simulations with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to 1e-3, specifically for Hamiltonians that anti-commute with a Pauli string. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with different system Hamiltonians, system sizes, and time evolution encoding methods on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance with other existing methods and show that we can consistently achieve two to three orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.</description>
