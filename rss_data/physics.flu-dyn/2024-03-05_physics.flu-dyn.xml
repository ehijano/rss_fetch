      <title>Modal analysis of high-fidelity simulations in turbomachinery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit recently published high-fidelity implicit large eddy simulation datasets obtained with a high-order discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method and analyse them using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD). The first configuration is the MTU T161 low-pressure turbine cascade with resolved end wall boundary layers in a clean version and one with incoming turbulent wakes. We focus on the behaviour of the laminar separation bubble and the secondary flow system and how these phenomena are affected by incoming wakes. The second configuration is a transonic compressor cascade in which we analyse the unsteady behaviour of the shock wave boundary layer interaction. Throughout the paper, we try to discuss not only the flow physics but also insights into how the modal decomposition techniques can help facilitate understanding and where their limitations are.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and physical validity in modeling turbomachinery PIV data by Physics-Informed CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data is a valuable asset in fluid mechanics. It is capable of visualizing flow structures even in complex physics scenarios, such as the flow at the exit of the rotor of a centrifugal fan. Machine learning is also a successful companion to PIV in order to increase data resolution or impute experimental gaps. While classical algorithms focus solely on replicating data using statistical metrics, the application of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) contributes to both data reconstruction and adherence to governing equations. The present study utilizes a convolutional physics-informed auto-encoder to reproduce planar PIV fields in the gappy regions while also satisfying the mass conservation equation. It proposes a novel approach, which compromises experimental data reconstruction for compliance with physical restrictions. Simultaneously, it is aimed to ensure that the reconstruction error does not considerably deviate from the uncertainty band of the test data. Turbulence scale approximation is employed to set the relative weighting of the physical and non-physical terms in the loss function to ensure that both objectives are achieved. All steps are initially evaluated on a set of DNS data to demonstrate the general capability of the network. Finally, examination of the PIV data indicates that the proposed PINN auto-encoder can enhance reconstruction accuracy by about 28% and 29% in terms of mass conservation residual and velocity statistics, respectively, in expense of up to 5% increase in the number of vectors with reconstruction error higher than the uncertainty band of the PIV test data.</description>

      <title>Wave and turbulence separation using dynamic mode decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Separating the effects of waves and turbulence in oceanographic time series is an ongoing challenge because surface wave motion and turbulence fluctuations can occur at overlapping frequencies. As a result, simple bandpass filters cannot effectively separate their dynamics. While more advanced decomposition techniques have been developed, they often entail restrictive assumptions about the wave and turbulence interactions, require synchronized measurements, and/or only decompose the signal spectrally without a time-series reconstruction. To overcome these restrictions, we aim to apply modern data-driven methods to this classical problem by using dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). In this study, we present our new wave-turbulence decomposition technique which uses DMD. The technique is designed to be signal-agnostic such that it can be applied to any generic time series. Our approach requires minimal tuning, where the main user input is the wave frequency range of interest. To demonstrate the method, we apply it to synthetic, field, and laboratory data, and compare the results to other published methods in the literature. We conduct a sensitivity analysis on the synthetic data and find that the most sensitive parameter to the accuracy is the rank truncation in the DMD. Additionally, because of the accuracy of our decomposition technique, we demonstrate how we are able to analyze the velocity autocorrelation of the separated turbulence time series with minimal contamination by the waves. Overall, we find that our decomposition method outperforms the other time-series decomposition methods and provides for robust separation of the waves and turbulence, demonstrating that it is a promising technique with wide application to ocean signal processing.</description>

      <title>Data-driven transient lift attenuation for extreme vortex gust-airfoil interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a data-driven feedforward control to attenuate large transient lift experienced by an airfoil disturbed by an extreme level of discrete vortex gust. The current analysis uses a nonlinear machine-learning technique to compress the high-dimensional flow dynamics onto a low-dimensional manifold. While the interaction dynamics between the airfoil and extreme vortex gust are parameterized by its size, gust ratio, and position, the wake responses are well-captured on this simple manifold. The effect of extreme vortex disturbance about the undisturbed baseline flows can be extracted in a physically-interpretable manner. Furthermore, we call on phase-amplitude reduction to model and control the complex nonlinear extreme aerodynamic flows. The present phase-amplitude reduction model reveals the sensitivity of the dynamical system in terms of the phase shift and amplitude change induced by external forcing with respect to the baseline periodic orbit. By performing the phase-amplitude analysis for a latent dynamical model identified by sparse regression, the sensitivity functions of low-dimensionalized aerodynamic flows for both phase and amplitude are derived. With the phase and amplitude sensitivity functions, optimal forcing can be determined to quickly suppress the effect of extreme vortex gusts towards the undisturbed states in a low-order space. The present optimal flow modification built upon the machine-learned low-dimensional subspace quickly alleviates the impact of transient vortex gusts for a variety of extreme aerodynamic scenarios, providing a potential foundation for flight of small-scale air vehicles in adverse atmospheric conditions.</description>

      <title>Long-time fractalisation of liquid films undergoing thermocapillary instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of viscous thin film flow has led to the development of highly nonlinear partial differential equations that model how the evolution of the film height is affected by different forces. We investigate a model of interaction between surface tension and the thermocapillary Marangoni effect, with a particular focus on the long-time limit. In this limit, the model predicts patterns that repeat on successively smaller spatial scales near points where the film thickness vanishes. By solving the governing equation in a space- and time-rescaled coordinate system, we observe the dynamics much further in time than has previously been achieved. Our numerical results suggest that patterns form on a close to, but not exactly, geometrically decreasing scale, potentially approaching a geometric scale very slowly as time tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Eckart streaming with nonlinear high-order harmonics: an example at gigahertz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic streaming shows great potential in applications such as bubble dynamics, cell aggregation, and nano-sized particle isolation in the biomedical and drug industries. As the acoustic shock distance decreases with the increase of incident frequency, the nonlinear propagation effect will play a role in acoustic streaming, e.g., Eckart (bulk) streaming at a few gigahertz (GHz). However, the theory of source terms of bulk streaming is still missing at this stage when high-order acoustic harmonics play a role. In this paper, we derive the source term including the contribution of higher-order harmonics. The streaming-induced hydrodynamic flow is assumed to be incompressible and no shock wave occurs during the nonlinear acoustic propagation as restricted by the traditional Goldberg number \Gamma &lt; 1 or \Gamma \approx 1 which indicates the importance of nonlinearity relative to dissipation. The derived force terms allow evaluating bulk streaming with high-order harmonics at GHz and provide an exact expression compared to the existing empirical formulas. Numerical results show that the contribution of higher-order harmonics increases the streaming flow velocity by more than 20%. We show that the expression introduced by Nyborg should be avoided in numerical computations as it includes part of the acoustic radiation force that does not lead to acoustic streaming.</description>

      <title>Inertia onset in disordered porous media flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the very onset of the inertial regime in pore-scale fluid flow in a three-dimensional, disordered porous media. We analyze how the flow structure changes with increasing Reynolds number. In particular, we compute tortuosity, spatial kinetic energy localization, and the pore-space volume fraction containing negative streamwise velocity. Our analysis shows that the onset of inertia observed in a standard way by computing the friction factor appears at a Reynolds number two orders of magnitude higher than indicated by analyzing tortuosity and spatial distribution of kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Slender vortex filaments in the Boussinesq Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for the motion of slender vortex filaments is extended to include the effect of gravity. The model, initially introduced by Callegari and Ting (SIAM, J. of App. Math., (1978), vol. 35, pp. 148-175), is based on a matched asymptotic expansion in which the outer solution, given by the Biot-Savart law, is matched with the inner solution derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on recent work by Harikrishnan et al (Phys. of Fluids, (2023), vol. 35) the Boussinesq approximation is applied such that the density variations only enter in the gravity term. However, unlike Harikrishnan et al. (2023) the density variation enters at a lower order in the asymptotic expansion, and thus has a more significant impact on the self-induced velocity of the vortex filament. In this regime, which corresponds to the regime studied by Chang and Smith (J. of Fl. Mech., (2018), vol. 857), the effect of gravity is given by an alteration of the core constant, which couples the motion of the filament to the motion within the vortical core, in addition to a change in the compatability conditions (evolution equations) which determine the leading order azimuthal and tangential velocity fields in the vortex core. The results are used to explain certain properties of bouyant vortex rings, as well as qualitatively explore the impact of gravity on tornado type atmospheric vorticies.</description>

      <title>Pair correlation function of vorticity in a coherent vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the correlations of vorticity fluctuations inside a coherent vortex resulting from the inverse energy cascade in two-dimensional turbulence. The presence of a coherent flow, which is a differential rotation, suppresses small-scale fluctuations of the flow, which are created by an external force, and lead to the fact that these fluctuations can be considered as non-interacting and, therefore, examined in a linear approximation. We calculate the pair correlation function of vorticity and demonstrate that it has a power-law behavior both in space and in time. The obtained results allow us to start a systematic study of the effects associated with the nonlinear interaction of fluctuations, which play an essential role on the periphery of a coherent vortex. Our results are also applicable to the statistics of a passive scalar in a strong shear flow.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin representation for the Navier-Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum representation for Newtonian viscous fluid flows by establishing a mapping between the Navier-Stokes equation (NSE) and the Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation (SPE). The proposed nonlinear SPE incorporates the two-component wave function and the imaginary diffusion. Consequently, classical fluid flow can be interpreted as a non-Hermitian quantum spin system. Using the SPE-based numerical simulation of viscous flows, we demonstrate the quantum/wave-like behavior in flow dynamics. Furthermore, the SPE equivalent to the NSE can facilitate the quantum simulation of fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local stability guarantees for data-driven quadratically nonlinear models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Navier Stokes equations (NSEs) are partial differential equations (PDEs) to describe the nonlinear convective motion of fluids and they are computationally expensive to simulate because of their high nonlinearity and variables being fully coupled. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are simpler models for evolving the flows by capturing only the dominant behaviors of a system and can be used to design controllers for high-dimensional systems. However it is challenging to guarantee the stability of these models either globally or locally. Ensuring the stability of ROMs can improve the interpretability of the behavior of the dynamics and help develop effective system control strategies. For quadratically nonlinear systems that represent many fluid flows, the Schlegel and Noack trapping theorem (JFM, 2015) can be used to check if ROMs are globally stable (long-term bounded). This theorem was subsequently incorporated into system identification techniques that determine models directly from data. In this work, we relax the quadratically energy-preserving constraints in this theorem, and then promote local stability in data-driven models of quadratically nonlinear dynamics. First, we prove a theorem outlining sufficient conditions to ensure local stability in linear-quadratic systems and provide an estimate of the stability radius. Second, we incorporate this theorem into system identification methods and produce a-priori locally stable data-driven models. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>The first law of thermodynamics in hydrodynamic steady and unsteady flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied planar compressible flows of ideal gas as models of a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system. We demonstrate that internal energy $U(S^{*},V,N)$ of such systems in stationary and non-stationary states is the function of only three parameters of state, i.e. non-equilibrium entropy $S^{*}$, volume $V$ and number of particles $N$ in the system. Upon transition between different states, the system obeys the first thermodynamic law, i.e. $dU=T^{*}dS^{*}-p^{*}dV+{\mu}^{*}dN$, where $U=3/2 NRT^{*}$ and $p^{*}V=NRT^{*}$. Placing a cylinder inside the channel, we find that U depends on the location of the cylinder $y_{c}$ only via the parameters of state, i.e. $U(S^{*}(y_{c}),V,N(y_{c}))$ at V=const. Moreover, when the flow around the cylinder becomes unstable, and velocity, pressure, and density start to oscillate as a function of time, t, U depends on t only via the parameters of state, i.e. $U(S^{*}(t),V,N(t))$ for V=const. These examples show that such a form of internal energy is robust and does not depend on the particular boundary conditions even in the unsteady flow.</description>

      <title>Implicit high-order gas-kinetic schemes for compressible flows on three-dimensional unstructured meshes II: unsteady flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the simulations of unsteady flow, the global time step becomes really small with a large variation of local cell size. In this paper, an implicit high-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) is developed to remove the restrictions on the time step for unsteady simulations. In order to improve the efficiency and keep the high-order accuracy, a two-stage third-order implicit time-accurate discretization is proposed. In each stage, an artificial steady solution is obtained for the implicit system with the pseudo-time iteration. In the iteration, the classical implicit methods are adopted to solve the nonlinear system, including the lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LUSGS) and generalized minimum residual (GMRES) methods. To achieve the spatial accuracy, the HGKSs with both non-compact and compact reconstructions are constructed. For the non-compact scheme, the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction is used. For the compact one, the Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstruction is adopted due to the updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their derivatives. The expected third-order temporal accuracy is achieved with the two-stage temporal discretization. For the smooth flow, only a single artificial iteration is needed. For uniform meshes, the efficiency of the current implicit method improves significantly in comparison with the explicit one. For the flow with discontinuities, compared with the well-known Crank-Nicholson method, the spurious oscillations in the current schemes are well suppressed. The increase of the artificial iteration steps introduces extra reconstructions associating with a reduction of the computational efficiency. Overall, the current implicit method leads to an improvement in efficiency over the explicit one in the cases with a large variation of mesh size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a turbulence-sustaining mechanism in a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate, which is based on the chaotic nature of internal spin dynamics. Magnetic driving induces a complete chaotic evolution of the local spin state, thereby continuously randomizing the spin texture of the condensate to maintain the turbulent state. We experimentally demonstrate the onset of turbulence in the driven condensate as the driving frequency changes and show that it is consistent with the regular-to-chaotic transition of the local spin dynamics. This chaos-assisted turbulence establishes the spin-driven spinor condensate as an intriguing platform for exploring quantum chaos and related superfluid turbulence phenomena.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced drift in Marangoni-driven transport of surfactant: a Lagrangian perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Successive drops of coloured ink mixed with surfactant are deposited onto a thin film of water to create marbling patterns in the Japanese art technique of Suminagashi. To understand the physics behind this and other applications where surfactant transports adsorbed passive matter at gas-liquid interfaces, we investigate the Lagrangian trajectories of material particles on the surface of a thin film of a confined viscous liquid under Marangoni-driven spreading by an insoluble surfactant. We study a model problem in which several deposits of exogenous surfactant simultaneously spread on a bounded rectangular surface containing a pre-existing endogenous surfactant. We derive Eulerian and Lagrangian formulations of the equations governing the Marangoni-driven surface flow. Both descriptions show how confinement can induce drift and flow reversal during spreading. The Lagrangian formulation captures trajectories without the need to calculate surfactant concentrations; however, concentrations can still be inferred from the Jacobian of the map from initial to current particle position. We explore a link between thin-film surfactant dynamics and optimal transport theory to find the approximate equilibrium locations of material particles for any given initial condition by solving a Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We find that, as the endogenous surfactant concentration $\delta$ vanishes, the equilibrium shapes of deposits using the Monge-Amp\`ere approximation approach polygons with corners curving in a self-similar manner over lengths scaling as $\delta^{1/2}$. We explore how Suminagashi patterns may be produced by using computationally efficient successive solutions of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel data-driven reduced-order model for complex dynamics, including nonlinear, multi-attractor, multi-frequency, and multiscale behaviours. The starting point is a fully automatable cluster-based network model (CNM) (Li et al. J. Fluid Mech. vol.906, 2021, A21) which kinematically coarse-grains the state with clusters and dynamically predicts the transitions in a network model. In the proposed dynamics-augmented CNM (dCNM), the prediction error is reduced with trajectory-based clustering using the same number of centroids. The dCNM is first exemplified for the Lorenz system and then implemented for the three-dimensional sphere wake featuring periodic, quasi-periodic and chaotic flow regimes. For both plants, the dCNM significantly outperforms the CNM in resolving the multi-frequency and multiscale dynamics. This increased prediction accuracy is obtained by stratification of the state space aligned with the direction of the trajectories. Thus, the dCNM has numerous potential applications to a large spectrum of shear flows, even for complex dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Using experiments and a depth-averaged numerical model, we study instabilities of two-phase flows in a Hele-Shaw channel with an elastic upper boundary and a non-uniform cross-section prescribed by initial collapse. Experimentally, we find increasingly complex and unsteady modes of air-finger propagation as the dimensionless bubble speed, Ca, and level of collapse are increased, including pointed fingers, indented fingers and the feathered modes first identified by Cuttle et al.(J. Fluid Mech., vol. 886, 2020, A20). By introducing a measure of the viscous contribution to finger propagation, we identify a Ca threshold beyond which viscous forces are superseded by elastic effects. Quantitative prediction of this transition between 'viscous' and 'elastic' reopening regimes across levels of collapse establishes the fidelity of the numerical model. In the viscous regime, we recover the non-monotonic dependence on Ca of the finger pressure, which is characteristic of benchtop models of airway reopening. To explore the elastic regime numerically, we extend the depth-averaged model introduced by Fontana et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 916, 2021, A27) to include an artificial disjoining pressure which prevents the unphysical self-intersection of the interface. Using time simulations, we capture for the first time the majority of experimental finger dynamics, including feathered modes. We show that these disordered states continually evolve, with no evidence of convergence to steady or periodic states. We find that the steady bifurcation structure satisfactorily predicts the bubble pressure as a function of Ca, but that it does not provide sufficient information to predict the transition to unsteady dynamics which appears strongly nonlinear.</description>

      <title>Dual theory of decaying turbulence. 2. Numerical simulation and continuum limit</title>

Abstract: This is the second paper in a cycle investigating the exact solution of loop equations in decaying turbulence. We perform numerical simulations of the Euler ensemble, suggested in the previous work, as a solution to the loop equations. We designed novel algorithms for simulation, which take a small amount of computer RAM so that only the CPU time grows linearly with the size of the system and its statistics. This algorithm allows us to simulate systems with billions of discontinuity points on our fractal curve, dual to the decaying turbulence. For the vorticity correlation function, we obtain \textbf{quantum fractal laws} with regime changes between universal discrete values of indexes. The traditional description of turbulence with fractal or multifractal scaling laws does not apply here. The measured conditional probabilities of fluctuating variables are smooth functions of the logarithm of scale, with statistical errors being negligible at our large number of random samples $T = 167,772,160$ with $N = 200,000,000$ points on a fractal curve. The quantum jumps arise from the analytical distribution of scaling variable $X = \frac{\cot^2(\pi p/q)}{q^2}$ where $\frac{p}{q}$ is a random fraction. This distribution is related to the totient summatory function and is a discontinuous function of $X$. In particular, the energy spectrum is a devil's staircase with tilted uneven steps with slopes between $-1$ and $-2.03$. The logarithmic derivative of energy decay $n(t)$ as a function of time is jumping down the stairs of universal levels between $1.50$ and $1.53$. The quantitative verification of this quantization would require more precise experimental data.</description>

      <title>Data-driven nonlinear turbulent flow scaling with Buckingham Pi variables</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear machine learning for turbulent flows can exhibit robust performance even outside the range of training data. This is achieved when machine-learning models can accommodate scale-invariant characteristics of turbulent flow structures. This study presents a data-driven approach to reveal scale-invariant vortical structures across Reynolds numbers that provide insights for supporting nonlinear machine-learning-based studies of turbulent flows. To uncover conditions for which nonlinear models are likely to perform well, we use a Buckingham Pi-based sparse nonlinear scaling to find the influence of the Pi groups on the turbulent flow data. We consider nonlinear scalings of the invariants of the velocity gradient tensor for an example of three-dimensional decaying isotropic turbulence. The present scaling not only enables the identification of vortical structures that are interpolatory and extrapolatory for the given flow field data but also captures non-equilibrium effects of the energy cascade. As a demonstration, the present findings are applied to machine-learning-based super-resolution analysis of three-dimensional isotropic turbulence. We show that machine-learning models reconstruct vortical structures well in the interpolatory space with reduced performance in the extrapolatory space revealed by the nonlinearly scaled invariants. The present approach enables us to depart from labeling turbulent flow data with a single parameter of Reynolds number and comprehensively examine the flow field to support training and testing of nonlinear machine-learning techniques.</description>
