      <title>Transient growth and nonlinear breakdown of wavelet-based resolvent modes in turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effectiveness of the time-localised principal resolvent forcing mode at actuating the near wall cycle of turbulence. The mode is restricted to a wavelet pulse and computed from an SVD of the windowed wavelet-based resolvent operator so that it produces the largest amplification via the linearised Navier-Stokes equations. We then inject this time-localised mode into the turbulent minimal flow unit at different intensities, and measure the instantaneous deviation of the system's response from the optimal resolvent response mode. This is possible under the new formulation, which enables the modes to represent transient trajectories. For the most energetic spatial wave numbers in the minimal flow unit -- constant in the streamwise direction and once-periodic in the spanwise direction -- the forcing mode takes the shape of streamwise rolls and produces a response mode in the form of streamwise streaks that transiently grow and decay. For initial times and close to the wall, the DNS response matches the principal response mode well, but due to nonlinearities, the response across all forcing intensities decays prematurely, and a higher forcing intensity leads to faster energy decay. The principal forcing mode still leads to significant energy amplification and is more effective than a randomly-generated forcing structure and the second suboptimal resolvent forcing mode at amplifying the near-wall streaks. We compute the nonlinear energy transfer to secondary modes and observe that the breakdown of the actuated mode proceeds similarly across all forcing intensities: in the near-wall region, the induced streak forks into a structure twice periodic in the spanwise direction; in the outer region, the streak breaks up into a structure that is once periodic in the streamwise direction. In both regions, spanwise gradients account for the dominant share of nonlinear energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Using wetting and ultrasonic waves to extract oil from oil/water mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oil and water phases placed on top of a solid surface respond differently to a MHz-level surface acoustic wave (SAW) propagating in the solid due to their different surface tensions and the corresponding capillary stresses. We observe that, under SAW excitation, oil films are extracted continuously from sessile drops of silicone-oil/water/surfactant mixtures. The mechanism responsible for the extraction of oil from the mixtures is the acoustowetting phenomenon: the low surface tension oil phase leaves the mixture in the form of `fingers' that initially spread over the solid in the direction transverse to that of the SAW. Once away from the drop the oil spreads on the solid surface in the direction opposite that of the SAW, as in classic studies on acoustowetting. The high surface tension water phase remains at rest. Increasing the SAW intensity and oil content in the mixtures enhances the rate at which oil leaves the emulsion. We further observe that the oil film develops free surface instabilities in the form of periodic spatial variations, as well as the formation of spatial gradients in the emulsion concentrations in the presence of SAW. Our study suggests the potential for using SAW to remove oil from oil-in-water mixtures to facilitate the small-scale separation of water and oil phases. Furthermore, we describe the peculiar physical effects leading to acoustic-capillary flow instabilities and SAW-induced emulsion dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the estimation of specific interfacial areas in self-aerated flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a short clarification on the definition of specific interfacial areas in self-aerated flows, thereby distinguishing between the specific interfacial area related to the volume of an air-water mixture, and the specific interfacial area related to the water volume. This distinction is important when it comes to solving the air-water mass transfer equation, as there has been some misconception on the past. It is hoped that this contribution will help to clarify on these basic fundamentals, which is anticipated to be important for the future development and application of advanced air-water mass transfer models to self-aerated flows.</description>

      <title>Phototactic Bioconvection in a Rotating Isotropic Porous Medium: Linear Stability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the linear stability of phototactic bioconvection in a rotating porous medium under collimated light, incorporating the effects of critical intensity, Darcy number, and Taylor number. Using a mathematical model and the MATLAB Bvp4c solver, the critical Rayleigh number and wavenumber for instability onset are identified. The results reveal that higher Darcy numbers enhance instability, increasing the wavelength of bioconvection patterns, while rotation exerts a stabilizing effect by limiting vertical motion and confining fluid dynamics to the horizontal plane. Additionally, an increase in critical intensity amplifies instability. Furthermore, the study explores the transition between oscillatory and stationary solutions, highlighting the role of rotational dynamics in altering instability modes. These findings provide novel insights into the interplay of phototaxis, rotation, and porous media, advancing the understanding of bioconvective systems with potential applications in environmental engineering, biophysics, and geophysical fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Confinement suppresses the effect of rotation on convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) to study the effect of bi-lateral confinement, i.e., the effect of aspect ratio, on the Rayleigh number (Ra) for the onset of wall-mode convection ($Ra_{wm}$) in rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) for various Ekman number E ($10^{-2}{\le}E{\le}10^{-5}$) and aspect ratio ${\Gamma}$ ($0.08{\le}{\Gamma}{\le}5$). For a given E, as the aspect ratio is lowered from a large value, $Ra_{wm}$ initially decreases slowly, reaching a minimum at ${\Gamma}={\Gamma}_{min}$ (${\Gamma}_{min}{\sim}E^{0.09}$). As ${\Gamma}$ is decreased further below ${\Gamma}_{min}$, $Ra_{wm}$ increases rapidly and for sufficiently strong confinement, i.e., ${\Gamma}&lt;{\Gamma}_{\ast}$ (${\Gamma}_{\ast}{\sim}E^{\frac{1}{3}}$), becomes indistinguishable from $Ra_{c}$, the critical Rayleigh number for non-rotating RBC, at the same ${\Gamma}$. We designate the ranges ${\Gamma}_{min}&lt;{\Gamma}&lt;5$ as the 'confinement-affected' regime and ${\Gamma}&lt;{\Gamma}_{\ast}$ as the 'spatially constrained' regime. For a given rotation rate, the spatially constrained regime extends to higher Ra as the aspect ratio is decreased. We propose that in this regime, strong lateral confinement suppresses the horizontal velocity, and hence the Coriolis force, rendering rotation ineffective over most of the domain.</description>

      <title>Internal Aerodynamics of Supersonic Crossflows with Transverse Liquid Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study experimentally investigates the internal aerodynamics of transverse liquid injection in a supersonic crossflow (Mach (M) = 2.1) using two configurations: single and tandem (8 mm spacing) at three injection mass flow rates. Back-lit imaging revealed classical jet breakup phenomena, including surface wave instabilities with increasing amplitudes along the jet boundary, leading to protrusions, breakup into large liquid clumps, and their disintegration into finer droplets under aerodynamic forces. The single injection exhibited the formation of large liquid clumps further downstream compared to the tandem injection. Schlieren imaging showed that at a low momentum flux ratio (J = 0.94), both configurations produced regular reflection (RR) of the bow shock wave from the top wall. Increasing J to 1.90 resulted in RR for the single injection, while the tandem injection transitioned to Mach reflection (MR). At J = 2.67, both configurations exhibited MR. The earlier RR-to MR transition in tandem injection is attributed to its higher jet penetration and spanwise spread, which reduce the downstream crossflow passage area, acting as a supersonic diffuser and increasing downstream pressure which is favorable for MR transition. Separation zones were observed at the bottom wall due to bow shock wave-boundary layer interaction, and at the side walls due to the interaction of the Mach stem of the MR structure with the walls. These interactions create complex flow regions dominated by vortex structures, significantly influencing the overall flow dynamics.</description>

      <title>Wetting simulation of the porous structure of a heat pipe using an eXtended Discontinuous Galerkin Method and a Parameterized Level-Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform high-order simulations of two-phase flows in capillaries, with and without evaporation. Since a sharp-interface model is used, singularities can arise at the three-phase contact line, where the fluid-fluid interface interacts with the capillary wall. These singularities are especially challenging when a highly accurate, high-order method with very little numerical diffusion is used for the flow solver. In this work, we employ the eXtended Discontinuous Galerkin (XDG) method, which has a very high accuracy but a severe limit regarding e.g., the time-step restriction.
  To address this challenge and enhance the stability of our numerical method we introduce a novel approach for representing a moving interface in the case of two-phase flows. We propose a global analytical representation of the interface-describing level-set field, defined by a small set of time-dependent parameters. Noteworthy for its simplicity and efficiency, this method effectively addresses the inherent complexity of two-phase flow problems. Furthermore, it significantly improves numerical stability and enables the use of larger time steps, ensuring both reliability and computational efficiency in our simulations.
  We compare different analytic expressions for level-set representation, including the elliptic function and the fourth-order polynomial, and validate the method against established literature data for capillary rise, both with and without evaporation. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in resolving complex interfacial dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal amplitude equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider fluid flows for which the linearized Navier-Stokes operator is strongly non-normal. The responses of such flows to external perturbations are spanned by a generically very large number of (non-orthogonal) eigenmodes. They are therefore qualified as ``nonmodal" responses, to insist on the inefficiency of the eigenbasis to describe them. For the purpose of this article to reduce the dimension of the system in a weakly nonlinear regime, (eigen)modal reduction techniques, such as the center manifold, are thus inappropriate precisely because the leading-order dynamics cannot be restricted to a low-dimensional eigensubspace. On the other hand, it is often true that only a small number (we assume one) of singular modes is sufficient to reconstruct the nonmodal responses at the leading order. By adopting the latter paradigm, we propose a method to analytically derive a weakly nonlinear amplitude equation for the nonmodal response of a fluid flow to a small harmonic forcing, stochastic forcing, and initial perturbation, respectively. The present approach is simpler than the one we previously proposed, for neither the operator perturbation nor the ensuing compatibility condition were formally necessary. When applied to the stochastic response, the present method makes it possible to derive an amplitude equation that is substantially easier to solve than the one we proposed previously. Despite being concerned with the response to external disturbances of three different natures, the derivations of the amplitude equations all proceed by the same general principle. Eventually, the three derived amplitude equations are tested in three distinct flows. At extremely low numerical cost as compared to fully nonlinear techniques, they can predict the weakly nonlinear modification of the gains as the flow departs from the linear regime by increasing the amplitude of the external excitation.</description>

      <title>Second-order theory for multi-hinged directional wavemakers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second-order directional wavemaker theory for regular and irregular waves is extended to multi-hinged wavemakers and combined piston--flap wavemaker systems. Derived expressions enable second-order signal correction, common in single-hinged wavemakers, to be applied to multi-hinged systems. Multi-hinged wavemakers offer additional degrees of freedom, with different combinations of paddle motion producing the same progressive wave. This is here exploited to better understand wavemaker behaviour. Single-harmonic signals are computed for double-hinged wavemakers that suppress spurious waves without introducing double-harmonic motions. Surprisingly, these flap motions are almost always in opposite phase, with the larger draft found underneath the water surface. %contradicting to assumptions from earlier studies. Due to the opposing paddle phase, the double-hinged wavemaker draft is usually smaller than the corresponding single-hinged draft. The ability of thsee systems to suppress spurious waves with single-harmonic motion is verified experimentally. The wavemaker theory further supports an arbitrary number of flap hinges, enabling the approximation of a fully flexible wavemaker through piecewise-linear segments. This is demonstrated with an exponential wavemaker profile that does not generate any evanescent waves at linear order. Such a wavemaker is likely to limit wave breaking and cross-modes, but is found to produce spurious second-order waves of a magnitude comparable to a single flap. The presented solution is complete, intrinsically including return flow through the second-order zero mode. This return flow is found to precisely match the Stokes drift.</description>

      <title>Sliding dynamics of a particle in a soap film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sliding dynamics of a millimeter-sized particle trapped in a horizontal soap film. Once released, the particle moves toward the center of the film in damped oscillations. We study experimentally and model the forces acting on the particle, and evidence the key role of the mass of the film on its shape and particle dynamics. Not only is the gravitational distortion of the film measurable, it completely determines the force responsible for the motion of the particle - the catenoid-like deformation induced by the particle has negligible effect on the dynamics. Surprisingly, this is expected for all film sizes as long as the particle radius remains much smaller than the film width. We also measure the friction force, and show that ambient air and the film contribute almost equally to the friction. The theoretical model that we propose predicts exactly the friction coefficient as long as inertial effects can be neglected in air (for the smallest and slowest particles). The fit between theory and experiments sets an upper boundary of 0.01 {\mu}Pa s m for the surface viscosity, in excellent agreement with recent interfacial microrheology measurements.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for modelling unstructured grid data in computational physics: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unstructured grid data are essential for modelling complex geometries and dynamics in computational physics. Yet, their inherent irregularity presents significant challenges for conventional machine learning (ML) techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive review of advanced ML methodologies designed to handle unstructured grid data in high-dimensional dynamical systems. Key approaches discussed include graph neural networks, transformer models with spatial attention mechanisms, interpolation-integrated ML methods, and meshless techniques such as physics-informed neural networks. These methodologies have proven effective across diverse fields, including fluid dynamics and environmental simulations. This review is intended as a guidebook for computational scientists seeking to apply ML approaches to unstructured grid data in their domains, as well as for ML researchers looking to address challenges in computational physics. It places special focus on how ML methods can overcome the inherent limitations of traditional numerical techniques and, conversely, how insights from computational physics can inform ML development. To support benchmarking, this review also provides a summary of open-access datasets of unstructured grid data in computational physics. Finally, emerging directions such as generative models with unstructured data, reinforcement learning for mesh generation, and hybrid physics-data-driven paradigms are discussed to inspire future advancements in this evolving field.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design with Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient method for the automation of inverse design in science and engineering. Based on simple least-square regression, the underlying dynamic mode decomposition algorithm can be used to construct a low-rank subspace spanning multiple experiments in parameter space. The proposed inverse design dynamic mode composition (ID-DMD) algorithm leverages the computed low-dimensional subspace to enable fast digital design and optimization on laptop-level computing, including the potential to prescribe the dynamics themselves. Moreover, the method is robust to noise, physically interpretable, and can provide uncertainty quantification metrics. The architecture can also efficiently scale to large-scale design problems using randomized algorithms in the ID-DMD. The simplicity of the method and its implementation are highly attractive in practice, and the ID-DMD has been demonstrated to be an order of magnitude more accurate than competing methods while simultaneously being 3-5 orders faster on challenging engineering design problems ranging from structural vibrations to fluid dynamics. Due to its speed, robustness, interpretability, and ease-of-use, ID-DMD in comparison with other leading machine learning methods represents a significant advancement in data-driven methods for inverse design and optimization, promising a paradigm shift in how to approach inverse design in practice.</description>

      <title>A mesh-constrained discrete point method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle-based methods are a practical tool in computational fluid dynamics, and novel types of methods have been proposed. However, widely developed Lagrangian-type formulations suffer from the nonuniform distribution of particles, which is enhanced over time and result in problems in computational efficiency and parallel computations. To mitigate these problems, a mesh-constrained discrete point (MCD) method was developed for stationary boundary problems (Matsuda et al., 2022). Although the MCD method is a meshless method that uses moving least-squares approximation, the arrangement of particles (or discrete points (DPs)) is specialized so that their positions are constrained in background meshes to obtain a closely uniform distribution. This achieves a reasonable approximation for spatial derivatives with compact stencils without encountering any ill-posed condition and leads to good performance in terms of computational efficiency. In this study, a novel meshless method based on the MCD method for incompressible flows with moving boundaries is proposed. To ensure the mesh constraint of each DP in moving boundary problems, a novel updating algorithm for the DP arrangement is developed so that the position of DPs is not only rearranged but the DPs are also reassigned the role of being on the boundary or not. The proposed method achieved reasonable results in numerical experiments for well-known moving boundary problems.</description>

Abstract: We carried out high-resolution large-eddy simulations (LESs) to investigate the effects of several separation-control approaches on a NACA4412 wing section with spanwise width of $L_z = 0.6$ at an angle of attack of $AoA=11^{\circ}$ at a Reynolds number of $Re_c = 200,000$ based on chord length $c$ and free-stream velocity $U_{\infty}$. Two control strategies were considered: (1) steady uniform blowing and/or suction on the suction and/or pressure sides, and (2) periodic control on the suction side. A wide range of control configurations were evaluated in terms of aerodynamic efficiency (i.e., lift-to-drag ratio) and separation delay. Uniform blowing and/or suction effectively delayed flow separation, leading to a lift increase of up to $11\%$, but yielded only marginal improvements in aerodynamic efficiency. In contrast, periodic control neither enhanced separation delay nor improved efficiency. A detailed analysis of the interaction between uniform blowing and/or suction and turbulent boundary layers (TBLs) over the wing was performed, including assessments of (1) integral boundary-layer quantities, (2) turbulence statistics, and (3) power-spectral densities. Significant modifications in Reynolds stresses and spectral characteristics were observed. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first numerical study utilizing high-resolution LESs to provide comprehensive assessments on separation control.</description>

      <title>FullSWOF: A free software package for the simulation of shallow water flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4125</link>
      <description>arXiv:1401.4125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of flows are required for numerous applications, and are usually carried out using shallow water equations. We describe the FullSWOF software which is based on up-to-date finite volume methods and well-balanced schemes to solve this kind of equations. It consists of a set of open source C++ codes, freely available to the community, easy to use, and open for further development. Several features make FullSWOF particularly suitable for applications in hydrology: small water heights and wet-dry transitions are robustly handled, rainfall and infiltration are incorporated, and data from grid-based digital topographies can be used directly. A detailed mathematical description is given here, and the capabilities of FullSWOF are illustrated based on analytic solutions and datasets of real cases. The codes, available in 1D and 2D versions, have been validated on a large set of benchmark cases, which are available together with the download information and documentation at http://www.univ-orleans.fr/mapmo/soft/FullSWOF/.</description>

      <title>Large-time behavior of the 2D thermally non-diffusive Boussinesq equations with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05400v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the large-time behavior of a buoyancy-driven fluid without thermal diffusion under Navier-slip boundary conditions in a bounded domain with Lipschitz-continuous second derivatives. After establishing improved regularity for classical solutions, we analyze their large-time asymptotics. Specifically, we show that the solutions converge to a state where, as $t \rightarrow \infty$, $\|u\|_{W^{1,p}} \rightarrow 0$, and hydrostatic balance is achieved in the weak topology of $L^2$. Furthermore, we identify the necessary conditions under which stable stratification and hydrostatic balance can be achieved in the strong topology as time approaches infinity. We then analyze a particular steady state, the hydrostatic equilibrium, characterized by $ u = 0 $, $ \theta = \beta x_2 + \gamma $, and $ p = \frac{\beta}{2}x_2^2 + \gamma x_2 + \delta $. In a periodic strip, we establish the linear stability of this state for $\beta &gt; 0$, indicating that the temperature is vertically stably stratified. This work builds upon the results in [Doering et al.], which focus on free-slip boundary conditions, as well as recent studies [Ayd{\i}n, Kukavica, Ziane; Ayd{\i}n, Jayanti] that address no-slip boundary conditions. Notably, the novelty of this study lies in the ability to directly bound the pressure term, made possible by the Navier-slip boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Integrating Neural Operators with Diffusion Models Improves Spectral Representation in Turbulence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We integrate neural operators with diffusion models to address the spectral limitations of neural operators in surrogate modeling of turbulent flows. While neural operators offer computational efficiency, they exhibit deficiencies in capturing high-frequency flow dynamics, resulting in overly smooth approximations. To overcome this, we condition diffusion models on neural operators to enhance the resolution of turbulent structures. Our approach is validated for different neural operators on diverse datasets, including a high Reynolds number jet flow simulation and experimental Schlieren velocimetry. The proposed method significantly improves the alignment of predicted energy spectra with true distributions compared to neural operators alone. This enables the diffusion models to stabilize longer forecasts through diffusion-corrected autoregressive rollouts, as we demonstrate in this work. Additionally, proper orthogonal decomposition analysis demonstrates enhanced spectral fidelity in space-time. This work establishes a new paradigm for combining generative models with neural operators to advance surrogate modeling of turbulent systems, and it can be used in other scientific applications that involve microstructure and high-frequency content.
