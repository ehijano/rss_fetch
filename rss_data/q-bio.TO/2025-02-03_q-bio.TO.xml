      <title>Geometric immunosuppression in CAR-T cell treatment: Insights from mathematical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for hematological malignancies, offering a targeted approach to cancer treatment. Understanding the complexities of CAR-T cell therapy within solid tumors poses challenges due to the intricate interactions within the tumor microenvironment. Mathematical modeling may serve as a valuable tool to unravel the dynamics of CAR-T cell therapy and improve its effectiveness in solid tumors. This study aimed to investigate the impact of spatial aspects in CAR-T therapy of solid tumors, utilizing cellular automata for modeling purposes. Our main objective was to deepen our understanding of treatment effects by analyzing scenarios with different spatial distributions and varying the initial quantities of tumor and CAR-T cells. Tumor geometry significantly influenced treatment efficacy in-silico, with notable differences observed between tumors with block-like arrangements and those with sparse cell distributions, leading to the concept of immune suppression due to geometrical effects. This research delves into the intricate relationship between spatial dynamics and the effectiveness of CAR-T therapy in solid tumors, highlighting the relevance of tumor geometry in the outcome of cellular immunotherapy treatments. Our results provide a basis for improving the efficacy of CAR-T cell treatments by combining them with other ones reducing the density of compact tumor areas and thus opening access ways for tumor killing T-cells.</description>

      <title>Effect of a new type of healthy and live food supplement on osteoporosis blood parameters and induced rheumatoid arthritis in Wistar rats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder, characterized by a decrease in bone strength and puts the individual at risk for fracture. On the other hand, rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease of unknown etiology that causes inflammation of the joints of the organs. Purpose Due to the destructive effects of these diseases and its increasing prevalence and lack of appropriate medication for treatment, the present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of a new type of healthy and live food supplement on rheumatoid arthritis and induced osteoporosis in rats. Methods In this research, healthy and live food powder were synthesized by a new and green route. This organic biomaterial was named NBS. The NBS food supplement had various vitamins, macro and micro molecules, and ingredients. The new healthy and nutritious diet showed that the use of this supplement led to the return of the parameters to normal levels. Results The concentration of 12.5 mg/ kg showed the least therapeutic effect and 50 mg/ kg had the highest therapeutic effect for osteoporosis. The results of blood parameters involved in inflammation in both healthy and patient groups showed that the use of complete adjuvant induction causes joint inflammation. In the study of the interaction of the concentrations, it was observed that the concentration of 50 mg/ kg had the highest therapeutic effect against the disease in the studied mice. Conclusion The results showed that the new healthy and viable supplement restores the blood osteoporotic and rheumatoid factors of the mice to normal.</description>

      <title>Single cell resolution 3D imaging and segmentation within intact live tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epithelial cells form diverse structures from squamous spherical organoids to densely packed pseudostratified tissues. Quantification of cellular properties in these contexts requires high-resolution deep imaging and computational techniques to achieve truthful three-dimensional (3D) structural features. Here, we describe a detailed step-by-step protocol for sample preparation, imaging and deep-learning-assisted cell segmentation to achieve accurate quantification of fluorescently labelled individual cells in 3D within live tissues. We share the lessons learned through troubleshooting 3D imaging of Drosophila wing discs, including considerations on the choice of microscopy modality and settings (objective, sample mounting) and available segmentation methods. In addition, we include a computational pipeline alongside custom code to assist replication of the protocol. While we focus on the segmentation of cell outlines from membrane labelling, this protocol applies to a wide variety of samples, and we believe it be valuable for studying other tissues that demand complex analysis in 3D.</description>
