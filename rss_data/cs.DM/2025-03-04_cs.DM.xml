      <title>Interval H-graphs : Recognition and forbidden obstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the class of interval $H$-graphs, which is the generalization of interval graphs, particularly interval bigraphs. For a fixed graph $H$ with vertices $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_k$, we say that an input graph $G$ with given partition $V_1,\dots,V_k$ of its vertices is an interval $H$-graph if each vertex $v \in G$ can be represented by an interval $I_v$ from a real line so that $u \in V_i$ and $v \in V_j$ are adjacent if and only if $a_ia_j$ is an edge of $H$ and intervals $I_u$ and $I_v$ intersect. $G$ is called interval $k$-graph if $H$ is a complete graph on $k$ vertices. and interval bigraph when $k=2$. We study the ordering characterization and forbidden obstructions of interval $k$-graphs and present a polynomial-time recognition algorithm for them. Additionally, we discuss how this algorithm can be extended to recognize general interval $H$-graphs. Special cases of interval $k$-graphs, particularly comparability interval $k$-graphs, were previously studied in [2], where the complexity interval $k$-graph recognition was posed as an open problem.</description>

      <title>On the time complexity of finding a well-spread perfect matching in bridgeless cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm for finding a perfect matching in a $3$-edge-connected cubic graph that intersects every $3$-edge cut in exactly one edge. Specifically, we propose an algorithm with a time complexity of $O(n \log^4 n)$, which significantly improves upon the previously known $O(n^3)$-time algorithms for the same problem. The technique we use for the improvement is efficient use of cactus model of 3-edge cuts. As an application, we use our algorithm to compute embeddings of $3$-edge-connected cubic graphs with limited number of singular edges (i.e., edges that are twice in the boundary of one face) in $O(n \log^4 n)$ time; this application contributes to the study of the well-known Cycle Double Cover conjecture.</description>

      <title>$K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs admit quasi-isometry with additive distortion to graphs of tree-width at most two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of edge contractions and vertex deletions. Otherwise, $G$ is $H$-induced minor-free. In this paper, we prove that $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs admit a quasi-isometry with additive distortion to graphs with tree-width at most two. Our result implies that a recent conjecture of Nguyen et al. [Coarse tree-width (2025)] holds for $K_{2,3}$-induced minor-free graphs.</description>

      <title>Soft Barycentric Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soft Barycentric refinement preserves manifolds with or without boundary. In every dimension larger than one, there is a universal spectral central limiting measure that has affinities with the Barycentric limiting measure one dimension lower. Ricci type quantities like the length of the dual sphere of co-dimension-2 simplex stay invariant under soft refinements. We prove that the dual graphs of any manifold can be colored with 3 colors, which is in the 2-dimensional case a special case of the Groetzsch theorem. It follows that the vertices of a soft Barycentric refined q-manifold G' can be colored by q+1 or q+2 colors.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Metaheuristic Vehicle Routing Problem for Security Dispatch Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimization of the Vehicle Routing Problem for Security Dispatch (VRPSD). VRPSD focuses on security and patrolling applications which involve challenging constraints including precise timing and strict time windows. We propose three algorithms based on different metaheuristics, which are Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS), Tabu Search (TS), and Threshold Accepting (TA). The first algorithm combines single-phase ALNS with TA, the second employs a multiphase ALNS with TA, and the third integrates multiphase ALNS, TS, and TA. Experiments are conducted on an instance comprising 251 customer requests. The results demonstrate that the third algorithm, the hybrid multiphase ALNS-TS-TA algorithm, delivers the best performance. This approach simultaneously leverages the large-area search capabilities of ALNS for exploration and effectively escapes local optima when the multiphase ALNS is coupled with TS and TA. Furthermore, in our experiments, the hybrid multiphase ALNS-TS-TA algorithm is the only one that shows potential for improving results with increased computation time across all attempts.</description>

      <title>Merging Hazy Sets with m-Schemes: A Geometric Approach to Data Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms try to visualize high dimensional metric data in 2D in such a way that the essential geometric and topological features of the data are highlighted. In this paper, we introduce a framework for aggregating dissimilarity functions that arise from locally adjusting a metric through density-aware normalization, as employed in the IsUMap method. We formalize these approaches as m-schemes, a class of methods closely related to t-norms and t-conorms in probabilistic metrics, as well as to composition laws in information theory. These m-schemes provide a flexible and theoretically grounded approach to refining distance-based embeddings.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Quantum Walks, with Application to $k$-Distinctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13492v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the quantum query complexity of $k$-distinctness is known to be $O\left(n^{3/4-1/4(2^k-1)}\right)$ for any constant $k \geq 4$, the best previous upper bound on the time complexity was $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{1-1/k}\right)$. We give a new upper bound of $\widetilde{O}\left(n^{3/4-1/4(2^k-1)}\right)$ on the time complexity, matching the query complexity up to polylogarithmic factors. In order to achieve this upper bound, we give a new technique for designing quantum walk search algorithms, which is an extension of the electric network framework. We also show how to solve the welded trees problem in $O(n)$ queries and $O(n^2)$ time using this new technique, showing that the new quantum walk framework can achieve exponential speedups.</description>

      <title>Output-sensitive Complexity of Multi-Objective Integer Network Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the output-sensitive complexity for linear multi-objective integer minimum cost flow (MOIMCF) problems and provides insights about the time complexity for enumerating all supported nondominated vectors. The paper shows that there can not exist an output-polynomial time algorithm for the enumeration of all supported nondominated vectors that determine the vectors in an ordered way in the outcome space unless NP = P. Moreover, novel methods for identifying supported nondominated vectors in bi-objective minimum cost flow (BOIMCF) problems are proposed, accompanied by a numerical comparison between decision- and objective-space methods. A novel, equivalent and more compact formulation of the minimum cost flow ILP formulation used in the e-constrained-scalarization approach is introduced, demonstrating enhanced efficiency in the numerical tests</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on words and generating Dirichlet series of automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13524v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$; i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some language strictly included in the set of all words over the alphabet $\{0, 1, \dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $b$-automatic sequences or $b$-regular sequences. We also consider a specific sequence that is not $b$-regular.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for the integrality gap of the bi-directed cut formulation of the Steiner Tree Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the metric Steiner Tree problem on graphs focusing on computing lower bounds for the integrality gap of the bi-directed cut (BCR) formulation and introducing a novel formulation, the Complete Metric (CM) model, specifically designed to address the weakness of the BCR formulation on metric instances. A key contribution of our work is extending the Gap problem, previously explored in the context of the Traveling Salesman problems, to the metric Steiner Tree problem. To tackle the Gap problem for Steiner Tree instances, we first establish several structural properties of the CM formulation. We then classify the isomorphism classes of the vertices within the CM polytope, revealing a correspondence between the vertices of the BCR and CM polytopes. Computationally, we exploit these structural properties to design two complementary heuristics for finding nontrivial small metric Steiner instances with a large integrality gap. We present several vertices for graphs with a number of nodes &lt;=10, which realize the best-known lower bounds on the integrality gap for the CM and the BCR formulations. We conclude the paper by presenting two new conjectures on the integrality gap of the BCR and CM formulations for small graphs.</description>
