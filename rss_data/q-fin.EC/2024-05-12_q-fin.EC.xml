      <title>New Business Model for Sustainable Retail Company Using Design Thinking Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The waste problem is still becoming a big concern in Indonesia. Waste, especially plastic waste comes from single-use packaging of daily necessities such as personal care and home care. PT. Siklus Refil Indonesia or Siklus, a retail company, comes to offer a sustainable solution of buying daily necessities by refill method. Since April 2020, Siklus has operated in the Greater Jakarta area and already impacted 20,000 customers. However, Siklus must change its new business model due to regulation from the Food and Drug Supervisory Agency (BPOM) that warned the company not to sell personal care who come in direct contact with skin. The warning impacted the decreasing customers, sales, and profit of Siklus. This research has the purpose of determining the new business model of Siklus using the design thinking concept. By this concept, this research empathizes with customers, defines customer needs, and ideates a business model. This research continues to decide the new business model by creating a matrix of stepwise selection. Then this research does a prototype business model and tests the new business model. After doing the process, Return from Home is selected as the new business model for Siklus.</description>

      <title>Is the panel fair? Evaluating panel compositions through network analysis. The case of research assessments in Italy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In research evaluation, the fair representation of panels is usually defined in terms of observable characteristics of scholars such as gender or affiliations. An an empirical strategy is proposed for exploring hidden connections between panellists such that, despite the respect of formal requirements, the panel could be considered alike as unfair with respect to the representation of diversity of research approaches and methodologies. The case study regards the three panels selected to evaluate research in economics, statistics and business during the Italian research assessment exercises. The first two panels were appointed directly by the governmental agency responsible for the evaluation, while the third was randomly selected. Hence the third panel can be considered as a control for evaluating about the fairness of the others. The fair representation is explored by comparing the networks of panellists based on their co-authorship relations, the networks based on journals in which they published and the networks based on their affiliated institutions (universities, research centres and newspapers). The results show that the members of the first two panels had connections much higher than the members of the control group. Hence the composition of the first two panels should be considered as unfair, as the results of the research assessments.</description>

      <title>The Returns to Science in the Presence of Technological Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific and technological progress has historically been very beneficial to humanity but this does not always need to be true. Going forward, science may enable bad actors to cause genetically engineered pandemics that are more frequent and deadly than prior pandemics. I develop a quantitative economic model to assess the social returns to science, taking into account benefits to health and income, and forecast damages from new biological capabilities enabled by science. I set parameters for this model based on historical trends and forecasts from a large forecasting tournament of domain experts and superforecasters, which included forecasts about genetically engineered pandemic events. The results depend on the forecast likelihood that new scientific capabilities might lead to the end of our advanced civilization - there is substantial disagreement about this probability from participants in the forecasting tournament I use. If I set aside this remote possibility, I find the expected future social returns to science are strongly positive. Otherwise, the desirability of accelerating science depends on the value placed on the long-run future, in addition to which set of (quite different) forecasts of extinction risk are preferred. I also explore the sensitivity of these conclusions to a range of alternative assumptions.</description>

      <title>Tacit algorithmic collusion in deep reinforcement learning guided price competition: A study using EV charge pricing game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Players in pricing games with complex structures are increasingly adopting artificial intelligence (AI) aided learning algorithms to make pricing decisions for maximizing profits. This is raising concern for the antitrust agencies as the practice of using AI may promote tacit algorithmic collusion among otherwise independent players. Recent studies of games in canonical forms have shown contrasting claims ranging from none to a high level of tacit collusion among AI-guided players. In this paper, we examine the concern for tacit collusion by considering a practical game where EV charging hubs compete by dynamically varying their prices. Such a game is likely to be commonplace in the near future as EV adoption grows in all sectors of transportation. The hubs source power from the day-ahead (DA) and real-time (RT) electricity markets as well as from in-house battery storage systems. Their goal is to maximize profits via pricing and efficiently managing the cost of power usage. To aid our examination, we develop a two-step data-driven methodology. The first step obtains the DA commitment by solving a stochastic model. The second step generates the pricing strategies by solving a competitive Markov decision process model using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) framework. We evaluate the resulting pricing strategies using an index for the level of tacit algorithmic collusion. An index value of zero indicates no collusion (perfect competition) and one indicates full collusion (monopolistic behavior). Results from our numerical case study yield collusion index values between 0.14 and 0.45, suggesting a low to moderate level of collusion.</description>
