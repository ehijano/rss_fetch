      <title>Ultimate charge transport regimes in doping-controlled graphene laminates: phonon-assisted processes revealed by the linear magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the electrical properties of solution-processed 2D materials is key to further printed electronics progress. Here we demonstrate that the thermolysis of the aromatic intercalants utilized in nanosheet exfoliation for graphene laminates opens the route to achieving high intrinsic mobility and simultaneously controlling doping type ($n$- and $p$-) and concentration over a wide range. We establish that the intra-flake mobility is high by observing a linear magnetoresistance of such solution-processed graphene laminates and using it to devolve the inter-flake tunneling and intra-layer magnetotransport. Consequently, we determine the temperature dependences of the inter- and intra-layer characteristics, which both appear to be dominated by phonon-assisted processes at temperature $T&gt;$20 Kelvin. In particular, we identify the efficiency of phonon-assisted tunneling as the main limiting factor for electrical conductivity in graphene laminates at room temperature. We also demonstrate a thermoelectric sensitivity of around 50 ${\mu}$V K$^{-1}$ in a solution-processed metal-free graphene-based thermocouple.</description>

      <title>Spin-dependent $\pi$$\pi^{\ast}$ gap in graphene on a magnetic substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the electronic properties of graphene/Eu/Ni(111). By using angle and spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ab initio calculations, we show that the Eu-intercalation of graphene/Ni(111) restores the nearly freestanding dispersion of the $\pi\pi^\ast$ Dirac cones at the K point with an additional lifting of the spin degeneracy due to the mixing of graphene and Eu states. The interaction with the magnetic substrate results in a large spin-dependent gap in the Dirac cones with a topological nature characterized by a large Berry curvature, and a spin-polarized van Hove singularity, whose closeness to the Fermi level gives rise to a polaronic band.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical perspective on Landau levels and Hall conductivity in an anisotropic Cubic Dirac Semi-Metal and the peculiar case of star-shaped classical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an anisotropic cubic Dirac semi-metal subjected to a constant magnetic field. In the case of an isotropic dispersion in the $x$-$y$ plane, with parameters $v_{x}=v_{y}$, it is possible to find exact Landau levels, indexed by the quantum number $n$, using the typical ladder operator approach. Interestingly, we find that the lowest energy level (the zero energy state in the case $k_z=0$) has a degeneracy that is three times that of other states. This degeneracy manifests in the Hall conductivity as a step at zero chemical potential that is 3/2 the size of other steps. Moreover, as $n\to\infty$ we find energies $E_n\propto n^{3/2}$, which means the $n$-th step as a function of chemical potential roughly occurs at a value $\mu\propto n^{3/2}$. We propose that these exciting features could be used to identify cubic Dirac semi-metals experimentally. Subsequently, we analyze the anisotropic case $v_{y}=\lambda v_{x}$ with $\lambda\neq 1$. First, we consider a perturbative treatment around $\lambda\approx 1$ and find that energies $E_n\propto n^{3/2}$ still holds as $n\to\infty$. To gain further insight into the Landau level structure for a maximum anisotropy, we turn to a semi-classical treatment that reveals interesting star-shaped orbits in phase space that close at infinity. This property is a manifestation of weakly localized states. Despite being infinite in length, these orbits enclose a finite phase space volume and permit finding a simple semi-classical formula for the energy, which again has the form as above. Our findings suggest that both isotropic and anisotropic cubic Dirac semi-metals should leave similar experimental imprints.</description>

      <title>Fractional ac Josephson effect as evidence of topological hinge states in a Dirac semimetal NiTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate Josephson current between two 5~$\mu$m spaced superconducting indium leads, coupled to a NiTe$_2$ single crystal flake, which is a type-II Dirac semimetal. Under microwave irradiation, we demonstrate a.c. Josephson effect at millikelvin temperatures as a number of Shapiro steps. In addition to the integer ($n=1,2,3,4...$) steps, we observe fractional ones at half-integer values $n=1/2,3/2,5/2$ and 7/2, which corresponds to $\pi$ periodicity of current-phase relationship. In contrast to previous investigations, we do not observe $4\pi$ periodicity (disappearance of the odd $n=1,3,5...$ Shapiro steps), while the latter is usually considered as a fingerprint of helical surface states in Dirac semimetals and topological insulators. We argue, that our experiment confirms Josephson current through the topological hinge states in NiTe$_2$: since one can exclude bulk supercurrent in 5~$\mu$m long Josephson junctions, interference of the hinge modes is responsible for the $\pi$ periodicity, while stable odd Shapiro steps reflect chiral character of the topological hinge states.</description>

      <title>Small-angle neutron scattering signatures of magnetic hopfions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional localized magnetic topological solitons which can exist in the bulk of magnetic materials. Based on a Ritz model for magnetic hopfions in a chiral magnet, the unpolarized magnetic small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section, the spin-flip scattering cross section, and the chiral function (characterizing the imbalance between the two spin-flip scattering amplitudes) are computed here analytically; while the real-space correlation function is obtained numerically. Features of these functions, specific to magnetic hopfions, are discussed. Our results enable the SANS method to be used for the detection of magnetic hopfions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood, a ubiquitous and fundamental carbohydrate material composed of plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, has been playing an important role in biology, life science, history, and religious study, while graphene has garnered significant attention due to its exceptional properties and extensive range of potential applications. Achieving environmentally friendly, cost-effective growth using hybrid precursors and obtaining high-quality graphene through a straightforward CVD process has been traditionally considered mutually exclusive. This study demonstrates that we can produce high-quality graphene domains with controlled thickness through a one-step growth process at atmospheric pressure using blood as a precursor. Raman spectroscopy confirms the uniformity of the blood-grown graphene films, and observing the half-integer quantum Hall effect in the measured devices highlights its outstanding electronic properties. This unprecedented approach opens possibilities for blood application, facilitating an unconventional route in graphene growth applications.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in twisted double bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional ferroelectrics can maintain vertical polarization up to room temperature, and are, therefore, promising for next-generation nonvolatile memories. Although natural two-dimensional ferroelectrics are few, moir\'{e} superlattices provide us with a generalized method to construct ferroelectrics from non-ferroelectric parent materials. We report a realization of ferroelectric hysteresis in a AB-BA stacked twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) system. The ferroelectric polarization is prominent at zero external displacement field and reduces upon increasing displacement fields. TDBG in the AB-BA configuration possesses a superlattice of non-centrosymmetric domains, exhibiting alternatively switchable polarities even without the assistance of any boron nitride layers; however, in the AB-AB stacking case, the development of polarized domains necessitates the presence of a second superlattice induced by the adjacent boron nitride layer. Therefore, twisted multilayer graphene systems offer us a fascinating field to explore two-dimensional ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Gate control of 2D magnetism in tri- and four-layers $\rm CrI_3$/graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct experimental studies on the electrical transport properties of monolayer graphene directly covered by a few layers of $\rm CrI_3$. We do not observe the expected magnetic exchange coupling in the graphene but instead discover proximity effects featuring gate and magnetic field tunability. The tunability of gate voltage is manifested in the alignment of the lowest conduction band of $\rm CrI_3$ and the Fermi level of graphene, which can be controlled by the gate voltage. The coexistence of the normal and atypical quantum Hall effects in our device also corresponds to gate-control modulation doping. The lowest conduction band depends on the magnetic states of the $\rm CrI_3$ and can be altered by the magnetic field, which corresponds to the resistance loops during back-and-forth sweeps of the magnetic field. Our results serve as a reference for exploiting the magnetic proximity effects in graphene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we explore the quantum propagation of exciton polaritons in semiconductor microcavities, exhibiting intriguing effects such as interactions, decay, and disorder scatterings. Our investigation uncovers anomalies in their quantum propagation, deviating from predictions based on existing theories. By applying scaling theory, we elucidate the true nature of exciton polariton propagation, unveiling a localization phase that characteristically differs from Anderson localization. Our numerical results agree with the self-consistent theory developed for exciton polariton condensates, incorporating non-linearity and finite lifetime.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz transitions and Weyl semimetals from a topological superconductor with supercurrent flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A current flowing through a superconductor induces a spatial modulation in its superconducting order parameter, characterized by a wavevector $Q$ related to the total momentum of a Cooper pair. Here we investigate this phenomenon in a $p$-wave topological superconductor, described by a one-dimensional Kitaev model. We demonstrate that, by treating $Q$ as an extra synthetic dimension, the current carrying non-equilibrium steady state can be mapped into the ground state of a half-filled two-dimensional Weyl semimetal, whose Fermi surface exhibits Lifshitz transitions when varying the model parameters. Specifically, the transition from Type-I to Type-II Weyl phases corresponds to the emergence of a gapless $p$-wave superconductor, where Cooper pairs coexist with unpaired electrons and holes. Such transition is signaled by the appearance of a sharp cusp in the $Q$-dependence of the supercurrent, at a critical value $Q^*$ that is robust to variations of the chemical potential $\mu$. We determine the maximal current that the system can sustain in the topological phase, and discuss possible implementations.</description>

      <title>Tailoring coercive fields and the Curie temperature via proximity coupling in WSe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid structures consisting of two-dimensional (2D) magnets and semiconductors have exhibited extensive functionalities in spintronics and opto-spintronics. In this work, we have fabricated WSe$_2$/Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures and investigated the proximity effects on 2D magnetism. Through reflective magnetic circular dichroism (RMCD), we have observed a temperature-dependent modulation of magnetic order in the heterostructure. For temperatures above $40$ K, WSe$_2$-covered Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ exhibits a larger coercive field than that observed in bare Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, accompanied by a noticeable enhancement of the Curie temperature by $21$ K. This strengthening suggests an increase in magnetic anisotropy in the interfacial Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ layer, which can be attributed to the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) proximity effect induced by the adjacent WSe$_2$ layers. However, at much lower temperatures ($T&lt;20$ K), a non-monotonic modification of the coercive field is observed, showing both reduction and enhancement, which depends on the thickness of the WSe$_2$ and Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ layers. Moreover, an unconventional two-step magnetization process emerges in the heterostructure, indicating the short-range nature of SOC proximity effects. Our findings revealing proximity effects on 2D magnetism may shed light on the design of future spintronic and memory devices based on 2D magnetic heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Hall systems are platforms of choice when it comes to study topological properties of condensed matter systems and anyonic exchange statistics. In this work we have developed a tunable radiofrequency edge magnetoplasmonic resonator meant to serve as a versatile platform for future interferometric devices. The resonance frequency of the system is controlled by both the magnetic field and a set of electrostatic gates. The gates allow us to change both the size of the resonant cavity and the electronic density of the two-dimensional electron gas. We show that we can continuously control the frequency response of our resonator, making it possible to develop an edge magnetoplasmon interferometer. As we reach smaller sizes of our resonator, finite size effects caused by the measurement probes manifest. We present a theoretical description of the system taking into account the spatial extension of the probing gates. In the future, such device will be a valuable tool to investigate the properties of non-abelian anyons in the fractional quantum Hall regime.</description>

      <title>Tunable Ultrafast Dynamics of Antiferromagnetic Vortices in Nanoscale Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological vortex textures in magnetic disks have garnered great attention due to their interesting physics and diverse applications. However, up to now, the vortex state has mainly been studied in microsize ferromagnetic disks, which have oscillation frequencies confined to the GHz range. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible ultrasmall and ultrafast vortex state in an antiferromagnetic nanodot surrounded by a heavy metal, which is further harnessed to construct a highly tunable vortex network. We theoretically demonstrate that, interestingly, the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) induced by the heavy metal at the boundary of the dot acts as an effective chemical potential for the vortices in the interior. Mimicking the creation of a superfluid vortex by rotation, we show that a magnetic vortex state can be stabilized by this iDMI. Subjecting the system to an electric current can trigger vortex oscillations via spin-transfer torque, which reside in the THz regime and can be further modulated by external magnetic fields. Furthermore, we show that coherent coupling between vortices in different nanodisks can be achieved via an antiferromagnetic link. Remarkably, this interaction depends on the vortex polarity and topological charge and is also exceptionally tunable through the vortex resonance frequency. This opens up the possibility for controllable interconnected networks of antiferromagnetic vortices. Our proposal therefore introduces a new avenue for developing high-density memory, ultrafast logic devices, and THz signal generators, which are ideal for compact integration into microchips.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Floquet amorphous topological orders in experimentally accessible one-dimensional array of randomly pointed Rydberg atoms with periodic driving. The filling factor in the chain is tunable by applying a microwave field. We give a complete characterization of the topological properties from both the single-particle and many-body aspect. The periodic driving results in richer topological phases. At the single-particle level, we calculate the real space winding numbers and polarization, confirming robust amorphous topological phases with 0-type and $\pi$-type edge modes. We show a structural disorder induced topological phase transition acompanied with localization transition in the nonequilibrium system. Furthermore, in the many-body case we find the existence of amorphous topological orders of the hardcore bosons half-filled the chain, in contrast described by the topological entanglement entropy and the string order. Possible detection methods are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Pre-relaxation in quantum, classical, and quantum-classical two-impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the relaxation dynamics of impurity-host systems, focusing on the presence of long-lived metastable states in the non-equilibrium dynamics after an initial excitation of the impurities. In generic systems, an excited impurity coupled to a large bath at zero temperature is expected to relax and approach its ground state over time. However, certain exceptional cases exhibit metastability, where the system remains in an excited state on timescales largely exceeding the typical relaxation time. We study this phenomenon for three prototypical impurity models: a tight-binding quantum model of independent spinless fermions on a lattice with two stub impurities, a classical-spin Heisenberg model with two weakly coupled classical impurity spins, and a tight-binding quantum model of independent electrons with two classical impurity spins. Through numerical integration of the fundamental equations of motion, we find that all three models exhibit similar qualitative behavior: complete relaxation for nearest-neighbor impurities and incomplete or strongly delayed relaxation for next-nearest-neighbor impurities. The underlying mechanisms leading to this behavior differ between models and include impurity-induced bound states, emergent approximately conserved local observables, and exact cancellation of local and nonlocal dissipation effects.</description>

      <title>Magnetic X-ray imaging using a single polarization and multimodal-ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized X-rays allow for imaging birefringent or dichroic properties of materials with nanometric resolution. To disentangle these properties from the electronic density, either a polarization analyzer or several measurements with different polarizations (typically two, or more) are needed. Here we demonstrate that ptychography can disentangle these from a single-polarization measurement by using a multimodal analysis. This new method provides an alternative to obtain polarization-resolved images of a sample when manipulating the incident polarization is not possible nor sufficient.</description>

      <title>Decoherence induced by a sparse bath of two-level fluctuators: peculiar features of $1/f$ noise in high-quality qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in fabrication of semiconductor and superconductor qubits has greatly diminished the number of decohering defects, thus decreasing the devastating low-frequency $1/f$ noise and extending the qubits' coherence times (dephasing time $T_2^*$ and the echo decay time $T_2$). However, large qubit-to-qubit variation of the coherence properties remains a problem, making it difficult to produce a large-scale register where all qubits have a uniformly high quality. In this work we show that large variability is a characteristic feature of a qubit dephased by a sparse bath made of many ($n\gg 1$) decohering defects, coupled to the qubit with similar strength. We model the defects as two-level fluctuators (TLFs) whose transition rates $\gamma$ are sampled from a log-uniform distribution over an interval $[\gamma_{m},\gamma_M]$, which is a standard model for $1/f$ noise. We investigate decoherence by such a bath in the limit of high-quality qubit, i.e.\ when the TLF density $d$ is small (the limit of sparse bath, with $d=n/w\ll 1$, where $n$ is the number of TLFs and $w=\ln{[\gamma_M/\gamma_{m}]}$ is the log-width of the distribution). We show that different realizations of the bath produce very similar noise power spectra $S(f)\sim 1/f$, but lead to drastically different coherence times $T_2^*$ and $T_2$. Thus, the spectral density $S(f)$ does not determine coherence of a qubit coupled to a sparse TLF bath, as opposed to a dense bath; instead, decoherence is controlled by only a few exceptional fluctuators, determined by their value of $\gamma$. We show that removing only two of these TLFs greatly increases $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ times. Our findings help theoretical understanding and further improvements in the coherence properties of semiconductor and superconductor qubits, battling the $1/f$ noise in these platforms.</description>

      <title>A diverse set of two-qubit gates for spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To realize large-scale quantum information processes, an ideal scheme for two-qubit operations should enable diverse operations with given hardware and physical interaction. However, for spin qubits in semiconductor quantum dots, the common two-qubit operations, including CPhase gates, SWAP gates, and CROT gates, are realized with distinct parameter regions and control waveforms, posing challenges for their simultaneous implementation. Here, taking advantage of the inherent Heisenberg interaction between spin qubits, we propose and verify a fast composite two-qubit gate scheme to extend the available two-qubit gate types as well as reduce the requirements for device properties. Apart from the formerly proposed CPhase (controlled-phase) gates and SWAP gates, theoretical results indicate that the iSWAP-family gate and Fermionic simulation (fSim) gate set are additionally available for spin qubits. Meanwhile, our gate scheme limits the parameter requirements of all essential two-qubit gates to a common J~{\Delta}E_Z region, facilitate the simultaneous realization of them. Furthermore, we present the preliminary experimental demonstration of the composite gate scheme, observing excellent match between the measured and simulated results. With this versatile composite gate scheme, broad-spectrum two-qubit operations allow us to efficiently utilize the hardware and the underlying physics resources, helping accelerate and broaden the scope of the upcoming noise intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate anomalous spin and orbital Hall phenomena in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials via orbital pumping experiments. Conducting spin and orbital pumping experiments on YIG/Pt/Ir20Mn80 heterostructures, we unexpectedly observe strong spin and orbital anomalous signals in an out-of-plane configuration. We report a sevenfold increase in the signal of the anomalous inverse orbital Hall effect (AIOHE) compared to conventional effects. Our study suggests expanding the Orbital Hall angle ({\theta}_OH) to a rank 3 tensor, akin to the Spin Hall angle ({\theta}_SH), to explain AIOHE. This work pioneers converting spin-orbital currents into charge current, advancing the spin-orbitronics domain in AF materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doped van der Waals heterostructures host layer-hybridized trions, i.e. charged excitons with layer-delocalized constituents holding promise for highly controllable optoelectronics. Combining a microscopic theory with photoluminescence (PL) experiments, we demonstrate the electrical tunability of the trion energy landscape in naturally stacked WSe$_2$ bilayers. We show that an out-of-plane electric field modifies the energetic ordering of the lowest lying trion states, which consist of layer-hybridized $\Lambda$-point electrons and layer-localized K-point holes. At small fields, intralayer-like trions yield distinct PL signatures in opposite doping regimes characterized by weak Stark shifts in both cases. Above a doping-asymmetric critical field, interlayer-like species are energetically favored and produce PL peaks with a pronounced Stark red-shift and a counter-intuitively large intensity arising from efficient phonon-assisted recombination. Our work presents an important step forward in the microscopic understanding of layer-hybridized trions in van der Waals heterostructures and paves the way towards optoelectronic applications based on electrically controllable atomically-thin semiconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present an effective tight-binding model for an accurate description of the lowest energy quadruplet of conduction band in a ferromagnetic CrX$_3$ monolayer, tuned to the complementary \textit{ab initio} density functional theory simulations. This model, based on a minimum number of chromium orbitals, captures a distinctively flat dispersion in those bands but requires taking into account hoppings beyond nearest neighbours, revealing ligand-mediated electron pathways connecting remote chromium sites. Doping of states in the lowest conduction band of CrX$_3$ requires charge transfer, which, according to recent studies, can occur in graphene(G)/CrX$_3$ heterostructures. Here, we use the detailed description of the lowest conduction band in CrI$_3$ to show that G/CrI$_3$/G and G/CrI$_3$ are type-II heterostructures where light holes in graphene would coexist with heavy electrons in the magnetic layer, where the latter can be characterised by Wigner parameter $r_s\sim 15-20$ (as estimated for hBN-encapsulated structures).</description>

      <title>Fate of surface gaps in magnetic topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetic topological insulators, the surface states can exhibit a gap due to the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. Various experiments, while suggesting the existence of the surface gap, have raised questions about its underlying mechanism in the presence of different magnetic orderings. Here, we demonstrate that magnon-mediated electron-electron interactions, whose effects are not limited to the surfaces perpendicular to the magnetic ordering, can significantly influence surface states and their effective gaps. On the surfaces perpendicular to the spin quantization axis, many-body interactions can enhance the band gap to a degree that surpasses the non-interacting scenario. Then, on surfaces parallel to the magnetic ordering, we find that strong magnon-induced fermionic interactions can lead to features resembling a massless-like gap. These remarkable results largely stem from the fact that magnon-mediated interactions exhibit considerable long-range behavior compared to direct Coulomb interactions among electrons, thereby dominating the many-body properties at the surface of magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin and charge are the two most important degrees of freedom of electrons. Their interplay lies at the heart of numerous strongly correlated phenomena including Hubbard model physics and high temperature superconductivity. Such interplay for bosons, on the other hand, is largely unexplored in condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate a unique realization of the spin-1/2 Bose-Hubbard model through excitons in a semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. We find evidence of a transient in-plane ferromagnetic (FM-$xy$) order of exciton spin - here valley pseudospin - around exciton filling $\nu_{ex}$ = 1, which transitions into a FM-$z$ order both with increasing exciton filling and a small magnetic field of 10 mT. The phase diagram is different from the fermion case and is qualitatively captured by a simple phenomenological model, highlighting the unique consequence of Bose-Einstein statistics. Our study paves the way for engineering exotic phases of matter from spinor bosons, as well as for unconventional devices in optics and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Twisted Magnetic Van der Waals Bilayers: An Ideal Platform for Altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a universal methodology for generating and manipulating altermagnetism in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic van der Waals (MvdW) materials through twisting. We find that a key in-plane 2-fold rotational operation can be achieved in a twisted bilayer of any 2D MvdW material, which takes one of all five 2D Bravais lattices, thereby inducing altermagnetism. By choosing the constituent MvdW monolayer with specific symmetry, our approach can tailor altermagnetism of any type, such as $d$-wave, $g$-wave, and $i$-wave. Furthermore, the properties of our twisted altermagnetic materials can be easily engineered. Taking a transition-metal oxyhalide VOBr as an example, we find that by tuning the twist angle and Fermi level a giant spin Hall angle can be obtained, much larger than the experimentally reported. This approach establishes a general, robust, and adjustable platform to explore altermagnetism, and provides a new efficient way to generate and manipulate the spin current.</description>

      <title>Charge density-waves with non-trivial orbital textures in rare earth tritellurides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments reporting unconventional collective modes in the charge density-wave (CDW) state of rare-earth tritellurides $R$Te$_3$, we derive from a multi-orbital microscopic model on the square net a CDW Ginzburg-Landau theory that allows for non-trivial orbital order. Our analysis reveals unconventional CDWs where order parameters with distinct orbital character coexist due to an approximate symmetry of the low-energy model, which becomes exact in the limit of nearest-neighbor-only hopping and decoupled $p_x$, $p_y$ orbitals. Because of this coexistence, the resulting CDW pattern displays an orbital texture that generally breaks additional symmetries of the lattice besides those explicitly broken by the CDW wave-vector. In particular, we find two competing phases that differ in whether they break or preserve inversion and vertical mirror symmetries. We explain the mechanisms that favor each outcome, and discuss experimental probes that can distinguish the different phases.</description>

Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to directly elucidate their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. By carefully disentangling X-ray induced effects, we find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and to those in experiments and hydrodynamic theories of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Via comparison with simulations, we find that the extracted strength of the attractions explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in a variety of complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter systems, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical instabilities of two-dimensional membranes has strong connection to the subjects of structure instabilities, morphology control and materials failures. In this work, we investigate the plastic mechanism developed in the annular crystalline membrane system for adapting to the shrinking space, which is caused by the controllable gradual expansion of the inner boundary. In the process of plastic deformation, we find the continuous generation of dislocations at the inner boundary, and their collective migration to the outer boundary; this neat dynamic scenario of dislocation current captures the complicated reorganization process of the particles. We also reveal the characteristic vortex structure arising from the interplay of topological defects and the displacement field. These results may find applications in the precise control of structural instabilities in packings of particulate matter and covalently bonded systems.</description>

Abstract: The luminescent mechanism of nano-sized materials with indirect bandgap and parity-forbidden transition has always been a critical issue in breaking through bottlenecks in traditional luminescent materials. The lack of understanding has resulted in great disputes regarding the origin of fluorescence in weak-transition nanocrystals (NCs). This paper proposes a new physical luminescence model, named as localized state-induced enhanced emission (LIEE), i.e., localized processes induced by size-limitation or partial doping, to explain the anomalous luminescence from non-luminescent state to luminescent state in various perovskite nanocrystals with indirect/direct bandgap or parity-forbidden transition. These findings provide a theoretical viewpoint to design efficient lead-free perovskite NCs and promote the development of fast optical transitions in luminescent materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution spectroscopic investigation of the energy and linewidth of an exciton-polariton laser in the single-mode regime, which derives its coherent emission from an optically pumped and confined exciton-polariton condensate. We report an ultra-narrow linewidth of 56~MHz or 0.24~$\mu$eV, corresponding to a coherence time of 5.7~ns. The narrow linewidth is consistently achieved by using an exciton-polariton condensate with a high photonic content confined in an optically induced trap. Contrary to previous studies, we show that the excitonic reservoir created by the pump and responsible for creating the trap does not strongly affect the emission linewidth as long as the condensate is trapped and the pump power is well above the condensation (lasing) threshold. Our results open up opportunities for manipulating the macroscopic quantum state of the system owing to its long coherence time.</description>

Abstract: Topologically nontrivial systems can be protected by band topology in momentum space, as seen in topological insulators and semimetals, or real-space topology, such as in lattice deformations known as topological disclinations (TDs). TDs, with inherent chiral symmetry, can support localized states pinned spectrally to the middle of the topological gap, preventing hybridization with bulk bands, and making them promising for topological lasers. Here, we experimentally realize a C4v symmetric TD laser based on perovskite exciton-polariton lattices at room temperature. Protected by the chiral and point group symmetries of the lattice, the TD state emerges in the middle of the gap and at the core of the perovskite lattice. Under a non-resonant pulsed excitation, coherent polariton lasing occurs precisely at the TD state with a low threshold of 9.5 uJ/cm2, as confirmed by momentum space and real space spectra measurements. This study not only introduces a class of symmetry-protected topological lasers, but also expands the landscape for exploring exciton-polariton light-matter interactions with novel topological structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement in a pure state of strongly correlated quantum impurity systems</title>

Abstract: We consider quantum entanglement in strongly correlated quantum impurity systems for states manifesting interesting properties such as multi-level Kondo effect and dual nature between itineracy and localization etc.. For this purpose, we set up a system consisting of one or two quantum impurities arbitrarily selected from the system as a subsystem, and investigate quantum entanglement with its environmental system. We reduce the pure state of interest as described above to the subsystem, and formulate quantum informative quantities such as entanglement entropy, mutual information and relative entropy. We apply them to the single impurity Anderson model where the most basic Kondo effect is manifested, and obtain new insights into the Kondo effect there. The obtained results suggest that the method proposed here is promising for elucidating the quantum entanglement of pure states in various quantum impurity systems.</description>

      <title>High-performance gate-controlled superconducting switches: large output voltage and reproducibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logic circuits consist of devices that can be controlled between two distinct states. The recent demonstration that a superconducting current flowing in a constriction can be controlled via a gate voltage ($V_G$) - can lead to superconducting logic with better performance than existing logics. However, before such logic is developed, high reproducibility in the functioning of GCS devices and optimization of their performance must be achieved. Here, we report an investigation of gated Nb devices showing GCS with unprecedently-high reproducibility. Based on the investigation of a statistically-significant number of devices, we demonstrate that the GCS is independent of the constriction width, in contrast with previous reports, and confirm a strong correlation between the GCS and the leakage current ($I_{leak}$) induced by $V_G$. We also achieve a voltage output in our devices larger than the typical values reported to date by at least one order of magnitude, which is relevant for the future interconnection of devices, and show that $I_{leak}$ can be used as a tool to modulate the operational $V_G$ of devices on a $SiO_2$ substrates. These results altogether represent an important step forward towards the optimization of reproducibility and performance of GCS devices, and the future development of a GCS-based logic.</description>

Abstract: Stoner magnetism in bands endowed with Berry curvature is shown to be profoundly influenced by the coupling between spin chirality density $\vec s\cdot(\partial_x\vec s\times\partial_y\vec s)$ and Berry's orbital magnetization. The key effect is that carriers moving in the presence of a spin texture see it as a source of a geometric magnetic field coupled to the carrier's orbital motion through a spin-dependent Aharonov-Bohm effect. This emergent spin-orbit interaction effect favors chiral spin textures such as skyrmions -- the topologically protected objects with particle-like properties, stabilized in the ground state. In addition, the threshold for Stoner instability softens, rendering chiral spin-ordered phases accessible under realistic conditions. We present a detailed analysis of this chiral interaction for Bernal bilayer graphene band and discuss the unique properties of skyrmion textures in graphene multilayers.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor moir\'e superlattices have been shown to host a wide array of interaction-driven ground states. However, twisted homobilayers have been difficult to study in the limit of large moir\'e wavelength, where interactions are most dominant. Here, we conduct local electronic compressibility measurements of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ (tWSe$_2$) at small twist angles. We demonstrate multiple topological bands which host a series of Chern insulators at zero magnetic field near a 'magic angle' around $1.23^\circ$. Using a locally applied electric field, we induce a topological quantum phase transition at one hole per moir\'e unit cell. Our work establishes the topological phase diagram of a generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in tWSe$_2$, demonstrating a tunable platform for strongly correlated topological phases.</description>

      <title>Anomalous shift and optical vorticity in the steady photovoltaic current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.</description>

Abstract: We establish the quantum mechanics of composite fermions based on the dipole picture initially proposed by Read. It comprises three complimentary components: a wave equation for determining the wave functions of a composite fermion in ideal fractional quantum Hall states and when subjected to external perturbations, a wave function ansatz for mapping a many-body wave function of composite fermions to a physical wave function of electrons, and a microscopic approach for determining the effective Hamiltonian of the composite fermion. The wave equation resembles the ordinary Schr\"{o}dinger equation but has drift velocity corrections which are not present in the Halperin-Lee-Read theory. The wave-function ansatz constructs a physical wave function of electrons by projecting a state of composite fermions onto a half-filled bosonic Laughlin state of vortices. Remarkably, Jain's wave function ansatz can be reinterpreted as the new ansatz in an alternative wave-function representation of composite fermions. The dipole model and the effective Hamiltonian can be derived from the microscopic model of interacting electrons confined in a Landau level, with parameters fully determined. In this framework, we can construct the physical wave function of a fractional quantum Hall state deductively by solving the wave equation and applying the wave function ansatz, based on the effective Hamiltonian derived from first principles, rather than relying on intuitions or educated guesses. For ideal fractional quantum Hall states in the lowest Landau level, the approach yields physical wave functions identical to those prescribed by the standard theory of composite fermions. We further demonstrate that the reformulated theory of composite fermions can be easily generalized for flat Chern bands.</description>

      <title>Weak localization at arbitrary disorder strength in systems with generic spin-dependent fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of weak localization (WL) in the presence of generic spin-dependent fields, including any type of spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman fields, and non-homogeneous magnetic textures. We go beyond the usual diffusive approximation, considering systems with short-range disorder of arbitrary strength, and obtain a compact expression for the weak localization (WL) correction to the conductivity in terms of the singlet-triplet polarization operator in momentum space. The latter can be directly related to the solution of the quasiclassical Eilenberger equation for superconducting systems. This formulation presents an intuitive framework to explore how the interplay of various spin-dependent fields drives weak (anti) localization. We apply our results to study in-plane magnetoconductivity in systems with spin-orbit coupling, and in newly discovered altermagnets. Our results enable straightforward calculation of the WL conductivity at arbitrary disorder strength, which can be particularly useful for interpreting experiments on high-mobility samples.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of stress propagation in anharmonic crystals: MD simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anharmonic inter-atomic potential x to power of n, n&gt;1, has been used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of stress dynamics of FCC oriented crystal. The model of the chain of masses and springs is found as a convenient and accurate description of simulation results, with masses representing the crystallographic planes. The dynamics of oscillations of two planes is found analytically to be given by Euler beta functions, and its scaling with non-linearity parameter and amplitude of oscillations, or applied shear pressure is discussed on examples of time dependencies of displacements, velocities, and forces acting on masses (planes). The dynamics of stress penetration from the surface of the sample with multiply-planes (an anharmonic crystal) towards its interior is confirmed to be given exactly as a series of Bessel functions, when n=2 (Schrodinger and Pater solutions). When n&lt;&gt;2 the stress dynamics (wave propagation) in bulk material remains qualitatively of the same nature as in the linear case. In particular, results suggest that the quasi-linear relationship between frequency and wave number is preserved. Speed of the transverse sound component, dependent on sound wave amplitude, is found to be a strongly decreasing function of n. The results are useful in the analysis of any MD simulations under pressure, as they help to understand the dynamics of pressure retarded effects, as well help design the proper methodology of performing MD simulations, such as studies of dynamics of dislocations.</description>

Abstract: Adsorption of 4He on atomically flat substrates such as graphene provides a route towards the engineering of low dimensional quantum phases including superfluids and strongly interacting insulators. In this study, we explore the effects of graphene corrugation on the helium adsorption process via quantum Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble. We utilize an empirical adsorption potential based on the superposition of individual helium-carbon interactions and systematically control corrugation, from a smooth membrane to the fully rough potential, via the implementation of a cutoff in reciprocal space. The results highlight the importance of using a fully corrugated potential to understand the plethora of commensurate and incommensurate phases in the first adsorbed layer. Surprisingly, some residual effects of corrugation are still present before and during the promotion and onset of a second adsorbed layer, where a smooth adsorption can lead to enhanced particle fluctuations in a helium-interaction dominated regime.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio transport theory for the intrinsic spin Hall effect applied to 5$d$ metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe how the spin Hall effect (SHE) can be studied from ab-initio by combining density functional theory with the non-equilibrium Green's functions technique for quantum transport into the so-called DFT+NEGF method. After laying down our theoretical approach in particular discussing how to compute charge and spin bond currents, DFT+NEGF calculations are carried out for ideal clean systems. In these the transport is ballistic and the linear response limit is met. The SHE emerges in a central region attached to two leads when we apply a bias voltage so that electrons are accelerated by a uniform electric field. As a result, we obtain a finite spin-Hall current and, by performing a scaling analysis with respect to the system size, we estimate the ballistic spin Hall conductivity (SHC). We consider 5d metals with fcc and bcc crystal structures, finding that the SHC exhibits a rough qualitative dependence on the d-band filling, and comment on these results in relation to existing literature. Finally, within the same DFT+NEGF approach, we also predict the appearance of a current-induced spin dipole moment inside the materials' unit cell and estimate its magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi sea in a metal can host exotic quantum topology, which determines its conductance quantization and is characterized by Euler characteristic $\chi_F$. Unlike gapped band topology described by the global feature of wave function, this topology of gapless system is associated with the geometry of Fermi sea, and thus probing and identifying $\chi_F$ are inherently difficult in higher-dimensional systems. Here, we propose a dimensional reduction theory for Fermi sea topology in $d$-dimensional metallic systems, showing that $\chi_F$ can be determined by the feature of so-called reduced critical points on Fermi surfaces, with theoretical simplicity and observational intuitiveness. We also reveal a nontrivial correspondence between the Fermi sea topology and the gapped band topology by using an ingenious mapping, of which $\chi_F$ exactly equals to the topological invariant of gapped topological phases. This provides a potential way to capture $\chi_F$ through the topological superconductors. Our work opens an avenue to characterize and detect the Fermi sea topology using low-dimensional momentum information.</description>

Abstract: Fano resonance is believed to arise when a direct path interferes with a resonant path. We demonstrate that this is not true for chiral electronic transmission without additional direct paths. To address the Fano effect in chiral electronic transport, we suggest an electronic Mach-Zehnder-Fano interferometer (MZFI), which combines a quantum dot with an electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Backscattering is completely suppressed in chiral electronic transport, yielding perfect Fano profiles that can be fully adjusted by an external magnetic flux in the transmission, linear conductance, and differential spectra. Even the current and shot noise for a symmetric interferometer with two arms of the same length exhibit fully controllable resonances and distinct Fano resonance characteristics. Along with the profiles, all of the transport spectra follow the same evolution pattern in a cycle that is resistant to changes in the device's defining parameters.</description>

Abstract: There have been numerous studies on topological superconductivity in magnetic atomic chains deposited on s-wave superconductors. Most of these investigations have focused on spin-orbit interactions or helical spin orders. In this paper, we propose a new model for achieving one-dimensional topological superconductivity in a magnetic atomic ring. This model utilizes a magnetic field and an antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic order, under the condition that the magnetic field is perpendicular to the moments of the magnetic order. On a quasi-one-dimensional substrate surface, where the half-filled ring favors an antiferromagnetic configuration, we demonstrate that either the magnetic field itself or a Rashba spin-orbit coupling guarantees the perpendicularity. On a two-dimensional surface, where the ring favors ferromagnetic orders, the perpendicularity is achieved by introducing a minor Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Autoparametric resonance extending the bit-flip time of a cat qubit up to 0.3 s</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06761v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cat qubits, for which logical $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$ are coherent states $|\pm\alpha\rangle$ of a harmonic mode, offer a promising route towards quantum error correction. Using dissipation to our advantage so that photon pairs of the harmonic mode are exchanged with single photons of its environment, it is possible to stabilize the logical states and exponentially increase the bit-flip time of the cat qubit with the photon number $|\alpha|^2$. Large two-photon dissipation rate $\kappa_2$ ensures fast qubit manipulation and short error correction cycles, which are instrumental to correct the remaining phase-flip errors in a repetition code of cat qubits. Here we introduce and operate an autoparametric superconducting circuit that couples a mode containing the cat qubit to a lossy mode whose frequency is set at twice that of the cat mode. This passive coupling does not require a parametric pump and reaches a rate $\kappa_2/2\pi\approx 2~\mathrm{MHz}$. With such a strong two-photon dissipation, bit-flip errors of the autoparametric cat qubit are prevented for a characteristic time up to 0.3~s with only a mild impact on phase-flip errors. Besides, we illustrate how the phase of a quantum superposition between $|\alpha\rangle$ and $|-\alpha\rangle$ can be arbitrarily changed by driving the harmonic mode while keeping the engineered dissipation active.</description>

Abstract: We study Y3Fe5O12 (YIG) flakes that we produce via mechanical cleaving and exfoliation of YIG single crystals. By characterizing their structural and magnetic properties, we find that these YIG nanoflakes have surfaces oriented along unusual crystallographic axes and uniaxial in-plane magnetic anisotropy due to their shape, both of which are not commonly available in YIG thin films. These physical properties, combined with the possibility of picking up the YIG flakes and stacking them onto flakes of other van der Waals materials or pre-patterned electrodes or waveguides, open unexplored possibilities for magnonics and for the realization of novel YIG-based heterostructures and devices.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the equilibrium Josephson current through a disordered interacting quantum dot described by a Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model contacted by two BCS superconductors. We show that, at zero temperature and at the conformal limit, i.e. in the strong interacting limit, the Josephson current is suppressed by $U$, the strength of the interaction, as $\ln(U)/U$ and becomes universal, namely it gets independent on the superconducting pairing. At finite temperature $T$, instead, it depends on the ratio between the gap $\Delta$ and the temperature. A proximity effect exists but the self-energy corrections induced by the coupling with the superconducting leads seem subleading as compared to the self-energy due to the interaction for large number of particles. Finally we compare the results of the original four-fermion model with those obtained considering zero interaction, two-fermions and a generalized q-fermion model.</description>

      <title>The inverse Faraday effect at Mie resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04569</link>

Abstract: Nowadays, dielectric nanophotonics enables almost lossless resonant interaction between light and matter at the nanoscale. We show both theoretically and by electromagnetic simulations, that the peculiar nature of Mie-resonance induced effective magnetic fields contrasts sharply with the optomagnetism of smooth bulk materials. Mie resonances produce strongly nonuniform effective magnetic fields generated by the inverse Faraday effect. Different orders of optical resonances are characterized by different types of the effective magnetic field patterns. The number of point-like inverse Faraday effect sources can be controlled by adjusting the pump wavelength, allowing for the selective launch of spin waves with submicron wavelengths. A distinguish feature of the Mie-resonance-induced effective magnetic fields is the vortex structure that can be used for the magnetic skyrmion generation. The proposed approach considerably broadens the scope of nanoscale optomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Revealing mode formation in quasi-bound states in the continuum metasurfaces via near-field optical microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17346</link>

Abstract: Photonic metasurfaces offer exceptional control over light at the nanoscale, facilitating applications spanning from biosensing, and nonlinear optics to photocatalysis. Many metasurfaces, especially resonant ones, rely on periodicity for the collective mode to form, which makes them subject to the influences of finite size effects, defects, and edge effects, all of which have considerable negative impact at the application level. These aspects are especially important for quasi-bound state in the continuum (BIC) metasurfaces, for which the collective mode is highly sensitive to perturbations due to high quality factors and strong near-field enhancement. Here, we quantitatively investigate the mode formation in quasi-BIC metasurfaces on the individual resonator level using scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) in combination with a new image processing technique. We find that the quasi-BIC mode is formed at a minimum size of 10 x 10-unit cells much smaller than expected from far-field measurements. Furthermore, we show that the coupling direction of the resonators, defects and edge states have pronounced influence on the quasi-BIC mode. This study serves as a link between the far-field and near-field responses of metasurfaces, offering crucial insights for optimizing spatial footprint and active area, holding promise for augmenting applications such as catalysis and biospectroscopy.</description>
