      <title>Tunamis on a deep open sea and on a sloping beach -- a mathematical theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I describe in this paper how the shallow water waves of Airy, produced by submarine earthquake, gentle on a deep open sea traveling by the cruising speed, get instantaneous $ +\infty$ or $-\infty$ traveling speed in approaching the shallow water near the coasts at the points of the surface on x=X, near the crest or the trough, where the tangent of itself and the tangent of the seabed coincide, rushing as inland tunamis ( near the crest) or as offshore tunamis (near the trough).</description>

      <title>Multi-scale decomposition of sea surface height snapshots using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge of ocean circulation is important for understanding and predicting weather and climate, and managing the blue economy. This circulation can be estimated through Sea Surface Height (SSH) observations, but requires decomposing the SSH into contributions from balanced and unbalanced motions (BMs and UBMs). This decomposition is particularly pertinent for the novel SWOT satellite, which measures SSH at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Specifically, the requirement, and the goal of this work, is to decompose instantaneous SSH into BMs and UBMs. While a few studies using deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise in framing this decomposition as an image-to-image translation task, these models struggle to work well across a wide range of spatial scales and require extensive training data, which is scarce in this domain. These challenges are not unique to our task, and pervade many problems requiring multi-scale fidelity. We show that these challenges can be addressed by using zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) whitening and data augmentation; making this a viable option for SSH decomposition across scales.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic growth of sea ice: assessing the role of salinity using a quasi-static modelling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea ice is a mushy layer, a porous material whose properties depend on the relative proportions of solid and liquid. The growth of sea ice is governed by heat transfer through the ice together with appropriate boundary conditions at the interfaces with the atmosphere and ocean. The salinity of sea ice has a large effect on its thermal properties so might naively be expected to have a large effect on its growth rate. However, previous studies observed a low sensitivity throughout the winter growth season. The goal of this study is to identify the controlling physical mechanisms that explain this observation. We develop a simplified quasi-static framework by applying a similarity transformation to the underlying heat equation and neglecting the explicit time dependence. We find three key processes controlling the sensitivity of growth rate to salinity. First, the trade-off between thermal conductivity and (latent) heat capacity leads to low sensitivity to salinity even at moderately high salinity and brine volume fraction. Second, the feedback on the temperature profile reduces the sensitivity relative to models that assume a linear profile, such as zero-layer Semtner models. Third, thicker ice has the opposite sensitivity of growth rate to salinity compared to thinner ice, sensitivities that counteract each other as the ice grows. Beyond its use in diagnosing these sensitivities, we show that the quasi-static approach offers a valuable sea-ice model of intermediate complexity between zero-layer Semtner models and full partial-differential-equation-based models such as Maykut-Untersteiner/Bitz-Lipscomb and mushy-layer models.</description>

      <title>A two-dimensional model for eddy saturation and frictional control in the Southern Ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced sensitivity of mean Southern Ocean zonal transport with respect to surface wind stress magnitude changes, known as eddy saturation, is studied in an idealised analytical model. The model is based on the assumption of a balance between surface wind stress forcing and bottom dissipation in the planetary geostrophic limit, coupled to the GEOMETRIC form of the Gent--McWilliams eddy parameterisation. The assumption of a linear stratification, together with an equation for the parameterised domain integrated total eddy energy, enables the formulation of a two component dynamical system, which reduces to the non-linear oscillator of Ambaum and Novak (Q. J. R. Meteorolog. Soc. 140(685), 2680--2684, 2014) in a Hamiltonian limit. The model suggests an intrinsic oscillatory time scale for the Southern Ocean, associated with a combination of mean shear erosion by eddies and eddy energy generation by the mean shear. For Southern Ocean parameters the model suggests that perturbing the system via stochastic wind forcing may lead to relatively large excursions in eddy energy.</description>

      <title>SEA-ViT: Sea Surface Currents Forecasting Using Vision Transformer and GRU-Based Spatio-Temporal Covariance Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forecasting sea surface currents is essential for applications such as maritime navigation, environmental monitoring, and climate analysis, particularly in regions like the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions. The code and pretrained models are available at \url{https://github.com/kaopanboonyuen/gistda-ai-sea-surface-currents}.</description>

      <title>Bivariate DeepKriging for Large-scale Spatial Interpolation of Wind Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High spatial resolution wind data are essential for a wide range of applications in climate, oceanographic and meteorological studies. Large-scale spatial interpolation or downscaling of bivariate wind fields having velocity in two dimensions is a challenging task because wind data tend to be non-Gaussian with high spatial variability and heterogeneity. In spatial statistics, cokriging is commonly used for predicting bivariate spatial fields. However, the cokriging predictor is not optimal except for Gaussian processes. Additionally, cokriging is computationally prohibitive for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a method, called bivariate DeepKriging, which is a spatially dependent deep neural network (DNN) with an embedding layer constructed by spatial radial basis functions for bivariate spatial data prediction. We then develop a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method based on bootstrap and ensemble DNN. Our proposed approach outperforms the traditional cokriging predictor with commonly used covariance functions, such as the linear model of co-regionalization and flexible bivariate Mat\'ern covariance. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed DNN model, with computations that are, on average, 20 times faster than those of conventional techniques. We apply the bivariate DeepKriging method to the wind data over the Middle East region at 506,771 locations. The prediction performance of the proposed method is superior over the cokriging predictors and dramatically reduces computation time.</description>
