      <title>Jacobi-Haantjes manifolds, integrability and dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of Jacobi-Haantjes manifolds is proposed as a natural geometric framework useful to state the integrability of both conservative and dissipative Hamiltonian systems in a unified way. As a reduction, new structures such as contact-Haantjes and locally conformal symplectic-Haantjes manifolds are investigated. The main properties of these novel classes of manifolds and their mutual relationship are discussed. It is shown that the notion of Haantjes chains, within the framework of Jacobi geometry, is related to the existence of complete integrable contact Hamiltonian systems, encompassing also dissipative cases, as well as to the integrability of Hamiltonian systems on appropriate invariant submanifolds. Our framework naturally generalizes the formulation of integrable conservative Hamiltonian systems through the theory of symplectic-Haantjes (or {\omega}H) manifolds.</description>

      <title>Pseudodifferential Weyl calculus on vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for Weyl quantization on pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, in which pseudodifferential operators act on sections of vector bundles equipped with arbitrary connections. We construct the associated star product and compute its semiclassical expansion up to third order in the expansion parameter. A central feature of our approach is a one-to-one correspondence between formally self-adjoint symbols and formally self-adjoint operators, extending known results from flat space to curved geometries. In addition, we analyze the Moyal equation satisfied by the Wigner function in this setting and provide explicit computations of Weyl symbols for several physically significant operators, including the Dirac, Maxwell, linearized Yang-Mills, and linearized Einstein operators. Our results lay the foundation for future developments in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes, semiclassical analysis, and chiral kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Integrable systems from Poisson reductions of generalized Hamiltonian torus actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a set of sufficient conditions for guaranteeing that an integrable system with a symmetry group $K$ on a manifold $M$ descends to an integrable system on a dense open subset of the quotient Poisson space $M/K$. The higher dimensional phase space $M$ carries a bivector $P_M$ yielding a bracket on $C^\infty(M)$ such that $C^\infty(M)^K$ is a Poisson algebra. The unreduced system on $M$ is supposed to possess `action variables' that generate a proper, effective action of a group of the form $\mathrm{U}(1)^{\ell_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{\ell_2}$ and descend to action variables of the reduced system. In view of the form of the group and since $P_M$ could be a quasi-Poisson bivector, we say that we work with a generalized Hamiltonian torus action. The reduced systems are in general superintegrable owing to the large set of invariants of the proper Hamiltonian action of $\mathrm{U}(1)^{\ell_1} \times \mathbb{R}^{\ell_2}$. We present several examples and apply our construction for solving open problems regarding the integrability of systems obtained previously by reductions of master systems on doubles of compact Lie groups: the cotangent bundle, the Heisenberg double and the quasi-Poisson double. Furthermore, we offer numerous applications to integrable systems living on moduli spaces of flat connections, using the quasi-Poisson approach.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of eigenvalues of large rank perturbations of large random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with deformed Wigner random matrices. These matrices are closely connected with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): weight matrices of trained DNNs could be represented in the form $R + S$, where $R$ is random and $S$ is highly correlated. The spectrum of such matrices plays a key role in rigorous underpinning of the novel pruning technique based on Random Matrix Theory. Mathematics has been done only for finite-rank matrix $S$. However, in practice rank may grow. In this paper we develop asymptotic analysis for the case of growing rank.</description>

      <title>Liouville Quantum Duality and Random Planar Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider models of block-weighted random planar maps in which possibly decorated maps are decomposed canonically into blocks, each block receiving the weight $u$. These maps present a transition at some critical value $u=u_{cr}$ above which the maps degenerate into Brownian trees. We show that the enumerative properties and critical exponents of the maps at $u=u_{cr}$ and those for $u&lt;u_{cr}$ are connected by duality relations which are precisely those expected in the context of the Liouville quantum gravity description of random surfaces. We illustrate this result by various instances of block-weighted maps: random planar quadrangulations decomposed into simple blocks, Hamiltonian cycles on cubic or bicubic planar maps decomposed into irreducible blocks, and meandric systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent Hartree and Hartree-Fock equations provide effective mean-field descriptions for the dynamics of large fermionic systems and play a fundamental role in many areas of physics. In this work, we rigorously derive the time-dependent Hartree equations as the large-$N$ limit of the microscopic Schr\"odinger dynamics of $N$ fermions confined to a volume of order one and interacting via strong pair potentials. A central step in our analysis is the implementation of time-dependent gauge transformations, which eliminate the dominant contribution from the interaction potential in both the Schr\"odinger and Hartree evolutions.</description>

      <title>Competing color superconductivity and color Kondo effect in quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The competition between bulk color superconductivity and the localized screening of a heavy quark impurity, analogous to the Kondo effect, leads to a rich spectrum of phenomena in dense quark matter. We investigate this competition at the edge of a superconducting quark bulk, where both the superconducting gap and the Kondo scale are dynamically generated in a tractable toy model. Utilizing the exact Bethe Ansatz method, we elucidate the resulting boundary physics. We identify distinct regimes characterized by either multi-particle Kondo screening or an unscreened local moment. Crucially, we also uncover a novel intermediate phase featuring impurity screening through a single-particle bound state formed within the superconducting gap. The toy model presented in this work highlights the complex interplay between dynamically generated bulk properties and boundary impurities in extreme QCD environments, offering potential insights into phenomena occurring in heavy-ion collisions and compact stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to derive noncommutative versions of integrable partial difference equations using Darboux transformations. As an illustrative example, we use the nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) system. We derive a noncommutative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and we construct its integrable discretisations via the compatibility condition of Darboux transformations around the square. In particular, we construct a noncommutative Adler--Yamilov type system and a noncommutative discrete Toda equation. For the noncommutative Adler--Yamilov type system we construct B\"acklund transformations.</description>

      <title>WZW Partition Functions from Supersymmetric Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Murthy and Witten which expresses modular invariant WZW partition functions as lattice sums. We show that when the sum is over the root lattice of SU(N), the result correctly reproduces the diagonal modular invariants of SU(N)_k whenever N &gt; 2 and N + k is even. Beyond these cases, the proposition is not always true and we provide a counterexample when k &gt;&gt; N &gt; 2 and k + N is odd. This proof generalizes the proof by Murthy and Witten for the SU(2) case. We then move onto nondiagonal modular invariants and show that all SU(2)_k nondiagonal invariants (the D and the E-series) can be obtained using these lattice sums.</description>

      <title>Notions of Adiabatic Drift in the Quantized Harper model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a quantized, discrete and drifting version of the Harper Hamiltonian, also called the finite almost Mathieu operator, which resembles the pendulum Hamiltonian but in phase space is confined to a torus. Spacing between pairs of eigenvalues of the operator spans many orders of magnitude, with nearly degenerate pairs of states at energies that are associated with circulating orbits in the associated classical system. When parameters of the system slowly vary, both adiabatic and diabatic transitions can take place at drift rates that span many orders of magnitude. Only under an extremely negligible drift rate would all transitions into superposition states be suppressed. The wide range of energy level spacings could be a common property of quantum systems with non-local potentials that are related to resonant classical dynamical systems. Notions for adiabatic drift are discussed for quantum systems that are associated with classical ones with divided phase space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the geometry of the space of codimension-2 submanifolds. We implicitly represent these submanifolds by a class of complex-valued functions. This reveals a prequantum bundle structure over the space of submanifolds, equipped with the well-known Marsden-Weinstein symplectic structure. This bundle allows a new physical interpretation of the Marsden-Weinstein structure as the curvature of a connection form, which measures the average of volumes swept by the deformation of the S^1-family of hypersurfaces, defined as the phases of a complex function implicitly representing a submanifold.</description>

      <title>Non-additive measures for quantum probability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-established that quantum probability does not follow classical Kolmogorov probability calculus. Various approaches have been developed to loosen the axioms, of which the use of signed measures is the most successful (e.g. the Wigner quasiprobability distribution). As part of our larger effort Assumptions of Physics, we have been considering the various roles of measures, which are used in physics not only for probability, but also to quantify the count of possible states and configurations. These measures play a crucial role in classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure. If one tries to construct a parallel in quantum mechanics, the measure to quantify the count of states turns out to be non-additive. The proper extension of probability calculus may require the use of non-additive measures, which is something that, to our knowledge, has not yet been explored. The purpose of this paper is to present the general idea and the open problems to an audience that is knowledgeable of the subject of non-additive set functions, though not necessarily in quantum physics, in the hope that it will spark helpful discussions. We go through the motivation in simple terms, which stems from the link between the entropy of a uniform distribution and the logarithm of the measure associated to its support. If one extends this notion to quantum mechanics, the associated measure is non-additive. We will explore some properties of this "quantum measure", its reasonableness in terms of the physics, but its peculiarity on the math side. We will explore the need for a set of properties that can properly characterize the measure and a generalization of the Radon-Nikodym derivative to define a properly extended probability calculus that reduces to the standard additive one on sets of physically distinguishable cases (i.e. orthogonal measurement outcomes).</description>

Abstract: This paper presents correspondence between Albert Einstein and the mathematical analyst J. L. B. Cooper on the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox of quantum theory published in 1935. Two letters written by Cooper, and the replies from Einstein, all written between October and December 1949, are retyped from the original ones. Furthermore, Einstein's second letter, which he wrote in German, is translated into English. The lack of agreement, arising from very different points of view, is analysed, taking into account the complex underlying mathematical and physical factors that arise naturally in connection with the EPR paradox.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation embodies a fundamental paradigm of the quantum theory of open systems, and the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) generation theorem says precisely which superoperators can appear on its right-hand side. These are the generators of completely positive trace-preserving (or nonincreasing) semigroups. A complete exposition of this theorem is given. The finite-dimensional case is handled using a form of Jamio\l{}kowski transform. The treatment requires no previous knowledge of complete positivity and obtains the Choi-Kraus presentation along the way. The (separable) infinite-dimensional case is handled by means of a sequence of finite-dimensional approximations, using the finite-dimensional case as a crucial tool. An extension to time-dependent generator is also given.</description>

      <title>Conformable Scaling and Critical Dynamics: A Unified Framework for Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the application of conformable derivatives to model critical phenomena near continuous phase transitions. By incorporating a deformation parameter into the differential structure, we derive unified expressions for thermodynamic observables such as heat capacity, magnetization, susceptibility, and coherence length, each exhibiting power-law behavior near the critical temperature. The conformable derivative framework naturally embeds scale invariance and critical slowing down into the dynamics without resorting to fully nonlocal fractional calculus. Modified Ginzburg-Landau equations are constructed to model superconducting transitions, leading to analytical expressions for the order parameter and London penetration depth. Experimental data from niobium confirm the model's applicability, showing excellent fits and capturing asymmetric scaling behavior around Tc. This work offers a bridge between classical mean-field theory and generalized scaling frameworks, with implications for both theoretical modeling and experimental analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning in Multi-Qubit Phase-Space Part I: Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) seeks to exploit the intrinsic properties of quantum mechanical systems, including superposition, coherence, and quantum entanglement for classical data processing. However, due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, QML faces practical limits in classical simulations with the state-vector representation of quantum system. On the other hand, phase-space methods offer an alternative by encoding quantum states as quasi-probability functions. Building on prior work in qubit phase-space and the Stratonovich-Weyl (SW) correspondence, we construct a closed, composable dynamical formalism for one- and many-qubit systems in phase-space. This formalism replaces the operator algebra of the Pauli group with function dynamics on symplectic manifolds, and recasts the curse of dimensionality in terms of harmonic support on a domain that scales linearly with the number of qubits. It opens a new route for QML based on variational modelling over phase-space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze from a geometric perspective the Hamiltonian formulation of a recent modification of the Husain-Kucha\v{r} model where, while preserving the connection as a dynamical variable, the other field is restricted to be the exterior covariant derivative of a Lie algebra-valued function. We prove that 3-dimensional diffeomorphisms can be accommodated among the local gauge transformations of the model in addition to the internal gauge symmetries.</description>

      <title>Generalized Jensen's inequality motivated from thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the work of P.T.Landsberg\cite{web1,web2} and S.S.Sidhu\cite{web3} by providing an inequality that has its main motivation from the laws of thermodynamics, in the form of a theorem which is quite useful in generating different inequalities such as the weighted AM-GM-HM inequality, the p-th power inequality , Jensen's inequality and many other inequalities.In this paper, we have not only given the thermodynamic motivation behind the inequality but we have given the required mathematical justification in the form of a straightforward rigorous proof using basic real analysis , which was not present in the works of Landsberg and Sidhu. In fact, the first statement of the theorem mathematically proves the uniqueness of the equilibrium temperature that is attained when n different bodies at different temperatures are brought in contact. The second statement of the theorem gives a mathematical proof of the fact that the process in which n bodies at different temperatures when brought in contact equilibriate to a common temperature is spontaneous,i.e., entropically favourable. Thus, this article motivates the students to come up with different mathematical results by observing the phenomena already existing in nature and also helps them to appreciate the conventional inequalities taught to them at the secondary school and undergraduate level by associating relevant physical phenomena with those inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of Sturm-Liouville operators with periodically modulated parameters. Their spectral properties depend on the monodromy matrix of the underlying periodic problem computed for the spectral parameter equal to $0$. Under certain assumptions, by studying the asymptotic behavior of Christoffel functions and density of states, we prove that the spectral density is a continuous positive everywhere function on the real line.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution and Diffusion of an Athermal Inertial Run-and-Tumble Particle in a Shear-Thickening Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of an athermal inertial run-and-tumble particle moving in a shear-thickening medium in $d=1$. The viscosity of the medium is represented by a nonlinear function $f(v)\sim\tan(v)$, while a symmetric dichotomous noise of strength $\Sigma$ and flipping rate $\lambda$ models the activity of the particle. Starting from the Fokker-Planck~(FP) equation for the time-dependent probability distribution $W_{\pm\Sigma}(v, t)$ of the particle's velocity $v$ at time $t$ and the active force is $\pm\Sigma$, we analytically derive the steady-state velocity distribution function $W_s(v)$ and a quadrature expression for the effective diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$. For a fixed $\Sigma$, $W_s(v)$ undergoes multiple transitions with varying $\lambda$, and we have identified the corresponding transition points. We then numerically compute $W_s(v)$, the mean-squared velocity $\langle v^2\rangle(t)$, and the diffusion coefficient $D_{\rm eff}$, all of which show excellent agreement with the analytical results in the steady-state. Finally, we test the robustness of the transitions in $W_s(v)$ by considering an alternative $f(v)$ function that also capture the shear-thickening behavior of the medium.</description>

      <title>Global Synchronization in Matrix-Weighted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena in complex systems are fundamental to understanding collective behavior across disciplines. While classical approaches model such systems by using scalar-weighted networks and simple diffusive couplings, many real-world interactions are inherently multidimensional and transformative. To address this limitation, Matrix-Weighted Networks (MWNs) have been introduced as a versatile framework where edges are associated with matrix weights that encode both interaction strength and directional transformation. In this work, we investigate the emergence and stability of global synchronization in MWNs by studying coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators-an archetypal model of nonlinear dynamics near a Hopf bifurcation. We derive a generalized Master Stability Function (MSF) tailored to MWNs and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for synchronization to occur. Central to our analysis is the concept of coherence, a structural property of MWNs ensuring path-independent transformations. Our results show that coherence is necessary to achieve global synchronization and provides a theoretical foundation for analyzing multidimensional dynamical processes in complex networked systems.</description>

      <title>Linearization-Based Feedback Stabilization of McKean-Vlasov PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the feedback stabilization of the McKean-Vlasov PDE on the torus. Our goal is to steer the dynamics toward a prescribed stationary distribution or accelerate convergence to it using a time-dependent control potential. We reformulate the controlled PDE in a weighted-projected space and apply the ground-state transform to obtain a Schrodinger-type operator. The resulting operator framework enables spectral analysis, verification of the infinite-dimensional Hautus test, and the construction of Riccati-based feedback laws. We rigorously prove local exponential stabilization via maximal regularity arguments and nonlinear estimates. Numerical experiments on well-studied models (the noisy Kuramoto model for synchronization, the O(2) spin model in a magnetic field, and the Gaussian/von Mises attractive interaction potential) showcase the effectiveness of our control strategy, demonstrating convergence speed-ups and stabilization of otherwise unstable equilibria.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective resistance between any two nodes in a perturbed resistor network is determined by removing multiple bonds from an infinite resistor lattice. We have developed an efficient method for calculating the Green operator of the Laplacian for such perturbed networks, which is directly related to the two-point resistance. Unlike the recursive techniques that remove bonds one at a time, our approach handles all bond modifications simultaneously. To demonstrate the versatility of our method, several analytical and numerical examples are presented. In addition, we computed bond current distributions to gain deeper insight into the nature of resistor perturbations. We emphasize that our method has a broad range of applications, including condensed matter physics describing the quantum mechanical effects of impurities in crystal lattices, recently emerging topoelectronics, the study of vibrations in spring networks, and problems involving random walks.</description>

Abstract: We discuss anyon condensation in mixed-state topological order. The phases were recently conjectured to be classified by pre-modular fusion categories. Just like anyon condensation in pure-state topological order, a bootstrap analysis shows condensable anyons are given by connected \'etale algebras. We explain how to perform generic anyon condensation including non-invertible anyons and successive condensations. Interestingly, some condensations lead to pure-state topological orders. We clarify when this happens. We also compute topological invariants of equivalence classes.</description>

      <title>Fluid-membrane Descriptions of Various Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The membrane paradigm of black holes is an effective theory that replaces the event horizon with a fictitious yet tangible fluid. It has provided us with valuable insights, especially in understanding the environment of black holes. The paradigm establishes a fluid/gravity correspondence that allows the computation of the thermal properties of the black hole in terms of the transport coefficients of the fluid. Recently, we showed that this is a van der Waals-type fluid for Kerr and especially for Johannsen-Psaltis black holes. Here, we use the paradigm to study the properties of various black holes in different dimensions to test the predictive capacity of effective theory. Among these, for the BTZ black holes, the paradigm gives a physical bulk viscosity, unlike the generic examples, for which the paradigm works with a negative bulk viscosity. For Lorentz-violating black holes, we demonstrate that the parameter for Lorentz violation is seen as a hair under the paradigm, which shifts the ergoregion where the fluid pressure diverges. It might have a consequence for black hole jets. For asymptotically safe quantum-corrected black holes, the paradigm detects the final state of evaporation, i.e., a remnant with a correct value for the mass that still has an event horizon. Finally, we check the paradigm with stringy black holes that have dilatonic and axionic charges, and the fluid produces the known results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18355v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate D-dimensional atomic Bose-Einstein condensates in a hypercylindrical trap with a vortex core along the z-axis and quantized circulation $\hbar m$. We analytically approximate the hypercylindrical Gross-Pitaevskii equation using dimensional perturbation theory with perturbation parameter $\delta=1/(D+2|m|-d)$, \textcolor{black}{where $d$ controls the contribution of kinetic energy at zeroth order}. We derive the zeroth-order ($\delta \to 0$) semiclassical approximations for the condensate energy, density, chemical potential, and critical vortex rotation speed in arbitrary dimensions. We investigate the effect of trap anisotropy on lower effective dimensionality and compute properties of vortices in higher dimensions motivated by the study of synthetic dimensions and holographic duality, where a higher-dimensional gravitational model corresponds to a lower-dimensional quantum model. In the zeroth-order approximation, we observe crossings between energy levels for different dimensions as a function of interaction strength and anisotropy parameters.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of one-dimensional, time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multipole moments in general relativity serve as a powerful tool for characterising the gravitational field. In this paper, we review the construction of the Geroch--Hansen multipole moments for stationary asymptotically flat vacuum spacetimes. A particular focus is placed on the well-definedness of these moments, which hinges on the uniqueness of the one-point conformal completion in Geroch's asymptotic flatness definition. Based on Geroch's approach, we formulate and prove a revised uniqueness result, thereby filling in some gaps in the original approach. Uniqueness holds up to certain conformal transformations, and we discuss how the multipole moments behave under such transformations.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations in Switching Diffusion: from Free Cumulants to Dynamical Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a particle with a time-dependent diffusion constant $D(t)$ that switches between random values drawn from a distribution $W(D)$ at a fixed rate $r$. Using a renewal approach, we compute exactly the moments of the position of the particle $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle$ at any finite time $t$, and for any $W(D)$ with finite moments $\langle D^n \rangle$. For $t \gg 1$, we demonstrate that the cumulants $\langle x^{2n}(t) \rangle_c$ grow linearly with $t$ and are proportional to the free cumulants of a random variable distributed according to $W(D)$. For specific forms of $W(D)$, we compute the large deviations of the position of the particle, uncovering rich behaviors and dynamical transitions of the rate function $I(y=x/t)$. Our analytical predictions are validated numerically with high precision, achieving accuracy up to $10^{-2000}$.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>

      <title>$x-y$ swap for $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of 2D gravity -- ``matrix model'' duality on the example of $(2,2p+1)$ minimal string. We propose a reformulation of the duality, related to a more conventional one by ``$x-y$ swap'' in the language of topological recursion. This formulation elucidates some conceptual and technical difficulties in the dictionary of the duality and relation to other examples. In particular, it allows to circumvent the necessity to use ``resonance transformations'', that were previously introduced to match the worldsheet and ``matrix model'' correlators, and the expressions for minimal string amplitudes in this approach are reminiscent of the ones obtained recently for ``complex Liouville string'' theory. Using this new approach, we also formulate a conjecture on how one can compute amplitudes with operators other than tachyons in the dual theory.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Pinning models with contact number constraint: the effect of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered pinning models are statistical mechanics models built on discrete renewal processes: renewal epochs in this context are called contacts. It is well known that pinning models can undergo a localization/delocalization phase transition: in the localized phase the typical density of contacts is positive and the largest gap between contacts is at most of the order of the logarithm of the size $n$ of the system, whereas the system is void of contacts in the delocalized phase. When disorder is absent and the phase transition is discontinuous, conditioning the contact density to be positive but smaller than the minimum typical density in the localized phase has the effect of forcing to create one, and only one, macroscopic gap between two contacts, while the rest of the configuration keeps the characteristics of a localized state. However it is known that, in the presence of (bounded) disorder, this big jump phenomenon is no longer observed, in the sense that the largest gap in the conditioned system is $o(n)$. Under minimal integrability conditions on the disorder we show that the conditioned system is localized in a very strong sense, in particular the largest gap is $O(\log n)$. The proof is achieved by exploiting the improved understanding of the localized phase of disordered pinning models developed in [34] and by establishing some refined estimates, in particular a quenched Local Central Limit Theorem. We also present an analysis of the effect of disorder on the large deviation rate function of the contact density and, as an important ingredient for the generality of our results, we establish a smoothing inequality for pinning models under minimal integrability conditions, thus generalizing [11,32].</description>
