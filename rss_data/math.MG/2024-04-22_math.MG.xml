      <title>The Andoni-Naor-Neiman inequalities and isometric embeddability into a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Andoni, Naor and Neiman (2018) established a family of quadratic metric inequalities that hold true in every $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. As stated in their paper, this family seems to include all previously used quadratic metric inequalities that hold true in every $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. We prove that there exists a metric space that satisfies all inequalities in this family but does not admit an isometric embedding into any $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space. More precisely, we prove that the $6$-point metric spaces constructed by Nina Lebedeva, which are known to admit no isometric embedding into any $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space, satisfy all inequalities in this family.</description>

      <title>A Blaschke-Petkantschin formula for linear and affine subspaces with application to intersection probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a uniformly distributed random linear subspace $L$ and a stochastically independent random affine subspace $E$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, both of fixed dimension. For a natural class of distributions for $E$ we show that the intersection $L\cap E$ admits a density with respect to the invariant measure. This density depends only on the distance $d(o,E \cap L)$ of $L\cap E$ to the origin and is derived explicitly. It can be written as the product of a power of $d(o,E \cap L)$ and a part involving an incomplete beta integral. Choosing $E$ uniformly among all affine subspaces of fixed dimension hitting the unit ball, we derive an explicit density for the random variable $d(o,E \cap L)$ and study the behavior of the probability that $E \cap L$ hits the unit ball in high dimensions. Lastly, we show that our result can be extended to the setting where $E$ is tangent to the unit sphere, in which case we again derive the density for $d(o,E \cap L)$. Our probabilistic results are derived by means of a new integral-geometric transformation formula of Blaschke--Petkantschin type.</description>

      <title>Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms and associated $p$-energy measures on fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct good $p$-energy forms on metric measure spaces as pointwise subsequential limits of Besov-type $p$-energy functionals under certain geometric/analytic conditions. Such forms are often called Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms in the literature. As an advantage of our approach, the associated $p$-energy measures are obtained and investigated. We also prove that our construction is applicable to the settings of Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and Cao-Gu-Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517], yields Korevaar-Schoen $p$-energy forms comparable to the $p$-energy forms constructed in these papers, and can be further modified in the case of self-similar sets to obtain self-similar $p$-energy forms keeping most of the good properties of Korevaar-Schoen ones.</description>

      <title>Contraction properties and differentiability of $p$-energy forms with applications to nonlinear potential theory on self-similar sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce new contraction properties called the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms as generalizations of many well-known inequalities, such as Clarkson's inequalities, the strong subadditivity and the ``Markov property'' in the theory of nonlinear Dirichlet forms, and show that any $p$-energy form satisfying Clarkson's inequalities is Fr\'{e}chet differentiable. We also verify the generalized $p$-contraction property for $p$-energy forms constructed by Kigami [Mem. Eur. Math. Soc. 5 (2023)] and by Cao--Gu--Qiu [Adv. Math. 405 (2022), no. 108517]. As a general framework of $p$-energy forms taking into consideration the generalized $p$-contraction property, we introduce the notion of $p$-resistance form and investigate fundamental properties for $p$-harmonic functions with respect to $p$-resistance forms. In particular, some new estimates on scaling factors of $p$-energy forms are obtained by establishing H\"{o}lder regularity estimates for harmonic functions, and the $p$-walk dimensions of the generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski carpets and $D$-dimensional level-$l$ Sierpi\'{n}ski gasket are shown to be strictly greater than $p$.</description>

      <title>Inscribable fans I: Inscribed cones and virtual polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.07724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate polytopes inscribed into a sphere that are normally equivalent (or strongly isomorphic) to a given polytope $P$. We show that the associated space of polytopes, called the inscribed cone of $P$, is closed under Minkowski addition. Inscribed cones are interpreted as type cones of ideal hyperbolic polytopes and as deformation spaces of Delaunay subdivisions. In particular, testing if there is an inscribed polytope normally equivalent to $P$ is polynomial time solvable.
  Normal equivalence is decided on the level of normal fans and we study the structure of inscribed cones for various classes of polytopes and fans, including simple, simplicial, and even. We classify (virtually) inscribable fans in dimension $2$ as well as inscribable permutahedra and nestohedra.
  A second goal of the paper is to introduce inscribed virtual polytopes. Polytopes with a fixed normal fan $\mathcal{N}$ form a monoid with respect to Minkowski addition and the associated Grothendieck group is called the type space of $\mathcal{N}$. Elements of the type space correspond to formal Minkowski differences and are naturally equipped with vertices and hence with a notion of inscribability. We show that inscribed virtual polytopes form a subgroup, which can be non-trivial even if $\mathcal{N}$ does not have actual inscribed polytopes.
  We relate inscribed virtual polytopes to routed particle trajectories, that is, piecewise-linear trajectories of particles in a ball with restricted directions. The state spaces gives rise to connected groupoids generated by reflections, called reflection groupoids. The endomorphism groups of reflection groupoids can be thought of as discrete holonomy groups of the trajectories and we determine when they are reflection groups.</description>

      <title>Kalai's $3^{d}$ conjecture for unconditional and locally anti-blocking polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kalai's $3^d$ conjecture states that every centrally-symmetric $d$-polytope has at least $3^d$ faces. We give short proofs for two special cases: if $P$ is unconditional (that is, invariant w.r.t. reflection in any coordinate hyperplane), and more generally, if $P$ is locally anti-blocking. In both cases we show that the minimum is attained exactly for the Hanner polytopes.</description>

      <title>Solutions to the discrete Pompeiu problem and to the finite Steinhaus tiling problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nonempty finite subset of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^k$ $(k\ge 2)$. We prove that if a function $f\colon \mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{C}$ is such that the sum of $f$ on every congruent copy of $K$ is zero, then $f$ vanishes everywhere. In fact, a stronger, weighted version is proved. As a corollary we find that every finite subset $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^k$ having at least two elements is a Jackson set; that is, no subset of $\mathbb{R}^k$ intersects every congruent copy of $K$ in exactly one point.</description>

      <title>A rigidity framework for Roe-like algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a complete solution to the problem of C*-rigidity for (extended) locally compact metric spaces. Namely, we show that (stable) isomorphisms among Roe algebras always give rise to coarse equivalences. To do so, we develop a framework to study rigidity problems for Roe-like C*-algebras of countably generated coarse spaces. This allows us to provide a unified proof of C*-rigidity for Roe algebras, algebras of operators of controlled propagation, and algebras of quasi-local operators. As further applications, we prove that the outer automorphism groups of all of these algebras are isomorphic to the group of coarse equivalences of the starting coarse space.</description>
