      <title>Modulational instability and collapse of internal gravity waves in the atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear two-dimensional internal gravity waves (IGWs) in the atmospheres of the Earth and the Sun are studied. The resulting two-dimensional nonlinear equation has the form of a generalized nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with nonlocal nonlinearity, that is when the nonlinear response depends on the wave intensity at some spatial domain. The modulation instability of IGWs is predicted, and specific cases for the Earth's atmosphere are considered. In a number of particular cases, the instability thresholds and instability growth rates are analytically found. Despite the nonlocal nonlinearity, we demonstrate the possibility of critical collapse of IGWs due to the scale homogeneity of the nonlinear term in spatial variables.</description>

      <title>Radiative tail of solitary waves in an extended Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) equation which is a modified KdV equation perturbed by a fifth-order derivative term multiplied by a small parameter $\epsilon^2$, with $0&lt; \epsilon \ll 1$. Unlike the KdV equation, the stationary fKdV equation does not exhibit exactly localized 1-soliton solution, instead it allows a solution which has a well defined central core similar to that of the KdV 1-soliton solution, accompanied by extremely small oscillatory standing wave tails on both sides of the core. The amplitude of the standing wave tail oscillations is $\mathcal{O}(\exp(-1/\epsilon))$, i.e. it is beyond all orders small in perturbation theory. The analytical computation of the amplitude of these transcendentally small tail oscillations has been carried out up to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^5)$ order corrections by using the complex method of matched asymptotics. Also the long-standing discrepancy between the $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^2)$ perturbative result of Grimshaw and Joshi (1995) and the numerical results of Boyd (1995) has been resolved. In addition to the stationary symmetric weakly localized solitary wave-like solutions, we analyzed the stationary asymmetric solutions of the fKdV equation which decay exponentially to zero on one side of the (slightly asymmetric) core and blows up to large negative values on other side of the core. The asymmetry is quantified by computing the third derivative of the solution at the origin which also turns out to be beyond all orders small in perturbation theory. The analytical computation of the third derivative of a function at the origin has also been carried out up to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^5)$ order corrections. We use the exponentially convergent pseudo-spectral method to solve the fKdV equation numerically. The analytical and the numerical results show remarkable agreement.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Spatiotemporal Pattern Formation in Photonic Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of time varying photonic media with an optical Kerr nonlinearity and an associated phase transition. The interplay between a periodically modulated permittivity and the nonlinearity induces a continuous transition of electromagnetic waves to a state with broken spatial and time translation symmetries. This transition gives rise to a lattice-like wave pattern, in many ways similar to a spatial crystallization in solids. Symmetry breaking triggers the emergence of soft, Goldstone-like modes, which propagate as deformations of the lattice structure, as well as massive Higgs-like modes -- spatially uniform oscillations of the field amplitude. We extend the analysis of the non-equlibrium symmetry breaking to 2+1 dimensional time varying media and discuss pattern formation as well as the connection to discrete dissipative time crystals.</description>
