      <title>Minimum time connection between non-equilibrium steady states: the Brownian gyrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimising the connection time between non-equilibrium steady states of the Brownian Gyrator. This is a paradigmatic model in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, an overdamped Brownian particle trapped in a two-dimensional elliptical potential, with the two degrees of freedom $(x,y)$ coupled to two, in principle different, thermal baths with temperatures $T_x$ and $T_y$, respectively. Application of Pontryagin's Maximum Principle reveals that shortest protocols belong to the boundaries of the control set defined by the limiting values of the parameters $(k,u)$ characterising the elliptical potential. We identify two classes of optimal minimum time protocols, i.e. brachistochrones: (i) regular bang-bang protocols, for which $(k,u)$ alternatively take their minimum and maximum values allowed, and (ii) infinitely degenerate singular protocols. We thoroughly investigate the minimum connection time over the brachistochrones in the limit of having infinite capacity for compression. A plethora of striking phenomena emerge: sets of states attained at null connection times, discontinuities in the connection time along adjacent target states, and the fact that, starting from a state in which the oscillators are coupled, uncoupled states are impossible to reach in a finite time.</description>

      <title>Exponential growth rate of lattice comb polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a lattice model of comb polymers and derive bounds on the exponential growth rate of the number of embeddings of the comb. A comb is composed of a backbone that is a self-avoiding walk and a set of $t$ teeth, also modelled as mutually and self-avoiding walks, attached to the backbone at vertices or nodes of degree 3. Each tooth of the comb has $m_a$ edges and there are $m_b$ edges in the backbone between adjacent degree 3 vertices and between the first and last nodes of degree 3 and the end vertices of degree 1 of the backbone. We are interested in the exponential growth rate as $t \to \infty$ with $m_a$ and $m_b$ fixed. We prove upper bounds on this growth rate and show that for small values of $m_a$ the growth rate is strictly less than that of self-avoiding walks.</description>

      <title>Low energy excitations in bosonic quantum quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first principles construction of the low-energy effective action for bosonic self-organized quantum quasicrystals. Our generalized elasticity approach retains the appropriate number of phase- and corresponding conjugate density- degrees-of-freedom required for a proper description of the Goldstone modes. For the dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystal structures we obtain collective longitudinal and transversal excitations with an isotropic speed of sound. Meanwhile, for the octagonal structure, the coupling between phononic and phasonic degrees of freedom leads in turn to hybridization of the latter with the condensate sound mode, producing collective excitations with a longitudinal and transversal component, and an anisotropic speed of sound. Finally, we discuss the fate of each excitation mode at the low and high density phase transitions limiting the quantum quasicrystal phase.</description>

      <title>Topological Anderson insulator phases in one dimensional quasi-periodic mechanical SSH chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transition between topological phases in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model composed of springs and masses in which the intracellular quasi-periodic disorder modulates the spring constants. We observe the presence of a topological Anderson insulating (TAI) phase within a specific range of quasi-periodic modulation strength and calculate the phase transition boundary analytically. We examine the localization properties of the normal modes using the inverse participation ratio (IPR) of eigenstates of the dynamical matrix, and the corresponding fractal dimension associated with quasiperiodic modulation. We also examine the stability of the TAI phase across a range of modulation strengths and comments on the presence of mobility edge that separate localized modes from non-localized ones. We demonstrate the fact that special analytical techniques are needed to compute an exact expression for mobility edges in such scenario.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-assisted transport in a tight-binding chain with a linear potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters. From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size, provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of charged dual-unitary circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between symmetries and entanglement in out-of-equilibrium quantum systems is currently at the centre of an intense multidisciplinary research effort. Here we introduce a setting where these questions can be characterised exactly by considering dual-unitary circuits with an arbitrary number of $U(1)$ charges. After providing a complete characterisation of these systems we show that one can introduce a class of solvable states, which extends that of generic dual unitary circuits, for which the non-equilibrium dynamics can be solved exactly. In contrast to the known class of solvable states, which relax to the infinite temperature state, these states relax to a family of non-trivial generalised Gibbs ensembles. The relaxation process of these states can be simply described by a linear growth of the entanglement entropy followed by saturation to a non-maximal value but with maximal entanglement velocity. We then move on to consider the dynamics from non-solvable states, combining exact results with the entanglement membrane picture we argue that the entanglement dynamics from these states is qualitatively different from that of the solvable ones. It shows two different growth regimes characterised by two distinct slopes, both corresponding to sub-maximal entanglement velocities. Moreover, we show that non-solvable initial states can give rise to the quantum Mpemba effect, where less symmetric initial states restore the symmetry faster than more symmetric ones.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium dynamics of symmetry-resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry: Exact asymptotics in Rule 54</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry are two measures of quantum correlations sensitive to symmetries of the system. Here we discuss their non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet interacting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the more analytically tractable "charged moments", i.e. traces of powers of a suitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms of a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local algebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments, valid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the relevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially with the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.</description>

      <title>Entropy, Thermodynamics and the Geometrization of the Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss how pure mathematics and theoretical physics can be applied to the study of language models. Using set theory and analysis, we formulate mathematically rigorous definitions of language models, and introduce the concept of the moduli space of distributions for a language model. We formulate a generalized distributional hypothesis using functional analysis and topology. We define the entropy function associated with a language model and show how it allows us to understand many interesting phenomena in languages. We argue that the zero points of the entropy function and the points where the entropy is close to 0 are the key obstacles for an LLM to approximate an intelligent language model, which explains why good LLMs need billions of parameters. Using the entropy function, we formulate a conjecture about AGI.
  Then, we show how thermodynamics gives us an immediate interpretation to language models. In particular we will define the concepts of partition function, internal energy and free energy for a language model, which offer insights into how language models work. Based on these results, we introduce a general concept of the geometrization of language models and define what is called the Boltzmann manifold. While the current LLMs are the special cases of the Boltzmann manifold.</description>

      <title>Projected Entangled Pair States with flexible geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS) are a class of quantum many-body states that generalize Matrix Product States for one-dimensional systems to higher dimensions. In recent years, PEPS have advanced understanding of strongly correlated systems, especially in two dimensions, e.g., quantum spin liquids. Typically described by tensor networks on regular lattices (e.g., square, cubic), PEPS have also been adapted for irregular graphs, however, the computational cost becomes prohibitive for dense graphs with large vertex degrees. In this paper, we present a PEPS algorithm to simulate low-energy states and dynamics defined on arbitrary, fluctuating, and densely connected graphs. We introduce a cut-off, $\kappa \in \mathbb{N}$, to constrain the vertex degree of the PEPS to a set but tunable value, which is enforced in the optimization by applying a simple edge-deletion rule, allowing the geometry of the PEPS to change and adapt dynamically to the system's correlation structure. We benchmark our flexible PEPS algorithm with simulations of classical spin glasses and quantum annealing on densely connected graphs with hundreds of spins, and also study the impact of tuning $\kappa$ when simulating a uniform quantum spin model on a regular (square) lattice. Our work opens the way to apply tensor network algorithms to arbitrary, even fluctuating, background geometries.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage from measurement-induced entanglement in random shallow circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random constant-depth quantum circuits in a two-dimensional architecture. While these circuits only produce entanglement between nearby qubits on the lattice, long-range entanglement can be generated by measuring a subset of the qubits of the output state. It is conjectured that this long-range measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) proliferates when the circuit depth is at least a constant critical value. For circuits composed of Haar-random two-qubit gates, it is also believed that this coincides with a quantum advantage phase transition in the classical hardness of sampling from the output distribution. Here we provide evidence for a quantum advantage phase transition in the setting of random Clifford circuits. Our work extends the scope of recent separations between the computational power of constant-depth quantum and classical circuits, demonstrating that this kind of advantage is present in canonical random circuit sampling tasks. In particular, we show that in any architecture of random shallow Clifford circuits, the presence of long-range MIE gives rise to an unconditional quantum advantage. In contrast, any depth-d 2D quantum circuit that satisfies a short-range MIE property can be classically simulated efficiently and with depth O(d). Finally, we introduce a two-dimensional, depth-2, "coarse-grained" circuit architecture, composed of random Clifford gates acting on O(log n) qubits, for which we prove the existence of long-range MIE and establish an unconditional quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Critical surface adsorption of confined binary liquids with locally conserved mass and composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to a solid surface, the properties of a fluid deviate significantly from their bulk values. In this context, we study the surface adsorption profiles of a symmetric binary liquid confined to a slit pore by means of molecular dynamics simulations; the latter naturally entails that mass and concentration are locally conserved. Near a bulk consolute point, where the liquid exhibits a demixing transition with the local concentration as the order parameter, we determine the order parameter profiles and characterise the relevant critical scaling behaviour, in the regime of strong surface attraction, for a range of pore widths and temperatures. The obtained order parameter profiles decay monotonically near the surfaces, also in the presence of a pronounced layering in the number density. Overall, our results agree qualitatively with recent theoretical predictions from a mesoscopic field-theoretical approach for the canonical ensemble.</description>

      <title>Modelling competition for space: Emergent inefficiency and inequality due to spatial self-organization among a group of crowd-avoiding agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Competition for a limited resource is the hallmark of many complex systems, and often, that resource turns out to be the physical space itself. In this work, we study a novel model designed to elucidate the dynamics and emergence in complex adaptive systems in which agents compete for some spatially spread resource. Specifically, in the model, the dynamics result from the agents trying to position themselves in the quest to avoid physical crowding experienced locally. We characterize in detail the dependence of the emergent behavior of the model on the population density of the system and the individual-level agent traits such as the extent of space an agent considers as her neighborhood, the limit of occupation density one tolerates within that neighborhood, and the information accessibility of the agents about neighborhood occupancy. We show that the efficiency with which the agents utilize the physical space shows transitions at two values of densities. The first of these transitions demarcates efficient and inefficient phases of the system, and the second one signifies the density at which the inefficiency is maximum. We show that the variation of inefficiency with respect to the information accessible to the agents shows opposing behavior above and below this second transition density. We also look into the inequality of resource sharing in the model and show that although inefficiency can be a non-monotonic function of information depending upon the parameters of the model, inequality, in general, decreases with information. Our study sheds light on the role of competition, spatial constraints, and agent traits within complex adaptive systems, offering insights into their emergent behaviors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic behavior of open quantum systems through the Hamiltonian of Mean Force, focusing on two models: a two-qubit system interacting with a thermal bath and a Jaynes-Cummings Model without the rotating wave approximation. By analyzing both weak and strong coupling regimes, we uncover the impact of environmental interactions on quantum thermodynamic quantities, including specific heat capacity, internal energy, and entropy. Further, the ergotropy and entropy production are computed. We also explore the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which sets an upper bound on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

Abstract: The totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) is a stochastic model for the unidirectional dynamics of interacting particles on a $1$D-lattice that is much used in systems biology and statistical physics. Its master equation describes the evolution of the probability distribution on the state space. The size of the master equation grows exponentially with the length of the lattice. It is known that the complexity of the system may be reduced using mean field approximations. We provide a rigorous derivation and a stochastic interpretation of these approximations and present numerical results on their accuracy for a number of relevant cases.</description>

      <title>Exact Fractional Inference via Re-Parametrization &amp; Interpolation between Tree-Re-Weighted- and Belief Propagation- Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of inference -- required to compute the partition function, $Z$, of an Ising model over a graph of $N$''spins" -- is most likely exponential in $N$. Efficient variational methods, such as Belief Propagation (BP) and Tree Re-Weighted (TRW) algorithms, compute $Z$ approximately by minimizing the respective (BP- or TRW-) free energy. We generalize the variational scheme by building a $\lambda$-fractional interpolation, $Z^{(\lambda)}$, where $\lambda=0$ and $\lambda=1$ correspond to TRW- and BP-approximations, respectively. This fractional scheme -- coined Fractional Belief Propagation (FBP) -- guarantees that in the attractive (ferromagnetic) case $Z^{(TRW)} \geq Z^{(\lambda)} \geq Z^{(BP)}$, and there exists a unique (``exact") $\lambda_*$ such that $Z=Z^{(\lambda_*)}$. Generalizing the re-parametrization approach of \citep{wainwright_tree-based_2002} and the loop series approach of \citep{chertkov_loop_2006}, we show how to express $Z$ as a product, $\forall \lambda:\ Z=Z^{(\lambda)}{\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$, where the multiplicative correction, ${\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$, is an expectation over a node-independent probability distribution built from node-wise fractional marginals. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by extensive experiments with models from Ising ensembles over planar and random graphs of medium- and large-sizes. The empirical study yields a number of interesting observations, such as the ability to estimate ${\tilde Z}^{(\lambda)}$ with $O(N^{2::4})$ fractional samples and suppression of $\lambda_*$ fluctuations with an increase in $N$ for instances from a particular random Ising ensemble. We also verify and discuss the applicability of this approach to the problem of image de-noising.</description>

      <title>Entanglement spectrum of matchgate circuits with universal and non-universal resources</title>

Abstract: The entanglement level statistics of a quantum state have recently been proposed to be a signature of universality in the underlying quantum circuit. This is a consequence of level repulsion in the entanglement spectra being tied to the integrability of entanglement generated. However, such studies of the level-spacing statistics in the entanglement spectrum have thus far been limited to the output states of Clifford and Haar random circuits on product state inputs. In this work, we provide the first example of a circuit which is composed of a simulable gate set, yet has a Wigner-Dyson distributed entanglement level spectrum without any perturbing universal element. We first show that, for matchgate circuits acting on random product states, Wigner-Dyson statistics emerge by virtue of a single SWAP gate, in direct analog to previous studies on Clifford circuits. We then examine the entanglement spectrum of matchgate circuits with varied input states, and find a sharp jump in the complexity of entanglement as we go from two- to three-qubit entangled inputs. Studying Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits, we find examples of classically simulable circuits whose output states exhibit Wigner-Dyson entanglement level statistics in the absence of universal quantum gate elements. Our study thus provides strong evidence that entanglement spectrum is not strongly connected to notions of simulability in any given quantum circuit.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal alignment induces asymmetric clustering in active mixtures</title>

Abstract: Heterogeneity is ubiquitous in biological and synthetic active matter systems that are inherently out of equilibrium. Typically, such active mixtures involve not only conservative interactions between the constituents, but also non-reciprocal couplings, whose full consequences for the collective behavior still remain elusive. Here, we study a minimal active non-reciprocal mixture with both, symmetric isotropic and non-reciprocal polar interactions. By combining a hydrodynamic theory derived from microscopic equations and particle-based simulations, we provide a scale-bridging view on the rich dynamics that occur even in absence of oscillatory instabilities. We show, in particular, that non-reciprocal alignment alone induces asymmetrical clustering at otherwise fully symmetric parameters. These density inhomogeneities go beyond the typical band formation in Vicsek-like systems. Within the asymmetric clustering state, single-species clusters chase more dilute accumulations of the other species.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structures in phase-separating non-reciprocal polar active mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal systems exhibit diverse dynamical phases whose character depends on the type and degree of non-reciprocity. In this study, we theoretically investigate dynamical structures in a mixture of non-reciprocally aligning polar active particles with repulsion, focusing on the performance on (and connection between) different levels of description. Linear stability analyses of the associated continuum model predict a profound influence of non-reciprocity, leading to phase separation, (anti-)flocking and asymmetric clustering behavior. On the microscopic level, particle simulations confirm the emergence of these dynamical phases and allow for a more in-depth investigation of (microscopic) properties, including orientational correlations and susceptibilities. The drastic impact of orientational couplings alone on the density dynamics is demonstrated in particle simulations without repulsion, where non-reciprocal alignment leads to the asymmetric formation of single-species polarized clumps. Overall, our findings demonstrate that certain dynamical properties, like a chase-and-run behavior in the asymmetrical clustering phase, are overlooked in mean-field continuum theory, making microscopic simulations an indispensable tool for studying the effects of non-reciprocal alignment couplings.</description>

      <title>Measuring multipartite quantum correlations by thermodynamic work extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations are at the core of quantum mechanics and play a crucial role in various fields. While bipartite quantum correlations have been extensively studied, multipartite quantum correlations in many-body systems remain elusive due to their complex structure. In particular, a primary challenge lies in the fact that the calculation of multipartite quantum correlation measure often requires exponential cost. In this work, we tackle this problem by adopting a thermodynamic approach; we introduce a measure of multipartite quantum correlations based on the difference in extractable thermodynamic work by global operations and local operations and classical communication (LOCC). This can be regarded as a multipartite generalization of the work deficit, which has attracted attention as a thermodynamic measure of bipartite quantum correlation. A distinguishing feature of the thermodynamic approach to multipartite quantum correlation is that we can compare the degree of quantum correlations with clear operational meaning. Importantly, we develop an efficient calculation method of the multipartite work deficit. This efficient method works for a special class of quantum many-body systems described by matrix product states (MPS), where the numerical cost is shown to be proportional to the system size, significantly reducing the exponential cost required for the direct calculations. We demonstrate this efficient method in the AKLT state and the cluster state, and analytically obtain the exact values of this measure. We further show that a quantum phase transition described by MPS is well captured by the multipartite work deficit. This shows that the multipartite work deficit does not only highlight the fundamental connection between multipartite quantum correlations and quantum thermodynamics, but also serves as an efficiently-computable probe of the structures of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Supersolidity in Rydberg tweezer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg tweezer arrays provide a versatile platform to explore quantum magnets with dipolar XY or van-der-Waals Ising ZZ interactions. Here, we propose a scheme combining dipolar and van-der-Waals interactions between Rydberg atoms, where the amplitude of the latter can be greater than that of the former, realizing an extended Hubbard model with long-range tunnelings in optical tweezer arrays. For repulsive interactions, we predict the existence of a robust supersolid phase accessible in current Rydberg tweezer experiments on the triangular lattice supported by large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on explicitly calculated pair interactions for ${}^{87}$Rb and with a critical entropy per particle $S/N \approx 0.19$. Such a lattice supersolid is long-lived, found over a wide parameter range in an isotropic and flat two-dimensional geometry, and can be realized for 100s of particles. Its thermodynamical and dynamical properties can hence be studied at a far larger scale than hitherto possible.</description>
