      <title>Stationary multiple euclidon solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear superposition of the stationary euclidon solution with an arbitrary axially symmetric stationary gravitational field on the basis of the method of variation of parameters was constructed. Stationary soliton solution of the Einstein equations was generalized to the case of a stationary seed metric. The formulae obtained have a simple and compact form, permitting an effective non-linear "addition" of the solutions. These euclidon solutions serve as building block of the theory, which allows for the construction of almost all known solutions to the vacuum static axially-symmetric Einstein equations, including such important ones as the Kerr-NUT solution. The stationary euclidon solution has a clear physical interpretation as a relativistic accelerated non-inertial reference frame, which provides a different perspective on the physical interpretation of well-known solutions, such as the Kerr solution.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical understanding of flux quantization in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Like electric charge, magnetic flux is also quantised. Theoretically, one can show that the flux quantum must be h/e, as observed in the quantum Hall effect. However, in the superconducting systems, the flux quantum is experimentally observed as h/2e. There is no fundamental explanation for the empirical result. In this article, we argue that this phenomenon is fundamentally linked to the nonlocality problem of the Aharonov-Bohm effect and present a new semi-classical explanation for the magnetic flux quantum in superconductivity. This work will also show why the flux quantum should be h/e in the case of the quantum Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Can the "basis vectors", describing the internal spaces of fermion and boson fields with the Clifford odd (for fermion) and Clifford even (for boson) objects, explain interactions among fields, with gravitons included?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Clifford odd and even "basis vectors", describing the internal spaces of fermion and boson fields, respectively, offer in even-dimensional spaces, like in $d=(13+1)$, the description of quarks and leptons and antiquarks and antileptons appearing in families, as well as of all the corresponding gauge fields: photons, weak bosons, gluons, Higgs's scalars and the gravitons, which not only explain all the assumptions of the standard model, and makes several predictions, but also explains the existence of the graviton gauge fields. Analysing the properties of fermion and boson fields concerning how they manifest in $d=(3+1)$, assuming space in $d=(3+1)$ flat, while all the fields have non-zero momenta only in $d=(3+1)$, this article illustrates that scattering of fermion and boson fields, with gravitons included, represented by the Feynman diagrams, are determined by the algebraic products of the corresponding "basis vectors" of fields, contributing to scattering. There are two kinds of boson gauge fields appearing in this theory, both contribute when describing scattering. We illustrate, assuming that the internal space, which manifests in $d=(3+1)$ origin in $d=(5+1)$, and in $d=(13+1)$, the annihilation of an electron and positron into two photons, and the scattering of an electron and positron into two muons. The theory offers an elegant and promising illustration of the interaction among fermion and boson second quantised fields.</description>
