      <title>Optimization-Driven Design of Monolithic Soft-Rigid Grippers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a significant challenge in soft robotics due to the unpredictability introduced by common manufacturing processes such as 3D printing and molding. These processes often result in deviations from simulated designs, requiring multiple prototypes before achieving a functional system. In this study, we propose a novel methodology to address these limitations by combining advanced rapid prototyping techniques and an efficient optimization strategy. Firstly, we employ rapid prototyping methods typically used for rigid structures, leveraging their precision to fabricate compliant components with reduced manufacturing errors. Secondly, our optimization framework minimizes the need for extensive prototyping, significantly reducing the iterative design process. The methodology enables the identification of stiffness parameters that are more practical and achievable within current manufacturing capabilities. The proposed approach demonstrates a substantial improvement in the efficiency of prototype development while maintaining the desired performance characteristics. This work represents a step forward in bridging the sim-to-real gap in soft robotics, paving the way towards a faster and more reliable deployment of soft robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Low-Dose CT Image Reconstruction on GPU using Out-Of-Core: Precision and Quality Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algebraic methods applied to the reconstruction of Sparse-view Computed Tomography (CT) can provide both a high image quality and a decrease in the dose received by patients, although with an increased reconstruction time since their computational costs are higher. In our work, we present a new algebraic implementation that obtains an exact solution to the system of linear equations that models the problem and based on single-precision floating-point arithmetic. By applying Out-Of-Core (OOC) techniques, the dimensions of the system can be increased regardless of the main memory size and as long as there is enough secondary storage (disk). These techniques have allowed to process images of 768 x 768$ pixels. A comparative study of our method on a GPU using both single-precision and double-precision arithmetic has been carried out. The goal is to assess the single-precision arithmetic implementation both in terms of time improvement and quality of the reconstructed images to determine if it is sufficient to consider it a viable option. Results using single-precision arithmetic approximately halves the reconstruction time of the double-precision implementation, whereas the obtained images retain all internal structures despite having higher noise levels.</description>

      <title>A tutorial on automatic differentiation with complex numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic differentiation is everywhere, but there exists only minimal documentation of how it works in complex arithmetic beyond stating "derivatives in $\mathbb{C}^d$" $\cong$ "derivatives in $\mathbb{R}^{2d}$" and, at best, shallow references to Wirtinger calculus. Unfortunately, the equivalence $\mathbb{C}^d \cong \mathbb{R}^{2d}$ becomes insufficient as soon as we need to derive custom gradient rules, e.g., to avoid differentiating "through" expensive linear algebra functions or differential equation simulators. To combat such a lack of documentation, this article surveys forward- and reverse-mode automatic differentiation with complex numbers, covering topics such as Wirtinger derivatives, a modified chain rule, and different gradient conventions while explicitly avoiding holomorphicity and the Cauchy--Riemann equations (which would be far too restrictive). To be precise, we will derive, explain, and implement a complex version of Jacobian-vector and vector-Jacobian products almost entirely with linear algebra without relying on complex analysis or differential geometry. This tutorial is a call to action, for users and developers alike, to take complex values seriously when implementing custom gradient propagation rules -- the manuscript explains how.</description>
