      <title>Calculation of the Relaxation Modulus in the Andrade Model by Using the Laplace Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the theory of linear viscoelasticity, we derive an analytical expression of the relaxation modulus in the Andrade model $G_{\alpha }\left( t\right) $ for the case of rational parameter \mbox{$\alpha =m/n\in (0,1)$} in terms of Mittag--Leffler functions from its Laplace transform $\tilde{G}_{\alpha }\left( s\right) $. It turns out that the expression obtained can be rewritten in terms of Rabotnov functions. Moreover, for the original parameter $\alpha =1/3$ in the Andrade model, we obtain an expression in terms of Miller-Ross functions. The asymptotic behaviours of $G_{\alpha }\left( t\right) $ for $t\rightarrow 0^{+}$ and $t\rightarrow +\infty $ are also derived applying the Tauberian theorem. The analytical results obtained have been numerically checked by solving the Volterra integral equation satisfied by $G_{\alpha }\left( t\right) $ by using a successive approximation approach, as well as computing the inverse Laplace transform of $\tilde{G}_{\alpha }\left( s\right) $ by using Talbot's method.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Singularities in Scattering Spectra of Mie Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems are known to possess unique singularities in the scattering spectra such as exceptional points, bound states in the continuum, Diabolic points, and anapole states, which are usually considered to be independent. Here, we demonstrate the fundamental relationships between non-Hermitian singularities and observe them experimentally in the scattering spectra. We reveal that exceptional points appear in the anapole regime, and diabolic points are associated with superscattering. We confirm our findings with microwave experiments by measuring the scattering spectra of subwavelength Mie-resonant ceramic rings. Our study underpins the generic behavior of non-Hermitian singularities in the scattering spectra of subwavelength resonators, uncovering their novel applications in non-Hermitian nonlinear optics and topological photonics.</description>

      <title>Efficient numerical frameworks for modelling ultrasonic beams propagating across interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two different frameworks are developed to model the wave field generated by a transducer and propagating through one or more interfaces, and a Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) integration scheme is used to numerically evaluate their results. The first method is based on the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld Integral (RSI), further developing a formulation in the literature and improving its capabilities, while the second relies on a high-frequency approximation, using a ray tracing principle. The advantages and limitations of each model are then compared via in-depth investigations on several use cases, culminating in an efficiency and scope assessment. It was found that the RSI-based model performs well if a large number of field points is needed, such as when modelling a full image of the field. Conversely, for a large number of interfaces, such as when modelling the field through a thin-layered material, the most efficient model was the ray tracing formulation, since it was unnecessary to propagate the field between all the interfaces first. This was especially noticeable for applications requiring only the evaluation of the field at a few points on the other side of multiple interfaces.</description>

      <title>Topological dynamics of continuum lattice structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum lattice structures which consist of joined elastic beams subject to flexural deformations are ubiquitous in nature and engineering. Here, first, we reveal the topological dynamics of continuous beam structures by rigorously proving the existence of infinitely many topological edge states within the bandgaps. Then, we obtain the analytical expressions for the topological phases of bulk bands, and propose a topological index related to the Zak phase that determines the existence of the edge states. The theoretical approach is directly applicable to general continuum lattice structures. We demonstrate the topological edge states of bridge-like frames, plates, and continuous beams on elastic foundations and springs, and the topological corner states of kagome frames. The continuum lattice structures serve as excellent platforms for exploring various kinds of topological phases and demonstrating the topologically protected states at multifrequencies, and their topological dynamics has significant implications in safety assessment, structural health monitoring, and energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabaticity across a separatrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shortcuts to adiabaticity are strategies for conserving adiabatic invariants under non-adiabatic (i.e. fast-driving) conditions. Here, we show how to extend classical, Hamiltonian shortcuts to adiabaticity to allow the crossing of a phase-space separatrix -- a situation in which a corresponding adiabatic protocol does not exist. Specifically, we show how to construct a time-dependent Hamiltonian that evolves one energy shell to another energy shell across a separatrix. Leveraging this method, we design an erasure procedure whose energy cost and fidelity do not depend on the protocol's duration.</description>

      <title>Visual relativistic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many formalisms of special relativity are shown in various textbooks. However, even in those where the underlying geometry of Minkowski space is emphasized, the visualisations are lacking. This article aims to remedy this by expressing relativistic concepts in a visual manner, using the full power of hyperbolic trigonometric functions. Minkowski diagrams in energy-momentum space are used and then augmented in comparison with previous uses in literature by direct usage of triangles in Minkowski space. As a proof-of-concept for the advantages of this holistic approach, elegant new derivations of the relativistic rocket equation and the relativistic Doppler effect are presented.</description>
