      <title>New spectral Bishop--Gromov and Bonnet--Myers theorems and applications to isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a sharp and rigid spectral generalization of the classical Bishop--Gromov volume comparison theorem: if a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\geq3$ satisfies \[ \lambda_1(-\gamma\Delta+\mathrm{Ric})\geqslant n-1 \] for some $0\leqslant\gamma\leqslant\frac{n-1}{n-2}$, then $\mathrm{vol}(M)\leqslant\mathrm{vol}(\mathbb S^{n})$, and $\pi_1(M)$ is finite. Moreover, the bound on $\gamma$ is sharp for this result to hold. A generalization of the Bonnet--Myers theorem is also shown under the same spectral condition. The proofs involve the use of a new unequally weighted isoperimetric problem and unequally warped $\mu$-bubbles. As an application, in dimensions $3\leqslant n\leqslant 5$, we infer sharp results on the isoperimetric structure at infinity of complete manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive biRicci curvature.</description>

      <title>Bismut torsion parallel metrics with constant holomorphic sectional curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An old conjecture in non-K\"ahler geometry states that, if a compact Hermitian manifold has constant holomorphic sectional curvature, then the metric must be K\"ahler (when the constant is non-zero) or Chern flat (when the constant is zero). It is known to be true in complex dimension $2$ by the work of Balas and Gauduchon in 1985 (when the constant is negative or zero) and Apostolov, Davidov and Muskarov in 1996 (when the constant is positive). In dimension $3$ or higher, the conjecture is only known in some special cases, such as the locally conformally K\"ahler case (when the constant is negative or zero) by the work of Chen, Chen and Nie, or for complex nilmanifolds with nilpotent $J$ by the work of Li and the second named author.
  In this note, we confirm the above conjecture for all non-balanced Bismut torsion parallel (BTP) manifolds. Here the BTP condition means that the Bismut connection has parallel torsion. In particular, the conjecture is valid for all Vaisman manifolds.</description>

      <title>Optimal asymptotic volume ratio for noncompact 3-manifolds with asymptotically nonnegative Ricci curvature and a uniformly positive scalar curvature lower bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study 3-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds with asymptotically nonnegative Ricci curvature and a uniformly positive scalar curvature lower bound. Our main result is that, if this manifold has $k$ ends and finite first Betti number, then it has at most linear volume growth, and furthermore, if the negative part of Ricci curvature decays sufficiently fast at infinity, then we have an optimal asymptotic volume ratio $\limsup_{r\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\mathrm{Vol}(B(p, r))}{r}\leq4k\pi$. In particular, our results apply to 3-dimensional complete non-compact Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and a uniformly positive scalar curvature lower bound.</description>

      <title>Cohomogeneity one RCD-spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces $(X,d,\mathfrak{m})$ with group actions by isometries preserving the reference measure $\mathfrak{m}$ and whose orbit space has dimension one, i.e. cohomogeneity one actions. To this end we prove a Slice Theorem asserting that each slice at a point is homeomorphic to a non-negatively curved $\mathsf{RCD}$-space. Under the assumption that $X$ is non-collapsed we further show that the slices are homeomorphic to metric cones over homogeneous spaces with $\mathrm{Ric} \geq 0$. As a consequence we obtain complete topological structural results and a principal orbit representation theorem. Conversely, we show how to construct new $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces from a cohomogeneity one group diagram, giving a complete description of $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of cohomogeneity one. As an application of these results we obtain the classification of cohomogeneity one, non-collapsed $\mathsf{RCD}$-spaces of essential dimension at most $4$.</description>

      <title>A Simple Ricci Flow Proof of the Uniformization Theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we provide a very simple proof of the uniformization theorem of Riemann surfaces by Ricci flow. The argument builds on a refinement of Hamilton's isoperimetric estimate for the Ricci flow on the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>The Boussinesq systems on non-compact Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the global existence, uniqueness and exponential stability of mild solutions to the Boussinesq systems on the framework of non-compact Riemannian manifolds. We work on some manifolds satisfying some bounded and negative conditions on curvature tensors. We consider a couple of Stokes and heat semigroups associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. By using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup we establish the existence and uniqueness of the bounded-in-time mild solution for linear system. Next, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to obtain the well-posedness by utilizing fixed point arguments. Moreover, we will prove the exponential stability of such solutions by using Gronwall's inequality. Finally, we give an application of stability to study periodic mild solutions. Our results extend the ones in \cite{Pi,HuyHa2022} in the aspect of global-in-time well-posedness and the existence of periodic mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Hypertoric varieties, $W$-Hilbert schemes, and Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>

      <title>On Steinerberger Curvature and Graph Distance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steinerberger proposed a notion of curvature on graphs (J. Graph Theory, 2023). We show that nonnegative curvature is almost preserved under three graph operations. We characterize the distance matrix and its null space after adding an edge between two graphs. Let $D$ be the graph distance matrix and $\mathbf{1}$ be the all-one vector. We provide a way to construct graphs so that the linear system $Dx = \mathbf{1}$ does not have a solution. Let $\eta$ be the Perron eigenvector of $D.$ We provide a lower bound to $\langle\eta,\mathbf{1}\rangle$ when the graph is a tree.</description>
