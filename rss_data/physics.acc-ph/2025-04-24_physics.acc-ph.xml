      <title>Nondestructive beam envelope measurements using beam position monitors for low-beta heavy ion beams in superconducting linear accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In superconducting linear accelerators (linacs), accurately monitoring beam dynamics is essential for minimizing beam losses and ensuring stable operations. However, destructive diagnostics must be avoided in superconducting sections to prevent the occurrence of particulates and outgassing, rendering direct measurements of the beam envelope particularly challenging. This study presents a non-destructive method that uses beam position monitors (BPMs) to estimate the transverse beam envelope based on measurements of the quadrupole moment of the beam distribution. Although this concept was originally proposed in the 1980s, its application, especially to hadron beams, has been limited because of low signal sensitivity and the accuracy constraints associated with conventional BPM geometries. To overcome these challenges, we employed $\cos{2\theta}$-type BPMs, which offer improved sensitivity to quadrupole components and are well-suited for low-$\beta$ heavy ion beams. This method was applied to the heavy ion beams in the superconducting RIKEN linac (SRILAC), for which data from eight BPMs were combined with transfer matrix calculations and supplemental wire scanner data. The resulting beam envelope estimates exhibited good agreement with conventional quadrupole scan results, demonstrating the feasibility of this technique for routine, non-destructive beam monitoring in superconducting accelerator sections.</description>

      <title>Preliminary design of a Cavity Tuner for Superconducting Radio-Frequency Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a newly designed cavity tuner for superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavity. Aiming to overcome the drawbacks of traditional tuning systems, like the limited tuning range of piezoelectric tuner and the low-speed tuning of stepper-motor-based tuner, this novel tuner is crafted to improve SRF cavity performance and stability via efficient and accurate frequency tuning. The design encompasses several key elements. The cavity structure includes a commonly used 1.3 GHz single-cell superconducting cavity and a room-temperature coaxial tuner cavity. The coupling mechanism between the two cavities, along with the coupling window design, ensures effective energy transfer while minimizing losses. The mechanical tuning system, driven by electromagnetic coils, enables precise adjustments, and the cooling mechanisms for both cavities guarantee stable operation. Functioning by coupling an external resonant cavity to the superconducting one, this tuner can adjust frequencies through mechanical or electromagnetic methods. It realizes rapid tuning, with a speed much faster than traditional mechanical tuner, high-precision tuning down to the sub-mHz level, and a wide tuning range covering a broader frequency spectrum. Theoretical analysis and simulations verify that the tuner can remarkably enhance tuning speed, precision, and range. It also has distinct advantages such as a simplified structure, which reduces manufacturing and maintenance complexity, and enhanced reliability due to its non-contact tuning operation. In particle accelerators, this cavity tuner holds great potential. It represents a significant step forward in superconducting accelerator technology, offering a novel way to optimize the performance and stability of SRF cavity.</description>

      <title>High Field Magnet Programme -- European Strategy Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this submission, we describe research goals, implementation, and timelines of the High Field Magnet Programme, hosted by CERN. The programme pursues accelerator-magnet R&amp;D with low-temperature- and high-temperature superconductor technology with a main focus on the FCC-hh. Following a long tradition of magnet R&amp;D for high-energy particle colliders, HFM R&amp;D fosters important societal impact through synergies with other fields.</description>
