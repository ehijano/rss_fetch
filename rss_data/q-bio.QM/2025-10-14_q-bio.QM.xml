      <title>scPPDM: A Diffusion Model for Single-Cell Drug-Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Single-Cell Perturbation Prediction Diffusion Model (scPPDM), the first diffusion-based framework for single-cell drug-response prediction from scRNA-seq data. scPPDM couples two condition channels, pre-perturbation state and drug with dose, in a unified latent space via non-concatenative GD-Attn. During inference, factorized classifier-free guidance exposes two interpretable controls for state preservation and drug-response strength and maps dose to guidance magnitude for tunable intensity. Evaluated on the Tahoe-100M benchmark under two stringent regimes, unseen covariate combinations (UC) and unseen drugs (UD), scPPDM sets new state-of-the-art results across log fold-change recovery, delta correlations, explained variance, and DE-overlap. Representative gains include +36.11%/+34.21% on DEG logFC-Spearman/Pearson in UD over the second-best model. This control interface enables transparent what-if analyses and dose tuning, reducing experimental burden while preserving biological specificity.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Inverse Gaussians for Hemodynamic Transport (MIGHT) in Vascular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic molecular communication (MC) in the cardiovascular system (CVS) is a key enabler for many envisioned medical applications in the human body, such as targeted drug delivery, early cancer detection, and continuous health monitoring. The design of MC systems for such applications requires suitable models for the signaling molecule propagation through complex vessel networks (VNs). Existing theoretical models offer limited analytical tractability and lack closed-form solutions, making the analysis of large-scale VNs either infeasible or not insightful. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a novel closed-form physical model, termed MIGHT, for advection-diffusion-driven transport of signaling molecules through complex VNs. The model represents the received molecule flux as a weighted sum of inverse Gaussian (IG) distributions, parameterized by physical properties of the network. The proposed model is validated by comparison with an existing convolution-based model and finite-element simulations. Further, we show that the model can be applied for the reduction of large VNs to simplified representations preserving the essential transport dynamics and for estimating representative VN based on received signals from unknown VNs.</description>

      <title>PRISM: Enhancing Protein Inverse Folding through Fine-Grained Retrieval on Structure-Sequence Multimodal Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target three-dimensional structure, known as the inverse folding problem, is central to protein engineering but remains challenging due to the vast sequence space and the importance of local structural constraints. Existing deep learning approaches achieve strong recovery rates, yet they lack explicit mechanisms to reuse fine-grained structure-sequence patterns that are conserved across natural proteins. We present PRISM, a multimodal retrieval-augmented generation framework for inverse folding that retrieves fine-grained representations of potential motifs from known proteins and integrates them with a hybrid self-cross attention decoder. PRISM is formulated as a latent-variable probabilistic model and implemented with an efficient approximation, combining theoretical grounding with practical scalability. Across five benchmarks (CATH-4.2, TS50, TS500, CAMEO 2022, and the PDB date split), PRISM establishes new state of the art in both perplexity and amino acid recovery, while also improving foldability metrics (RMSD, TM-score, pLDDT), demonstrating that fine-grained multimodal retrieval is a powerful and efficient paradigm for protein sequence design.</description>

      <title>Fast and Interpretable Protein Substructure Alignment via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proteins are essential biological macromolecules that execute life functions. Local motifs within protein structures, such as active sites, are the most critical components for linking structure to function and are key to understanding protein evolution and enabling protein engineering. Existing computational methods struggle to identify and compare these local structures, which leaves a significant gap in understanding protein structures and harnessing their functions. This study presents PLASMA, the first deep learning framework for efficient and interpretable residue-level protein substructure alignment. We reformulate the problem as a regularized optimal transport task and leverage differentiable Sinkhorn iterations. For a pair of input protein structures, PLASMA outputs a clear alignment matrix with an interpretable overall similarity score. Through extensive quantitative evaluations and three biological case studies, we demonstrate that PLASMA achieves accurate, lightweight, and interpretable residue-level alignment. Additionally, we introduce PLASMA-PF, a training-free variant that provides a practical alternative when training data are unavailable. Our method addresses a critical gap in protein structure analysis tools and offers new opportunities for functional annotation, evolutionary studies, and structure-based drug design. Reproducibility is ensured via our official implementation at https://github.com/ZW471/PLASMA-Protein-Local-Alignment.git.</description>

      <title>Optimal Pair Matching Combined with Machine Learning Predicts a Significant Reduction in Myocardial Infarction Risk in African Americans following Omega-3 Fatty Acid Supplementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conflicting clinical trial results on omega-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFA) have prompted uncertainty about their cardioprotective effects. While the VITAL trial found no overall cardiovascular benefit from n-3 HUFA supplementation, its substantial African American (AfAm) enrollment provided a unique opportunity to explore racial differences in response to n-3 HUFA supplementation. The current observational study aimed to simulate randomized clinical trial (RCT) conditions by matching 3,766 AfAm and 15,553 non-Hispanic White (NHW) individuals from the VITAL trial utilizing propensity score matching to address the limitations related to differences in confounding variables between the two groups. Within matched groups (3,766 AfAm and 3,766 NHW), n-3 HUFA supplementation's impact on myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality was assessed. A weighted decision tree analysis revealed belonging to the n-3 supplementation group as the most significant predictor of MI among AfAm but not NHW. Further logistic regression using the LASSO method and bootstrap estimation of standard errors indicated n-3 supplementation significantly lowered MI risk in AfAm (OR 0.17, 95% CI [0.048, 0.60]), with no such effect in NHW. This study underscores the critical need for future RCT to explore racial disparities in MI risk associated with n-3 HUFA supplementation and highlights potential causal differences between supplementation health outcomes in AfAm versus NHW populations.</description>

      <title>Genomic Influence of a Key Transcription Factor in Male Glandular Malignancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate cancer (PCa) remains a significant global health concern among men, particularly due to the lethality of its more aggressive variants. Despite therapeutic advancements that have enhanced survival for many patients, high grade PCa continues to contribute substantially to cancer related mortality. Emerging evidence points to the MYB proto-oncogene as a critical factor in promoting tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and disease relapse. Notably, differential expression patterns have been observed, with markedly elevated MYB levels in tumor tissues from Black men relative to their White counterparts potentially offering insight into documented racial disparities in clinical outcomes. This study investigates the association between MYB expression and key oncogenic features, including androgen receptor (AR) signaling, disease progression, and the risk of biochemical recurrence. Employing a multimodal approach that integrates histopathological examination, quantitative digital imaging, and analyses of public transcriptomic datasets, our findings suggest that MYB overexpression is strongly linked to adverse prognosis. These results underscore MYB's potential as a prognostic biomarker and as a candidate for the development of individualized therapeutic strategies.</description>

      <title>TopROI: A topology-informed network approach for tissue partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mammalian tissue architecture is central to biological function, and its disruption is a hallmark of disease. Medical imaging techniques can generate large point cloud datasets that capture changes in the cellular composition of such tissues with disease progression. However, regions of interest (ROIs) are usually defined by quadrat-based methods that ignore intrinsic structure and risk fragmenting meaningful features. Here, we introduce TopROI, a topology-informed, network-based method for partitioning point clouds into ROIs that preserves both local geometry and higher-order architecture. TopROI integrates geometry-informed networks with persistent homology, combining cell neighbourhoods and multiscale cycles to guide community detection. Applied to synthetic point clouds that mimic glandular structure, TopROI outperforms quadrat-based and purely geometric partitions by maintaining biologically plausible ROI geometry and better preserving ground-truth structures. Applied to cellular point clouds obtained from human colorectal cancer biopsies, TopROI generates ROIs that preserve crypt-like structures and enable persistent homology analysis of individual regions. This study reveals a continuum of architectural changes from healthy mucosa to carcinoma, reflecting progressive disorganisation in tissue structure. TopROI thus provides a principled and flexible framework for defining biologically meaningful ROIs in large point clouds, enabling more accurate quantification of tissue organization and new insights into structural changes associated with disease progression.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Generative Framework for Modeling Single-Cell Transcriptomes with Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies and the simultaneous gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel hybrid quantum-classical simulator that leverages quantum entanglement to model single-cell transcriptomes. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) and cell-cell communication topologies with explicit directionality (causality). The synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies that challenge standard analysis. We demonstrated that classical correlation methods (Pearson and Spearman) failed to reconstruct the complete programmed quantum causal paths, instead reporting spurious statistical artifacts driven by high base-gene expression probabilities. Applying CellChat2.0 to the simulated cell-cell communication validated the true mechanistic links by showing a robust, relative increase in communication probability (up to 75-fold) only when the quantum entanglement was active. This work confirms that the quantum kernel is essential for creating high-fidelity ground truth data, highlighting the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>

      <title>ECMSim: A high-performance web simulation of cardiac ECM remodeling through integrated ODE-based signaling and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3 million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125 species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction, and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.</description>

      <title>Multitask finetuning and acceleration of chemical pretrained models for small molecule drug property prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT) significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes. Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference in industrial drug discovery workflows.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Neurodegeneration with Brain Age Gap Prediction Models: A Graph Signal Processing Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodegeneration, characterized by the progressive loss of neuronal structure or function, is commonly assessed in clinical practice through reductions in cortical thickness or brain volume, as visualized by structural MRI. While informative, these conventional approaches lack the statistical sophistication required to fully capture the spatially correlated and heterogeneous nature of neurodegeneration, which manifests both in healthy aging and in neurological disorders. To address these limitations, brain age gap has emerged as a promising data-driven biomarker of brain health. The brain age gap prediction (BAGP) models estimate the difference between a person's predicted brain age from neuroimaging data and their chronological age. The resulting brain age gap serves as a compact biomarker of brain health, with recent studies demonstrating its predictive utility for disease progression and severity. However, practical adoption of BAGP models is hindered by their methodological obscurities and limited generalizability across diverse clinical populations. This tutorial article provides an overview of BAGP and introduces a principled framework for this application based on recent advancements in graph signal processing (GSP). In particular, we focus on graph neural networks (GNNs) and introduce the coVariance neural network (VNN), which leverages the anatomical covariance matrices derived from structural MRI. VNNs offer strong theoretical grounding and operational interpretability, enabling robust estimation of brain age gap predictions. By integrating perspectives from GSP, machine learning, and network neuroscience, this work clarifies the path forward for reliable and interpretable BAGP models and outlines future research directions in personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Implementation: An Introduction to a Low-Cost, GUI-Based, Semi-Unsupervised Microscopy Segmentation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a novel microscopy image analysis framework designed for low-budget labs equipped with a standard CPU desktop. The Python-based program enables cytometric analysis of live, unstained cells in culture through an advanced computer vision and machine learning pipeline. Crucially, the framework operates on label-free data, requiring no manually annotated training data or training phase. It is accessible via a user-friendly, cross-platform GUI that requires no programming skills, while also providing a scripting interface for programmatic control and integration by developers. The end-to-end workflow performs semantic and instance segmentation, feature extraction, analysis, evaluation, and automated report generation. Its modular architecture supports easy maintenance and flexible integration while supporting both single-image and batch processing. Validated on several unstained cell types from the public dataset of livecells, the framework demonstrates superior accuracy and reproducibility compared to contemporary tools like Cellpose and StarDist. Its competitive segmentation speed on a CPU-based platform highlights its significant potential for basic research and clinical application-particularly in cell transplantation for personalised medicine and muscle regeneration therapies. The access to the application is available for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Riemannian generative decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19133v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Riemannian representation learning typically relies on an encoder to estimate densities on chosen manifolds. This involves optimizing numerically brittle objectives, potentially harming model training and quality. To completely circumvent this issue, we introduce the Riemannian generative decoder, a unifying approach for finding manifold-valued latents on any Riemannian manifold. Latents are learned with a Riemannian optimizer while jointly training a decoder network. By discarding the encoder, we vastly simplify the manifold constraint compared to current approaches which often only handle few specific manifolds. We validate our approach on three case studies -- a synthetic branching diffusion process, human migrations inferred from mitochondrial DNA, and cells undergoing a cell division cycle -- each showing that learned representations respect the prescribed geometry and capture intrinsic non-Euclidean structure. Our method requires only a decoder, is compatible with existing architectures, and yields interpretable latent spaces aligned with data geometry.

Abstract: Drug discovery through virtual screening (VS) has become a popular strategy for identifying hits against protein targets. Alongside VS, molecular design further expands accessible chemical space. Together, these approaches have the potential to reduce the cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments, thereby accelerating drug discovery pipelines. Improving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant challenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower screening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform enhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep learning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a multi-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds. Compared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated significantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets, achieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10 times faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development pipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and novel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these pipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the molecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels. This demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for various targets and pockets.In addition, the HelixVS platform has been extended with HelixVS-Syn, which enables design of novel compounds from reference scaffolds. These designed molecules are seamlessly integrated into the HelixVS screening workflow, allowing researchers to explore both existing chemical libraries and novel chemical space with high affinity, synthetic accessibility, and structural novelty.</description>
