      <title>The role of gouge production in the seismic behavior of rough faults: A numerical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault zones mature through the accumulation of earthquakes and the wearing of contact asperities at multiple scales. This study examines how wear-induced gouge production affects the evolution of fault seismicity, focusing on earthquake nucleation, recurrence, and moment partitioning. Using 2D quasi-dynamic simulations integrating rate-and-state friction with Archard's law of wear, we model the space-time distribution of gouge and its effect on the critical slip distance. The study reveals a shift from single to multi-rupture nucleation, marked by increased foreshock activity. The recurrence interval undergoes two separate phases: an initial phase of steady increase followed by a secondary phase of unpredictable behavior. Finally, we observe a transition in the moment partitioning from faster to slower slip rates and a decrease in the moment released per cycle relative to the case where no gouge formation is simulated. This research sheds light on wear-driven mechanisms affecting fault slip behavior, offering valuable insights into how the evolution of gouge along a fault affects its seismic potential.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) plays a crucial role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, particularly from industrial outputs. Using seismic monitoring can aid in an accurate and robust monitoring system to ensure the effectiveness of CCS and mitigate associated risks. However, conventional seismic wave equation-based approaches are computationally demanding, which hinders real-time applications. In addition to efficiency, forecasting and uncertainty analysis are not easy to handle using such numerical-simulation-based approaches. To this end, we propose a novel subsurface multiphysics monitoring and forecasting framework utilizing video diffusion models. This approach can generate high-quality representations of CO$2$ evolution and associated changes in subsurface elastic properties. With reconstruction guidance, forecasting and inversion can be achieved conditioned on historical frames and/or observational data. Meanwhile, due to the generative nature of the approach, we can quantify uncertainty in the prediction. Tests based on the Compass model show that the proposed method successfully captured the inherently complex physical phenomena associated with CO$_2$ monitoring, and it can predict and invert the subsurface elastic properties and CO$_2$ saturation with consistency in their evolution.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional multi-physics simulation and sensitivity analysis of cyclic hydrogen storage in salt caverns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale storage technologies are crucial to balance consumption and intermittent production of renewable energy systems. One of these technologies can be developed by converting the excess energy into compressed air or hydrogen, i.e., compressed gas, and store it in underground solution-mined salt caverns. Salt caverns are proven seals towards compressed air and hydrogen. However, several challenges including fast injection/production cycles and operating them in a system of caverns fields are yet to be resolved in order to allow for their safe scaled-up utilization for energy storage. The present study investigates time-dependent mechanical behaviors of salt caverns, individually and in multi-cavern systems. The stress conditions and model constructions are chosen to be relevant for underground energy storage purpose, and reflect the essential microscopic deformation mechanisms for reliable predictions. Built on these, the impact of model calibration and parameter estimation on cavern-scale performance are investigated. Moreover, the impact of the transient and reverse creep, cavern complex geometry, and non-salt interlayers on salt cavern performance are studied in detail. Importantly, the presented studies include quantification of the interaction of the caverns in a system of caverns. These are achieved by developing an open-source three-dimensional finite element simulator, named as "SafeInCave", which also incorporates a comprehensive salt rock constitutive model. The findings provide insights into improving the reliability of numerical simulations for safe and efficient operation of salt caverns in energy storage applications.</description>

      <title>The seismic purifier: An unsupervised approach to seismic signal detection via representation learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an unsupervised learning approach to earthquake detection. We train a specific class of deep auto-encoders that learn to reproduce the input waveforms after a data-compressive bottleneck, and then use a simple triggering algorithm at the bottleneck to label waveforms as noise or signal.
  Our approach is motivated by the intuition that efficient compression of data should represent signals differently from noise, and is facilitated by a time-axis-preserving approach to auto-encoding and intuitively-motivated choices on the architecture and triggering.
  We demonstrate that the detection performance of the unsupervised approach is comparable to, and in some cases better than, some of the state-of-the-art supervised methods. Moreover, it has strong \emph{cross-dataset generalization}. By experimenting with various modifications, we demonstrate that the detection performance is insensitive to various technical choices made in the algorithm.
  Our approach has the potential to be useful for other signal detection problems with time series data.</description>

      <title>Tipping detection using climate networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robust Early Warning Signals (EWS) is necessary to quantify the risk of crossing tipping points in the present-day climate change. Classically, EWS are statistical measures based on time series of climate state variables, without exploiting their spatial distribution. However, spatial information is crucial to identify the starting location of a transition process, and can be directly inferred by satellite observations. By using complex networks constructed from several climate variables on the numerical grid of climate simulations, we seek for network properties that can serve as EWS when approaching a state transition. We show that network indicators such as the normalized degree, the average length distance and the betweenness centrality are capable of detecting tipping points at the global scale, as obtained by the MIT general circulation model in a coupled-aquaplanet configuration for CO$_2$ concentration-driven simulations. The applicability of such indicators as EWS is assessed and compared to traditional methods. We also analyse the ability of climate networks to identify nonlinear dynamical patterns.</description>

      <title>On Godunov-type finite volume methods for seismic wave propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational complexity of simulating seismic waves demands continual exploration of more efficient numerical methods. While Finite Volume methods are widely acclaimed for tackling general nonlinear hyperbolic (wave) problems, their application in realistic seismic wave simulation remains uncommon, with rare investigations in the literature. Furthermore, seismic wavefields are influenced by sharp subsurface interfaces frequently encountered in realistic models, which could, in principle, be adequately solved with Finite Volume methods. In this study, we delved into two Finite Volume (FV) methods to assess their efficacy and competitiveness in seismic wave simulations, compared to traditional Finite Difference schemes. We investigated Gudunov-type FV methods: an upwind method called wave propagation algorithm (WPA), and a Central-Upwind type method (CUp). Our numerical analysis uncovered that these finite volume methods could provide less dispersion (albeit increased dissipation) compared to finite differences for seismic problems characterized by velocity profiles with abrupt transitions in the velocity. However, when applied to more realistic seismic models, finite volume methods yielded unfavorable outcomes compared to finite difference methods, the latter offering lower computational costs and higher accuracy. This highlights that despite the potential advantages of finite volume methods, such as their conservative nature and aptitude for accurately capturing shock waves in specific contexts, our results indicate that they are only advantageous for seismic simulations when unrealistic abrupt transitions are present in the velocity models.</description>
