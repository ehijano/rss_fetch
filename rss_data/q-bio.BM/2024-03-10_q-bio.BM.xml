      <title>Advances of Deep Learning in Protein Science: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein representation learning plays a crucial role in understanding the structure and function of proteins, which are essential biomolecules involved in various biological processes. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for protein modeling due to its ability to learn complex patterns and representations from large-scale protein data. This comprehensive survey aims to provide an overview of the recent advances in deep learning techniques applied to protein science. The survey begins by introducing the developments of deep learning based protein models and emphasizes the importance of protein representation learning in drug discovery, protein engineering, and function annotation. It then delves into the fundamentals of deep learning, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, attention models, and graph neural networks in modeling protein sequences, structures, and functions, and explores how these techniques can be used to extract meaningful features and capture intricate relationships within protein data. Next, the survey presents various applications of deep learning in the field of proteins, including protein structure prediction, protein-protein interaction prediction, protein function prediction, etc. Furthermore, it highlights the challenges and limitations of these deep learning techniques and also discusses potential solutions and future directions for overcoming these challenges. This comprehensive survey provides a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners in the field of proteins who are interested in harnessing the power of deep learning techniques. By consolidating the latest advancements and discussing potential avenues for improvement, this review contributes to the ongoing progress in protein research and paves the way for future breakthroughs in the field.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Large Language Models for Molecule Prediction Tasks</title>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) stand at the forefront of a number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Despite the widespread adoption of LLMs in NLP, much of their potential in broader fields remains largely unexplored, and significant limitations persist in their design and implementation. Notably, LLMs struggle with structured data, such as graphs, and often falter when tasked with answering domain-specific questions requiring deep expertise, such as those in biology and chemistry. In this paper, we explore a fundamental question: Can LLMs effectively handle molecule prediction tasks? Rather than pursuing top-tier performance, our goal is to assess how LLMs can contribute to diverse molecule tasks. We identify several classification and regression prediction tasks across six standard molecule datasets. Subsequently, we carefully design a set of prompts to query LLMs on these tasks and compare their performance with existing Machine Learning (ML) models, which include text-based models and those specifically designed for analysing the geometric structure of molecules. Our investigation reveals several key insights: Firstly, LLMs generally lag behind ML models in achieving competitive performance on molecule tasks, particularly when compared to models adept at capturing the geometric structure of molecules, highlighting the constrained ability of LLMs to comprehend graph data. Secondly, LLMs show promise in enhancing the performance of ML models when used collaboratively. Lastly, we engage in a discourse regarding the challenges and promising avenues to harness LLMs for molecule prediction tasks.

      <title>A Protein Structure Prediction Approach Leveraging Transformer and CNN Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proteins are essential for life, and their structure determines their function. The protein secondary structure is formed by the folding of the protein primary structure, and the protein tertiary structure is formed by the bending and folding of the secondary structure. Therefore, the study of protein secondary structure is very helpful to the overall understanding of protein structure. Although the accuracy of protein secondary structure prediction has continuously improved with the development of machine learning and deep learning, progress in the field of protein structure prediction, unfortunately, remains insufficient to meet the large demand for protein information. Therefore, based on the advantages of deep learning-based methods in feature extraction and learning ability, this paper adopts a two-dimensional fusion deep neural network model, DstruCCN, which uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CCN) and a supervised Transformer protein language model for single-sequence protein structure prediction. The training features of the two are combined to predict the protein Transformer binding site matrix, and then the three-dimensional structure is reconstructed using energy minimization.</description>
