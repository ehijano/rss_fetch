      <title>A Metric on the Polycrystalline Microstructure State Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Material microstructures are traditionally compared using sets of statistical measures that are incomplete, e.g., two visually distinct microstructures can have identical grain size distributions and phase fractions. While this is not a severe concern for materials fabricated by traditional means, the microstructures produced by advanced manufacturing methods can depend sensitively and unpredictably on the processing conditions. Moreover, the advent of computational materials design has increased the frequency of synthetic microstructure generation, and there is not yet a standard approach in the literature to validate the generated microstructures with experimental ones. This work proposes an idealized distance on the space of single-phase polycrystalline microstructures such that two microstructures that are close with respect to the distance exhibit statistically similar grain geometries in all respects below a user-specified length scale. Given a pair of micrographs, the distance is approximated by sampling windows from the micrographs, defining a distance between pairs of windows, and finding a window matching that minimizes the sum of pairwise window distances. The approach is used to compare a variety of synthetic microstructures and to develop a procedure to query a proof-of-concept database suitable for general single-phase polycrystalline microstructures.</description>

      <title>Rewrite it in Rust: A Computational Physics Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surveys of computational science show that many scientists use languages like C and C++ in order to write code for scientific computing, especially in scenarios where performance is a key factor. In this paper, we seek to evaluate the use of Rust in such a scenario, through implementations of a physics simulation in both C++ and Rust. We also create a parallel version of our Rust code, in order to further explore performance as well as parallel code complexity. Measuring performance as program runtime, we find that Rust can offer better performance than C++, with some test cases showing as much as a 5.6$\times$ performance increase, and that parallel code in Rust can further improve performance while being easy to write safely. Finally, we provide some preliminary profiling to better understand the difference between the way our implementations perform.</description>

      <title>eminus -- Pythonic electronic structure theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In current electronic structure research endeavors such as warm dense matter or machine learning applications, efficient development necessitates non-monolithic software, providing an extendable and flexible interface. The open-source idea offers the advantage of having a source code base that can be reviewed and modified by the community. However, practical implementations can often diverge significantly from their theoretical counterpart. Leveraging the efforts of recent theoretical formulations and the features of Python, we try to mitigate these problems. We present eminus, an education- and development-friendly electronic structure package designed for convenient and customizable workflows, yet built with intelligible and modular implementations.</description>

      <title>A new calculation method using pathlines for delayed neutron precursors in liquid nuclear fuels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nuclear reactors, Delayed Neutron Precursors (DNPs) are important for reactor safety and operation. In liquid nuclear fuels, DNPs are transported by the flow, and an advection-reaction balance equation for their concentration must be solved in addition to the Neutron Balance Equation. This research paper applies the method of characteristics to solve the DNPs equation, using techniques previously developed in petroleum engineering and groundwater analysis. The calculation strategy incorporates a pathline generation algorithm covering all the mesh cells of the geometry for concentration calculations, and pathlines are reconstructed for both step and piecewise linear velocity fields. The analytical solutions are used on a Cartesian mesh to compute the DNPs concentrations assuming a step source of DNPs. The results obtained on the steady state phases of a benchmark problem illustrate this new method's capability to solve advection-dominated problems in liquid-fueled reactors. The method developed in this work is suited to smooth velocity fields (e.g., laminar or RANS flows) where pathlines can be tracked, and where DNP diffusivity is negligible.</description>

      <title>A Spectral-based Physics-informed Finite Operator Learning for Prediction of Mechanical Behavior of Microstructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel physics-informed operator learning technique based on spectral methods is introduced to model the complex behavior of heterogeneous materials. The Lippmann-Schwinger operator in Fourier space is employed to construct physical constraints with almost no additional overhead, eliminating the need for automatic differentiation. This methodology accelerates the training process by allowing gradient construction on a finite fixed discretization in Fourier space. Later, the spectral physics-informed finite operator learning (SPiFOL) framework is built based on this discretization and trained to map the arbitrary shape of microstructures to their mechanical responses (strain fields) without using any labeled data. The training is done by minimizing equilibrium in Fourier space concerning the macroscopic loading condition, which also guarantees the periodicity. The trained SPiFOL predicts full-field solutions for unseen cases accelerating the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) solvers by two orders of magnitude. The accuracy of the SPiFOL is investigated for a wide range of microstructures from dual-phase to multiphase materials and the homogenized stresses computed by SPiFOL show less than 1% error compared to results obtained by conventional FFT solvers. SPiFOL is further enhanced with a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to map microstructure to mechanical behavior using only physical equations in Fourier space. Compared to the standard data-driven FNO, SPiFOL shows higher accuracy in predicting stress fields and provides nearly resolution-independent results. Furthermore, the zero-shot-super-resolution feature in heterogeneous domains is investigated. Finally, the effectiveness of SPiFOL as a solver for individual microstructures is demonstrated, highlighting the reduction in solving time when utilizing GPUs.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Tomography of Photonic Qubits with Realistic Coherent Light Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is an essential technique for characterizing quantum states. However, practical implementations of QST are significantly challenged by factors such as shot noise, attenuation, and Raman scattering, especially when photonic qubits are transmitted through optical fibers alongside classical signals. In this paper, we present a numerical framework to simulate and evaluate the efficiency of QST under these realistic conditions. The results reveal how the efficiency of QST is influenced by the power of the classical signal. By analyzing the fidelity of reconstructed states, we provide insights into the limitations and potential improvements for QST in noisy environments.</description>

      <title>1D Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in thermal equilibrium via Non-Hermitian Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking generally circumvents one-dimensional systems with local interactions in thermal equilibrium. Here, we analyze a category of one-dimensional Hermitian models via local non-Hermitian constructions. Notably, spontaneous symmetry breaking and long-range order may emerge at finite temperatures in such systems under periodic boundary conditions, in sharp contrast to Hermitian constructions. We demonstrate clear numerical evidence, such as order parameters and specific heat, supporting phase diagrams with robust ordered phases. Non-Hermitian physics plays a vital role in prohibiting domain-wall proliferation and promoting spontaneous symmetry breaking. The fermions exhibit an exotic topological nature in their path-integral windings, which uphold nonzero integers -- commonly a non-Hermitian signature -- in the ordered phases, thus offering a novel and spontaneous origin for both symmetry breaking and non-Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>The advent of fully variational quantum eigensolvers using a hybrid multiresolution approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In electronic structure theory, variational computing offers a valuable paradigm for the approximation of electronic ground states. However, for historical reasons, this principle is mostly restricted to model-chemistries in pre-defined fixed basis sets. Especially in quantum computation, these model-chemistries are far from an accurate description of the initial electronic Hamiltonian. Throwing down the gauntlet, we here demonstrate a fully variational approach to the electronic structure problem by variationally optimizing the orbitals representing the second quantized Hamiltonian alongside a quantum circuit that generates the many-electron wavefunction. To this end, the orbitals are represented within an adaptive multi-wavelet format, guaranteeing numerical precision. We then showcase explicit numerical protocols and highlight the quantum circuit's effects on determining the optimal orbital basis.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free online learning of subgrid-scale dynamics with neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19385v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generic algorithm to train machine learning-based subgrid parametrizations online, i.e., with a posteriori loss functions, but for non-differentiable numerical solvers. The proposed approach leverages a neural emulator to approximate the reduced state-space solver, which is then used to allow gradient propagation through temporal integration steps. We apply this methodology on a single layer quasi-geostrophic system with topography, known to be highly unstable in around 500 temporal iterations with offline strategies. Using our algorithm, we are able to train a parametrization that recovers most of the benefits of online strategies without having to compute the gradient of the original solver. It is demonstrated that training the neural emulator and parametrization components separately with different loss quantities is necessary in order to minimize the propagation of approximation biases. Experiments on emulator architectures with different complexities also indicates that emulator performance is key in order to learn an accurate parametrization. This work is a step towards learning parametrization with online strategies for weather models.</description>

      <title>Everything everywhere all at once, a probability-based enhanced sampling approach to rare events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of studying rare events is central to many areas of computer simulations. In a recent paper [Kang, P., et al., Nat. Comput. Sci. 4, 451-460, 2024], we have shown that a powerful way of solving this problem passes through the computation of the committor function, and we have demonstrated how the committor can be iteratively computed in a variational way and the transition state ensemble efficiently sampled. Here, we greatly ameliorate this procedure by combining it with a metadynamics-like enhanced sampling approach in which a logarithmic function of the committor is used as a collective variable. This integrated procedure leads to an accurate and balanced sampling of the free energy surface in which transition states and metastable basins are studied with the same thoroughness. We also show that our approach can be used in cases in which competing reactive paths are possible and intermediate metastable are encountered. In addition, we demonstrate how physical insights can be obtained from the optimized committor model and the sampled data, thus providing a full characterization of the rare event under study. We ascribe the success of this approach to the use of a probability-based description of rare events.</description>

      <title>Perturbing scattering resonances in non-Hermitian systems: a generalized Wigner-Smith operator formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resonances of open non-Hermitian systems are associated with the poles of the system scattering matrix. Perturbations of the system cause these poles to shift in the complex frequency plane. In this work, we introduce a novel method for calculating shifts in scattering matrix poles using generalized Wigner-Smith operators. We link our method to traditional cavity perturbation theory and validate its effectiveness through application to complex photonic networks. Our findings underscore the versatility of generalized Wigner-Smith operators for analyzing a broad spectrum of resonant systems and provides new insight into resonant properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Based Generative Chemical Language AI Model for Structural Elucidation of Organic Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For over half a century, computer-aided structural elucidation systems (CASE) for organic compounds have relied on complex expert systems with explicitly programmed algorithms. These systems are often computationally inefficient for complex compounds due to the vast chemical structural space that must be explored and filtered. In this study, we present a proof-of-concept transformer based generative chemical language artificial intelligence (AI) model, an innovative end-to-end architecture designed to replace the logic and workflow of the classic CASE framework for ultra-fast and accurate spectroscopic-based structural elucidation. Our model employs an encoder-decoder architecture and self-attention mechanisms, similar to those in large language models, to directly generate the most probable chemical structures that match the input spectroscopic data. Trained on ~ 102k IR, UV, and 1H NMR spectra, it performs structural elucidation of molecules with up to 29 atoms in just a few seconds on a modern CPU, achieving a top-15 accuracy of 83%. This approach demonstrates the potential of transformer based generative AI to accelerate traditional scientific problem-solving processes. The model's ability to iterate quickly based on new data highlights its potential for rapid advancements in structural elucidation.</description>
