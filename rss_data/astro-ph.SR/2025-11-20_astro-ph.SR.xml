      <title>Delayed Wind Onset in Pa 30, the Remnant of Type Iax SN 1181</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pa 30 is the recently identified remnant of the historical supernova SN 1181, likely a Type Iax event, and a nebula surrounding the central white dwarf launching a fast wind ($\sim10^9~\cm~\s^{-1}$) is observed in optical and infrared bands. X-ray observations show that this wind collides with the surrounding material and produces a termination shock, and the observed extent of the shock indicates that the wind started blowing centuries after 1181 A.D. rather than immediately after the SN explosion. We propose that the wind is triggered by delayed ignition of fallback carbon-rich material on the WD surface and investigate the conditions that reproduce such delayed ignition. We show that producing delays of several centuries requires a relatively hot post-explosion WD core with a temperature $T_c \simeq 6\times10^8~\mathrm{K}$. This supports the pure-deflagration progenitor scenario for Type Iax SN 1181, which implies the presence of a He star companion inside Pa~30; we also discuss why such a potential He star has not been detected and its prospects for discovery by future observations.</description>

      <title>V570 Per: Characterization of a Benchmark Eclipsing Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the detached binary system V570\,Per through combined photometric, spectroscopic, and astrometric observations. By disentangling the composite spectra, precise fundamental parameters and detailed chemical abundances were determined for both stars. The primary component has a mass of $1.4569_{-0.0100}^{+0.0094}$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of $1.543_{-0.009}^{+0.012}$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $6556_{-26}^{+64}$ K, and a metallicity of $+0.18_{-0.01}^{+0.03}$ dex, while the secondary has a mass of $1.3579_{-0.0089}^{+0.0094}$ $M_{\odot}$, a radius of $1.377_{-0.015}^{+0.013}$ $R_{\odot}$, an effective temperature of $6468_{-21}^{+32}$ K, and a metallicity of $+0.15_{-0.01}^{+0.02}$ dex. The system is estimated to be $577_{-60}^{+60}$ Myr old with a synchronized orbit. The available O-C data imply a minimum mass of 0.57 $M_{\odot}$ or 0.11 $M_{\odot}$ for the third body, corresponding to eccentric and circular orbits, respectively. \texttt{MESA} evolutionary models indicate that the primary will fill its Roche lobe and begin mass transfer to the secondary in about 2.8 Gyr, whereas the secondary will reach the terminal-age main sequence in approximately 3.2 Gyr. The chemical composition of both stars shows remarkable consistency, confirming their common origin, except for calcium, which is significantly enhanced in the primary. Line measurements support this difference and are therefore interpreted as an intrinsic abundance variation rather than an artifact of the analysis. The overall solar-rich metallicity, combined with a relatively low $\alpha$-element content, links V570\,Per to the Galactic thin-disk population. In addition, Galactic orbit analyses of open clusters in the solar neighborhood have revealed that the V570\,Per system may have originated from the Melotte 25 open cluster.</description>

      <title>Proton specific entropy as a proxy for the $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ charge state ratio over heliocentric distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the fast solar wind has well-established origins in coronal holes, the source of the slow solar wind remains uncertain. Compositional metrics, such as heavy ion charge state ratios are set in the lower corona, providing insights into solar wind source regions. However, prior to the launch of Solar Orbiter, in situ measurements of heavy ion charge state were limited to distances of 1 AU and beyond. We investigate proton specific entropy as a proxy for the oxygen charge state ratio ($O^{7+}/O^{6+}$),which generally becomes frozen-in below ~1.8 Rsun, leveraging observations from Solar Orbiter's Heavy Ion Sensor and Proton and Alphas Sensor covering 0.28 to 1 AU. Our analysis confirms a strong anti-correlation between specific entropy and the oxygen charge state ratio that persists over a broad range of distances in the inner heliosphere. We categorize observed solar wind into fast solar wind, slow Alfvenic solar wind, and slow solar wind, identifying clear distinctions in specific entropy values and charge state ratios across these types. The work demonstrates the potential to use proton specific entropy as a classifier of solar wind source regions throughout the heliosphere. By establishing the $S_p$-$O^{7+}/O^{6+}$ relationship and quantifying its radial dependence, the specific entropy can be used as a quantity to identify the solar wind source region in the absence of in-situ charge state measurements. This motivates future studies as to the applicability of this proxy to near-Sun observations (such as Parker Solar Probe) and throughout the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Relative Strengths of Fundamental and Harmonic Emissions of Solar Radio Type II Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar radio type II bursts are slow-drifting bursts that exhibit various distinct features such as Fundamental (F) and Harmonic (H) emissions, band-splitting, and discrete fine structures in the dynamic spectra. Observationally, it has been found that in some cases the F emission is stronger than the H emission, and vice versa. The reason for such behavior has not been thoroughly investigated. To investigate this, we studied 58 meter wave (20-500 MHz) type II solar radio bursts showing both F and H emissions, observed during the period from 13 June 2010 to 25 December 2024, using data obtained with the Compound Astronomical Low frequency Low cost Instrument for Spectroscopy and Transportable Observatory (CALLISTO) spectrometers at different locations and Gauribidanur LOw-frequency Solar Spectrograph (GLOSS). We examined the intensity ratios of the H ($I_H$) and F ($I_F$) emissions and analyzed their variation with heliographic longitude. We found that 14 out of 19 bursts originating from heliographic longitudes beyond $\pm75^\circ$ exhibited an $I_H/I_F$ ratio greater than unity. In contrast, 32 out of 39 bursts originating from longitudes within $\pm75^\circ$ showed a intensity ratio less than unity. From these results, we conclude that the relative strength of the F and H emissions can be influenced by refraction due to density gradient in the solar corona, directivity and viewing angle of the bursts.</description>

      <title>PHR~J1724-3859: A Bipolar Planetary Nebula in Open Cluster Trumpler 25</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) studies are essential for understanding late stellar evolution of low-to-intermediate mass stars. PNe in open clusters (OC) are rare but valuable since their study directly links their properties to those of their progenitors, something that cannot be achieved for field PNe. Here, we report the identification of one more OC-PN association to add to the small sample of, now, five pairs. The physical properties of the host cluster, PN and its central star (CSPN) have been explored using high and intermediate-resolution spectral and deep photometric data. The close agreement of the radial velocities of the PN and host cluster, together with concordance of reddening and distance, show that the PN PHR~J1724-3859 is highly likely to be physically associated with the OC Trumpler~25. Deep photometric data allowed clear identification of the CSPN. We find a CSPN effective temperature of around 250 kK and a nebular kinematic age of 23 kyrs, both at the extreme end, like the other members of this small class. The progenitor and final CSPN masses have been estimated to be 5.12$_{-0.15}^{+0.16}$ $M_\odot$ and 0.95$\pm$0.12 $M_\odot$ respectively. These latest results agree with the emerging trend for our other OC-PNe, falling below, but approximately parallel to, the latest initial-to-final-mass relation estimates derived from cluster white dwarfs and has important implications for stellar evolution models. All OC-PNe also possess some other common properties (e.g. all are Type-I PNe and bipolars) to be explored in future studies.</description>

      <title>Interacting binaries on the Main Sequence as in-situ tracers of mass transfer efficiency and stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the transfer of mass and angular momentum in binary interactions is crucial for modelling the evolution of any interacting binary after the first mass transfer phase. We constrain the efficiency and stability of thermal timescale mass transfer in massive binary evolution using the observed population of massive interacting binaries on the Main Sequence (`Algols') in the Milky Way, Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Assuming the present-day mass of the donor star represents its initial convective core mass at Zero-Age Main Sequence, we estimate its initial mass using detailed stellar evolution models. From the initial donor mass, we calculate the range of initial accretor masses (for different mass transfer efficiencies). By imposing physical constraints on the above initial parameter ranges, we derive the mass transfer efficiency, stability and angular momentum loss that can reproduce the current properties of each Algol binary. We find that purely conservative or non-conservative mass transfer cannot explain the current mass ratio and orbital period of all massive Algols. Angular momentum conservation rules out conservative mass transfer in $\sim$28\,\% of massive Algols in the SMC. About three-quarters of all massive Algols are consistent with having undergone inefficient mass transfer ($\lesssim$\,50\,\%), while the remaining systems, mostly residing in the LMC and Milky Way, require mass transfer to have been more efficient than 25\%. The current sample of massive Algols does not require mass transfer to be efficient at the shortest orbital periods (2\,d) at any metallicity. We find evidence that mass transfer on the Main Sequence needs to be stable for initial accretor-to-donor mass ratios as unequal as $\sim 0.6$. The massive Algols in the SMC seem to have undergone less efficient mass transfer than those in the LMC and Milky Way. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Type Iax supernovae as a source of iron-rich silicate dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the formation of dust in the ejecta of Type Iax supernovae (SNe), which is a low-luminosity subclass of Type Ia SNe. A non-equilibrium chemical kinetic approach is adopted to trace the synthesis of molecules, molecular clusters, and dust grains in the ejecta of thermonuclear SNe. We find that Type Iax SNe provide conditions conducive to the formation of several O-rich dust species in the ejecta. Particularly, iron-rich silicates of chemical type FeSiO3, Fe2SiO4, and MgFeSiO4 are found to form in abundance, suggesting that the ejecta of low-luminosity thermonuclear SNe can be a site where a large fraction of iron is locked up in dust, unlike other stellar sources. The final mass of dust formed in the ejecta ranges between 10^{-5} and 10^{-4} Msun, where most of the dust forms between 1000 and 2000 days post-explosion. Apart from Fe-rich silicates, Mg-silicates, and silicon carbide are also formed in the ejecta of Type Iax SNe. When compared to the dust budget of typical Type Ia SNe, we find that the expected dust-to-ejecta mass ratio is one or two orders of magnitude larger in Type Iax SNe. We conclude that the ejecta of typical Type Ia SNe form a negligible amount of dust, in agreement with observation, while the low-luminosity subclass Type Iax SNe are potential producers of iron-rich silicates.</description>

      <title>Identification of periodic density structures in Solar Orbiter data: Radial evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-Periodic density structures (PDSs) are quasiperiodic variations of solar wind density ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. They are trains of advected density structures with radial length scales LR in the 100-10,000 Mm range, thus belonging to the class of solar wind mesoscale structures. Even though PDS at L1 have been extensively studied both through statistical and event analysis, their investigation at distances closer to the Sun is limited. This study performs a statistical investigation of PDS at various distances from the Sun between 0.3 and 1 AU by exploiting Solar Orbiter data. We compiled and made publicly available an extensive list of PDSs following a well-established methodology that combines the Multitaper method as well as wavelet analysis to reveal the distribution of PDS radial length scales and how they vary with respect to the radial distance. Our results indicate that PDS advected with the ambient slow solar wind are expanded at a rate of approximately 10%, while PDS detected during fast solar wind segments show compression at a similar rate. These are consistent with the scenario in which PDSs are formed at the Sun by processes involving magnetic reconnection and interchange reconnection in the solar corona.</description>

      <title>Using Light Curve Derivatives to Estimate the Fill-out Factor of Overcontact Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple method for estimating the fill-out factor of overcontact binary systems using the derivatives of light curves. We synthesized 74,431 sample light curves, covering the typical parameter space of overcontact binaries. On the basis of a recent study that proposed a new classification scheme using light curve derivatives up to the fourth order, the sample light curves were classified. Among the classified types, for systems exhibiting high mass ratios and high inclinations (i.e., SPf type), we found that the fill-out factor has a strong correlation with the time interval between two local extrema in the third derivatives of their light curves. An empirical formula to estimate the fill-out factor was derived using regression analysis for the identified correlation. Application to real overcontact binary data demonstrated that the proposed method is practical for obtaining reliable estimates of the fill-out factor and its associated uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Quadruple system HD 135160 in a unique 2+2 configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysing a large body of observational data, we found that HD 135160 is a quadruple 2+2 system, composed of a massive ellipsoidal binary ('heartbeat' star) with components Aa and Ab in an eccentric 8.234 d orbit and an eclipsing binary (with components Ba and Bb), with a 5.853 d period and partial eclipses that have already been reported from the space photometry secured by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Our systematic echelle spectroscopy, secured since September 2021, led to the discovery that the optical spectra are dominated by spectral lines of three early-type stars, two moving around each other on a 8.234 d orbit of a high eccentricity, which causes periodic brightenings near the periastron passage, and the third one (component Ba) being the brighter component of the 5.853 d binary. Both pairs are physically bounded and revolve around each other with a period somewhere between 1600 and 2200 days (4.4 to 6 years). The object exhibits small cyclic light variations of a variable amplitude and characteristic time scale of 0.071 d (14.14 c d-1), seen throughout the whole orbit. The nature of these tiny changes deserves further investigation. It also seems that the earlier classification of the object as a Be star is unfounded.</description>

      <title>The JWST weather report from the nearest brown dwarfs III: Heterogeneous clouds and Thermochemical instabilities as possible drivers of WISE 1049AB's spectroscopic variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analysis of the spectroscopic variability of WISE~J104915.57$-$531906.1AB (WISE~1049AB, L7.5+T0.5), observed using the NIRSpec instrument onboard the James Webb Space Telescope (GO 2965 - PI: Biller). We explored the variability of the dominant molecular bands present in their 0.6--5.3~$\mu$m spectra (H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO), finding that the B component exhibits a higher maximum deviation than the A component in all the wavelength ranges tested. The light curves reveal wavelength-(atmospheric depth) and possibly chemistry-dependent variability. In particular, for the A component, the variability in the light curves at the wavelengths traced by the CH$_4$ and CO molecular absorption features is higher than that of H$_2$O, even when both trace similar pressure levels. We concluded that clouds alone are unlikely to explain the increased variability of CO and CH$_4$ with respect to H$_2$O, suggesting that an additional physical mechanism is needed to explain the observed variability. This mechanism is probably due to thermochemical instabilities. Finally, we provide a visual representation of the 3D atmospheric map reconstructed for both components using the molecular band contributions at different pressure levels and the fit of planetary-scale waves.</description>

      <title>On the Theory of Bulk Viscosity of Cold Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the kinetic equation for ionization-recombination processes in cold plasmas for temperatures much lower than the first ionization potentials, we derive an explicit expression for the bulk viscosity. We obtain that bulk viscosity can be many order of magnitude bigger than the shear viscosity. Our result for the relaxation time reveals that the Mandelstam-Leontovich approximation for the frequency dependence of the bulk viscosity is in practice an exact result for the cold plasmas. The illustrative numerical examples correspond to the plasma cocktail of the solar chromosphere at the height of the minimal polytropic index. The possible application for the acoustic heating of the inner solar atmosphere up to the transition region is shortly discussed together with the evaluation to confirm the theory by laboratory plasmas.</description>

      <title>The significance of Halley's Comet in the Bayeux Tapestry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comet appears in the Bayeux Tapestry between the scene showing the death of the English king Edward the Confessor and the election of his successor, Harold Godwinson. The Tapestry's inscription only refers to this as a star, though we can see from its depiction, shown with a hairy tail, that it is a comet, now known to us as Halleys Comet P1/Halley. Behind the exciting story of the Bayeux Tapestry, however, goes a rich mythological world of intrigue, deceit, the succession of kings, and earlier sightings of the same comet. In historical accounts of many cultures, comets are generally considered portents of change rather than disaster. Here we consider the significance of the Tapestry's comet in the context of the so-called English succession crisis of 1066 with reference to other contemporary accounts of comets. We conclude that although the tapestry's illustration is suggestive and unmistakably Halleys Comet, it is not a priority for its creators to give a precise account of its arrival in the sky, but rather connect it, likely for political reasons, albeit retrospectively, to the sequential events of Edwards death and Harolds coronation. In that, the tapestry's anonymous artists provide a unique telling of its arrival.</description>

      <title>Solar Periodic Companion and Random Stellar Flybys: Dynamical Perturbations of Highly Eccentric Comets in the Oort Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia space telescope has transformed our understanding of random stellar encounters with the Solar System. This study examines how such perturbations influence the most eccentric comets in the Oort Cloud (OC), a thermalized reservoir of $\sim 10^{12}$ icy bodies extending from $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ AU. Recent Gaia-based analyses indicate about 20 stellar passages within 1 pc of the Sun per Myr. Using analytical estimates and direct $N$-body simulations, we quantify how these encounters modify highly eccentric orbits: individual flybys enhance comet-shower rates by factors of about 2, producing a cumulative increase of roughly 40 over a Myr. In parallel, we perform a full dynamical search through all stars with six-dimensional phase-space data in Gaia DR3 and identify a compelling candidate for a long-period stellar companion to the Sun. This star exhibits recurrent $\sim 45$ Myr perihelion passages and, in simulations, can elevate comet-shower activity by an order of magnitude. Because a perturber of this kind could also be a dispersed solar sibling, the companion hypothesis links the dynamical structure of the OC directly to the long-standing problem of identifying the Sun's birth-cluster relatives. The chemical-abundance pattern of such a star therefore becomes a critical observational test. Together, these results clarify how both stochastic encounters and potential long-period companions shape the dynamical evolution and observable output of the outermost OC, while highlighting the possibility that the OC retains a dynamical memory of the Sun's earliest stellar environment.</description>

      <title>The Rotation Dip in the Envelope-Disk Transition of HH 111: Evidence for Magnetic Braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic braking can drive angular momentum loss in star formation and influence disk evolution. A previous study of HH 111 VLA1 suggested a decrease in rotation velocity in a region between the infalling envelope and rotating disk. Using ALMA C$^{18}$O ($J = 2-1$) data, we analyzed the gas motion within 6000 au and found clear deviations from the simplest expectations of free-fall towards the central star with conserved angular momentum in the transition region between the envelope and disk (from $\sim$5200 to 160 au). The region can be further divided into three zones: (1) outer region with a significant decrease in infall velocity, dropping to approximately 60\% of the free-fall velocity and 70\% of conservation of angular momentum and energy; (2) middle region with a sharp drop in angular momentum and thus rotation velocity and an increase in infall velocity; and (3) inner region with rotation velocity increasing inward to connect to that of the Keplerian disk and infall velocity decreasing to zero. Comparison with non-ideal MHD simulations suggests that the reduced infall velocity in the outer region can be due to magnetic tension by the pinched magnetic field lines, the sharp drop of angular momentum in the middle region can be due to magnetic braking as the field lines pile up, and the rapid increase in rotation velocity in the inner region might result from weaker magnetic braking due to ambipolar diffusion of the field lines. The resulting dip in the rotation profile supports magnetic braking.</description>

      <title>Wavelengths and Energy Levels of Neutral Manganese (Mn I) Determined Using High-Resolution Fourier Transform and Grating Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extensive analysis of the spectrum of neutral manganese has been performed using spectra of manganese-neon and manganese-argon hollow cathode discharges measured using high resolution Fourier transform (FT) and grating spectroscopy over the range 151 - 5112 nm (1956 - 65876 cm-1). Wavelengths for 10426 spectral lines were extracted from the FT spectra, with uncertainties at least an order-of-magnitude lower than previous measurements. Wavelengths for 13397 lines from new grating spectra were determined for spectral regions beyond the FT spectra range or to provide wavelengths for weak transitions not observed in FT spectra. To aid in level identification, selected, previously published grating lines were included in the energy level optimisation, but no levels in this work relied solely on previously published wavelengths. In total, 24237 lines were included in the final spectral linelist, and these were used to identify 2186 Mn I transitions. These classified spectral lines were then used to optimise the values of 384 previously published energy levels of Mn I, with typical uncertainties of a few 10-3 cm-1, again typically an order-of-magnitude improvement in accuracy. Our study then expanded the known energy level structure of Mn I through the establishment of 18 new energy levels, reported here for the first time. In total, 2187 lines and 402 energy levels of Mn I have been determined as a result of our work, marking a substantial advance in the precision of Mn I atomic data which will enable far more accurate analyses of Mn I lines in astrophysical spectra.
  Please note: The final wavelength and energy level datasets are withheld from this pre-print to ensure that only the peer-reviewed, definitive versions are released. This approach prevents the propagation of duplicate or inconsistent data across widely used atomic databases and modelling frameworks.</description>

      <title>Turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath: space-time correlation using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal correlation of magnetic field fluctuations is investigated using the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission in the terrestrial magnetosheath. The first observation of the turbulence propagator in space emerges through analysis of more than a thousand intervals. Results show clear features of spatial and spectral anisotropy, leading to a distinct behavior of relaxation times in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field. Full space-time investigation of the Taylor hypothesis reveals a scale-dependent anisotropy of magnetosheath fluctuations that can be compared to the effect of flow propagation on spacecraft frame time decorrelation rates as well as with Eulerian estimates. The turbulence propagator reveals that the amplitudes of the perpendicular modes decorrelate according to sweeping or Alfv\'enic propagation mechanisms. The decorrelation time of parallel modes instead does not depend on the parallel wavenumber, which could be due to resonant interactions. Through direct observation, this study provides unprecedented insight into the space-time structure of turbulent space plasmas, while giving critical constraints for theoretical and numerical models.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Drag Torque in Common Envelope Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Common envelope (CE) evolution is largely governed by the drag torque applied on the in-spiralling stellar components by the envelope. Previous work has shown that idealized models of the torque based on a single body moving in rectilinear motion through an unperturbed atmosphere can be highly inaccurate. Progress requires new models for the torque that account for binarity. Toward this end we perform a new 3D global hydrodynamic CE simulation with the mass of the companion point particle set equal to the mass of the asymptotic giant branch star core particle to maximize symmetry and facilitate interpretation. First, we find that a region around the particles of a scale comparable to their separation contributes essentially all of the torque. Second, the density pattern of the torque-dominating gas and, to an extent, this gas itself, is roughly in corotation with the binary. Third, approximating the spatial distribution of the torquing gas as a uniform-density prolate spheroid whose major axis resides in the orbital plane and lags the line joining the binary components by a constant phase angle reproduces the torque evolution remarkably well, analogous to studies of binary supermassive black holes. Fourth, we compare the torque measured in the simulation with the predictions of a model that assumes two weak point-mass perturbers undergoing circular motion in a uniform background without gas self-gravity, and find remarkable agreement with our results if the background density is taken to be equal to a fixed fraction (~0.44) of the density at the spheroid surface. Overall, this work makes progress toward developing simple time-dependent models of the CE phase, for example by informing the development of drag force prescriptions for 1D spherically symmetric CE simulations, which could be used to explore the parameter space of luminous red novae or in binary population synthesis studies.</description>

      <title>Dance to Demise -- How Massive Stars May Form Dense Circumstellar Shells Before Explosion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of red supergiant (RSG) progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) with initial masses between $12$ and $20~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, focusing on effects of enhanced mass loss due to pulsation-driven instabilities in their envelopes and subsequent dynamical ejections during advanced stages of nuclear burning. Using time-dependent mass loss rates from detailed Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) stellar evolution models, including prescriptions for both pulsation-driven superwinds and shock-induced ejections, we construct the circumstellar medium (CSM) before the SN explosion. We calculate resulting CSM density profiles and column densities considering the radiation-driven acceleration of the stellar wind. Our models produce episodes of enhanced mass loss $\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-2}~ \mathrm{M}_{\odot}~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ in the last centuries-decades before explosion forming dense CSM ($\gtrsim10^{-15}~\mathrm{g~cm}^{-3}$ at distances $\lesssim10^{15}~\mathrm{cm}$) - consistent with multi-wavelength observations of Type II SNe such as SN 2023ixf, SN 2020ywx, SN 2017hcc, SN 2005ip and SN 1998S. The formation of such dense CS shells, as predicted by our single star RSG models, provides a natural explanation for observed flash-ionization signatures, X-ray and radio emission, and has important implications for dust formation around Type II SNe.</description>

      <title>An extremely fast fading population II dwarf nova candidate: caught spectroscopically on the rise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AT2022kak, a rapidly evolving optical transient discovered by the KiloNova and Transients Program (KNTraP). This interesting burst exhibited extremely fast evolution, with a large amplitude blue outburst of m &gt; 3.3 in a single night, and a rapid fade back to quiescence in the following two nights. We deployed a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign, monitoring the object for the next two months, but saw no recurrent burst. Three years later, while observing to get spectroscopy of the object in quiescence, there was a new outburst, enabling the collection of time-resolved spectra of the rise and fade of the outburst. The light curve properties of the first burst and spectra of the second burst are consistent with a dwarf nova. Its fast evolving behaviour makes it one of the fastest and faintest dwarf novae observed. The estimated distance of AT2022kak from the Galactic centre is ~6.6 kpc, with a scale height of ~2 kpc. This scale height places it in the Galactic thick disk, where only very few dwarf novae have been found, and is therefore a potential Population II dwarf novae system.</description>

      <title>Occurrence rate of stellar Type II radio bursts from a 100 star-year search for coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather in the Solar System, but their occurrence rate on other stars is unknown. A characteristic (deca-)metric radio burst with a time-frequency drift, known as a Type II radio burst, is a key observational signature of CMEs. We searched a total of 107 years of stellar data using time-frequency spectra that targeted all known stars within 100 parsecs in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) up to May 2023. This resulted in the largest unbiased search for circularly polarised stellar Type II metric radio bursts to date, with a typical 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of 2.5 mJy for an integration time of 1 minute. We detected two drifting stellar radio bursts: the published 2-minute burst from the M dwarf StKM 1-1262 and a new 13-minute burst from the M dwarf LP 215-56. The new burst is characterised by a drift rate of $-0.060^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ MHz s$^{-1}$, an average Stokes V flux density of $-4.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ mJy, and a temporal duration of $63^{+31}_{-11}$ seconds. We constrained the occurrence rate of drifting stellar bursts by calculating Poisson upper and lower limits based on the two drifting bursts. We also fitted a cumulative burst luminosity distribution to the data using the burst detections and the non-detections; this yielded a power law index ($\alpha$) of $-0.7^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ and a normalisation point (N) of one burst per year with $E&gt;6.8\times10^{13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. We find an agreement between this and the cumulative luminosity distribution of decametric SOHO/LASCO solar Type II data ($\alpha = -0.81 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.02$), which suggests that the current scarcity of detected stellar Type II bursts is likely due to limited sensitivity rather than to the intrinsic rarity of these events. Additionally, we identify 19 circularly polarised stellar radio bursts without a time-frequency drift.</description>

      <title>Stellar Flares in the TESS Light Curves of Planet-hosting M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: M dwarfs are magnetically active stars that frequently produce flares, which have implications for both stellar evolution and exoplanet studies. Flare occurrence rates and activity levels of M dwarfs correlate with stellar characteristics such as age, mass, and rotation period. We search TESS observations of a known active population of M dwarfs as well as a volume-limited sample of M dwarfs within 15 parsecs. We detect flares in the light curves of these stars, including 276 of 538 M dwarfs within 15 pc, and calculate cumulative flare frequency distributions (FFDs) for each star. Based on flaring behavior, we categorize stars into relatively higher and lower activity groups and fit power laws to their FFDs to compare the power law exponent ($\alpha$) across activity levels. We find $\alpha =1.99 \pm 0.07$ for the combined FFD of the lower activity M dwarfs, compared to averages of $\alpha = 1.94 \pm 0.58$ for highly active stars with 10-100 detected flares, and $\alpha = 2.03 \pm 0.43$ for those with &gt; 100 detected flares, suggesting little evolution in the power law distribution of flares as M dwarfs transition from high to low activity states. The uncertainties for the active star groups reflect the standard deviation of $\alpha$ values across individual stars within each subset. Because stellar flares and associated stellar activity complicate exoplanet observations, we also examine the subset of M dwarfs with JWST transmission spectroscopy follow-up observations in Cycles 1-3. The flares we detect for these targets are consistent with the broader 15 pc sample, providing context for interpreting planetary atmosphere retrievals from JWST spectra.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismic Imprints of Mass Transfer in Binary Stars: Probing the Interiors of Donors and Accretors with Gravity and Acoustic Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The synergy between close binary stars and asteroseismology enables constraints on mass-transfer episodes and their consequences for internal structure, rotation profiles, and oscillation modes.
  Aims. We investigate how mass accretion and donation in close binaries affects the internal structure and oscillation modes of main-sequence stars.
  Methods. Building on the established relation between the Brunt-Vaisala (buoyancy) glitch and the Fourier spectra of g-mode period spacings, we quantitatively explain the origins of the g-mode period-spacing differences between single-star and mass-accretion/donation models of intermediate-mass stars (M = 2.0, 3.0, and 4.5 Msun). In particular, the hydrogen mass fraction profiles X of the donor model show two chemical gradient regions, which results in a double-peaked Brunt-Vaisala profile. The presence of additional buoyancy glitches gives rise to further periodic modulations in the g-mode period spacings.
  Results. Mass-accretion induced changes in the chemical profile create sharp features in the buoyancy frequency, which modify both the amplitudes and frequencies of the g-mode period-spacing variations. This behavior resembles that produced by multiple chemical transition zones in compact pulsators such as white dwarfs and sub-dwarf B stars. Similarly, for acoustic modes in the M = 1 Msun solar-like models, we attribute the differences in frequency-separation ratios between single-star and mass-donor models to the variations in the internal sound-speed gradient (acoustic glitches). We discuss future prospects for using asteroseismology to discover the mass-transfer products and constrain the mass-transfer processes in binary star evolution.</description>

      <title>Formation of neutron stars inside planetary nebulae via accretion-induced collapse and core-merger-induced collapse from white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of neutron stars (NSs) within planetary nebulae (PNe) has not been previously even mentioned in the literature. In this paper, I propose two possible formation channels for NSs inside PNe. First, using simulations performed with the MESA stellar evolution code, I present a scenario in which NSs form via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of oxygen-neon-magnesium (ONeMg) white dwarfs (WDs) inside PNe--referred to here as symbiotic nebulae. In the late evolutionary stages of ONeMg WD-red giant (or asymptotic giant branch) star binaries, substantial mass loss can occur through strong stellar winds or/and Roche-lobe overflow, potentially leading to the formation of nebulae surrounding central accreting WD binaries. These nebulae may be ionized by the hot cores of the giant stars or by the accreting WDs themselves. Under such conditions, the accreting WD may grow in mass to the Chandrasekhar limit and undergo collapse into a neutron star. NSs formed via this AIC channel are likely to retain WD companions, resulting in NS-WD binary systems, of which the Milky Way may host dozens. Second, through binary population synthesis modeling, I introduce another evolutionary pathway: the core-merger-induced collapse occurring during the common envelope evolution of ONeMg WD binaries. This process may result in the formation of a newborn NS within a PN-or, in some cases, a pulsar wind nebula.</description>

      <title>Understanding large-scale dynamos in unstratified rotating shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

      <title>Analytical Transit Light Curves for Arbitrary Power-Law Limb Darkening: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18860v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first exact analytical solutions for exoplanet transit light curves under arbitrary real power-law limb darkening, $I(\mu) = I_0\mu^\alpha$ with $\alpha &gt; -2$, removing the two-decade restriction to integer-polynomial forms. This generalization addresses a fundamental barrier: physically motivated stellar atmosphere models require non-integer exponents -- most critically the square-root law ($\alpha=1/2$) essential for M-dwarf characterization and half-integer powers in Claret's four-parameter law -- yet existing frameworks support only integer powers, forcing reliance on numerical integration or polynomial approximations that introduce systematic errors at the $\sim 10^{-3}$ level. We develop three mathematically equivalent formulations: (1) a geometric kernel representation expressing blocked flux as a one-dimensional radial integral; (2) a fractional-calculus framework yielding exact hypergeometric solutions via Riemann-Liouville operators; and (3) a numerically stable hypergeometric-integrand form with guaranteed convergence. All three reproduce established elliptic-integral expressions for integer $\alpha$, confirming our framework as a true generalization. For central transits, we obtain the exact closed form $\mathcal{F} = (1-p^2)^{1+\alpha/2}$. Linear superposition enables exact treatment of multi-parameter laws without special-case logic. Validation using 45-digit precision arithmetic demonstrates inter-method agreement at $|\Delta\mathcal{F}| \lesssim 10^{-13}$ across all geometric regions, including transcendental exponents ($\pi/2$, $\sqrt{2}$, $e-2$). Compared with Monte Carlo integration, our method achieves nine orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy with $\sim 10^4\times$ computational speedup, enabling efficient Bayesian inference for JWST, TESS, and next-generation facilities.</description>

      <title>JWST's PEARLS: A Candidate Massive Binary Star System in a Lensed Galaxy at Redshift 0.94</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive stars at cosmological distances can be individually detected during transient microlensing events, when gravitational lensing magnifications may exceed ~1000. Nine such sources were identified in JWST NIRCam imaging of a single galaxy at redshift z=0.94 known as the "Warhol arc,'' which is mirror-imaged by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0416.1-2403. Here we present the discovery of two coincident and well-characterized microlensing events at the same location followed by a third event observed in a single filter approximately 18 months later. The events can be explained by microlensing of a binary star system consisting of a red supergiant (T ~ 4000 K) and a B-type (T ~ 13,000 K) companion star. The timescale of the coincident microlensing events constrains the estimated projected source-plane size to tens of AU. The most likely binary configurations consistent with the observational constraints on the temperature and luminosity of each star are stars with initial masses M1=23.6+5.3-4.3 Msol and an initial mass ratio between the two stars close to unity. A kinematic model that reproduces the observed light curve in all filters gives a relatively small transverse velocity of 50 km/s. This requires the dominant velocity component of several hundreds of km/s to be roughly parallel to the microcaustic. An alternative possibility would be that the three microlensing events correspond to unrelated stars crossing distinct microcaustics, but this would imply a highly elevated rate of events at their common position, even though no underlying knot is present at the location.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Recoil and Suppression of Super Massive Black Hole Seeds in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of gravitational-wave (GW) recoil on the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the early Universe. Forming 10^9 Solar Mass SMBHs by z=6 is challenging and may require hierarchical mergers of smaller seed black holes. We extend a semi-analytic seed model by explicitly incorporating GW recoil physics. Our model includes: (1) recoil velocity formulae calibrated to numerical relativity for spinning, unequal-mass BH binaries (Campanelli2007,Lousto2012); (2) assignment of spin magnitudes and orientations based on seed type (Population III remnant, stellar cluster, or direct-collapse); and (3) a retention probability scheme comparing the recoil speed to the host halo escape velocity. We find that including GW recoil reduces final SMBH masses by approximately 20-30% by z=6 and creates a population of off-nuclear (``wandering'') BHs amounting to a few percent of the total. Observable consequences include spatial offsets approximately 0.1'' and line-of-sight velocity shifts approximately 10^2-10^3 km\s in a few-percent of high-redshift quasars.

      <title>Kinematics of Stellar Streams from Globular Clusters Depend on Black Hole Retention and Star Mass: A Selection Effect for Dark Matter Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) in stellar streams from globular clusters (GCs) is sensitive to heating by Galactic substructure, including dark matter (DM) subhalos. Recent studies have compared $\sigma$ in observed and modeled streams to probe DM properties, but have relied on stream models that neglect strong encounters, black holes (BHs), and mass segregation in GCs. Such phenomena may inflate stream $\sigma$ or introduce selection effects -- e.g., a $\sigma$ that depends on star mass ($m$). We investigate this prospect using Monte Carlo $N$-body simulations of GCs under static Galactic tides to generate mock streams with realistic mass and velocity distributions. We find $\sigma$ correlates with $m$, especially after core collapse (the GC's observable increase in central density upon ejecting its BHs), rising from $1.2$--$2.2\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ between $m=0.3$--$0.8\,M_\odot$, with typical kinematic cuts on stream membership. Similar in magnitude to heating by Galactic substructure, this enhancement occurs because the GC's loss of BHs allows its most-massive stars to occupy its dense center, raising their likelihood of strong ejection via binary interactions and adding broad, exponential wings to the stream's velocity distribution. Streams' kinematics thus probe properties (density, BH retention) of their progenitor GCs. Our results also imply observations of streams from some GCs, especially those not subject to highly episodic mass loss, may select for higher $\sigma$ than predicted by models neglecting $\sigma$'s $m$-dependence. This would cause observed $\sigma$ in streams -- already on the low side of expectations for cold DM -- to further favor alternatives such as warm or ultralight DM.</description>
