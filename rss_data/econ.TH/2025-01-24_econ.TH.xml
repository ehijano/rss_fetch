      <title>Cautious Dual-Self Expected Utility and Weak Uncertainty Aversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty aversion introduced by Gilboa and Schmeidler (1989) has played a central role in decision theory, but at the same time, many incompatible behaviors have been observed in the real world. In this paper, we consider an axiom that postulates only a minimal degree of uncertainty aversion, and examine its implications in the preferences with the basic structure, called the invariant biseparable preferences. We provide three representation theorems for these preferences. Our main result shows that a decision maker with such a preference evaluates each act by considering two "dual" scenarios and then adopting the worse one as its evaluation in a cautious manner. The other two representations share a structure similar to the main result, which clarifies the key implication of weak uncertainty aversion. Furthermore, we offer another foundation for the main representation in the objective/subjective rationality model and characterizations of extensions of the main representation.</description>

      <title>A Non-Parametric Approach to Heterogeneity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a network-based method to capture unobserved heterogeneity in consumer microdata. We develop a permutation-based approach that repeatedly samples subsets of choices from each agent and partitions agents into jointly rational types. Aggregating these partitions yields a network that characterizes the unobserved heterogeneity, as edges denote the fraction of times two agents belong to the same type across samples. To evaluate how observable characteristics align with the heterogeneity, we implement permutation tests that shuffle covariate labels across network nodes, thereby generating a null distribution of alignment. We further introduce various network-based measures of alignment that assess whether nodes sharing the same observable values are disproportionately linked or clustered, and introduce standardized effect sizes that measure how strongly each covariate "tilts" the entire network away from random assignment. These non-parametric effect sizes capture the global influence of observables on the heterogeneity structure. We apply the method to grocery expenditure data from the Stanford Basket Dataset.</description>

      <title>Comparative Withholding Behavior Analysis of Historical Energy Storage Bids in California</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of battery energy storage in wholesale electricity markets calls for a deeper understanding of storage operators' bidding strategies and their market impacts. This study examines energy storage bidding data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) between July 1, 2023, and October 1, 2024, with a primary focus on economic withholding strategies. Our analysis reveals that storage bids are closely aligned with day-ahead and real-time market clearing prices, with notable bid inflation during price spikes. Statistical tests demonstrate a strong correlation between price spikes and capacity withholding, indicating that operators can anticipate price surges and use market volatility to increase profitability. Comparisons with optimal hindsight bids further reveal a clear daily periodic bidding pattern, highlighting extensive economic withholding. These results underscore potential market inefficiencies and highlight the need for refined regulatory measures to address economic withholding as storage capacity in the market continues to grow.</description>

      <title>Markovian Search with Socially Aware Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a general class of sequential search problems for selecting multiple candidates from different societal groups under "ex-ante constraints" aimed at producing socially desirable outcomes, such as demographic parity, diversity quotas, or subsidies for disadvantaged groups. Starting with the canonical Pandora's box model [Weitzman, 1978] under a single affine constraint on selection and inspection probabilities, we show that the optimal constrained policy retains an index-based structure similar to the unconstrained case, but may randomize between two dual-based adjustments that are both easy to compute and economically interpretable. We then extend our results to handle multiple affine constraints by reducing the problem to a variant of the exact Carath\'eodory problem and providing a novel polynomial-time algorithm to generate an optimal randomized dual-adjusted index-based policy that satisfies all constraints simultaneously. Building on these insights, we consider richer search processes (e.g., search with rejection and multistage search) modeled by joint Markov scheduling (JMS) [Dumitriu et al., 2003; Gittins, 1979]. By imposing general affine and convex ex-ante constraints, we develop a primal-dual algorithm that randomizes over a polynomial number of dual-based adjustments to the unconstrained JMS Gittins indices, yielding a near-feasible, near-optimal policy. Our approach relies on the key observation that a suitable relaxation of the Lagrange dual function for these constrained problems admits index-based policies akin to those in the unconstrained setting. Using a numerical study, we investigate the implications of imposing various constraints, in particular the utilitarian loss (price of fairness), and whether these constraints induce their intended societally desirable outcomes.</description>

      <title>Equilibria in Repeated Games under No-Regret with Dynamic Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In repeated games, strategies are often evaluated by their ability to guarantee the performance of the single best action that is selected in hindsight, a property referred to as \emph{Hannan consistency}, or \emph{no-regret}. However, the effectiveness of the single best action as a yardstick to evaluate strategies is limited, as any static action may perform poorly in common dynamic settings. Our work therefore turns to a more ambitious notion of \emph{dynamic benchmark consistency}, which guarantees the performance of the best \emph{dynamic} sequence of actions, selected in hindsight subject to a constraint on the allowable number of action changes. Our main result establishes that for any joint empirical distribution of play that may arise when all players deploy no-regret strategies, there exist dynamic benchmark consistent strategies such that if all players deploy these strategies the same empirical distribution emerges when the horizon is large enough. This result demonstrates that although dynamic benchmark consistent strategies have a different algorithmic structure and provide significantly enhanced individual assurances, they lead to the same equilibrium set as no-regret strategies. Moreover, the proof of our main result uncovers the capacity of independent algorithms with strong individual guarantees to foster a strong form of coordination.</description>
