      <title>A collinear shower algorithm for NSL non-singlet fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a collinear partonic shower algorithm that achieves next-to-single-logarithmic (NSL, $\alpha_s^n L^{n-1}$) accuracy for collinear-sensitive non-singlet fragmentation observables. This entails the development of an algorithm for nesting triple-collinear splitting functions. It also involves the inclusion of the one-loop double-collinear corrections, through a $z$-dependent NLO-accurate effective $1\to 2$ branching probability, using a formula that can be applied more generally also to future full showers with $1\to3$ splitting kernels. The specific NLO branching probability is calculated in two ways, one based on slicing, the other using a subtraction approach based on recent analytical calculations. We close with demonstrations of the shower's accuracy for non-singlet partonic fragmentation functions and the energy spectrum of small-$R$ quark jets. This work represents an important conceptual step towards general NNLL accuracy in parton showers.</description>

      <title>Illuminating dark objects with dark matter lampshades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a new technique to search for dark compact objects. When dark matter comprising a dark compact object interacts with photons, the compact object can disperse light traveling though it. As these objects pass between the Earth and a distant star, they act as "lampshades" that dim the star. We examine how dimming effects from clumps of dark matter in the galaxy could be searched for in microlensing surveys, which measure the brightness of stars as a function of time. Using the EROS-2 and OGLE surveys, we show that a dimming analysis of existing data can be used to constrain dark sectors, and could be used to discover dark matter in compact objects.</description>

      <title>Loops in supergroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theory of a scalar in the fundamental representation of the internal supergroup $SU(N|M)$. Remarkably, for $M=N+1$ its tree-level mass does not receive quantum corrections at one loop from either self-coupling or interactions with gauge bosons and fermions. This property comes at the price of introducing both degrees of freedom with wrong statistics and with wrong sign kinetic terms. We detail a method to break $SU(N|M)$ down to its bosonic subgroup through a Higgs-like mechanism, allowing for the partial decoupling of the dangerous modes, and study the associated vacuum structure up to one loop.</description>

      <title>Predictions for the rare kaon decays $K_{S,L} \to \pi^0 \ell^+ \ell^-$ from QCD in the limit of a large number of colours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-distance and non-local parts of the form factors describing the single-photon mediated $K_{S,L}\to\pi^0\gamma^*\to\pi^0\ell^+\ell^-$ ($\ell = e, \mu$) transitions in the standard model are addressed in QCD in the limit where the number $N_c$ of colours becomes infinite. It is shown that this provides a suitable theoretical framework to study these decay modes and that it allows to predict the decay rates for $K_{S}\to\pi^0\ell^+\ell^-$. It also unambiguously predicts that the interference between the direct and indirect CP-violating contributions to the decay rate for $K_L\to\pi^0 \ell^+ \ell^-$ is constructive.</description>

      <title>Probing Large Extra Dimension at DUNE using beam tunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a leading experiment in neutrino physics which is presently under construction. DUNE aims to measure the yet unknown parameters in the three flavor oscillation case which includes discovery of leptonic CP violation, determination of the neutrino mass hierarchy and measuring the octant of $\theta_{23}$. Additionally, the ancillary goals of DUNE include probing the subdominant effects induced by possible physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). One such new physics scenario is the possible presence of Large Extra Dimension (LED) which can naturally give rise to tiny neutrino masses. LED impacts neutrino oscillation through two new parameters, - namely the lightest Dirac mass $m_{0}$ and the radius of the extra dimension $R_{\text{ED}}$ ($&lt; 2$ $\mu$m). At the DUNE baseline of 1300 km, the probability seems to be modified more at the higher energy ($\gtrsim 4-5$ GeV) in presence of LED. In this work, we attempt to constrain the parameter space of $m_{0}$ and $R_{\text{ED}}$ by performing a statistical analysis of neutrino data simulated at DUNE far detector (FD). We illustrate how a combination of the standard low energy (LE) neutrino beam and a medium energy (ME) neutrino beam can take advantage of the relatively large impact of LED at higher energy and improve the constraints. In the analysis we also show the role of the individual oscillation channels ($\nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{e}, \nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\mu}, \nu_{\mu} \to \nu_{\tau}$), as well as the two neutrino mass hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Resonance suppression during the hadronic stage from the FAIR to the intermediate RHIC energy regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy and centrality dependence of the kaon resonance ratio $(K^{*0}+\Bar{K}^{*0})/(K^+ + K^-)$ is explored in the RHIC-BES and CBM-FAIR energy regime. To this aim, the Ultra-relativistic Quantum Molecular Dynamics (UrQMD) model is employed to simulate reconstructable $K^{*}$ resonances in Au+Au and p+p collisions from $\sqrt{s_{\text{NN}}}=3-39$ GeV. We obtain a good description of the resonance yields and mean transverse momenta over the whole investigated energy range. The decrease of the $K^*/K$ ratio, with increasing centrality is in line with the available experimental data. We also observe the experimenatlly measured increase in $\langle p_{\text{T}}\rangle$ with increasing centrality which is interpreted as a lower reconstruction probability of low-$p_{\text{T}}$ $K^*$ due to the $p_{\text{T}}$ dependent absorption of the decay daughter hadrons. We conclude that the observed suppression of reconstructable $K^{*}$ resonances provides a strong sign of an extended hadronic rescattering stage at all investigated energies. Its duration increases from peripheral to central reactions as expected. Following a method, suggested by the STAR experiment, the "duration" of the hadronic stage is extracted using the $K^*/K$ ratios at chemical and kinetic freeze-out. The resulting lifetimes are in good agreement with the experimental data, but much shorter than the actual lifetime of the hadronic phase in the transport simulation. This indicates that the experimental method to estimate the life time of the hadronic stage is too simplified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I describe in detail the phenomenology of a d=4 flavour-non-universal gauge theory, based on Ref. [1] , where global accidental symmetries control the pattern of the Yukawa couplings of the charged fermions and, at the same time, the deviations from the Standard Model of the relevant flavour observables. Special attention is payed to the phenomenology at the lowest new scale, the mass $m_{Z_{23}}$ of a neutral vector boson, in the MultiTeV</description>

      <title>Simulation of a (3+1)D glasma in Milne coordinates: Topological charge, eccentricity, and angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the 3D glasma simulation method using Milne coordinates, proposed in our previous work [1], to the early stage of the Au-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=200$ GeV. The nucleus model prior to the collisions, which offers the initial condition for the 3D glasma simulation is constructed to account for the longitudinal structure of the nucleus, the finite thickness of nucleons and their random positions along the collision axis. We investigate rapidity profiles for a wide range of physical quantities of the glasma, including energy, pressure, fluctuations of topological charge, eccentricity, and angular momentum. In particular, we elucidate the behavior of eccentricity and angular momentum, which are physical quantities dependent on the geometric shape of the glasma, across a wide range of impact parameter regions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Chirality Structure in Nucleon Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon number conservation is an accidental symmetry in the Standard Model, but its violation is theoretically anticipated, making the search for such processes a promising avenue for discovering new physics. In this paper, we explore how measurements of different nucleon decay channels can reveal the structure of the underlying theory. We investigate the chirality structure of baryon-number violating interactions through lifetime measurements of strangeness-conserving nucleon-decay channels. By employing an effective field theory approach, we demonstrate that the ratio of partial decay widths of proton decay channels, $\Gamma(p \to \eta \ell^+)/\Gamma(p \to \pi^0 \ell^+)$, where $\ell^+$ denotes a positron or anti-muon, is sensitive to this chirality structure. Furthermore, we find that in certain new physics models, both anti-lepton and anti-neutrino channels provide valuable insights into the model's structure. Our results highlight the importance of searching for various decay channels in upcoming nucleon decay experiments.</description>

      <title>Scaling up to Multivariate Rational Function Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present an algorithm for the reconstruction of multivariate rational functions from black-box probes. The arguably most important application in high-energy physics is the calculation of multi-loop and multi-leg amplitudes, where rational functions appear as coefficients in the integration-by-parts reduction to basis integrals. I show that for a dense coefficient the algorithm is nearly optimal, in the sense that the number of required probes is close to the number of unknowns.</description>

      <title>Thermal leptogenesis, dark matter and gravitational waves from an extended canonical seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a canonical type-I seesaw scenario, the SM is extended with three singlet right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) $N_i, i=1,2,3$ with masses $M_i, i=1,2,3$ to simultaneously explain sub-eV masses of light neutrinos and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In this paper, we show that a relatively low-scale thermal leptogenesis accompanied by gravitational wave signatures is possible when the type-I seesaw is extended with a singlet fermion ($S$) and a singlet scalar ($\rho$), where $S$ and $\rho$ are odd under a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. We also add a vector-like fermion doublet $\Psi$ and impose a $Z^\prime_2$ symmetry under which both $N_1$ and $\Psi$ are odd while all other particles are even. This gives rise to a singlet-doublet Majorana fermion dark matter in our setup. At a high scale, the $Z_2$ symmetry is broken spontaneously by the vacuum expectation value of $\rho$ and leads to : (i) mixing between RHNs ($N_2, N_3$) and S, and (ii) formation of Domain walls (DWs). In the former case, the final lepton asymmetry is generated by the out-of-equilibrium decay of $S$, which dominantly mixes with $N_2$. We show that the scale of thermal leptogenesis can be lowered to $M_S \sim 4 \times 10^8$ GeV. In the latter case, the disappearance of the DWs gives observable gravitational wave signatures, which can be probed at NANOGrav, EPTA, LISA, etc.</description>

      <title>Considerations on electromagnetic radiation in Podolsky electrodynamics within a Lorentz-symmetry violating framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how higher-order derivative terms impact a physical observable within a Lorentz-Symmetry Violating (LSV) framework. We specifically examine Podolsky electrodynamics coupled with the Carroll-Field-Jackiw model (CFJ). Our analysis shows how vacuum and wave propagation are affected by the interaction of LSV parameters with properties of Podolsky electrodynamics. In this scenario, our results indicate that the new electromagnetic vacuum is birefringent, dichroic, and dispersive. We also point out that the higher-derivative term in the presence of the CFJ space-time anisotropy induces an oscillation mechanism between the photon, which acquires a non-vanishing mass, and the massive vector mode carried by the higher derivative. We then investigate the electromagnetic radiation emitted by a moving charged particle interacting with this new medium. Our analysis reveals that the refractive vacuum through which the charged particle travels influences the electromagnetic radiation, leading to a profile similar to the Cherenkov effect.</description>

      <title>Domain-wall Skyrmion phase of QCD in magnetic field: Gauge field dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ground state of QCD in sufficiently strong magnetic field at finite baryon density is an inhomogeneous state consisting of an array of solitons, called the chiral soliton lattice (CSL). It is, however, replaced in a region with higher density and/or magnetic field by the so-called domain-wall Skyrmion(DWSk) phase where Skyrmions are created on top of the CSL. This was previously proposed within the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) approximation neglecting a gauge field dynamics and taking into account its effect by a flux quantization condition. In this paper, by taking into account dynamics of the gauge field, we show that the phase boundary between the CSL and DWSk phases beyond the BPS approximation is identical to the one obtained in the BPS approximation. We also find that domain-wall Skyrmions are electrically charged with the charge one as a result of the chiral anomaly.</description>

      <title>Two-loop planar master integrals for NNLO QCD corrections to W-pair production in quark-antiquark annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar two-loop scalar Feynman integrals contributing to the massive NNLO QCD corrections for $W$-boson pair production via quark-antiquark annihilation can be classified into three family branches, each of which is reduced to a distinct set of master integrals (MIs), totaling $27$, $45$ and $15$, respectively. These MIs are analytically calculated using the method of differential equations, with solutions expanded as Taylor series in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$. For the first two family branches, the differential systems can be successfully transformed into canonical form by adopting appropriate bases of MIs. This enables the MIs of these family branches to be expressed either as Goncharov polylogarithms (GPLs) or as one-fold integrals over GPLs, up to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^4)$. In contrast, the differential system for the third family branch can only be cast into a form linear in $\epsilon$ due to the presence of elliptic integrals. The solution to this linear-form differential system is expressed in an iterated form owing to the strictly lower-triangular structure of the coefficient matrices at $\epsilon = 0$. Our analytic expressions for these MIs are verified with high accuracy against the numerical results from the \texttt{AMFlow} package.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the entropic uncertainty relations and the quantum Fisher information to explore the formation of quark $t\bar{t}$ pairs at a large hadron collider through the combination of $q\bar{q}$ pair and $gg$ pair initiated processes. A comprehensive analysis has been undertaken on the procedure of quark and gluon channel mixing in the production of top quark pairs $t\bar{t}$, encompassing the tightness of the entropic uncertainty inequalities and the maximum quantum Fisher information of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the discovery of $T_{cc}$ by LHCb, there has been considerable interest in $T_{cc}$ and its heavy-flavor partners. However, the study of its strange partner $T_{ss}$ has been largely overlooked. Within the framework of the chiral quark model, we conducted a systematic study of the bound states of $T_{ss}$ utilizing the Gaussian Expansion Method. Considering all physical channels with $01^{+}$, including molecular and diquark structures. Our calculations revealed that upon considering the coupling between diquarks and molecular states, we identified a deep bound state with a bounding energy of 60 MeV, primarily composed of $K K^{*}$. Using the $^3P_0$ model, we calculated the decay width of $K^{*}$ within the $KK^{*}$ bound state, which is approximated as the decay width of the bound state in the $T_{ss}$ system. The results indicate that due to the effect of binding energy, the decay width of $K^{*}$ in $KK^{*}$ is approximately $3$ MeV smaller than that of $K^{*}$ in vacuum. Additionally, resonance state calculations were performed. Utilizing the real-scaling method, we searched for possible resonance states in the $T_{ss}$ sysytem. Due to the strong attraction in the $[K^{*}]_8[K^{*}]_8$ configuration, four resonance states were found in the vicinity of $2.2$-$2.8$ GeV, predominantly featuring hidden-color structures, and their decay widths are all less than $10$ MeV. We strongly recommend experimental efforts to search for the resonance states in the $T_{ss}$ system predicted by our calculations.</description>

      <title>One loop $\beta$ functions for mirror noncommutative Euclidean Yukawa sector within electroweak-scale right handed neutrinos model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the renormalization scale dependence of noncommutative mirror Yukawa couplings. To achieve this, we first formulate an Euclidean noncommutative version of the Yukawa sector within the electroweak-scale mirror right handed neutrinos model. Then, we calculate the noncommutative one loop $\beta$ functions of Yukawa couplings for mirror fermions involved in this model, by taking advantage of the Slavnov Taylor identities for the universal mirror Yukawa couplings, and by using the noncommutative vulcanised scalar and spinor propagators that prevent the UV/IR mixing. This leads us to a system of six cubic coupled first order differential equations that depend only on the mirror Yukawa couplings and not on the noncommutative deformation and vulcanised parameters. We solve this system numerically for different initial conditions to get the evolution of the mirror Yukawa couplings in terms of the renormalization scale. Furthermore, we discuss the link to the commutative case and analyze the occurrence of the Landau pole for some specific sets of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Chiral dark matter and radiative neutrino masses from gauged U(1) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of dark matter models based on a chiral $U(1)$ gauge symmetry acting on a dark sector. The chiral $U(1)$ protects the masses of the dark sector fermions, and also guarantees the stability of the dark matter particle by virtue of an unbroken discrete $\mathcal{Z}_N$ gauge symmetry. We identify 38 such $U(1)$ models which are descendants of a chiral $SU(3) \times SU(2)$ gauge symmetry, consisting of a minimal set of fermions with simple $U(1)$ charge assignments. We show how these models can also be utilized to generate small Majorana neutrino masses radiatively via the scotogenic mechanism with the dark sector particles circulating inside loop diagrams. We further explore the phenomenology of the simplest model in this class, which admits a Majorana fermion, Dirac fermion or a scalar field to be the dark matter candidate, and show the consistency of various scenarios with constraints from relic density and direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Phenomenology of Identified Particle Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions at LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A nonequilibrium state does not relax to thermodynamic equilibrium but to a state which takes into account long-living fluctuations as quasi-conserved quantities. This state is described by the relevant statistical operator within the Zubarev method to derive the nonequilibrium statistical operator. We apply this approach to the spectra of particles produced in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions at the LHC experiments at CERN. We show that controversal explanations of the low-momentum part of the spectrum given by an extended hydrodynamic-like Blast-Wave approach [with mesonic chemical potentials] and the reaction-kinetic description of the hadron resonance gas can be considered as special approximation of a more general nonequilibrium approach which takes mesonic chemical potentials into account to describe quasi-conserved particle numbers, but takes also continuum correlations, in particular resonances, into account using the Beth-Uhlenbeck [or Dashen-Ma-Bernstein] virial expansion. We present results for the spectra of pions, kaons, and protons and explain why different approaches can explain the data obtained from the ALICE experiments.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from a Gauge Field Non-minimally Coupled to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An axion-like spectator during inflation can trigger a tachyonic instability which amplifies the modes of one of the helicities of the gauge field, resulting in the production of parity-violating gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper we investigate the impact of the coupling $RFF$ of the gauge field to gravity on the production of GWs. We find that such a coupling introduces a multiplicative factor to the tachyonic mass, which effectively enhances the amplitude of the gauge field modes. Produced GWs are expected to be observed by future space-based GW detectors. Additionally, we find that the strong backreaction due to particle production leads to multiple peaks in the energy spectrum of GWs.</description>

      <title>Robust Constraints on the Physics of the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A from Optical Depth Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brightest-of-all-time gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 221009A, is the first GRB observed to have emission line (up to 37 MeV) in its prompt emission spectra. It is naturally explained as \pair annihilation line that was Doppler boosted in the relativistic jet of the GRB. In this work, we repeatedly apply the simple optical depth argument to different physical processes necessary to produce an observable \pair annihilation line. This approach results in robust constraints on the physics of the line: We conclude that in GRB 221009A, the \pair pairs were produced at a radius greater than $4.3\times 10^{15}$\,cm from the central engine, and annihilated in a region between $1.4\times 10^{16}$\,cm and $4.3\times 10^{16}$\,cm. From these constraints, we established a self-consistent picture of \pair production, cooling, and annihilation. We also derived a criterion for pair production in the GRB prompt emission: $E_{\rm{iso}} \gtrsim3.3\times 10^{53} E_{\rm{peak},100} (1+z) R^2_{\rm{prod},16}~\text{erg}$. Using this criterion, we find tens of candidate GRBs that could have produced \pair in prompt emissions to annihilate. GRB 221009A is with the highest likelihood according to this criterion. We also predict the presence of a thermal radiation, with a time-evolving black body temperature, sweeping through soft X-ray during the prompt emission phase.</description>

      <title>Evolution and the quasistationary state of collective fast neutrino flavor conversion in three dimensions without axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in this work the evolution of the collective fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC) in a three dimensional (3D) cubic box with periodic boundary condition for three different neutrino angular distributions that are axially asymmetric. We find that the system evolves toward a quasistationary state where the angular distribution of the spatially averaged neutrino electron-minus-muon lepton number (ELN) does not contain any crossings. In the quasistationary state, near flavor equilibration is achieved in one angular domain enclosed by the initial ELN angular crossing contour, similar to the conclusion derived based on simplified one dimensional (1D) system with axially symmetric neutrino angular distributions. We have also performed additional simulations in coordinates where the initial first ELN angular moment has only one nonvanishing spatial component by using the original axially asymmetric ELN angular distributions as well as the corresponding axisymmetric ELN distributions, and find interesting similarity between these two sets. Finally, we propose three different analytical prescriptions generalized from earlier 1D models to 3D models, and evaluate their performances in predicting the post-FFC moments. Our findings suggest that further development of effective classical transport model in multidimensions to capture the effect of FFC is promising.</description>

      <title>Constraints on dark energy and modified gravity from the BOSS Full-Shape and DESI BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We constrain dark energy and modified gravity within the effective field theory of dark energy framework using the full-shape BOSS galaxy power spectrum, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and recent baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from DESI. Specifically, we focus on a varying braiding parameter $\alpha_{\rm B}$, a running of the ``effective'' Planck mass $\alpha_{\rm M}$, and a constant dark energy equation of state $w$. The analysis is performed with two of these parameters at a time, including all the other standard cosmological parameters and marginalizing over bias and nuisance parameters. The full-shape galaxy power spectrum is modeled using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to 1-loop order in perturbation theory. We find that the CMB data is most sensitive to $\alpha_{\rm B}$, and that adding large-scale structure information only slightly changes the parameter constraints. However, the large-scale structure data significantly improve the bounds on $\alpha_{\rm M}$ and $w$ by a factor of two. This improvement is driven by background information contained in the BAO, which breaks the degeneracy with $H_0$ in the CMB. We confirm this by comparing the BOSS full-shape information with BOSS BAO, finding no significant differences. This is likely to change with future high-precision full-shape data from Euclid and DESI however, to which the pipeline developed here is immediately applicable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study higher-derivative supersymmetric effective field theories focusing on the systematic procedure for the elimination of ghosts from the spectrum. Particular attention is paid to the auxiliary fields, for which the higher-derivative terms induce non-algebraic equations of motion. By employing field redefinitions or the reduction of order procedure (both in component and superfield language) we show that the auxiliary fields remain non-dynamical in the EFT and that on shell they give rise to both derivative and non-derivative corrections to the scalar action. These methods are applied to the search for a SUSY embedding of the DBI action and to the dimensional reduction of HD terms for the K\"ahler moduli in type IIB string compactifications.</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>

      <title>Learning Theory Informed Priors for Bayesian Inference: A Case Study with Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological models are often motivated and formulated in the language of particle physics, using quantities such as the axion decay constant, but tested against data using ostensibly physical quantities, such as energy density ratios, assuming uniform priors on the latter. This approach neglects priors on the model from fundamental theory, including from particle physics and string theory, such as the preference for sub-Planckian axion decay constants. We introduce a novel approach to learning theory-informed priors for Bayesian inference using normalizing flows (NF), a flexible generative machine learning technique that generates priors on model parameters when analytic expressions are unavailable or difficult to compute. As a test case, we focus on early dark energy (EDE), a model designed to address the Hubble tension. Rather than using uniform priors on the $\textit{phenomenological}$ EDE parameters $f_{\rm EDE}$ and $z_c$, we train a NF on EDE cosmologies informed by theory expectations for axion masses and decay constants. Our method recovers known constraints in this representation while being $\sim 300,000$ times more efficient in terms of total CPU compute time. Applying our NF to $\textit{Planck}$ and BOSS data, we obtain the first theory-informed constraints on EDE, finding $f_{\rm EDE} \lesssim 0.02$ at $95\%$ confidence with an $H_0$ consistent with $\textit{Planck}$, but in $\sim 6\sigma$ tension with SH0ES. This yields the strongest constraints on EDE to date, additionally challenging its role in resolving the Hubble tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton holographic model for light quarks with nonzero magnetic field and chemical potential. First, we study the phase diagrams in $T-\mu$ and $T-B$ planes. We observe inverse magnetic catalysis which is consistent with the lattice QCD results. We discuss the influence of the magnetic field and chemical potential on the location of the critical end point (CEP). It is found that the magnetic field increases the critical $\mu_{\scriptscriptstyle CEP}$ of the CEP in the $T-\mu$ plane and the chemical potential increases the critical $B_{\scriptscriptstyle CEP}$ of the CEP in the $T-B$ plane. Second, we discuss the equations of state (EOS) with nonzero magnetic field and chemical potential. We observe that the EOS near the phase transition temperature are nonmonotonic. Then we study the energy loss with a nonzero magnetic field and chemical potential. It is found that the drag force of the heavy quark and jet quenching parameter $\hat{q}$ show an enhancement near the phase transition temperature. The peak values of drag force and $\hat{q}$ are pushed toward lower temperature with increasing $B$ or $\mu$. This phenomenon is consistent with the phase transition temperature decrease with increasing $B$ or $\mu$ in this holographic model. Moreover, we find that the heavy quark may lose more energy when it is perpendicular to a magnetic field which is consistent with the results of the jet quenching parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical approaches to computations typically reconstruct the numerators of Feynman diagrams in four dimensions. In doing so, certain rational terms arising from the (D-4)-dimensional part of the numerator multiplying ultraviolet (UV) poles in dimensional regularisation are not captured and need to be obtained by other means. At one-loop these rational terms of UV origin can be computed from a set of process-independent Feynman rules. Recently, it was shown that this approach can be extended to two loops. In this paper, we show that to all loop orders it is possible to compute rational terms of UV origin through process-independent vertices that are polynomial in masses and momenta.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction of the $X(3872)$ beyond vector meson dominance: the open-charm coupled-channel mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hidden-charm exotic hadrons will be searched for and investigated at future electron-ion colliders. For instance, the $X(3872)$ can be produced through the exclusive process $\gamma p\to X(3872)p$. The vector meson dominance model has been commonly employed in estimating the cross sections of such processes. However, the coupled-channel production mechanism through open-charm meson-baryon intermediate states may play a crucial role. To assess the significance of such contributions, we estimate the cross section of the $\gamma p\to X(3872)p$ reaction assuming the coupled-channel mechanism. For energies near the threshold, the total cross section is predicted to be of tens of nanobarns for $\gamma p\to X(3872)p$, which can be measured at future experimental facilities. Furthermore, the open-charm coupled-channel mechanism leads to a distinct line shape of the total cross section that can be utilized to reveal the production dynamics.</description>

      <title>Supernova-Neutrino-Boosted Dark Matter from All Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently proposed that the boosted dark matter (BDM) by supernova neutrinos (SN$\nu$) from SN1987a or from the next Galactic supernova (SN) can serve as a novel component to probe nonvanishing interaction between dark matter (DM) and the standard model leptons [Y.-H. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett 130, 111002 (2023) and Y.-H. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. D 108, 083013 (2023)]. In this Letter, we extend this concept and evaluate the present-day diffuse flux of SN$\nu$ BDM originated from all galaxies at higher redshifts. We show that by considering this diffuse BDM (DBDM) component, the best sensitivity on the product of the energy-independent DM-$\nu$ and DM-electron cross sections, $\sqrt{\sigma_{\chi\nu}\sigma_{\chi e}}\simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{-37})$ cm$^2$ for sub-MeV DM, can be obtained with large-size neutrino experiments such as Super-Kamiokande or Hyper-Kamiokande, surpassing the estimated SN$\nu$ BDM bound from SN1987a. We also examine the impact due to the presence of DM spikes around the supermassive black holes in galaxies on SN$\nu$ BDM and DBDM. Our results suggest that both the DBDM and the SN$\nu$ BDM probes are robust to the uncertain properties of DM spikes, unless the next Galactic SN happens to occur at a location extremely close to or right behind the Galactic Center along the SN line of sight.</description>

      <title>Solar chameleons: Novel channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the flux of chameleons (light scalar particles which could play a role in the dark energy phenomenon) produced in the interior of the Sun. Our novel analysis incorporates various important details and new processes that have previously been overlooked, including the impact of the bulk magnetic field profile, as well as Primakoff production of chameleons in the electric fields of electrons and ions. In this paper we consider only the contributions of transverse photons. The production of chameleons from longitudinal electromagnetic excitations will be presented in a dedicated follow-up work. Demanding that the total flux of chameleons does not exceed 3% of the solar luminosity leads to the stringent upper limit on the chameleon-photon conformal coupling $\beta_\gamma \lesssim 10^{10}$, assuming that the height of the chameleon potential is set to the dark energy scale $\Lambda = 2.4$ meV, and independently of other couplings to matter. Although this bound is tighter than current upper limits on $\beta_{\gamma}$ from the CAST helioscope, these limits will have to be reassessed in terms of the updated solar chameleon flux we have computed. We argue that solar chameleons, potentially detectable in next-generation helioscopes such as IAXO, can be used to probe a region of chameleon parameter space that has yet to be covered.</description>

      <title>Investigating a new neutral heavy gauge boson within the mono-Z$^{\prime}$ portal via simulated pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we aim to explore the potential for generating events related to dark matter (DM) in conjunction with a neutral heavy gauge boson (Z$^{\prime}$) decaying leptonically during proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These collisions occur at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, with a high integrated luminosity equivalent to 1000 fb$^{-1}$. Our analysis involves interpreting the outcomes through Monte Carlo simulation of the effective field theory (EFT) framework. If no new physics is detected, we establish constraints on various parameters within the EFT context, such as the scenario cutoff scale ($\Lambda$) and the Z$^{\prime}$ mass.</description>

      <title>The $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda\, l^+\nu_\ell$ weak decay including new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the $\Lambda_c \to \Lambda \ell^{+} \nu_\ell$ decay with a focus on potential new physics (NP) effects in the $\ell = \mu$ channel. We employ an effective Hamiltonian within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to consider generalized dimension-6 semileptonic $c\to s$ operators of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector and tensor types. We rely on Lattice QCD (LQCD) for the hadronic transition form factors, using heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) to determine those that have not yet been obtained on the lattice. Uncertainties due to the truncation of the NP Hamiltonian and different implementations of HQSS are taken into account. As a result, we unravel the NP discovery potential of the $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda$ semileptonic decay in different observables. Our findings indicate high sensitivity to NP in lepton flavour universality ratios, probing multi-TeV scales in some cases. On the theoretical side, we identify LQCD uncertainties in axial and vector form factors as critical for improving NP sensitivity, alongside better SMEFT uncertainty estimations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze data from the CsI, liquid Ar and Ge detectors of the COHERENT experiment and confirm within $1.5\sigma$ that the measured elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering cross section is proportional to the square of the number of neutrons in the nucleus, as expected for coherent scattering in the standard model. We also show how various degeneracies involving nonstandard neutrino interaction parameters are broken in a combined analysis of the three datasets.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Ionization in the Central Molecular Zone by sub-GeV Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the anomalous ionization rate observed in the Central Molecular Zone can be attributed to MeV dark matter annihilations into $e^+e^-$ pairs for galactic dark matter profiles with slopes $\gamma&gt;1$. The low annihilation cross-sections required avoid cosmological constraints and imply no detectable inverse Compton, bremsstrahlung or synchrotron emissions in radio, X and gamma rays. The possible connection to the source of the unexplained 511 keV line emission in the Galactic Center suggests that both observations could be correlated and have a common origin.</description>

      <title>Notes on Confinement on $\mathbf{R^3 \times S^1}$: From Yang-Mills, super-Yang-Mills, and QCD(adj) to QCD(F)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.10423v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical introduction to the physics of confinement on $R^3 \times S^1$, using $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills with massive or massless adjoint fermions as the prime example; at the end, we also add fundamental flavours. The small-$S^1$ limit is remarkable, allowing for controlled semiclassical determination of the nonperturbative physics in these, mostly non-supersymmetric, theories. We begin by reviewing the Polyakov confinement mechanism on $R^3$. Moving on to $R^3 \times S^1$, we show how introducing adjoint fermions stabilizes center symmetry, leading to abelianization and semiclassical calculability. We explain how monopole-instantons and twisted monopole-instantons arise. We describe the role of various novel topological excitations in extending Polyakov's confinement to the locally four-dimensional case, discuss the nature of the confining string, and the $\theta$-angle dependence.~We study the global symmetry realization and, when available, present evidence for the absence of phase transitions as a function of the $S^1$ size. As our aim is not to cover all work on the subject, but to prepare the interested reader for its study, we also include brief descriptions of topics not covered in detail: the necessity for analytic continuation of path integrals, the study of more general theories, and the 't Hooft anomalies involving higher-form symmetries.</description>

      <title>Yukawa Couplings at Infinite Distance and Swampland Towers in Chiral Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09775v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study limits of vanishing Yukawa couplings of 4d chiral matter fields in Quantum Gravity, using as a laboratory type IIA orientifolds with D6-branes. In these theories chiral fermions arise at brane intersections, where an infinite tower of charged particles dubbed gonions are localised. We show that in the limit $Y\rightarrow 0$ some of these towers become asymptotically massless, while at the same time the kinetic term of some chiral fields becomes singular and at least two extra dimensions decompactify. For limits parametrised by a large complex structure saxion $u$, Yukawa couplings have a behaviour of the form $Y \, \sim \, {1}/{u^r}$, with $r$ some positive rational number. Moreover, in this limit some of the gauge couplings associated to the Yukawa vanish. The lightest gonion scales are of order $m_{\rm gon} \sim g^s M_{\rm P}$ with $s&gt;1$, verifying the magnetic WGC with room to spare and with no need of its tower/sublattice versions. We also show how this behaviour can be understood in the context of the emergence of kinetic terms in Quantum Gravity. All these results may be very relevant for phenomenology, given the fact that some of the Yukawa couplings in the Standard Model are very small.</description>

      <title>Formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the theory behind the formation of primordial black hole binaries and their merger rates. We consider the binary formation in the early and late Universe, emphasising the former as it gives the dominant contribution of the present primordial black hole merger rate. The binaries formed in the early Universe are highly eccentric so their interactions with other primordial black holes can significantly increase their coalescence times and thereby suppress the merger rate. We discuss in detail how the suppression of the merger rate arising from such interactions can be estimated and how such interactions lead to the formation of another, much harder, binary population that contributes to the present merger rate if more than 10% of dark matter consists of primordial black holes with a relatively narrow mass distribution. When the primordial abundance is below 1%, encounters between primordial black holes are unlikely and their effect on the merger rate becomes negligible.</description>

      <title>Meso-inflationary Peccei-Quinn symmetry breaking with non-minimal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a realization of the inflationary scenario where the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry is spontaneously broken during inflation, facilitated by its non-minimal coupling to gravity. This results in effectively two-field inflation: the early stage is driven by an inflaton field with the PQ symmetry intact, and the later stage is driven by the PQ scalar after its effective mass becomes tachyonic, causing destabilization from the origin. The non-minimal coupling serves the dual purpose of restoring the PQ symmetry during early inflation and flattening the PQ potential post-tachyonic shift, allowing for continued slow roll. We analyze the inflationary background solutions and scalar perturbations, which are amplified at small scales via significant isocurvature perturbations generated near the symmetry-breaking epoch. These perturbations lead to second-order gravitational waves, detectable by next-generation space-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00691v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. The Bayesian analysis yields the NMEs $4.34^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ for $^{136}$Xe and $5.51^{+0.24}_{-0.26}$ for $^{150}$Nd. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation from binary systems in Unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unimodular gravity (UG) is classically considered identical to General Relativity (GR). However, due to restricted diffeomorphism symmetry, the Bianchi identites do not lead to the conservation of energy-momentum tensor. Thus, the conservation of energy-momentum tensor needs to be separately assumed in order to reconcile with GR. Relaxing this assumption, one finds that the conservation violation can lead to differences with GR, which can be subsequently examined in astrophysical and cosmological scenarios. To this end, we examine the predictions of UG in the context of binary systems emitting gravitational radiation. Primarily, we show how the field equations involve a diffusion function which quantifies the measure of non-conservation. Due to this violation, the dispersion relation is modified. Incorporating these changes, we provide an expression for the energy loss by the binaries, which reduces to Peters-Mathews result in the GR limit. Using binary pulsar data, we constrain the theory parameter $\zeta$ (which signifies non-conservation) by determining the rate of orbital decay. The strongest constrain on $\zeta$ comes out to be $\vert \zeta \vert \leq 5\times 10^{-4}$ which is better by an order of magnitude than an existing equivalent constraint coming from the tidal deformability of the neutron stars.</description>

      <title>QED Corrections in Unstable Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-energy and vacuum polarization effects in quantum electrodynamics (QED) are calculated for the supercritical Coulomb field, where Dirac energy levels become embedded in the negative-energy continuum. In this regime, the quantum vacuum becomes unstable, resulting in spontaneous electron-positron pair creation. By calculating the imaginary part of the QED correction, we gain access to an unexplored channel of vacuum instability: radiative spontaneous pair creation. Our results show that this radiative channel is greatly enhanced in the vicinity of the threshold of the supercritical regime, providing evidence for nonperturbative effects with respect to the fine-structure constant $\alpha$. We therefore conjecture that the total probability of spontaneous pair creation could differ significantly from the predictions of Dirac theory, especially near the supercritical threshold.</description>
