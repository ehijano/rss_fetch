      <title>Totally Disjoint 3-Digit Decimal Check Digit Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition and adjacent twin errors. The three versions of such a code that he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. This paper presents 3 pairwise disjoint 3-digit codes. The codes developed herein, have the property that the knowledge of the multiset of digits included in a word is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions were unknown. Thus the codes are permutation-free, and this fulfills his desire to eliminate cyclic errors. Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.</description>

      <title>Watts-Per-Intelligence: Part I (Energy Efficiency)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for quantifying energy efficiency in intelligent systems by linking energy consumption to information processing capacity. Our proposed watts per intelligence metric integrates algorithmic thermodynamic principles of Landauer with computational models of machine intelligence. By formalising the irreversible energy costs of computation, we derive rigorous lower bounds on energy usage of algorithmic intelligent systems and their adaptability. We introduce theorems that constrain the trade offs between intelligence output and energy expenditure. Our results contribute to design principles for energy efficient intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>Status Updating with Time Stamp Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A status updating system is considered in which multiple processes are sampled and transmitted through a shared channel. Each process has its dedicated server that processes its samples before time stamping them for transmission. Time stamps, however, are prone to errors, and hence the status updates received may not be credible. Our setting models the time stamp error rate as a function of the servers' busy times. Hence, to reduce errors and enhance credibility, servers need to process samples on a relatively prolonged schedule. This, however, deteriorates timeliness, which is captured through the age of information (AoI) metric. An optimization problem is formulated whose goal to characterize the optimal processes' schedule and sampling instances to achieve the optimal trade-off between timeliness and credibility. The problem is first solved for a single process setting, where it is shown that a threshold-based sleep-wake schedule is optimal, in which the server wakes up and is allowed to process newly incoming samples only if the AoI surpasses a certain threshold that depends on the required timeliness-credibility trade-off. Such insights are then extended to the multi-process setting, where two main scheduling and sleep-wake policies, namely round-robin scheduling with threshold-waiting and asymmetric scheduling with zero-waiting, are introduced and analyzed.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Near-Field Beam Training and Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a key technology for next-generation wireless communication systems. By deploying significantly more antennas than conventional massive MIMO systems, XL-MIMO promises substantial improvements in spectral efficiency. However, due to the drastically increased array size, the conventional planar wave channel model is no longer accurate, necessitating a transition to a near-field spherical wave model. This shift challenges traditional beam training and channel estimation methods, which were designed for planar wave propagation. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art beam training and channel estimation techniques for XL-MIMO systems. We analyze the fundamental principles, key methodologies, and recent advancements in this area, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations in addressing the challenges posed by the near-field propagation environment. Furthermore, we explore open research challenges that remain unresolved to provide valuable insights for researchers and engineers working toward the development of next-generation XL-MIMO communication systems.</description>

      <title>Curved representational Bregman divergences and their applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analogy to curved exponential families, we define curved Bregman divergences as restrictions of Bregman divergences to sub-dimensional parameter subspaces, and prove that the barycenter of a finite weighted parameter set with respect to a curved Bregman divergence amounts to the Bregman projection onto the subspace induced by the constraint of the barycenter with respect to the unconstrained full Bregman divergence. We demonstrate the significance of curved Bregman divergences with two examples: (1) symmetrized Bregman divergences and (2) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between circular complex normal distributions. We then consider monotonic embeddings to define representational curved Bregman divergences and show that the $\alpha$-divergences are representational curved Bregman divergences with respect to $\alpha$-embeddings of the probability simplex into the positive measure cone. As an application, we report an efficient method to calculate the intersection of a finite set of $\alpha$-divergence spheres.</description>

      <title>Robust and Efficient Average Consensus with Non-Coherent Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-coherent over-the-air (OTA) computation has garnered increasing attention for its advantages in facilitating information aggregation among distributed agents in resource-constrained networks without requiring precise channel estimation. A promising application scenario of this method is distributed average consensus in wireless multi-agent systems. However, in such scenario, non-coherent interference from concurrent OTA transmissions can introduce bias in the consensus value. To address this issue, we develop a robust distributed average consensus algorithm by formulating the consensus problem as a distributed optimization problem. Using decentralized projected gradient descent (D-PGD), our proposed algorithm can achieve unbiased mean square average consensus even in the presence of non-coherent interference and noise. Additionally, we implement transmit power control and receive scaling mechanisms to further accelerate convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the convergence speed of the D-PGD algorithm for OTA average consensus without compromising accuracy.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Assisted ISAC: A CRLB Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, pinching antennas have attracted significant research interest due to their capability to reconfigure wireless channels as well as their array configuration flexibility. This letter focuses on how these features can be used to support integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) from the Cramer Rao lower bound (CRLB) perspective. In particular, the CRLB achieved by pinching antennas is first derived and then compared to that of conventional antennas. The presented analytical and simulation results demonstrate that using pinching antennas can significantly reduce CRLB and, hence, enhance positioning accuracy. In addition, this letter also reveals that the low-cost and reconfigurability features of pinching antennas can be utilized to realize flexible user-centric positioning.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity AoI-Optimal Status Update Control with Partial Battery State Information in Energy Harvesting IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a two-hop IoT system consisting of multiple energy harvesting sensors, a cache-enabled edge node, and multiple monitors, the status update control at the edge node, which has partial battery state information (pBSI) of the sensors, is formulated as a pBSI problem. The concept of inferred pBSI is introduced to reduce the noiseless single-sensor pBSI problem to a Markov decision process with a moderate state-space size, enabling the optimal policy to be obtained through a value iteration algorithm. A lower bound on the expected time-average on-demand age of information performance is established for the general single-sensor status update problem. For the single-sensor pBSI problem, a semi-closed-form policy called the current-next (CN) policy is proposed, along with an efficient post-update value iteration algorithm with a per-iteration time complexity proportional to the square of the battery capacity. A weighted-update-gain-competition (WUGC) approach is further leveraged to extend the CN policy to the multi-sensor case. Numerical results in the single-sensor case demonstrate the near-optimal performance of the CN policy across various energy arrival processes. Simulations for an IoT system with $100$ sensors reveal that the WUGC-CN policy outperforms the maximum-age-first policy and the random-scheduling-based CN policy under Bernoulli energy arrival processes.</description>

      <title>Capacity Region for Covert Secret Key Generation over Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study covert secret key generation over a binary-input two-user multiple access channel with one-way public discussion and derive bounds on the capacity region. Specifically, in this problem, there are three legitimate parties: Alice, Bob and Charlie. The goal is to allow Charlie to generate a secret key with Alice and another secret key with Bob, reliably, secretly and covertly. Reliability ensures that the key generated by Alice and Charlie is the same and the key generated by Bob and Charlie is the same. Secrecy ensures that the secret keys generated are only known to specific legitimate parties. Covertness ensures that the key generation process is undetectable by a warden Willie. As a corollary of our result, we establish bounds on the capacity region of wiretap secret key generation without the covertness constraint and discuss the impact of covertness. Our results generalize the point-to-point result of Tahmasbi and Bloch (TIFS 2020) to the setting of multiterminal communication.</description>

      <title>Old and New Results on Alphabetic Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comprehensive survey examines the field of alphabetic codes, tracing their development from the 1960s to the present day. We explore classical alphabetic codes and their variants, analyzing their properties and the underlying mathematical and algorithmic principles. The paper covers the fundamental relationship between alphabetic codes and comparison-based search procedures and their applications in data compression, routing, and testing. We review optimal alphabetic code construction algorithms, necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence, and upper bounds on the average code length of optimal alphabetic codes. The survey also discusses variations and generalizations of the classical problem of constructing minimum average length alphabetic codes. By elucidating both classical results and recent findings, this paper aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and students, concluding with promising future research directions in this still-active field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and exact algorithm for generating connected Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n, p)$. Our approach exploits a link between the distribution of exploration process trajectories and an inhomogeneous random walk. In contrast to existing methods, our approach guarantees the correct distribution under the connectivity condition and achieves $O(n^2)$ runtime in the sparse case $p = c/n$. Furthermore, we show that our method can be extended to uniformly generate connected graphs $G(n, m)$ via an acceptance-rejection procedure.</description>

      <title>The Work Capacity of Channels with Memory: Maximum Extractable Work in Percept-Action Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting future observations plays a central role in machine learning, biology, economics, and many other fields. It lies at the heart of organizational principles such as the variational free energy principle and has even been shown -- based on the second law of thermodynamics -- to be necessary for reaching the fundamental energetic limits of sequential information processing. While the usefulness of the predictive paradigm is undisputed, complex adaptive systems that interact with their environment are more than just predictive machines: they have the power to act upon their environment and cause change. In this work, we develop a framework to analyze the thermodynamics of information processing in percept-action loops -- a model of agent-environment interaction -- allowing us to investigate the thermodynamic implications of actions and percepts on equal footing. To this end, we introduce the concept of work capacity -- the maximum rate at which an agent can expect to extract work from its environment. Our results reveal that neither of two previously established design principles for work-efficient agents -- maximizing predictive power and forgetting past actions -- remains optimal in environments where actions have observable consequences. Instead, a trade-off emerges: work-efficient agents must balance prediction and forgetting, as remembering past actions can reduce the available free energy. This highlights a fundamental departure from the thermodynamics of passive observation, suggesting that prediction and energy efficiency may be at odds in active learning systems.</description>

      <title>Channel Charting in Real-World Coordinates with Distributed MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel charting is an emerging self-supervised method that maps channel-state information (CSI) to a low-dimensional latent space (the channel chart) that represents pseudo-positions of user equipments (UEs). While channel charts preserve local geometry, i.e., nearby UEs are nearby in the channel chart (and vice versa), the pseudo-positions are in arbitrary coordinates and global geometry is typically not preserved. In order to embed channel charts in real-world coordinates, we first propose a bilateration loss for distributed multiple-input multiple-output (D-MIMO) wireless systems in which only the access point (AP) positions are known. The idea behind this loss is to compare the received power at pairs of APs to determine whether a UE should be placed closer to one AP or the other in the channel chart. We then propose a line-of-sight (LoS) bounding-box loss that places the UE in a predefined LoS area of each AP that is estimated to have a LoS path to the UE. We demonstrate the efficacy of combining both of these loss functions with neural-network-based channel charting using ray-tracing-based and measurement-based channel vectors. Our proposed approach outperforms several baselines and maintains the self-supervised nature of channel charting as it neither relies on geometrical propagation models nor on any ground-truth UE position information.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal Performance of Distributed Cell-Free Massive MIMO with LoS Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we revisit the performance analysis of distributed beamforming architectures in dense user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems in line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios. By incorporating a recently developed optimal distributed beamforming technique, called the team minimum mean square error (TMMSE) technique, we depart from previous studies that rely on suboptimal distributed beamforming approaches for LoS scenarios. Supported by extensive numerical simulations that follow 3GPP guidelines, we show that such suboptimal approaches may often lead to significant underestimation of the capabilities of distributed architectures, particularly in the presence of strong LoS paths. Considering the anticipated ultra-dense nature of cell-free mMIMO networks and the consequential high likelihood of strong LoS paths, our findings reveal that the team MMSE technique may significantly contribute in narrowing the performance gap between centralized and distributed architectures.</description>

      <title>Selfdual skew cyclic codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite extension $K/F$ of degree $r$ of a finite field $F$, we enumerate all selfdual skew cyclic codes in the Ore quotient ring $K[X;\text{Frob}]/(X^{rk}-1)$ for any positive integer $k$ coprime to the characteristic $p$ (separable case). We also provide an enumeration algorithm when $k$ is a power of $p$ (purely inseparable case), at the cost of some redundancies. Our approach is based on an explicit bijection between skew cyclic codes, on the one hand, and certain families of $F$-linear subspaces of some extensions of $K$. Finally, we report on an implementation in SageMath.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Holographic Beamforming via Dynamic Metasurface Antennas in QoS Guaranteed Power Efficient Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05659v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a power-efficient network for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMA)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) antenna systems. Power efficiency is achieved through holographic beamforming in a DMA-aided network, minimizing total transmission power while ensuring a guaranteed signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for multiple users in downlink. Unlike conventional MISO systems, which have well-explored beamforming solutions, DMA require specialized methods due to their unique physical constraints and wave-domain precoding capabilities. To achieve this, optimization algorithms relying on alternating optimization and semi-definite programming, are developed, including spherical-wave channel modelling of near-field communication. In this setup, the beamforming performance of DMA-aided precoding is analyzed in comparison to its optimal limits and traditional fully digital (FD) architectures, considering the effects of the Lorentzian constraints of metasurfaces and the degree of freedom (DoF) limitations due to a reduced number of RF chains. We demonstrate that the performance gap caused by DoF constraints becomes more significant as the number of users increases, highlighting the trade-offs of DMA in high-density wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Large Wireless Model (LWM): A Foundation Model for Wireless Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Large Wireless Model (LWM) -- the world's first foundation model for wireless channels. Designed as a task-agnostic model, LWM generates universal, rich, contextualized channel embeddings (features) that potentially enhance performance across a wide range of downstream tasks in wireless communication and sensing systems. Towards this objective, LWM, which has a transformer-based architecture, was pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on large-scale wireless channel datasets. Our results show consistent improvements in downstream tasks when using the LWM embeddings compared to raw channel representations, especially in scenarios with high-complexity machine learning tasks and limited training datasets. This LWM's ability to learn from large-scale wireless data opens a promising direction for intelligent systems that can efficiently adapt to diverse tasks with limited data, paving the way for addressing key challenges in wireless communication and sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Connecting the Unconnectable through Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable uplink connectivity remains a persistent challenge for IoT devices, particularly those at the cell edge, due to their limited transmit power and single-antenna configurations. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at connecting the unconnectable, leveraging real-time feedback from access points (APs) to enhance uplink coverage without increasing the energy consumption of IoT devices. At the core of this approach are feedback channel codes, which enable IoT devices to dynamically adapt their transmission strategies based on AP decoding feedback, thereby reducing the critical uplink SNR required for successful communication. Analytical models are developed to quantify the coverage probability and the number of connectable APs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Numerical results validate the proposed method, demonstrating substantial improvements in coverage range and connectivity, particularly for devices at the cell edge, with up to a 51% boost in connectable APs. Our approach offers a robust and energy-efficient solution to overcoming uplink coverage limitations, enabling IoT networks to connect devices in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Analysis of Multi-coding with Arbitrary Correlations Among the Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of non-orthogonal signals has several benefits over orthogonal signals in multi-coded communications. We provide a novel, theoretical study of non-orthogonal signaling to expand the applicability of these schemes. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or have equal correlation between vectors. Additionally, we show how Monte Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the integrals in the error probability calculation and derive low complexity upper bounds on the error probabilities.</description>

      <title>Grant-Free Random Access in Uplink LEO Satellite Communications with OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint device activity detection and channel estimation for grant-free random access in Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications. We consider uplink communications from multiple single-antenna terrestrial users to a LEO satellite equipped with a uniform planar array of multiple antennas, where orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation is adopted. To combat the severe Doppler shift, a transmission scheme is proposed, where the discrete prolate spheroidal basis expansion model (DPS-BEM) is introduced to reduce the number of unknown channel parameters. Then the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) algorithm is employed to approximate the minimum mean square error estimation of the channel, and the Markov random field is combined to capture the channel sparsity. Meanwhile, the expectation-maximization (EM) approach is integrated to learn the hyperparameters in priors. Finally, active devices are detected by calculating energy of the estimated channel. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of activity error rate and channel estimation precision.</description>

      <title>Unbounded Error Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional error-correcting codes (ECCs) assume a fixed message length, but many scenarios involve ongoing or indefinite transmissions where the message length is not known in advance. For example, when streaming a video, the user should be able to fix a fraction of errors that occurred before any point in time. We introduce unbounded error-correcting codes (unbounded codes), a natural generalization of ECCs that supports arbitrarily long messages without a predetermined length. An unbounded code with rate $R$ and distance $\varepsilon$ ensures that for every sufficiently large $k$, the message prefix of length $Rk$ can be recovered from the code prefix of length $k$ even if an adversary corrupts up to an $\varepsilon$ fraction of the symbols in this code prefix.
  We study unbounded codes over binary alphabets in the regime of small error fraction $\varepsilon$, establishing nearly tight upper and lower bounds on their optimal rate. Our main results show that: (1) The optimal rate of unbounded codes satisfies $R&lt;1-\Omega(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ and $R&gt;1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon \log \log(1/\varepsilon)})$. (2) Surprisingly, our construction is inherently non-linear, as we prove that linear unbounded codes achieve a strictly worse rate of $R=1-\Theta(\sqrt{\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon)})$. (3) In the setting of random noise, unbounded codes achieve the same optimal rate as standard ECCs, $R=1-\Theta(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))$.
  These results demonstrate fundamental differences between standard and unbounded codes.</description>
