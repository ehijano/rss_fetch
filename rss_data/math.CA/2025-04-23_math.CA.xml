      <title>The Assouad dimension of Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the structure of Kakeya sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We show that for every Kakeya set $K\subset\mathbb{R}^3$, there exist well-separated scales $0&lt;\delta&lt;\rho\leq 1$ so that the $\delta$ neighborhood of $K$ is almost as large as the $\rho$ neighborhood of $K$. As a consequence, every Kakeya set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has Assouad dimension 3 and every Ahlfors-David regular Kakeya set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has Hausdorff dimension 3. We also show that every Kakeya set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that has "stably equal" Hausdorff and packing dimension (this is a new notion, which is introduced to avoid certain obvious obstructions) must have Hausdorff dimension 3.
  The above results follow from certain multi-scale structure theorems for arrangements of tubes and rectangular prisms in three dimensions, and a mild generalization of the sticky Kakeya theorem previously proved by the authors.</description>

      <title>On Popoviciu's concept of convexity for functions of $d$ variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an integral representation for Popoviciu's convex functions of $d$ variables. This representation serves as a~foundation for deriving several functional inequalities, analogous to those well-known for usual convex functions. Our results generalize and extend the results obtained by S.~Gal, C.~Niculescu, B.~Gavrea, T.~Popoviciu, and others, who considered only differentiable functions of two variables. In contrast to other authors, we do not impose any additional regularity assumptions on the studied functions.</description>

      <title>A few identities and integrals involving Pochhammer symbol, Jacobi polynomials and hypergeometric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find some identities involving Pochhammer symbol (rising factorial) and apply them to find a closed form for some integrals of the Jacobi polynomials as well as a hypergeometric function multiplied by the product of Jacobi polynomial and the Beta density that makes this polynomial member of the family of orthogonal polynomials. In other words, we expand a hypergeometric function in an orthogonal series of Jacobi polynomials.</description>

      <title>On weighted Ces\`{a}ro function spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive demonstration of recent results regarding the structures of the weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces. These spaces' definitions involve local and global weighted Lebesgue norms; in other words, the norms of these spaces are generated by positive sublinear operators and by weighted Lebesgue norms. The weighted Lebesgue spaces are the special cases of these spaces with a specific set of parameters.
  Our primary method of investigating these spaces will be the so-called discretization technique. Our technique will be the development of the approach initiated by K.G. Grosse-Erdmann, which allows us to obtain the characterization in previously unavailable situations, thereby addressing decades-old open problems.
  We investigate the relation (embeddings) between weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces. The characterization of these embeddings can be used to tackle the problems of characterizing pointwise multipliers between weighted Ces\`aro and Copson function spaces, the characterizations of the associate spaces of Ces\`aro (Copson) function spaces, as well as the relations between local Morrey-type spaces.</description>
