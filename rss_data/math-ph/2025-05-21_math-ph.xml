      <title>Unified Structural Embedding of Orbifold Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified structural embedding framework for orbifold sigma models that systematically incorporates twisted sectors, singularities, and smooth regions into a single algebraic object. Traditional approaches to orbifold theories often treat sectors separately, requiring ad hoc regularizations near singularities and failing to capture inter-sector interactions under renormalization group flow. The framework presented herein resolves these limitations through the construction of a unified orbifold algebra $\mathcal{A}(X/G)$ that decomposes canonically into idempotent-projected components corresponding to conjugacy classes of the finite group $G$ acting on the target space $X$. A generalized Laplacian operator is defined on this algebra, enabling the construction of a one-parameter family of renormalization group compatible endomorphisms that preserve the sector structure while implementing scale transformations. The formalism is shown to recover conventional sigma model results in the smooth limit where $G$ approaches the trivial group, with the internal renormalization group derivation reducing to the standard one-loop beta function proportional to the Ricci tensor. Several examples demonstrate the framework's utility, including explicit calculations for the $\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold that exhibit the decomposition into untwisted and twisted field contributions. This approach provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for quantum field theories on singular spaces while maintaining compatibility with established results for smooth manifolds.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Lie-Hamilton systems: $t$-Dependent curved oscillators and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lie-Hamilton approach for $t$-dependent Hamiltonians is extended to cover the so-called nonlinear Lie-Hamilton systems, which are no longer related to a linear $t$-dependent combination of a basis of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra of functions $\mathcal{W}$, but an arbitrary $t$-dependent function on $\mathcal{W}$. This novel formalism is accomplished through a detailed analysis of related structures, such as momentum maps and generalized distributions, together with the extension of the Poisson coalgebra method to a $t$-dependent frame, in order to systematize the construction of constants of the motion for nonlinear systems. Several relevant relations between nonlinear Lie-Hamilton systems, Lie-Hamilton systems, and collective Hamiltonians are analyzed. The new notions and tools are illustrated with the study of the harmonic oscillator, H\'enon-Heiles systems and Painlev\'e trascendents within a $t$-dependent framework. In addition, the formalism is carefully applied to construct oscillators with a $t$-dependent frequency and Kepler-Coulomb systems with a $t$-dependent coupling constant on the $n$-dimensional sphere, Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, as well as on some spaces of non-constant curvature.</description>

      <title>Remarks on orthogonality spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two results. The first gives a finite graph constructed from consideration of mutually unbiased bases that occurs as a subgraph of the orthogonality space of $\mathbb{C}^3$ but not of that of $\mathbb{R}^3$. The second is a companion result to the result of Tau and Tserunyan \cite{Tau} that every countable graph occurs as an induced subgraph of the orthogonality space of a Hilbert space. We show that every finite graph occurs as an induced subgraph of the orthogonality space of a finite orthomodular lattice and that every graph occurs as an induced subgraph of the orthogonality space of some atomic orthomodular lattice.</description>

      <title>A novel variant of rhombic Penrose tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel variant of a planar quasiperiodic tiling with tenfold symmetry, employing the same thick and thin rhombuses as the celebrated rhombic Penrose tiling. Despite its distinct visual appearance, this new tiling shares several key features with its predecessor, including similar vertex environments, polygonal acceptance domains based on regular pentagons, and an inflation/deflation symmetry associated with the golden mean as its fundamental scaling ratio. Additional complexities arise from an increased number of prototiles and a dual grid pattern that incorporates folded lines alongside ordinary straight lines. This tiling exhibits a high density of a compact decagonal motif forming a two-tiered, five-petaled flower pattern, which spans a substantial portion of the tiling. We identify a slightly enhanced degree of hyperuniform order compared to the standard rhombic Penrose tiling.</description>

      <title>On the Mathematical Theory of Quantum Stochastic Filtering Equations for Mixed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum filtering equations for mixed states were developed in 80th of the last century. Since then the problem of building a rigorous mathematical theory for these equations in the basic infinite-dimensional settings has been a challenging open mathematical problem. In a previous paper, the author developed the theory of these equations in the case of bounded coupling operators, including a new version that arises as the law of large numbers for interacting particles under continuous observation and thus leading to the theory of quantum mean field games. In this paper, the main body of these results is extended to the basic cases of unbounded coupling operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present twistor BV actions that encompasses many classically consistent bosonic holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories with vanishing cosmological constant. Upon quantization, these actions are shown to be quantum consistent, i.e. no gauge anomaly, for some subclasses of twistorial higher-spin theories. Anomaly-free twistorial theories can be identified through an index theorem, which is a higher-spin extension of the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch index theorem. We also discuss the anomaly cancellation mechanisms on twistor space to render anomalous theories quantum consistent at one loop.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the coupling of pairs of reverse plane partitions of the same shape by assigning a certain local interaction between the reverse plane partitions. We show that they are in bijection with a certain Yang-Baxter integrable colored vertex model. By utilizing the Yang-Baxter equation for this colored vertex model, we are able to compute the generating function for the interacting pairs of reverse plane partitions. We also give a bijection between the coupled pairs of reverse plane partitions with the interaction strength set to zero and a single reverse plane partition of the same shape.</description>

Abstract: Smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equation with smooth but otherwise unconstrained initial conditions are constructed, to solve the Millennium fluids problem in the positive. The smooth solutions are the mean values of general weak solutions and are alternately characterized as the entropy production minimizing solutions.

      <title>On the existence of noncommutative Levi-Civita connections in derivation based calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of Levi-Civita connections, i.e torsion free connections compatible with a hermitian form, in the setting of derivation based noncommutative differential calculi over $\ast$-algebras. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of Levi-Civita connections in terms of the image of an operator derived from the hermitian form. Moreover, we identify a necessary symmetry condition on the hermitian form that extends the classical notion of metric symmetry in Riemannian geometry. The theory is illustrated with explicit computations for free modules of rank three, including noncommutative 3-tori. We note that our approach is algebraic and does not rely on analytic tools such as $C^\ast$-algebra norms.</description>

      <title>An Ode to the Penrose and Witten transforms in Twistor space for 3D CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we discuss the construction of Sp$(4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant objects in the twistor space for three dimensional conformal field theories. The Sp$(4;\mathbb{R})$ invariant projective delta function, alongside the Twistor symplectic dot product invariants form the basis for conformal Wightman functions involving conserved currents and $\Delta=1$ scalars. For correlators involving scalars with $\Delta\ne 1$, generic spinning primaries and parity odd correlators we show that the infinity twistor of $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$ must be incorporated into the analysis. We show that this feature can be traced to the Penrose and Witten transforms of these operators that we derive. We then discuss the super-twistor space construction and derive the supersymmetric Penrose transform for $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories using the Fourier transform and the supersymmetric Witten transform. We construct OSp$(\mathcal{N}|4;\mathbb{R})$ invariants and its application to several super-Wightman functions. Similar to the non supersymmetric case, we find an important role played by the (super) infinity twistor which we exemplify through parity odd super-correlators and a supersymmetric contact term.</description>

      <title>Linearized renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an infinitesimal approach, this work addresses the renormalization problem to deal with the ultraviolet divergences arising in quantum field theory. Under the assumption that the action has already been renormalized to yield an ultraviolet-finite effective action that satisfies a certain set of renormalization conditions, we analyze how the action must be adjusted to reproduce a first-order change in these renormalization conditions. The analysis then provides the change that is induced on the correlation functions of the theory. This program is successfully carried out in the case of super-renormalizable theories, namely, a scalar field with cubic interaction in four space-time dimensions and with quartic interaction in three space-time dimensions. Relying on existing results in the theory of perturbative renormalization, we derive explicit renormalized expressions for these theories, each of which involves only a finite number of graphs constructed with full propagators and full $n$-point vertices. The renormalizable case is analyzed as well; the derived expressions are ultraviolet finite as the regulator is removed but cannot be written without a regulator. In this sense, the renormalization is not fully explicit in the renormalizable case. Nevertheless, a perturbative solution of the equations starting from the free theory provides the renormalized Feynman graphs, similar to the BPHZ program. For compatibility with the preservation of the renormalization conditions, a projective renormalization scheme, as opposed to a minimal one, is also introduced. The ideas developed are extended to the study of the renormalization of composite operators and the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ consisting of a compact metrizable space $X$ and a homeomorphism $f \colon X \to X$, an endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is a continuous map of $X$ into itself which commutes with $f$. One says that a dynamical system $(X,f)$ is surjunctive if every injective endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is surjective. An endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is called pre-injective if its restriction to each $f$-homoclinicity class of $X$ is injective. One says that a dynamical system has the Moore property if every surjective endomorphism of the system is pre-injective and that it has the Myhill property if every pre-injective endomorphism is surjective. One says that a dynamical system satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem if it has both the Moore and the Myhill properties. We prove that every irreducible Smale space satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem and that every non-wandering Smale space is surjunctive and has the Moore property.</description>

      <title>Orientation Reversal and the Chern-Simons Natural Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the fundamental property of preservation of relations, underlying resurgent analysis, provides a new perspective on crossing a natural boundary, an important general problem in theoretical and mathematical physics. This reveals a deeper rigidity of resurgence in a quantum field theory. We study the non-perturbative completion of complex Chern-Simons theory that associates to a 3-manifold a collection of $q$-series invariants labeled by Spin$^c$ structures, for which crossing the natural boundary corresponds to orientation reversal of the 3-manifold. Our new resurgent perspective leads to a practical numerical algorithm that generates $q$-series which are dual to unary $q$-series composed of false theta functions. Until recently, these duals were only known in a limited number of cases, essentially based on Ramanujan's mock theta functions, and the common belief was that the more general duals might not even exist. Resurgence analysis identifies as primary objects Mordell integrals: transforms of resurgent functions. Their unique Borel summed transseries decomposition on either side of the Stokes line is the unique decomposition into real and imaginary parts. The latter are combinations of unary $q$-series in terms of $q$ and its modular counterpart $\tilde{q}$, and are resurgent by construction. The Mordell integral is analytic across the natural boundary of the $q$ and $\tilde{q}$ series, and uniqueness of a similar decomposition which preserves algebraic relations on the other side of the boundary defines the unique boundary crossing of the $q$ series. This continuation can be efficiently implemented numerically. This identifies known unique mock modular identities, and extends well beyond. The resurgent approach reveals new aspects, and is very different from other approaches based on indefinite theta series, Appell-Lerch sums, and logarithmic vertex operator algebras.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Decay Estimates for periodic Jacobi operators on the half-line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish dispersive time-decay estimates for periodic Jacobi operators on the discrete half-line, $\N$. Specifically, we prove $t^{-1/2}$ decay in the weighted $\ell^\infty_{-1}$ norm for all such operators. For the global $\ell^1 \to \ell^\infty$ decay estimate, we show that $t^{-1/3}$ decay holds under a nondegeneracy condition on the discriminant. Alternatively, for any even period $q\geq2$, if the continuous spectrum consists of exactly $q$ disjoint intervals (bands), we obtain a $t^{-1/(q+1)}$ decay rate without any further assumptions.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion stacking in stray field-coupled ultrathin ferromagnetic multilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the energy landscape of ferromagnetic multilayer
  heterostructures that feature magnetic skyrmions -- tiny whirls of
  spins with non-trivial topology -- in each magnetic layer. Such
  magnetic heterostructures have been recently pursued as possible
  hosts of room temperature stable magnetic skyrmions suitable for the
  next generation of low power information technologies and
  unconventional computing. The presence of stacked skyrmions in the
  adjacent layers gives rise to a strongly coupled nonlinear system,
  whereby the induced magnetic field plays a crucial stabilizing
  role. Starting with the micromagnetic modeling framework, we derive
  a general reduced energy functional for a fixed number of ultrathin
  ferromagnetic layers with perpendicular magnetocrystalline
  anisotropy. We next investigate this energy functional in the regime
  in which the energy is dominated by the intralayer exchange
  interaction and formally obtain a finite-dimensional description
  governed by the energy of a system of one skyrmion per layer as a
  function of the position, radius and the rotation angle of each of
  theses skyrmions. For the latter, we prove that energy minimizers
  exist for all fixed skyrmion locations. We then focus on the
  simplest case of stray field-coupled ferromagnetic bilayers and
  completely characterize the energy minimizers. We show that the
  global energy minimizers exist and consist of two stray
  field-stabilized N\'eel skyrmions with antiparallel in-plane
  magnetization components. We also calculate the energy of two
  skyrmions of equal radius as a function of their separation
  distance.</description>

      <title>General Construction of Bra-Ket Formalism for Identical Particle Systems in Rigged Hilbert Space Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study discussed Dirac's bra-ket formalism for the identical particles system based on the rigged Hilbert space reformulated by R. Madrid [J. Phys A:Math. Gen. 37, 8129 (2004)]. The bra and ket vectors for a composite system that form the basis of an identical particle system are described in dual and anti-dual spaces for the tensor product of rigged Hilbert spaces. The permutation operator that characterizes the symmetry of identical particles is constructed as the operator on such dual spaces. We also show that the nuclear spectral theorem in the tensor product of rigged Hilbert spaces endows the spectral expansion of the self-adjoint operator in the dual and anti-dual spaces and the expansion is consistent with the identicle particle system when the permutation operator commutes the self-adjoint operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the generating function $C_N(A)$, which enumerates classical closed random walks on square and triangular lattices with $N$ steps and a signed area $A$, characterized by the number of moves in each hopping direction. This enumeration problem is mapped to the trace of powers of anisotropic Hofstadter-like Hamiltonian and is connected to the cluster coefficients of exclusion particles: exclusion strength parameter $g = 2$ for square lattice walks, and a mixture of $g = 1$ and $g = 2$ for triangular lattice walks. By leveraging the intrinsic link between the Hofstadter model and high energy physics, we propose a conjecture connecting the above signed area enumeration $C_N(A)$ in statistical mechanics to the quantum A-period of associated toric Calabi-Yau threefold in topological string theory: square lattice walks correspond to local $\mathbb{F}_0$ geometry, while triangular lattice walks are associated with local $\mathcal{B}_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Introducing and varying parameters in such systems leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossing a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters. As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the "topology breaks down". We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka. winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These realize the lower bound on the number of Dirac points necessary obtained from viewing them as local charges. We treat several concrete models and show that they have the predicted generic behavior. In particular, we focus on different types of lattices and tight-binding models, and show that effective winding maps, and thus higher Chern numbers, can be achieved using k-th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. Our study includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices.</description>

      <title>Variational formulations of transport on combinatorial meshes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop analogues of the primal and mixed variational formulations of the conservation laws describing transport of scalar physical properties for topological spaces referred to as cell complexes. The development is restricted to cell complexes with cells having connectivity of simple polytopes. Such spaces are suitable representations of physical systems composed of elements of different apparent topological dimensions, where all elements might have individual properties, and elements of a given dimension might interact via common elements of lower dimensions. This modelling foundation can be considered as intermediate between the foundation for particle-based modelling, which is the discrete topology, and the foundation for continuum modelling, which is the smooth topology. The new foundation offers advantages for the analysis of the behaviour of physical systems with complex internal structures. The development is based on a calculus with combinatorial differential forms which is a discrete analogue of the smooth exterior calculus with differential forms. We call the resulting calculus combinatorial mesh calculus (CMC) as it is based on combinatorial meshes, for which embedding is forgotten and only the connectivity between cells and measures of the cells are used in calculations. We discuss how the obtained formulation is specialised for several different problems, including mass diffusion, heat conduction, fluid flow in porous media, and charge diffusion, and provide details about the formulation of initial boundary value problems for these transport cases. Examples and results for selected boundary value problems are given to demonstrate the capabilities of the CMC formulations.</description>

Abstract: The 2023 second edition of a 2006 encyclopedia article on mathematical aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes (QFTCST). Section-titles (with new sections indicated with stars) are: Introduction and preliminaries, Construction of a $*$-algebra for a real linear scalar field on globally hyperbolic spacetimes and some general theorems, *More about (quasifree) Hadamard states, Particle creation and the limitations of the particle concept, Theory of the stress-energy tensor, *More about the intersection of QFTCST with AQFT and the Fewster-Verch No-Go Theorem, Hawking and Unruh effects, *More about (classical and) quantum fields on black hole backgrounds, Non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes and the time-machine question, *More about QFT on non-globally hyperbolic spacetimes, Other related topics and some warnings. The article contains many references. It also includes a review of, and also compares and contrasts, recent results on the implications of QFTCST for the question of the instability of three sorts of Cauchy horizon -- first those inside black holes such as especially Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter and Kerr-de Sitter, second the compactly generated Cauchy horizons of spacetimes in which time-machines get manufactured, and third the Cauchy horizon of the spacetime which is believed to describe evaporating black holes and which underlies (one version of) the black hole information-loss puzzle.</description>

      <title>Extracting topological orders of generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11170v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an algorithm for extracting topological data from translation invariant generalized Pauli stabilizer codes in two-dimensional systems, focusing on the analysis of anyon excitations and string operators. The algorithm applies to $\mathbb{Z}_d$ qudits, including instances where $d$ is a nonprime number. This capability allows the identification of topological orders that differ from the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric codes. It extends our understanding beyond the established theorem that Pauli stabilizer codes for $\mathbb{Z}_p$ qudits (with $p$ being a prime) are equivalent to finite copies of $\mathbb{Z}_p$ toric codes and trivial stabilizers. The algorithm is designed to determine all anyons and their string operators, enabling the computation of their fusion rules, topological spins, and braiding statistics. The method converts the identification of topological orders into computational tasks, including Gaussian elimination, the Hermite normal form, and the Smith normal form of truncated Laurent polynomials. Furthermore, the algorithm provides a systematic approach for studying quantum error-correcting codes. We apply it to various codes, such as self-dual CSS quantum codes modified from the 2d honeycomb color code and non-CSS quantum codes that contain the double semion topological order or the six-semion topological order.</description>

      <title>About the Moments of the Generalized Ulam Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05860v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given $\pi \in S_n$, let $Z_{n,k}(\pi)=\sum_{1\leq i_1&lt;\dots&lt;i_k\leq n} \mathbf{1}(\{ \pi_{i_1}&lt;\dots&lt;\pi_{i_k}\}$ denote the number of increasing subsequences of length $k$. Consider the "generalized Ulam problem," studying the distribution of $Z_{n,k}$ for general $k$ and $n$. For the 2nd moment, Ross Pinsky initiated a combinatorial study by considering a pair of subsequences $i^{(r)}_1&lt;\dots&lt;i^{(r)}_k$ for $r \in \{1,2\}$, and conditioning on the size of the intersection $j = |\{i_1^{(1)},\dots,i^{(1)}_k\} \cap \{i^{(2)}_1,\dots,i^{(2)}_k\}|$. We obtain the exact large deviation rate function for $\mathbf{E}[Z_{n,k} Z_{n,\ell}]$ in the asymptotic regime $k\sim \kappa n^{1/2}$, $\ell \sim \lambda n^{1/2}$ as $n \to \infty$, for $\kappa,\lambda \in (0,\infty)$. This uses multivariate generating function techniques, as found in the textbook of Pemantle and Wilson. The requisite generating function enumerates pairs of up-right paths in $d=2$, which both end at $(k,\ell)$ with a given number of intersections. We also evaluate the analogous generating function for pairs of $(+\boldsymbol{i},+\boldsymbol{j},+\boldsymbol{k})$ paths in $d=3$, which both end at $(k,\ell,m)$, which has some utility in calculating the 3rd moment. Finally, we consider a simpler problem involving partitions instead of permutations, where all moments are calculable and the replica symmetric ansatz can be stated if not proved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to constructing gravitational instantons based on the observation that the gravitational action of general relativity in its teleparallel formulation can be expressed as a product of the torsion and excitation forms. We introduce a new class of solutions where these two forms are equal, which we term the self-excited instantons, and advocate for their use over the self-dual instantons of Eguchi and Hanson. These new self-excited instantons exhibit striking similarities to BPST instantons in Yang-Mills theory, as their action reduces to a topological Nieh-Yan term, which allows us to identify the axial torsion as a topological current and show that the gravitational action is given by a topological charge.</description>

Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

We show that if $\mu$ is the cascade measure generated by a sub-exponential random variable then \[\dim_F\mu=\min\{2,\dim_2\mu\}\,,\] where $\dim_2\mu$ is the correlation dimension of $\mu$ and it has an explicit formula.
  For cascades on the circle $S\subset\mathbb{R}^2$, we obtain \[\dim_F\mu\ge\frac{\dim_2\mu}{2+\dim_2\mu}\,.\]</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced entanglement and complexity in random constant-depth 2D quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the entanglement structure of states generated by random constant-depth two-dimensional quantum circuits, followed by projective measurements of a subset of sites. By deriving a rigorous lower bound on the average entanglement entropy of such post-measurement states, we prove that macroscopic long-ranged entanglement is generated above some constant critical depth in several natural classes of circuit architectures, which include brickwork circuits and random holographic tensor networks. This behaviour had been conjectured based on previous works, which utilize non-rigorous methods such as replica theory calculations, or work in regimes where the local Hilbert space dimension grows with system size. To establish our lower bound, we develop new replica-free theoretical techniques that leverage tools from multi-user quantum information theory, which are of independent interest, allowing us to map the problem onto a statistical mechanics model of self-avoiding walks without requiring large local Hilbert space dimension. Our findings have consequences for the complexity of classically simulating sampling from random shallow circuits, and of contracting tensor networks: First, we show that standard algorithms based on matrix product states which are used for both these tasks will fail above some constant depth and bond dimension, respectively. In addition, we also prove that these random constant-depth quantum circuits cannot be simulated by any classical circuit of sublogarithmic depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute families of solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations of the type of Brill waves, but with slow fall-off towards spatial infinity. We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for physical data and numerically construct some representative solutions. We numerically construct an explicit example with slow-off which does not exhibit antipodal symmetry at spatial infinity.</description>

      <title>Dark states in an integrable XY central spin model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eigenstates of central spin models in which the central spin is unentangled with the environment are known as dark states. They have recently been observed in a class of integrable XX models. Here we find that dark states are present in XY models, but only for particular configurations of the central spin magnetic field. We show this via an explicit construction of the Bethe states.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials in the spherical ensemble with two insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider asymptotics of planar orthogonal polynomials $P_{n,N}$ (where $\mathrm{deg}P_{n,N}=n$) with respect to the weight $$\frac{|z-w|^{2NQ_1}}{(1+|z|^2)^{N(1+Q_0+Q_1)+1}}, \quad(Q_0,Q_1 &gt; 0)$$ in the whole complex plane. With $n, N\rightarrow\infty$ and $N-n$ fixed, we obtain the strong asymptotics of the polynomials, asymptotics for the weighted $L^2$ norm and the limiting zero counting measure. These results apply to the pre-critical phase of the underlying two-dimensional Coulomb gas system, when the support of the equilibrium measure is simply connected. Our method relies on specifying the mother body of the two-dimensional potential problem. It relies too on the fact that the planar orthogonality can be rewritten as a non-Hermitian contour orthogonality. This allows us to perform the Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis of the associated $2\times 2$ Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>
