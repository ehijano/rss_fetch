      <title>Rock Classification through Knowledge-Enhanced Deep Learning: A Hybrid Mineral-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated rock classification from mineral composition presents a significant challenge in geological applications, with critical implications for material recycling, resource management, and industrial processing. While existing methods using One dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) excel at mineral identification through Raman spectroscopy, the crucial step of determining rock types from mineral assemblages remains unsolved, particularly because the same minerals can form different rock types depending on their proportions and formation conditions. This study presents a novel knowledge-enhanced deep learning approach that integrates geological domain expertise with spectral analysis. The performance of five machine learning methods were evaluated out of which the 1D-CNN and its uncertainty-aware variant demonstrated excellent mineral classification performance (98.37+-0.006% and 97.75+-0.010% respectively). The integrated system's evaluation on rock samples revealed variable performance across lithologies, with optimal results for limestone classification but reduced accuracy for rocks sharing similar mineral assemblages. These findings not only show critical challenges in automated geological classification systems but also provide a methodological framework for advancing material characterization and sorting technologies.</description>

      <title>AlphaQuanter: An End-to-End Tool-Orchestrated Agentic Reinforcement Learning Framework for Stock Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents show promise in automated trading, they still face critical limitations. Prominent multi-agent frameworks often suffer from inefficiency, produce inconsistent signals, and lack the end-to-end optimization required to learn a coherent strategy from market feedback. To address this, we introduce AlphaQuanter, a single-agent framework that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to learn a dynamic policy over a transparent, tool-augmented decision workflow, which empowers a single agent to autonomously orchestrate tools and proactively acquire information on demand, establishing a transparent and auditable reasoning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlphaQuanter achieves state-of-the-art performance on key financial metrics. Moreover, its interpretable reasoning reveals sophisticated strategies, offering novel and valuable insights for human traders. Our code for data acquisition and agent training is publicly available at: https://github.com/AlphaQuanter/AlphaQuanter</description>

      <title>A Structured Neural ODE Approach for Real Time Evaluation of AC Losses in 3D Superconducting Tapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient modeling of High Temperature Superconductors (HTS) is crucial for real-time quench monitoring; however, full-order electromagnetic simulations remain prohibitively costly due to the strong nonlinearities. Conventional reduced-order methods, such as the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM), alleviate this cost but are limited by intrusive implementation and by the need for many interpolation points. This work investigates reduced-order strategies for Integral Equation Method (IEM) of HTS systems. We present the first application of POD-DEIM to IEM-based HTS models, and introduce a Structured Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) approach that learns nonlinear dynamics directly in the reduced space. Benchmark results show that the Neural ODE outperforms POD-DEIM in both efficiency and accuracy, highlighting its potential for real-time superconducting simulations.</description>

      <title>MetaBench: A Multi-task Benchmark for Assessing LLMs in Metabolomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized. Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways, heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics research.</description>

      <title>LLM-guided Chemical Process Optimization with a Multi-Agent Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical process optimization maximizes production efficiency and economic performance, but optimization algorithms, including gradient-based solvers, numerical methods, and parameter grid searches, become impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable. We present a multi-agent LLM framework that autonomously infers operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then collaboratively guides optimization. Our AutoGen-based framework employs OpenAI's o3 model with specialized agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation, and optimization guidance. Through autonomous constraint generation and iterative multi-agent optimization, the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational bounds. Validated on hydrodealkylation across cost, yield, and yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework achieved competitive performance with conventional methods while reducing wall-time 31-fold relative to grid search, converging in under 20 minutes. The reasoning-guided search demonstrates sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs and applying domain-informed heuristics. Unlike conventional methods requiring predefined constraints, our approach uniquely combines autonomous constraint generation with interpretable parameter exploration. Model comparison reveals reasoning-capable architectures (o3, o1) are essential for successful optimization, while standard models fail to converge. This approach is particularly valuable for emerging processes and retrofit applications where operational constraints are poorly characterized or unavailable.</description>

      <title>A stabilized Two-Step Formulation of Maxwell's Equations in the time-domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating electromagnetic fields across broad frequency ranges is challenging due to numerical instabilities at low frequencies. This work extends a stabilized two-step formulation of Maxwell's equations to the time-domain. Using a Galerkin discretization in space, we apply two different time-discretization schemes that are tailored to the first- and second-order in time partial differential equations of the two-step solution procedure used here. To address the low-frequency instability, we incorporate a generalized tree-cotree gauge that removes the singularity of the curl-curl operator, ensuring robustness even in the static limit. Numerical results on academic and application-oriented 3D problems confirm stability, accuracy, and the method's applicability to nonlinear, temperature-dependent materials.</description>
