      <title>Constant congestion linkages in polynomially strong digraphs in polynomial time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given integers $k,c &gt; 0$, we say that a digraph $D$ is $(k,c)$-linked if for every pair of ordered sets $\{s_1, \ldots, s_k\}$ and $\{t_1, \ldots, t_k\}$ of vertices of $D$, there are $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ such that for $i \in [k]$ each $P_i$ is a path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ and every vertex of $D$ appears in at most $c$ of those paths. Thomassen [Combinatorica, 1991] showed that for every fixed $k \geq 2$ there is no integer $p$ such that every $p$-strong digraph is $(k,1)$-linked. Edwards et al. [ESA, 2017] showed that every digraph $D$ with directed treewidth at least some function $f(k)$ contains a large bramble of congestion $2$ and that every $(36k^3 + 2k)$-strong digraph containing a bramble of congestion $2$ and size roughly $188k^3$ is $(k,2)$-linked. Since the directed treewidth of a digraph has to be at least its strong connectivity, this implies that there is a function $L(k)$ such that every $L(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,2)$-linked. This result was improved by Campos et al. [ESA, 2023], who showed that any $k$-strong digraph containing a bramble of size at least $2k(c\cdot k -c + 2) + c(k-1)$ and congestion $c$ is $(k,c)$-linked. Regarding the bramble, although the given bound on $f(k)$ is very large, Masa\v{r}\'{\i}k et al. [SIDMA, 2022] showed that directed treewidth $\mathcal{O}(k^{48}\log^{13} k)$ suffices if the congestion is relaxed to $8$. We first show how to drop the dependence on $c$, for even $c$, on the size of the bramble that is needed in the work of Campos et al. [ESA, 2023]. Then, by making two local changes in the proof of Masa\v{r}\'{\i}k et al. [SIDMA, 2022] we show how to build in polynomial time a bramble of size $k$ and congestion $8$ assuming that a large obstruction to directed treewidth (namely, a path system) is given. Applying these results, we show that there is a polynomial function $g(k)$ such that every $g(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,8)$-linked.</description>

      <title>Random local access for sampling k-SAT solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sublinear time algorithm that gives random local access to the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments to an arbitrary k-CNF formula $\Phi$, at exponential clause density. Our algorithm provides memory-less query access to variable assignments, such that the output variable assignments consistently emulate a single global satisfying assignment whose law is close to the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments to $\Phi$.
  Such models were formally defined (for the more general task of locally sampling from exponentially sized sample spaces) in 2017 by Biswas, Rubinfeld, and Yodpinyanee, who studied the analogous problem for the uniform distribution over proper q-colorings. This model extends a long line of work over multiple decades that studies sublinear time algorithms for problems in theoretical computer science. Random local access and related models have been studied for a wide variety of natural Gibbs distributions and random graphical processes. Here, we establish feasiblity of random local access models for one of the most canonical such sample spaces, the set of satisfying assignments to a k-CNF formula.</description>

      <title>RCM++:Reverse Cuthill-McKee ordering with Bi-Criteria Node Finder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) algorithm is a graph-based method for reordering sparse matrices, renowned for its effectiveness in minimizing matrix bandwidth and profile. This reordering enhances the efficiency of matrix operations, making RCM pivotal among reordering algorithms. In the context of executing the RCM algorithm, it is often necessary to select a starting node from the graph representation of the matrix. This selection allows the execution of BFS (Breadth-First Search) to construct the level structure. The choice of this starting node significantly impacts the algorithm's performance, necessitating a heuristic approach to identify an optimal starting node, commonly referred to as the RCM starting node problem. Techniques such as the minimum degree method and George-Liu (GL) algorithm are popular solutions.
  This paper introduces a novel algorithm addressing the RCM starting node problem by considering both the eccentricity and the width of the node during the run. Integrating this algorithm with the RCM algorithm, we introduce RCM++. Experimental results demonstrate that RCM++ outperforms existing RCM methods in major software libraries, achieving higher quality results with comparable computation time. This advancement fosters the further application and development of the RCM algorithm.The code related to this research has been made available at https://github.com/SStan1/RCM\_PP.git.</description>

      <title>Improving the Parameter Dependency for High-Multiplicity Scheduling on Uniform Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address scheduling problems on uniform machines with high-multiplicity encoding, introducing a divide and conquer approach to assess the feasibility of a general Load Balancing Problem (LBP). Via reductions, our algorithm can also solve the more well-known problems $Q\|C_{\max}$ (makespan minimization), $Q\|C_{\min}$ (santa claus) and $Q\|C_{\text{envy}}$ (envy minimization). State-of-the-art algorithms for these problems, e.g. by Knop et al. (Math.\ Program.\ '23), have running times with parameter dependency $p_{\max}^{O(d^2)}$, where $p_{\max}$ is the largest processing time and $d$ is the number of different processing times. We partially answer the question asked by Kouteck\'y and Zink (ISAAC'20) about whether this quadratic dependency of $d$ can be improved to a linear one: Under the natural assumption that the machines are similar in a way that $s_{\max}/s_{\min} \leq p_{\max}^{O(1)}$ and $\tau\leq p_{\max}^{O(1)}$, our proposed algorithm achieves parameter dependency $p_{\max}^{O(d)}$ for the problems ${Q\|\{C_{\max},C_{\min},C_{\text{envy}}\}}$. Here, $\tau$ is the number of distinct machine speeds. Even without this assumption, our running times achieve a state-of-the-art parameter dependency and do so with an entirely different approach.</description>

      <title>FPT Algorithms using Minimal Parameters for a Generalized Version of Maximin Shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the computational complexity of fairly allocating indivisible, mixed-manna items. For basic measures of fairness, this problem is hard in general. Thus, research has flourished concerning input classes where efficient algorithms exist, both for the purpose of establishing theoretical boundaries and for the purpose of designing practical algorithms for real-world instances. Notably, the paradigm of fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) has lead to new insights and improved algorithms for a variety of fair allocation problems; see, for example, Bleim et al. (IJCAI 16), Aziz et al. (AAAI 17), Bredereck et al. (EC 19) and Kulkarni et al. (EC 21).
  Our focus is the fairness measure maximin shares (MMS). Motivated by the general non-existence of MMS allocations, Aziz et al. (AAAI 17) studied optimal MMS allocations, namely solutions that achieve the best $\alpha$-approximation for the maximin share value of every agent. These allocations are guaranteed to exist, prompting the important open question of whether optimal MMS allocations can be computed efficiently. We answer this question affirmatively by providing FPT algorithms to output optimal MMS allocations. Furthermore, our techniques extend to find allocations that optimize alternative objectives, such as minimizing the additive approximation, and maximizing some variants of global welfare.
  In fact, all our algorithms are designed for a more general MMS problem in machine scheduling. Here, each mixed-manna item (job) must be assigned to an agent (machine) and has a processing time and a deadline. We develop efficient algorithms running in FPT time. Formally, we present polynomial time algorithms w.r.t. the input size times some function dependent on the parameters that yield optimal maximin-value approximations (among others) when parameterized by a set of natural parameters</description>

      <title>Faster Sampling from Log-Concave Densities over Polytopes via Efficient Linear Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling from a log-concave distribution $\pi(\theta) \propto e^{-f(\theta)}$ constrained to a polytope $K:=\{\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d: A\theta \leq b\}$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times d}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$.The fastest-known algorithm \cite{mangoubi2022faster} for the setting when $f$ is $O(1)$-Lipschitz or $O(1)$-smooth runs in roughly $O(md \times md^{\omega -1})$ arithmetic operations, where the $md^{\omega -1}$ term arises because each Markov chain step requires computing a matrix inversion and determinant (here $\omega \approx 2.37$ is the matrix multiplication constant). We present a nearly-optimal implementation of this Markov chain with per-step complexity which is roughly the number of non-zero entries of $A$ while the number of Markov chain steps remains the same. The key technical ingredients are 1) to show that the matrices that arise in this Dikin walk change slowly, 2) to deploy efficient linear solvers that can leverage this slow change to speed up matrix inversion by using information computed in previous steps, and 3) to speed up the computation of the determinantal term in the Metropolis filter step via a randomized Taylor series-based estimator.</description>

      <title>MATWA: A Web Toolkit for Matching under Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matching markets, where agents are assigned to one another based on preferences and capacity constraints, are pervasive in various domains. This paper introduces MATWA (https://matwa.optimalmatching.com), a web application offering a rich collection of algorithms for fundamental problem models involving matching under preferences. MATWA provides results and visualizations of matching algorithm outputs based on different methods for providing problem instances. In this paper, we describe the features of the system, illustrating its usage for different problem models, and outlining the algorithm implementations that are supported. We also give evidence of usability testing and illustrate how the system was used to obtain new empirical results for a specific matching problem. MATWA is intended to be a resource for the community of researchers in the area of matching under preferences, supporting experimentation as well as aiding the understanding of matching algorithms.</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Vectorized Merge Sort on ARM NEON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sorting algorithms are the most extensively researched topics in computer science and serve for numerous practical applications. Although various sorts have been proposed for efficiency, different architectures offer distinct flavors to the implementation of parallel sorting. In this paper, we propose a hybrid vectorized merge sort on ARM NEON, named NEON Merge Sort for short (NEON-MS). In detail, according to the granted register functions, we first identify the optimal register number to avoid the register-to-memory access, due to the write-back of intermediate outcomes. More importantly, following the generic merge sort framework that primarily uses sorting network for column sort and merging networks for three types of vectorized merge, we further improve their structures for high efficiency in an unified asymmetry way: 1) it makes the optimal sorting networks with few comparators become possible; 2) hybrid implementation of both serial and vectorized merges incurs the pipeline with merge instructions highly interleaved. Experiments on a single FT2000+ core show that NEON-MS is 3.8 and 2.1 times faster than std::sort and boost::block\_sort, respectively, on average. Additionally, as compared to the parallel version of the latter, NEON-MS gains an average speedup of 1.25.</description>

      <title>Hardness of sampling for the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a hardness of sampling result for the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model on random graphs of average degree $d$ for large constant $d$, proving that when the normalized inverse temperature satisfies $\beta&gt;1$ (asymptotically corresponding to the condensation threshold), then w.h.p. over the random graph there is no stable sampling algorithm that can output a sample close in $W_2$ distance to the Gibbs measure. The results also apply to a fixed-magnetization version of the model, showing that there are no stable sampling algorithms for low but positive temperature max and min bisection distributions. These results show a gap in the tractability of search and sampling problems: while there are efficient algorithms to find near optimizers, stable sampling algorithms cannot access the Gibbs distribution concentrated on such solutions.
  Our techniques involve extensions of the interpolation technique relating behavior of the mean field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model to behavior of Ising models on random graphs of average degree $d$ for large $d$. While previous interpolation arguments compared the free energies of the two models, our argument compares the average energies and average overlaps in the two models.</description>

      <title>Sketching Meets Differential Privacy: Fast Algorithm for Dynamic Kronecker Projection Maintenance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11542v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Projection maintenance is one of the core data structure tasks. Efficient data structures for projection maintenance have led to recent breakthroughs in many convex programming algorithms. In this work, we further extend this framework to the Kronecker product structure. Given a constraint matrix ${\sf A}$ and a positive semi-definite matrix $W\in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ with a sparse eigenbasis, we consider the task of maintaining the projection in the form of ${\sf B}^\top({\sf B}{\sf B}^\top)^{-1}{\sf B}$, where ${\sf B}={\sf A}(W\otimes I)$ or ${\sf B}={\sf A}(W^{1/2}\otimes W^{1/2})$. At each iteration, the weight matrix $W$ receives a low rank change and we receive a new vector $h$. The goal is to maintain the projection matrix and answer the query ${\sf B}^\top({\sf B}{\sf B}^\top)^{-1}{\sf B}h$ with good approximation guarantees. We design a fast dynamic data structure for this task and it is robust against an adaptive adversary. Following the beautiful and pioneering work of [Beimel, Kaplan, Mansour, Nissim, Saranurak and Stemmer, STOC'22], we use tools from differential privacy to reduce the randomness required by the data structure and further improve the running time.</description>

      <title>inGRASS: Incremental Graph Spectral Sparsification via Low-Resistance-Diameter Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents inGRASS, a novel algorithm designed for incremental spectral sparsification of large undirected graphs. The proposed inGRASS algorithm is highly scalable and parallel-friendly, having a nearly-linear time complexity for the setup phase and the ability to update the spectral sparsifier in $O(\log N)$ time for each incremental change made to the original graph with $N$ nodes. A key component in the setup phase of inGRASS is a multilevel resistance embedding framework introduced for efficiently identifying spectrally-critical edges and effectively detecting redundant ones, which is achieved by decomposing the initial sparsifier into many node clusters with bounded effective-resistance diameters leveraging a low-resistance-diameter decomposition (LRD) scheme. The update phase of inGRASS exploits low-dimensional node embedding vectors for efficiently estimating the importance and uniqueness of each newly added edge. As demonstrated through extensive experiments, inGRASS achieves up to over $200 \times$ speedups while retaining comparable solution quality in incremental spectral sparsification of graphs obtained from various datasets, such as circuit simulations, finite element analysis, and social networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of enumerating connected subgraphs of a given size in a graph has been extensively studied in recent years. In this short communication, we propose an algorithm with a delay of $\mathcal{O}(k\Delta)$ for enumerating all connected induced subgraphs of size $k$ in an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$, where $k$ and $\Delta$ are respectively the size of subgraphs and the maximum degree of $G$. The proposed algorithm improves upon the current best delay bound $\mathcal{O}(k^2\Delta)$ for the connected induced subgraph enumeration problem in the literature.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04459v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent upper bound by Le and Solomon [STOC '23] has established that every $n$-node graph has a $(1+\varepsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner with lightness $O(\varepsilon^{-1} n^{1/k})$. This bound is optimal up to its dependence on $\varepsilon$; the remaining open problem is whether this dependence can be improved or perhaps even removed entirely.
  We show that the $\varepsilon$-dependence cannot in fact be completely removed. For constant $k$ and for $\varepsilon:= \Theta(n^{-\frac{1}{2k-1}})$, we show a lower bound on lightness of $$\Omega\left( \varepsilon^{-1/k} n^{1/k} \right).$$ For example, this implies that there are graphs for which any $3$-spanner has lightness $\Omega(n^{2/3})$, improving on the previous lower bound of $\Omega(n^{1/2})$.
  An unusual feature of our lower bound is that it is conditional on the girth conjecture with parameter $k-1$ rather than $k$. We additionally show that this implies certain technical limitations to improving our lower bound further. In particular, under the same conditional, generalizing our lower bound to all $\varepsilon$ \emph{or} obtaining an optimal $\varepsilon$-dependence are as hard as proving the girth conjecture for all constant $k$.</description>

      <title>Nearly-Tight Bounds for Flow Sparsifiers in Quasi-Bipartite Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flow sparsification is a classic graph compression technique which, given a capacitated graph $G$ on $k$ terminals, aims to construct another capacitated graph $H$, called a flow sparsifier, that preserves, either exactly or approximately, every multicommodity flow between terminals (ideally, with size as a small function of $k$). Cut sparsifiers are a restricted variant of flow sparsifiers which are only required to preserve maximum flows between bipartitions of the terminal set. It is known that exact cut sparsifiers require $2^{\Omega(k)}$ many vertices [Krauthgamer and Rika, SODA 2013], with the hard instances being quasi-bipartite graphs, where there are no edges between non-terminals. On the other hand, it has been shown recently that exact (or even $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate) flow sparsifiers on networks with just 6 terminals require unbounded size [Krauthgamer and Mosenzon, SODA 2023, Chen and Tan, SODA 2024].
  In this paper, we construct exact flow sparsifiers of size $3^{k^{3}}$ and exact cut sparsifiers of size $2^{k^2}$ for quasi-bipartite graphs. In particular, the flow sparsifiers are contraction-based, that is, they are obtained from the input graph by (vertex) contraction operations. Our main contribution is a new technique to construct sparsifiers that exploits connections to polyhedral geometry, and that can be generalized to graphs with a small separator that separates the graph into small components. We also give an improved reduction theorem for graphs of bounded treewidth [Andoni et al., SODA 2011], implying a flow sparsifier of size $O(k\cdot w)$ and quality $O\bigl(\frac{\log w}{\log \log w}\bigr)$, where $w$ is the treewidth.</description>

      <title>Two-sided Assortment Optimization: Adaptivity Gaps and Approximation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the challenge of choice congestion in matching markets, in this work, we introduce a two-sided assortment optimization framework under general choice preferences. The goal in this problem is to maximize the expected number of matches by deciding which assortments are displayed to the agents and the order in which they are shown. In this context, we identify several classes of policies that platforms can use in their design. Our goals are: (1) to measure the value that one class of policies has over another one, and (2) to approximately solve the optimization problem itself for a given class. For (1), we define the adaptivity gap as the worst-case ratio between the optimal values of two different policy classes. First, we show that the gap between the class of policies that statically show assortments to one-side first and the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to one-side first is exactly $1-1/e$. Second, we show that the gap between the latter class of policies and the fully adaptive class of policies that show assortments to agents one by one is exactly $1/2$. We also note that the worst policies are those who simultaneously show assortments to all the agents, in fact, we show that their adaptivity gap even with respect to one-sided static policies can be arbitrarily small. For (2), we first show that there exists a polynomial time policy that achieves a $1/4$ approximation factor within the class of policies that adaptively show assortments to agents one by one. Finally, when agents' preferences are governed by multinomial-logit models, we show that a 0.082 approximation factor can be obtained within the class of policies that show assortments to all agents at once.</description>

      <title>Low-Distortion Clustering in Bounded Growth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The well-known clustering algorithm of Miller, Peng, and Xu (SPAA 2013) is useful for many applications, including low-diameter decomposition and low-energy distributed algorithms. One nice property of their clustering, shown in previous work by Chang, Dani, Hayes, and Pettie (PODC 2020), is that distances in the cluster graph are rescaled versions of distances in the original graph, up to an $O(\log n)$ distortion factor and rounding issues. Minimizing this distortion factor is important for efficiency in computing the clustering, as well as in further applications, once the clustering has been constructed.
  We prove that there exist graphs for which an $\Omega((\log n)^{1/3})$ distortion factor is necessary for any clustering. We also consider a class of nice graphs which we call uniformly bounded independence graphs. These include, for example, paths, lattice graphs, and "dense" unit disk graphs. For these graphs, we prove that clusterings of constant distortion always exist, and moreover, we give an efficient distributed algorithm to construct them. Our clustering algorithm is based on Voronoi cells centered at the vertices of a maximal independent set in a suitable power graph.
  Applications of our new clustering include low-energy simulation of distributed algorithms in the LOCAL, CONGEST, and RADIO-CONGEST models, as well as efficient approximate solutions to distributed combinatorial optimization problems. We complement these results with matching or nearly matching lower bounds.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Group Testing with Runlength Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm to construct almost optimal $(k,n,d)$-superimposed codes with runlength constraints. A $(k,n,d)$-superimposed code of length $t$ is a $t \times n$ binary matrix such that any two 1's in each column are separated by a run of at least $d$ 0's, and such that for any column $\mathbf{c}$ and any other $k-1$ columns, there exists a row where $\mathbf{c}$ has $1$ and all the remaining $k-1$ columns have $0$. These combinatorial structures were introduced by Agarwal et al. [1], in the context of Non-Adaptive Group Testing algorithms with runlength constraints.
  By using Moser and Tardos' constructive version of the Lov\'asz Local Lemma, we provide an efficient randomized Las Vegas algorithm of complexity $\Theta(t n^2)$ for the construction of $(k,n,d)$-superimposed codes of length $t=O(dk\log n +k^2\log n)$. We also show that the length of our codes is shorter, for $n$ sufficiently large, than that of the codes whose existence was proved in [1].</description>
