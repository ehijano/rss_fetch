      <title>Ordering curves on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the order of lengths of closed geodesics on hyperbolic surfaces. Our first main result is that the order of lengths of curves determine a point in Teichm\"uller space. In an opposite direction, we identify classes of curves whose order never changes, independently of the choice of hyperbolic metric. We use this result to identify short curves with small intersections on pairs of pants.</description>

      <title>On gluing and splitting series invariants of plumbed 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study series invariants for plumbed 3-manifolds and knot complements twisted by a root lattice. Our series recover recent results of Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park, and Ri and apply more generally to 3-manifolds which are not necessarily negative definite. We show that our series verify certain gluing and splitting properties related to the corresponding operations on 3-manifolds. We conclude with an explicit description of the case of lens spaces and Brieskorn spheres.</description>

      <title>On symmetry and exterior problems of knotted handlebodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper concerns two classical problems in knot theory pertaining to knot symmetry and knot exteriors. In the context of a knotted handlebody $V$ in a $3$-sphere $S^3$, the symmetry problem seeks to classify the mapping class group of the pair $(S^3,V)$, whereas the exterior problem examines to what extent the exterior $E(V)$ determines or fails to determine the isotopy type of $V$. The paper determines the symmetries of knotted genus two handlebodies arising from hyperbolic knots with non-integral toroidal Dehn surgeries, and solve the knot exterior problem for them. A new interpretation and generalization of a Lee-Lee family of knotted handlebodies is provided.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial p-th Calabi flow for finite and infinite ideal circle patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07130v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow for both finite and infinite ideal circle patterns. In the finite case, we establish a sharp criterion: the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow with $p&gt;1$ converges if and only if a constant curvature metric exists in the underlying geometric background. In the infinite setting, we prove the long-time existence of solutions to the combinatorial $p$-th Calabi flow for $p \geq 2$, representing a significant advance in the theory of curvature flows on infinite structures.</description>

      <title>Heegaard Floer theory and pseudo-Anosov flows II: Differential and Fried pants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In earlier work, relying on work of Agol-Gu\'eritaud and Landry-Minsky-Taylor, we showed that given a pseudo-Anosov flow $(Y,\phi)$ and a collection of closed orbits $\mathcal{C}$ satisfying the `no perfect fit' condition, one can construct a special Heegaard diagram for the link complement $Y^\sharp= Y \setminus \nu (\mathcal{C})$ framed by the degeneracy curves. In this paper, we demonstrate how the special combinatorics of this diagram can be used to understand the differential of the associated Heegaard Floer chain complex. More specifically, we introduce a refinement of the $\text{spin}^\text{c}$-grading obstructing two Heegaard states from being connected by an effective domain. We describe explicitly the subcomplexes in the refined gradings that represent irreducible multi-orbits, in the sense that they contain states corresponding to multi-orbits which cannot be resolved along Fried pants. In particular we show that the homology of these subcomplexes are 1-dimensional. When specialized to the case of suspension flows our arguments prove some results in the spirit of Ni, Ghiggini, and Spano: the next-to-top non-zero sutured Floer group counts the number of periodic points of least period.</description>

      <title>Dirac spectral flow and Floer theory of hyperbolic three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between hyperbolic geometry and monopole Floer homology for a closed oriented three-manifold $Y$ with $b_1=1$ equipped with a torsion spin$^c$ structure $\mathfrak{s}$. We show that, under favorable circumstances, one can completely describe the Floer theory of $(Y,\mathfrak{s})$ purely in terms of geometric data such as the lengths and holonomies of closed geodesics. In particular, we perform the first computations of monopole Floer chain complexes with non-trivial homology for hyperbolic three-manifolds. The examples we consider admit no irreducible solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations, and the non-triviality of the Floer homology groups is a consequence of the geometry of the $1$-parameter family of Dirac operators associated to flat spin$^c$ connections. The main technical challenge is to understand explicitly how the Dirac eigenvalues with small absolute value cross the value zero in this family; we tackle this using Fourier analytic tools via the corresponding $1$-parameter family of odd Selberg trace formulas and its derivative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a smooth manifold is diffeomorphic to a Euclidean space if it admits a Lyapunov-Reeb function. Here a Lyapunov-Reeb function means a smooth function that is proper, bounded from below and possesses only one critical point. As applications, we determine the topology of moduli spaces of self-avoiding polygonal linkages by constructing Lyapunov-Reeb functions, and we prove a conjecture of Gonz\'{a}lez and Sedano-Mendoza on moduli spaces of simple polygons. We further describe foliation structures of these moduli spaces via level sets of Lyapunov-Reeb functions. Finally, we present algorithms for the Carpenter's Rule Problem and several related problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted Wirtinger presentations are generalizations of the classical Wirtinger presentations of knot and link groups. In this paper, we prove that if a finitely generated group admitting a twisted Wirtinger presentation is Gromov hyperbolic, then its second rational homology group vanishes. Moreover, if the group is torsion-free, then its second integral homology group also vanishes.</description>

      <title>Generalizations of Frobenius-Schur indicators from Kuperberg invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an approach to produce gauge invariants of any finite-dimensional Hopf algebras from the Kuperberg invariants of framed 3-manifolds. These invariants are generalizations of Frobenius-Schur indicators of Hopf algebras. The computation of Kuperberg invariants is based on a presentation of the framed 3-manifold in terms of Heegaard diagram with combings satisfying certain admissibility conditions. We provide framed Heegaard diagrams for two infinite families of small genus 3-manifolds, which include all the lens spaces, and some homology spheres. In particular, the invariants of the lens spaces $L(n,1)$ coincide with the higher Frobenius-Schur indicators of Hopf algebras. We compute the Kuperberg invariants of all these framed 3-manifolds, and prove that they are invariants of the tensor category of representations of the underlying Hopf algebra, or simply gauge invariants.</description>

Abstract: We present an effective method for visualizing flat surfaces using ray marching. Our approach provides an intuitive way to explore translation surfaces, mirror rooms, unfolded polyhedra, and translation prisms while maintaining computational efficiency. We demonstrate the utility of the method through various examples and provide implementation insights for programmers. Finally, we discuss the use of our visualizations in outreach. We make our simulations and code available online.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence: Lipschitz functions with converging Clarke subdifferentials and convergence of sets defined by converging equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we investigate some applications of the Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed sets in analysis that are motivated also by questions from singularity theory. First, we generalise to Lipschitz functions the classical theorem stating that given a sequence of smooth functions with locally uniformly convergent derivatives, we obtain the local uniform convergence of the functions themselves (provided they were convergent at one point). We use Clarke subdifferentials instead of derivative and Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of their graphs instead of local uniform convergence. Next we focus on reverse theorem. We show that Painlev\'e-Kuratowski convergence of closed nonempty sets implies convergence of distance functions and Clark subdifferentials of squared distance functions, but does not imply convergence of Clark subdifferentials of distance functions. Finally we turn to the study of the behaviour of the fibres of a given function. We prove some general real counterparts of the Hurwitz theorem from complex analysis stating that the local uniform convergence of holomorphic functions implies the convergence of their sets of zeros. From the point of view of singularity theory our two theorems concern the convergence of the sets when their descriptions are convergent. They are also of interest in approximation theory.</description>

      <title>On the genera of symmetric unions of knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the study of ribbon knots, Lamm introduced symmetric unions inspired by earlier work of Kinoshita and Terasaka. We show an identity between the twisted Alexander polynomials of a symmetric union and its partial knot. As a corollary, we obtain an inequality concerning their genera. It is known that there exists an epimorphism between their knot groups, and thus our inequality provides a positive answer to an old problem of Jonathan Simon in this case. Our formula also offers a useful condition to constrain possible symmetric union presentations of a given ribbon knot. It is an open question whether every ribbon knot is a symmetric union.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the configuration space of distinct, unordered points on compact orientable surfaces of genus $g$, denoted $S_g$. Specifically, we address the section problem, which concerns the addition of $n$ distinct points to an existing configuration of $m$ distinct points on $S_g$ in a way that ensures the new points vary continuously with respect to the initial configuration. This problem is equivalent to the splitting problem in surface braid groups. With an algebraic approach, for $g\geq 1$ and $m\geq 2$, we establish a necessary condition for the existence of a section, showing that if a section exists, then $n$ must be a multiple of $m+(2g-2)$. For $g\geq 1$ and $m=1$, we take a geometric approach to demonstrate that a section exists for all values of $n$.</description>

Abstract: Link equivalence up to isotopy in a 3-space is the problem that lies at the root of knot theory, and is important in 3-dimensional topology and geometry. We consider its restriction to alternating links, given by two alternating diagrams with $n_1$ and $n_2$ crossings, and show that this problem has polynomial algorithm in terms of $max\{n_1, n_2\}$. For the proof, we use Tait flyping conjectures, observations stemming from the work of Lackenby, Menasco, Sundberg and Thistlethwaite on alternating links, and algorithmic complexity of some problems from graph theory and topological graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve two open problems of Valeriy Bardakov about Cayley graphs of racks and graph-theoretic realizations of right quasigroups. We also extend Didier Caucal's classification of labeled Cayley digraphs to right quasigroups and related algebraic structures like quandles.
  First, we characterize markings of graphs that realize racks. As an application, we construct rack-theoretic (di)graph invariants from permutation representations of graph automorphism groups. We describe how to compute these invariants with general results for path graphs and cycle graphs.
  Second, we show that all right quasigroups are realizable by edgeless graphs and complete (di)graphs. Using Schreier (di)graphs, we also characterize Cayley (di)graphs of right quasigroups Q that realize Q. In particular, all racks are realizable by their full Cayley (di)graphs.
  Finally, we give a graph-theoretic characterization of labeled Cayley digraphs of right-cancellative magmas, right-divisible magmas, right quasigroups, racks, quandles, involutory racks, and kei.</description>

      <title>On groups of diffeomorphisms of the interval with finitely many fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:1503.03852v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [13], it is proved that any subgroup of $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}^{\omega }(I)$ (the group of orientation preserving analytic diffeomorphisms of the interval) is either metaabelian or does not satisfy a law. A stronger question is asked whether or not the Girth Alternative holds for subgroups of $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}^{\omega }(I)$. In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively for even a larger class of groups of orientation preserving diffeomorphisms of the interval where every non-identity element has finitely many fixed points. We show that every such (irreducible) group is either affine (in particular, metaabelian) or has infinite girth. The proof is based on our study of discrete subgroups of the diffeomorphism group $\mathrm{Diff}_{+}(I)$ which we initiated in [9] and later developed in [1] and [2]; more specifically, our results are obtained by sharpening the tools from the earlier works [1] and [2]. One of the major tools (local transitivity) is heavily exploited in [2] to get an extension of Holders theorem which is crucially used in this paper. We show that local transitivity can be proved for any (up to a conjugacy) non-affine group of irreducible diffeomorphisms with every non-identity element having finitely many fixed points.</description>

      <title>Homotopy of blow ups after looping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The homotopy theory of the blow up construction in algebraic and symplectic geometry is investigated via two approaches. The first approach introduces and develops fibrewise surgery theory, for which the fibrewise framing is characterized by the homotopy groups of a certain gauge group. This is used to obtain a homotopy decomposition of the based loop space on a blow up that holds $p$-locally for all but finitely many primes $p$ and holds rationally. The second approach is purely homotopy theoretic and obtains a homotopy decomposition of the based loop space on a blow up that holds integrally provided a certain condition is satisfied by an associated homotopy action.
  As applications, we obtain $p$-local homotopy decompositions of the based loop space of a focal genus $2$ manifold, improve an earlier result of the authors on the homotopy of manifolds stabilized by projective spaces, and obtain for blow-ups a refinement of the rational dichotomy.</description>

      <title>The rectifiable rectangular peg problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the rectangular peg problem for a large class of continuous Jordan curves that contains all rectifiable curves and Stromquist's locally monotone curves. Our proof is based on microlocal sheaf theory and inspired by recent work of Greene and Lobb.</description>
