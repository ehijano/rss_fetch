      <title>Weighted inequalities for weak Riesz-Fischer functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a set of relations between several quite diverse types of weighted inequalities involving various integral operators and fairly general quasinorm-like functionals. The main result enables one to solve a specific problem by transferring it to another one for which a solution is known. The main result is formulated in a rather surprising generality, involving previously unknown cases, and it works even for some nonlinear operators such as the geometric or harmonic mean operators. Proofs use only elementary means.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Extinction, An Average Lyapunov Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of $\mathcal{M}_0$, an invariant subset of a Markov process $(X_t)_{t\geq 0}$ on a metric space $\mathcal{M}$. By building the theory of average Lyapunov functions, we formulate general criteria based on the signs of Lyapunov exponents that guarantee extinction ($X_t \to \mathcal{M}_0$ as $t \to \infty$). Additionally, we provide applications to a stochastic SIS epidemic model on a network with regime-switching, a stochastic differential equation version of the Lorenz system, a general class of discrete-time ecological models, and stochastic Kolmogorov systems. In many examples we improve existing results by removing unnecessary assumptions or providing sharper criteria for the extinction.</description>

      <title>The Machado--Bishop theorem in the uniform topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Machado--Bishop theorem for weighted vector-valued functions vanishing at infinity has been extensively studied. In this paper, we give an analogue of Machado's distance formula for bounded weighted vector-valued functions. A number of applications are given; in particular, some types of the Bishop--Stone--Weierstrass theorem for bounded vector-valued continuous spaces in the uniform topology are discussed; the splitting of $C(I \times J, X \otimes Y)$ as the closure of $C(I, X) \otimes C(J, Y)$ in different senses and the extension of continuous vector-valued functions are studied.</description>

      <title>On Orlicz classes defined in terms of associated weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: N-functions and their growth and regularity properties are crucial in order to introduce and study Orlicz classes and Orlicz spaces. We consider N-functions which are given in terms of so-called associated weight functions. These functions are frequently appearing in the theory of ultradifferentiable function classes and in this setting additional information is available since associated weight functions are defined in terms of a given weight sequence. We express and characterize several known properties for N-functions purely in terms of weight sequences which allows to construct (counter-)examples. Moreover, we study how for abstractly given N-functions this framework becomes meaningful and finally we establish a connection between the complementary N-function and the recently introduced notion of the so-called dual sequence.</description>

      <title>A new space of Generalised vector-valued functions of Bounded Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [17], the authors introduced the space $GBV_\star(A)$ to minimise a class of functionals whose study is motivated by fracture mechanics. In this paper, we extend the definition of $GBV_\star(A)$ to the vectorial case, introducing the space $GBV_\star(A;\mathbb{R}^k)$. We study the main properties of $GBV_\star(A;\mathbb{R}^k)$ and prove a lower semicontinuity result useful for minimisation purposes. With the Direct Method in mind, we adapt the arguments of [17] to show that minimising sequences in $GBV_\star(A;\mathbb{R}^k)$ can be modified to obtain a minimising sequence converging $\mathcal{L}^d$-a.e in $A$.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness and maximal regularity for parabolic Cauchy problems on weighted tent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove well-posedness in weighted tent spaces of weak solutions to the Cauchy problem $\partial_t u - \mathrm{div} A \nabla u = f, u(0)=0$, where the source $f$ also lies in (different) weighted tent spaces, provided the complex coefficient matrix $A$ is bounded, measurable, time-independent, and uniformly elliptic. To achieve this, we extend the theory of singular integral operators on tent spaces via off-diagonal estimates introduced by [arXiv:1112.4292] to obtain estimates on solutions $u$, and also $\nabla u$, $\partial_t u$, and $\mathrm{div} A \nabla u$ in weighted tent spaces, showing at the same time maximal regularity. Uniqueness follows from a different strategy using interior representation for weak solutions and boundary behavior.</description>

      <title>Stability of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robot Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of variational principles for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is subjected to a fixed value and the other end is free, have been less studied in terms of their stability despite their abundance. In this article, we develop the stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional using the generalized Jacobi condition. This involves computing conjugate points that are determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to a tip load. Kirchhoff rod theory is employed to model the elastic rod deformations. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. This snap-back instability is demonstrated using various examples, highlighting its dependence on various system parameters. The presented examples illustrate the potential applications in the design of flexible soft robot arms and innovative mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Fourier restriction for Schatten class operators and functions on phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a variant of Fourier restriction for operators in Schatten classes, where the Fourier-Wigner transform of a bounded operator replaces the Fourier transform of a function. The Fourier-Wigner transform is closely related to the group Fourier transform of the Heisenberg group. The first result shows that Fourier-Wigner restriction for Schatten class operators is equivalent to the restriction of the symplectic Fourier transform of functions on phase space. We deduce various Schatten class results for the quantum Fourier extension operator and answer a conjecture by Mishra and Vemuri concerning the Weyl transform of measures in the affirmative.</description>
