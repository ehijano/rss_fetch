      <title>Multi-Head Neural Operator for Modelling Interfacial Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial dynamics underlie a wide range of phenomena, including phase transitions, microstructure coarsening, pattern formation, and thin-film growth, and are typically described by stiff, time-dependent nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Traditional numerical methods, including finite difference, finite element, and spectral techniques, often become computationally prohibitive when dealing with high-dimensional problems or systems with multiple scales. Neural operators (NOs), a class of deep learning models, have emerged as a promising alternative by learning mappings between function spaces and efficiently approximating solution operators. In this work, we introduce the Multi-Head Neural Operator (MHNO), an extended neural operator framework specifically designed to address the temporal challenges associated with solving time-dependent PDEs. Unlike existing neural operators, which either struggle with error accumulation or require substantial computational resources for high-dimensional tensor representations, MHNO employs a novel architecture with time-step-specific projection operators and explicit temporal connections inspired by message-passing mechanisms. This design allows MHNO to predict all time steps after a single forward pass, while effectively capturing long-term dependencies and avoiding parameter overgrowth. We apply MHNO to solve various phase field equations, including antiphase boundary motion, spinodal decomposition, pattern formation, atomic scale modeling, and molecular beam epitaxy growth model, and compare its performance with existing NO-based methods. Our results show that MHNO achieves superior accuracy, scalability, and efficiency, demonstrating its potential as a next-generation computational tool for phase field modeling.

      <title>Machine Learning Workflow for Analysis of High-Dimensional Order Parameter Space: A Case Study of Polymer Crystallization from Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, identification of crystallization pathways in polymers is being carried out using molecular simulation-based data on a preset cut-off point on a single order parameter (OP) to define nucleated or crystallized regions. Aside from sensitivity to cut-off, each of these OPs introduces its own systematic biases. In this study, an integrated machine learning workflow is presented to accurately quantify crystallinity in polymeric systems using atomistic molecular dynamics data. Each atom is represented by a high-dimensional feature vector that combines geometric, thermodynamic-like, and symmetry-based descriptors. Low dimensional embeddings are employed to expose latent structural fingerprints within atomic environments. Subsequently, unsupervised clustering on the embeddings identified crystalline and amorphous atoms with high fidelity. After generating high quality labels with multidimensional data, we use supervised learning techniques to identify a minimal set of order parameters that can fully capture this label. Various tests were conducted to reduce the feature set, demonstrating that using only three order parameters is sufficient to recreate the crystallization labels. Based on these observed OPs, the crystallinity index (C-index) is defined as the logistic regression model's probability of crystallinity, remaining bimodal throughout the process and achieving over 0.98 classification performance (AUC). Notably, a model trained on one or a few snapshots enables efficient on-the-fly computation of crystallinity. Lastly, we demonstrate how the optimal C-index fit evolves during various stages of crystallization, supporting the hypothesis that entropy dominates early nucleation, while symmetry gains relevance later. This workflow provides a data-driven strategy for OP selection and a metric to monitor structural transformations in large-scale polymer simulations.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Finite-Element Analysis of Multiscale Electromagnetic Problems via Sparse Operator-Adapted Wavelet Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a finite element method (FEM) framework enhanced by an operator-adapted wavelet decomposition algorithm designed for the efficient analysis of multiscale electromagnetic problems. Usual adaptive FEM approaches, while capable of achieving the desired accuracy without requiring a complete re-meshing of the computational domain, inherently couple different resolution levels. This coupling requires recomputation of coarser-level solutions whenever finer details are added to improve accuracy, resulting in substantial computational overhead. Our proposed method addresses this issue by decoupling resolution levels. This feature enables independent computations at each scale that can be incorporated into the solutions to improve accuracy whenever needed, without requiring re-computation of coarser-level solutions. The main algorithm is hierarchical, constructing solutions from finest to coarser levels through a series of sparse matrix-vector multiplications. Due to its sparse nature, the overall computational complexity of the algorithm is nearly linear. Moreover, Krylov subspace iterative solvers are employed to solve the final linear equations, with ILU preconditioners that enhance solver convergence and maintain overall computational efficiency. The numerical experiments presented in this article verify the high precision and nearly linear computational complexity of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A causality inspired acceleration method for the fast temporal superposition of the finite line source solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, fast method to compute thermal interactions in solids, useful for time-dependent problems involving several sources and several time and space scales such as the ones encountered in the physics of fields of closed loop borehole heat exchangers. The new method is based on the non-history temporal superposition acceleration algorithm, but presents better performance compared to the originally proposed scheme. The main idea behind it is to leverage the propagation properties of the heat wave. Despite the basic physical solutions of heat transfer being non-causal, it is possible to establish an influence region by fixing an acceptable error tolerance. This allows to reduce the necessary integration regions in such a way that numerical integration is favored. The better behaviour of the integrand arising from this approach allows us to replace the use of Bakhalov-Vasil'eva method in favor of the asymptotic method for the computation of highly oscillatory integrals that has better properties from a computational perspective in the present application. Extensive testing is presented to evaluate the robustness of the new method and to compare its performance against the originally proposed non-history method and the convolution using the FFT algorithm for a range of error tolerances. The results show that the computational cost is highly reduced for the precomputation, which includes all the computations done before starting the time-stepping scheme. The reduction is of several orders of magnitude, depending on the specific case. This cost was the bottleneck of the original non-history implementation, and reducing it in this way makes the method suitable for simulations involving hundreds of sources and hundreds of thousands of time steps that can arise in simulations of borehole fields.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Generative Diffusion for Materials Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generative modeling framework for atomistic systems that combines score-based diffusion for atomic positions with a novel continuous-time discrete diffusion process for atomic types. This approach enables flexible and physically grounded generation of atomic structures across chemical and structural domains. Applied to metallic clusters and two-dimensional materials using the QCD and C2DB datasets, our models achieve strong performance in fidelity and diversity, evaluated using precision-recall metrics against synthetic baselines. We demonstrate atomic type interpolation for generating bimetallic clusters beyond the training distribution, and use classifier-free guidance to steer sampling toward specific crystallographic symmetries in two-dimensional materials. These capabilities are implemented in Atomistic Generative Diffusion (AGeDi), an open-source, extensible software package for atomistic generative diffusion modeling.</description>

      <title>Topology-Preserving Coupling of Compressible Fluids and Thin Deformables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel discretization of coupled compressible fluid and thin deformable structures that provides sufficient and necessary leakproofness by preserving the path connectedness of the fluid domain. Our method employs a constrained Voronoi-based spatial partitioning combined with Godunov-style finite-volume time integration. The fluid domain is discretized into cells that conform exactly to the fluid-solid interface, allowing boundary conditions to be sharply resolved exactly at the interface. This enables direct force exchange between the fluid and solid while ensuring that no fluid leaks through the solid, even when arbitrarily thin. We validate our approach on a series of challenging scenarios -- including a balloon propelled by internal compressed air, a champagne cork ejecting after overcoming friction, and a supersonic asteroid -- demonstrating bidirectional energy transfer between fluid and solid.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating O(1)-entanged approximate state designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science, including quantum cryptography, quantum simulation, and benchmarking quantum devices. In this work, we discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. We show that those resources such quantum states can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega\left(\log (t/\epsilon)\right)$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, those resources do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$ in the system. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states. To this end, we develop an algorithm that transforms $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones through a sequence of multi-controlled gates, without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit is $O\left(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon)\right)$, which is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of shallow quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in various quantum information processing tasks. As a concrete example for demonstrating utility of our algorithm, we propose classical shadow tomography using an $O(1)$-entangled estimator, which can achieve shorter runtime compared to conventional schemes.</description>

      <title>Stability of Continuous Time Quantum Walks in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of continuous time quantum walks (CTQWs) in a range of network topologies under different decoherence mechanisms, defining stability as the system's ability to preserve quantum properties over time. The networks studied range from homogeneous to heterogeneous structures, including cycle, complete, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, small-world, scale-free, and star topologies. The decoherence models considered are intrinsic decoherence, Haken-Strobl noise, and quantum stochastic walks (QSWs). To assess quantum stability, we employ several metrics: node occupation probabilities, the $\ell_1$-norm of coherence, fidelity with the initial state, quantum-classical distance, and von Neumann entropy. Our results reveal that the interplay of both network topology and decoherence model influences coherence preservation. Intrinsic decoherence results in the slowest decay of coherence, followed by Haken-Strobl noise, while QSW causes the most rapid loss of coherence. The stability ranking among network topologies varies depending on the decoherence model and quantifier used. For example, under Haken-Strobl and intrinsic decoherence, the quantum-classical distance ranks the cycle network more stable than scale-free networks, although other metrics consistently favour scale-free topologies. In general, heterogeneous networks, such as star and scale-free networks, exhibit the highest stability, whereas homogeneous topologies, such as cycle and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi networks, are more vulnerable to decoherence. The complete graph, despite its homogeneity, remains highly stable due to its dense connectivity. Furthermore, in heterogeneous networks, the centrality of the initialised node, measured by degree or closeness, has a pronounced impact on stability, underscoring the role of local topological features in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Advancing the hBN Defects Database through Photophysical Characterization of Bulk hBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have gained significant attention due to a wide range of defects that offer high quantum efficiency and single-photon purity at room temperature. Most theoretical studies on hBN defects simulate monolayers, as this is computationally cheaper than calculating bulk structures. However, most experimental studies are carried out on multilayer to bulk hBN, which creates additional possibilities for discrepancies between theory and experiment. In this work, we present an extended database of hBN defects that includes a comprehensive set of bulk hBN defects along with their excited-state photophysical properties. The database features over 120 neutral defects, systematically evaluated across charge states ranging from -2 to 2 (600 defects in total). For each defect, the most stable charge and spin configurations are identified and used to compute the zero-phonon line, photoluminescence spectrum, absorption spectrum, Huang-Rhys (HR) factor, interactive radiative lifetimes, transition dipole moments, and polarization characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the electron-phonon coupling strength is primarily influenced by the presence of vacancies, which tend to induce stronger lattice distortions and broaden phonon sidebands. Additionally, correlation analysis shows that while most properties are independent, the HR factor strongly correlates with the configuration coordinates. All data are publicly available at https://h-bn.info, along with a new application programming interface (API) to facilitate integration with machine learning workflows. This database is therefore designed to bridge the gap between theory and experiment, aid in the reliable identification of quantum emitters, and support the development of machine-learning-driven approaches in quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>On zero-order consistency residue and background pressure for the conservative SPH fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As one of the major challenges for the conservative smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, the zero-order consistency issue, although thought to be mitigated by the particle regularization scheme, such as the transport velocity formulation, significantly damps the flow in a long channel for both laminar and turbulent simulations. Building on this finding, this paper not only thoroughly analyzes the damping reason in this pressure-driven channel flow, but also relates this problem with the excessive numerical dissipation in the gravity-driven free-surface flow. The common root cause of the non-physical numerical damping in the two typical flow scenarios, the zero-order gradient consistency residue, is exposed. The adverse influence of the background pressure on the residue for the two scenarios is revealed and discussed. To comprehensively understand the behavior of the residue and mitigate its potential adverse effects, we conduct both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments focusing on the key sensitive factors. For studying the residue-induced non-physical energy dissipation in the gravity-driven free-surface flow, the water depth and input dynamic pressure in the inviscid standing wave case are tested. To investigate the velocity loss in the pressure-driven channel flow, we examine the effects of the channel length, resolution, and outlet pressure. The state-of-the-art reverse kernel gradient correction technique is introduced for the two typical flows, and proved to be effective in reducing the residue effect, but we find its correction capability is fundamentally limited. Finally, the FDA nozzle, an engineering benchmark, is tested to demonstrate the residue influence in a complex geometry, highlighting the necessity of correction schemes in scenarios with unavoidable high background pressure.</description>

      <title>Toda lattice formed in nonequilibrium steady states of SWCNT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toda lattice or FPUT chain-like dynamics have been regarded as the prerequisite condition to explain the length dependency of high thermal conductivity of low-dimensional systems at the nanoscale. In this paper, a hypothetical condition is introduced that establishes a theoretical connection between the thermal conductivity of a nanoscale low-dimensional system in nonequilibrium steady states(NESS) and the canonical motion of the equation in the Toda lattice in equilibrium. The hypothesis relies on a numerically driven coarse grained molecular dynamics system acquired from the trajectory data of nonequilibrium molecular dynamics(NEMD) simulation. It models the macroscopic motion from longitudinal and flexural modulation observed in NEMD as a separate Hamiltonian in CGMD with a perturbation term governed by an overdamping process, which is assumed to be dominant during heat transfer. The Smoluchowski equation for the perturbation, which is derived from the cross correlated states between two degrees of freedom, suggests that the potential energy function induced from NESS is identical to that of Toda Lattice under the specific condition in the partition function for CG particles. The restrictions derived from the model are well confirmed by the data from the numerically driven CG model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a deep variational free energy framework to compute the equation of state of hydrogen in the warm dense matter region. This method parameterizes the variational density matrix of hydrogen nuclei and electrons at finite temperature using three deep generative models: a normalizing flow model that represents the Boltzmann distribution of the classical nuclei, an autoregressive transformer that models the distribution of electrons in excited states, and a permutational equivariant flow model that constructs backflow coordinates for electrons in Hartree-Fock orbitals. By jointly optimizing the three neural networks to minimize the variational free energy, we obtain the equation of state and related thermodynamic properties of dense hydrogen. We compare our results with other theoretical and experimental results on the deuterium Hugoniot curve, aiming to resolve existing discrepancies. The calculated results provide a valuable benchmark for deuterium in the warm dense matter region.</description>

      <title>PYSED: A tool for extracting kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and lifetime from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning potential-driven molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have significantly enhanced the predictive accuracy of thermal transport properties across diverse materials. However, extracting phonon-mode-resolved insights from these simulations remains a critical challenge. Here, we introduce PYSED, a Python-based package built on the spectral energy density (SED) method, designed to efficiently compute kinetic-energy-weighted phonon dispersion and extract phonon lifetime from large-scale MD simulation trajectories. By integrating high-accuracy machine-learned neuroevolution potential (NEP) models, we validate and showcase the effectiveness of the implemented SED method across systems of varying dimensionalities. Specifically, the NEP-driven MD-SED accurately reveals how phonon modes are affected by strain in carbon nanotubes, as well as by interlayer coupling strength and twist angle in two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. For three-dimensional systems, the SED method effectively establishes the thermal transport regime diagram for metal-organic frameworks, distinguishing between particlelike and wavelike propagation regions. Moreover, using bulk silicon as an example, we show that phonon SED can efficiently capture quantum dynamics based on path-integral trajectories. The PYSED package bridges MD simulations with detailed phonon-mode insights, delivering a robust tool for investigating thermal transport properties with detailed mechanisms across various materials.</description>

Abstract: This work establishes a protocol to study via Molecular Dynamics simulation the degradation of Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in water by hydroxyl radical. To achieve this, molecular dynamics simulations are carried out, using ReaxFF reactive interaction potential. Simulations are carried out under a temperature ramp for determining all possible products. Using this methodology, reaction pathways of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) are identified.</description>

      <title>The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11341</link>

Abstract: The solutions to many problems in the mathematical, computational, and physical sciences often involve multidimensional integrals. A direct numerical evaluation of the integral incurs a computational cost that is exponential in the number of dimensions, a phenomenon called the curse of dimensionality. The problem is so substantial that one usually employs sampling methods, like Monte Carlo, to avoid integration altogether. Here, we derive and implement a quantum algorithm to compress a multidimensional integrand into a product of matrix-valued functions - a spectral tensor train - changing the computational complexity of integration from exponential to polynomial. The algorithm compresses the integrand by applying a sequence of quantum gates to an unentangled quantum state, where each term corresponds to a body-ordered term in the potential. Because it allows for the systematic elimination of small contributions to the integral through decimation, we call the method integral decimation. The functions in the spectral basis are analytically differentiable and integrable, and in applications to the partition function, integral decimation numerically factorizes an interacting system into a product of noninteracting ones. We illustrate integral decimation by evaluating the absolute free energy and entropy of a chiral XY model as a continuous function of temperature. We also compute the nonequilibrium time-dependent reduced density matrix of a quantum chain with between two and forty levels, each coupled to colored noise. When other methods provide numerical solutions to these models, they quantitatively agree with integral decimation. When conventional methods become intractable, integral decimation can be a powerful alternative.</description>

      <title>Numerical approach to second-order canonical perturbation theory in the planetary 3-body problem: Application to exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13745</link>

Abstract: Extrasolar planetary systems commonly exhibit planets on eccentric orbits, with many systems located near or within mean-motion resonances, showcasing a wide diversity of orbital architectures. Such complex systems challenge traditional secular theories, which are limited to first-order approximations in planetary masses or rely on expansions in orbital elements--eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major axis ratios--that are subject to convergence issues, especially in highly eccentric, inclined, or tightly-packed systems. To overcome these limitations, we develop a numerical approach to second-order perturbation theory based on the Lie transform formalism. Our method avoids the need for expansions in orbital elements, ensuring broader applicability and more robust convergence. We first outline the Hamiltonian framework for the 3-body planetary problem, and apply a canonical transformation to eliminate fast angle dependencies, deriving the secular Hamiltonian up to second order in the mass ratio. We then use the fast Fourier transform algorithm to numerically simulate, in an accurate way, the long-term evolution of planetary systems near or away from mean-motion resonances. Finally, we validate our methods against well-known planetary configurations, such as the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, as well as to exoplanetary systems like WASP-148, TIC 279401253 and GJ 876, demonstrating the applicability of our models across a wide range of planetary configurations.</description>

      <title>Quantum walks reveal topological flat bands, robust edge states and topological phase transitions in cyclic graphs</title>

Abstract: Topological phases, edge states, and flat bands in synthetic quantum systems are a key resource for topological quantum computing and noise-resilient information processing. We introduce a scheme based on step-dependent quantum walks on cyclic graphs, termed cyclic quantum walks (CQWs), to simulate exotic topological phenomena using discrete Fourier transforms and an effective Hamiltonian. Our approach enables the generation of both gapped and gapless topological phases, including Dirac cone-like energy dispersions, topologically nontrivial flat bands, and protected edge states, all without resorting to split-step or split-coin protocols. Odd and even-site cyclic graphs exhibit markedly different spectral characteristics, with rotationally symmetric flat bands emerging exclusively in $4n$-site graphs ($n\in \mathbf{N}$). We analytically establish the conditions for the emergence of topological, gapped flat bands and show that gap closings in rotation space imply the formation of Dirac cones in momentum space. Further, we engineer protected edge states at the interface between distinct topological phases in both odd and even cycle graphs. We numerically demonstrate that the edge states are robust against moderate static and dynamic gate disorder and remain stable against phase-preserving perturbations. This scheme serves as a resource-efficient and versatile platform for engineering topological phases, transitions, edge states, and flat bands in quantum systems, opening new avenues for fault-tolerant quantum technologies.</description>
