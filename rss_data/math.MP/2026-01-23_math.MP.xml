      <title>A pseudo-bosonic Klein-Gordon field with finite two-points function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of pseudo-bosonic Klein-Gordon fields in 1+1 dimensions and we discuss some of their properties. This work originates from non Hermitian quantum mechanics and deformed canonical commutation relations. We show that, within this class of fields, there exist a specific subclass with the interesting feature of having finite equal space-time two-points function, contrarily to what happens for {\em standard} Klein-Gordon fields. This, in our opinion, is a relevant aspect of our proposal which is a good motivation to undertake a deeper analysis of this (and related) quantum fields.</description>

      <title>On the structural properties of Lie algebras via associated labeled directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for associating labeled directed graphs to finite-dimensional Lie algebras, thereby enabling rapid identification of key structural algebraic features. To formalize this approach, we introduce the concept of graph-admissible Lie algebras and analyze properties of valid graphs given the antisymmetry property of the Lie bracket as well as the Jacobi identity. Based on these foundations, we develop graph-theoretic criteria for solvability, nilpotency, presence of ideals, simplicity, semisimplicity, and reductiveness of an algebra. Practical algorithms are provided for constructing such graphs and those associated with the lower central series and derived series via an iterative pruning procedure. This visual framework allows for an intuitive understanding of Lie algebraic structures that goes beyond purely visual advantages, since it enables a simpler and swifter grasping of the algebras of interest beyond computational-heavy approaches. Examples, which include the Schr\"odinger and Lorentz algebra, illustrate the applicability of these tools to physically relevant cases. We further explore applications in physics, where the method facilitates computation of similtude relations essential for determining quantum mechanical time evolution via the Lie algebraic factorization method. Extensions to graded Lie algebras and related conjectures are discussed. Our approach bridges algebraic and combinatorial perspectives, offering both theoretical insights and computational tools into this area of mathematical physics.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable topological phase transition in a quantum dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a family of generalized Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonians, which are reverse-engineered to have an arbitrary edge-weighted superposition of dimer coverings as their exact ground state at the RK point. We then focus on a quantum dimer model on the triangular lattice, with doubly-periodic edge weights. For simplicity we consider a $2\times1$ periodic model in which all weights are set to one except for a tunable horizontal edge weight labeled $\alpha$. We analytically show that the model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition at $\alpha=3$, changing from a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid ($\alpha&lt;3$) to a columnar ordered state ($\alpha&gt;3$). The dimer-dimer correlator decays exponentially on both sides of the transition with the correlation length $\xi\propto1/|\alpha-3|$ and as a power-law at criticality. The vison correlator exhibits an exponential decay in the spin liquid phase, but becomes a constant in the ordered phase. We explain the constant vison correlator in terms of loops statistics of the double-dimer model. Using finite-size scaling of the vison correlator, we extract critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Quadratic tensors as a unification of Clifford, Gaussian, and free-fermion physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain families of quantum mechanical models can be described and solved efficiently on a classical computer, including qubit or qudit Clifford circuits and stabilizer codes, free-boson or free-fermion models, and certain rotor and GKP codes. We show that all of these families can be described as instances of the same algebraic structure, namely quadratic functions over abelian groups, or more generally over (super) Hopf algebras. Different kinds of degrees of freedom correspond to different "elementary" abelian groups or Hopf algebras: $\mathbb{Z}_2$ for qubits, $\mathbb{Z}_d$ for qudits, $\mathbb{R}$ for continuous variables, both $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ for rotors, and a super Hopf algebra $\mathcal F$ for fermionic modes. Objects such as states, operators, superoperators, or projection-operator valued measures, etc, are tensors. For the solvable models above, these tensors are quadratic tensors based on quadratic functions. Quadratic tensors with $n$ degrees of freedom are fully specified by only $O(n^2)$ coefficients. Tensor networks of quadratic tensors can be contracted efficiently on the level of these coefficients, using an operation reminiscent of the Schur complement. Our formalism naturally includes models with mixed degrees of freedom, such as qudits of different dimensions. We also use quadratic functions to define generalized stabilizer codes and Clifford gates for arbitrary abelian groups. Finally, we give a generalization from quadratic (or 2nd order) to $i$th order tensors, which are specified by $O(n^i)$ coefficients but cannot be contracted efficiently in general.</description>

      <title>A Modified Center-of-Mass Conservation Law in Finite-Domain Simulations of the Zakharov--Kuznetsov Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate conservation laws of the two-dimensional Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, a natural higher-dimensional and non-integrable extension of the Korteweg--de Vries equation. The ZK equation admits three scalar conserved quantities -- mass, momentum, and energy -- represented as $I_1$, $I_2$, and $I_3$, as well as a vector-valued quantity $\bm{I}_4$. In high-accuracy numerical simulations on a finite double-periodic domain, most of these quantities are well preserved, while a systematic temporal drift is observed only in the $x$-component $I_{4x}$. We show that the nontrivial evolution of $I_{4x}$ originates from an explicit boundary-flux contribution, which is induced by fluctuations of the solution and its spatial derivatives at the domain boundaries. We successfully identify the source of the inaccuracy in the numerical solutions. Motivated by this analysis, we define a modified center-of-mass quantity $I_{4x}^{\mathrm{mod}}$ and demonstrate its conservation numerically for single-pulse configurations. The modified quantity thus provides a consistent conservation law for the ZK equation and yields an appropriate description of center-of-mass motion in finite-domain numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Global regularity for the Navier-Stokes equations with application to global solvability for the Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any Leray-Hopf weak solution to the $d$-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations $(d\geq 3)$ with initial values $u_0\in H^{s}(\mathbb R^d)$, $s\geq -1+\frac{d}{2}$, belongs to $L^\infty(0,\infty; H^{s}(\mathbb R^d))$ and thus it is globally regular. For the proof, first, we construct a supercritical space which has very sparse inverse logarithmic weight in the frequency domain, compared to the critical homogeneous Sobolev $\dot{H}^{-1+d/2}$-norm. Then we obtain the energy estimates of high frequency parts of the solution which involve the supercritical norm as a factor of the upper bounds. Finally, we superpose the energy norm of high frequency parts of the solution to get estimates of the critical and subcritical norms independent of the viscosity coefficient for the weak solution via the re-scaling argument.</description>

      <title>On mode transition algebras for $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebras and applications to bosonic ghosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the mode transition algebras and Zhu algebras in the setting of $\mathbb{Z}$-graded vertex algebras, with particular focus on the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 (also known as bosonic ghosts or the $\beta\gamma$-system). We show that the mode transition algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 admit unity elements that form a family of strong unities in the sense of Damiolini-Gibney-Krashen. The existence of unities for the mode transition algebra of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 allows us to explicitly construct all higher level Zhu algebras of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2. We further analyze weak modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 induced from Zhu algebras, proving that every such module is already induced from the level-zero Zhu algebra. We then prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules induced from a Zhu algebra are not weakly interlocked, and hence not strongly interlocked in the sense of Barron-Batistelli-Orosz Hunziker-Yamskulna. More generally, we show that the property of being weakly interlocked is preserved under the action of an invertible Li's $\mathbf{\Delta}$ operator. As an application, we prove that all indecomposable reducible weight modules of the Weyl vertex algebra at central charge 2 obtained via spectral flow of Zhu-induced modules are likewise not weakly interlocked. These results clarify the role of being weakly interlocked in the modularity properties of bosonic ghost modules previously studied by Ridout-Wood and Allen-Wood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have previously observed that the theory of solutions of partial differential equations, regarded as diffieties inside jet bundles, acquires a powerful comonadic formulation after passage from the category of Fr\'echet smooth manifolds to the Cahiers topos of formal smooth sets (a well-adapted model for Synthetic Differential Geometry). However, the tacit assumption that this passage preserves the projective limits that define infinite jet bundles had remained unproven. Here we provide a detailed proof.</description>

      <title>On the escape rate for intermittent maps with holes shrinking around the indifferent fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study non-uniformly expanding maps of the unit interval with a parabolic fixed point at the origin that admit an ergodic absolutely continuous invariant measure, which may be finite or infinite. By introducing a hole defined by an interval containing the parabolic fixed point, we analyze the escape rate of the resulting open system and its asymptotic behavior as the hole shrinks. Our approach relies on the transfer operator associated with the dynamical system and on the relationship between the transfer operators of the original system and its induced version. The results extend to this general framework previous investigations which considered special cases.</description>

      <title>The Recovery of Semilinear Potentials Satisfying Null Conditions From Scattering Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct oscillatory solutions of fully semilinear wave equations in Minkowski space satisfying a null condition of the form $$\square u:=(-\partial_{x_0}^2 +\sum_{j=1}^n \partial_{x_j}^2 )u= q(x,u)((\partial_{x_0}u)^2-|\nabla_{x'}u|^2),$$ $$x=(x_0,x'), \;\ x'=(x_1,\ldots, x_n) \text{ and } x_0=t \text{ is the time variable,}$$ on an interval $x_0\in [-T,T]$, $T&lt;\infty$ arbitrary, which consist of the superposition of a non-oscillatory background solution and a single phase train of highly oscillatory waves of wave length $h\ll1$ and amplitudes given by powers of $h$; the waves interact with the nonlinearity and we measure the response $u(x_0,x')|_{x_0=T'}$ at a fixed time $x_0=T'&lt;T$.
  We show that the coefficient of amplitude $h$ of the oscillatory part of the nonlinear geometric optics expansion of the solution determines the light-ray transform of a vector field associated with $q(x,u)$, which determines $q(x,u)$ uniquely in the maximal region determined by the data. Our methods also work for systems of semilinear wave equations satisfying null conditions, but in this paper we focus on the scalar case.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points in Gaussian channels: diffusion gauging and drift-governed spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: McDonald and Clerk [Phys.\ Rev.\ Research 5, 033107 (2023)] showed that for linear open quantum systems the Liouvillian spectrum is independent of the noise strength. We first make this noise-independence principle precise in continuous time for multimode bosonic Gaussian Markov semigroups: for Hurwitz drift, a time-independent Gaussian similarity fixed by the Lyapunov equation gauges away diffusion for all times, so eigenvalues and non-diagonalizability are controlled entirely by the drift, while diffusion determines steady states and the structure of eigenoperators. We then extend the same separation to discrete time for general stable multimode bosonic Gaussian channels: for any stable Gaussian channel, we construct an explicit Gaussian similarity transformation that gauges away diffusion at the level of the channel parametrization. We illustrate the method with a single-mode squeezed-reservoir Lindbladian and with a non-Markovian family of single-mode Gaussian channels, where the exceptional-point manifolds and the associated gauging covariances can be obtained analytically.</description>

      <title>GW/DT invariants and 5D BPS indices for strips from topological recursion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological string theory partition function gives rise to Gromov-Witten invariants, Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 5D BPS indices. Using the remodeling conjecture, which connects Topological Recursion with topological string theory for toric Calabi-Yau threefolds, we study a more direct connection for the subclass of strip geometries. In doing so, new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$-$y$ duality. Through these techniques, our main result in this paper is a direct derivation of all free energies from topological recursion for general strip geometries. In analyzing the expression of free energy, we shed some light on the meaning and the influence of the $x$-$y$ duality in topological string theory and its interconnection to GW and DT invariants as well as the 5D BPS index.</description>

      <title>Foundations and Fundamental Properties of a Two-Parameter Memory-Weighted Velocity Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a **memory-weighted velocity operator** \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}\) as a mathematical framework for describing rates of change in systems with time-varying, power-law memory. The operator employs two independent continuous exponents \(\alpha(t)\) and \(\beta(t)\) that separately weight past state increments and elapsed time scaling, motivated by physical systems where these memory aspects may evolve differently -- such as viscoelastic materials with stress-dependent relaxation or anomalous transport with history-dependent characteristics.
  We establish the operator's foundational properties: an explicit integral representation, linearity, and **continuous dependence** on the memory exponents with respect to uniform convergence. Central to the analysis are **weighted pointwise estimates** revealing how the exponent difference \(\beta(t)-\alpha(t)\) modulates \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x](t)\), leading to conditions under which \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}\) defines a bounded linear operator between standard function spaces. These estimates exhibit a natural compensation mechanism between the two memory weightings.
  For the uniform-memory case \(\alpha=\beta\equiv1\), we prove that \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}[x](t)\) **asymptotically recovers** the classical derivative \(\dot{x}(0)\) as \(t\to 0^{+}\), ensuring consistency with local calculus. The mathematical framework is supported by self-contained technical appendices. By decoupling the memory weighting of state increments from that of elapsed time, \(\mathscr{V}_{\alpha,\beta}\) provides a structured approach to modeling systems with independently evolving memory characteristics, offering potential utility in formulating evolution equations for complex physical processes with non-stationary memory.</description>

Abstract: We prove the equivalence of VOA tensor categories and conformal net tensor categories for the following examples: all WZW models; all lattice VOAs; all unitary parafermion VOAs; type $ADE$ discrete series $W$-algebras; their tensor products; their regular cosets. A new proof of the complete rationality of conformal nets is also given.</description>

      <title>On rationality for $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be an $\mathbb{N}$-graded, simple, self-contragredient, $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra. We show that if the $S$-transformation of the character of $V$ is a linear combination of characters of $V$-modules, then the category $\mathcal{C}$ of grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules is a rigid tensor category. We further show, without any assumption on the character of $V$ but assuming that $\mathcal{C}$ is rigid, that $\mathcal{C}$ is a factorizable finite ribbon category, that is, a not-necessarily-semisimple modular tensor category. As a consequence, we show that if the Zhu algebra of $V$ is semisimple, then $\mathcal{C}$ is semisimple and thus $V$ is rational. The proofs of these theorems use techniques and results from tensor categories together with the method of Moore-Seiberg and Huang for deriving identities of two-point genus-one correlation functions associated to $V$. We give two main applications. First, we prove the conjecture of Kac-Wakimoto and Arakawa that $C_2$-cofinite affine $W$-algebras obtained via quantum Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of admissible-level affine vertex algebras are strongly rational. The proof uses the recent result of Arakawa and van Ekeren that such $W$-algebras have semisimple (Ramond twisted) Zhu algebras. Second, we use our rigidity results to reduce the "coset rationality problem" to the problem of $C_2$-cofiniteness for the coset. That is, given a vertex operator algebra inclusion $U\otimes V\hookrightarrow A$ with $A$, $U$ strongly rational and $U$, $V$ a pair of mutual commutant subalgebras in $A$, we show that $V$ is also strongly rational provided it is $C_2$-cofinite.</description>

      <title>Determinantally equivalent nonzero functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02471v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem raised in [Marco Stevens, Equivalent symmetric kernels of determinantal point processes, RMTA, 10(03):2150027, 2021] concerning the extension of its main result to the more general (potentially non-symmetric) setting. We construct a counterexample disproving the conjecture proposed in the paper, and subsequently solve it under some additional minor assumptions that preclude such counterexamples.
  The problem is plainly stated as follows: Let $\Lambda$ be a set and $\mathbb{F}$ a field, and suppose that $K,Q:\Lambda^2\to\mathbb{F}$ are two functions such that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}$ and $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n\in\Lambda$, the determinants of matrices $(K(x_i,x_j))_{1\leq i,j\leq n}$ and $(Q(x_i,x_j))_{1\leq i,j\leq n}$ agree. What are all the possible transformations that transform $Q$ into $K$? In [Marco Stevens, Equivalent symmetric kernels of determinantal point processes, RMTA, 10(03):2150027, 2021] the following two were conjectured: $(Tf)(x,y)=f(y,x)$; and $(Tf)(x,y)=g(x)g(y)^{-1}f(x,y)$ for some nowhere-zero function $g$. In the same paper, this conjectured classification is verified in the case of symmetric functions $K$ and $Q$. By extending the graph-theoretic techniques of the paper, we show that under some surprisingly simple and natural conditions the conjecture remains valid even with the symmetry constraints relaxed.
  By taking $\Lambda$ finite, the above problem, furthermore, reduces to that between two square matrices investigated in [Raphael Loewy, Principal minors and diagonal similarity of matrices, Linear Algebra and its Applications 78 (1986), 23--64]. Hence, our paper presents a simple non-linear-algebraic proof that uses only some elementary combinatorics and three simple algebraic identities involving $3$-cycles and $4$-cycles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07398v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the theory of principal $\infty$-bundles of Niklaus-Schreiber-Steveson, we develop a homotopy categorification of Hopf algebras, which model quantum groups. We study their higher-representation theory in the setting of $\mathsf{2Vect}^{hBC}$, which is a homotopy refinement of the notion of 2-vector spaces due to Baez-Crans that allows for higher coherence data. We construct in particular the 2-quantum double as a homotopy double crossed product, and prove its duality and factorization properties. We also define and characterize "2-$R$-matrices", which can be seen as an extension of the usual notion of $R$-matrix in an ordinary Hopf algebra. We found that the 2-Yang-Baxter equations describe the braiding of extended defects in 4d, distinct from but not unlike the Zamolodchikov tetrahedron equations. The main results we prove in this paper is that the 2-representation 2-category of a weak 2-bialgebra is braided monoidal if it is equipped with a universal 2-$R$-matrix, and that our homotopy quantization admits the theory of Lie 2-bialgebras as a semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hodge Theorem: curl and asymmetric pseudodifferential projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02015v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to the study of spectral asymmetry. Working with the operator $\operatorname{curl}:=*\mathrm{d}$ on a connected oriented closed Riemannian 3-manifold, we construct, by means of microlocal analysis, the asymmetry operator -- a scalar pseudodifferential operator of order $-3$. The latter is completely determined by the Riemannian manifold and its orientation, and encodes information about spectral asymmetry. The asymmetry operator generalises and contains the classical eta invariant traditionally associated with the asymmetry of the spectrum, which can be recovered by computing its regularised operator trace. Remarkably, the whole construction is direct and explicit.</description>

      <title>Differential operators on the base affine space of $SL_n$ and quantized Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the algebra $D_\hbar(SL_n/U)$ of differential operators on the base affine space of $SL_n$ is the quantized Coulomb branch of a certain 3d $\mathcal{N} = 4$ quiver gauge theory. In the semiclassical limit this proves a conjecture of Dancer-Hanany-Kirwan about the universal hyperk\"ahler implosion of $SL_n$. We also formulate and prove a generalization identifying the Hamiltonian reduction of $T^* SL_n$ with respect to an arbitrary unipotent character as a Coulomb branch. As an application of our results, we provide a new interpretation of the Gelfand-Graev symmetric group action on $D_\hbar(SL_n/U)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16673v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The McVittie metric does not describe a physical black hole in an expanding Universe because the curvature scalar and pressure at its event horizon are infinite. We show that extending this metric to an inhomogeneous scale factor, which depends on both the time and radial coordinate, removes those infinities by imposing at the horizon the constancy of the Hubble parameter and a particular constraint on the gradient of the scale factor. We consider a special case of this metric, and show that the Hubble parameters at the event horizons of all centrally symmetric black holes are equal to the same constant $H_\textrm{hor}=(\Lambda/3)^{1/2}$. Because of this equality and the equivalence to the Kottler metric near the horizon, black holes do not grow with the Universe expansion.</description>

      <title>Third-quantized master equations as a classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Third quantization is used in open quantum systems to construct a superoperator basis in which quadratic Lindbladians can be turned into a normal form. From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third quantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain the dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce an alternative basis for third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the $Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator coherent-state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>$N=1$ super Virasoro tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the category of $C_1$-cofinite modules for the universal $N=1$ super Virasoro vertex operator superalgebra $\mathcal{S}(c,0)$ at any central charge $c$ is locally finite and admits the vertex algebraic braided tensor category structure of Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang. For central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)=\frac{15}{2}-3(t+t^{-1})$ with $t\notin\mathbb{Q}$, we show that this tensor category is semisimple, rigid, and slightly degenerate, and we determine its fusion rules. For central charge $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(1)=\frac{3}{2}$, we show that this tensor category is rigid and that its simple modules have the same fusion rules as $\mathrm{Rep}\,\mathfrak{osp}(1\vert 2)$, in agreement with earlier fusion rule calculations of Milas. Finally, for the remaining central charges $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ with $t\in \mathbb{Q}^\times$, we show that the simple $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-module $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ of lowest conformal weight $h^{\mathfrak{ns}}_{2,2}(t)=\frac{3(t-1)^2}{8t}$ is rigid and self-dual, except possibly when $t^{\pm 1}$ is a negative integer or when $c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t)$ is the central charge of a rational $N=1$ superconformal minimal model.
  As $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is expected to generate the category of $C_1$-cofinite $\mathcal{S}(c^{\mathfrak{ns}}(t),0)$-modules under fusion, rigidity of $\mathcal{S}_{2,2}$ is the first key step to proving rigidity of this category for general $t\in\mathbb{Q}^\times$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of gauge covariant renormalisation of stochastic 3D Yang-Mills-Higgs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local solutions to the 3D stochastic quantisation equations of Yang-Mills-Higgs were constructed in (arXiv:2201.03487), and it was shown that, in the limit of smooth mollifications, there exists a mass renormalisation of the Yang-Mills field such that the solution is gauge covariant. In this paper we prove uniqueness of the mass renormalisation that leads to gauge covariant solutions. This strengthens the main result of (arXiv:2201.03487), and is potentially important for the identification of the limit of other approximations, such as lattice dynamics. Our proof relies on systematic short-time expansions of singular stochastic PDEs and of regularised Wilson loops. We also strengthen the recently introduced state spaces to allow finer control on line integrals appearing in expansions of Wilson loops.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced by fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue is in some cases a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing. Transitions similar to the noise-driven case can only occur if the amplitude of the chaotic forcing is large enough. If this is the case, in our numerical example - a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) - we observe the chaotic Kramers' law to hold even when the chaotic forcing is far from the stochastic limit. We discuss the limitations of the chaotic Kramers' law, how to address the numerical issues associated with the timescale separation, and give a possible explanation for the dynamics of recently found AMOC collapses and recoveries in complex climate models.</description>

      <title>Erasure cost of a quantum process: A thermodynamic meaning of the dynamical min-entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05307v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical operation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and information processing. We investigate the thermodynamic costs associated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we analyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary input-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the ground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced dynamics -- that is, the minimal thermodynamic work cost to erase the logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to the ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input state. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional to the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the dynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. The dynamical min-entropy can take positive and negative values, depending on the underlying quantum dynamics. The negative value of the erasure cost implies that the extraction of thermodynamic work is possible instead of its consumption during the process. A key foundation of this result is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates the decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Velocity Profiles for Homoenergetic Rayleigh-Boltzmann Flows under Dominant Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a particular class of solutions to the Rayleigh--Boltzmann equation, known in the nonlinear setting as \emph{homoenergetic solutions}. These solutions take the form $ g(x, v, t) = f(v - L(t)x, t),$ where the matrix $L(t)$ represents a shear flow deformation. We began our analysis in \cite{MNV}, where we rigorously proved the existence of a stationary non-equilibrium solution and established different behaviours of the solutions depending on the size of the shear parameter, for cut-off collision kernels with homogeneity parameter $0 \leq \gamma &lt; 1$, thus including Maxwell molecules and hard potentials. In the present work, we focus on the regime in which the deformation term dominates the collision term for large times (hyperbolic-dominated regime). This scenario occurs for collision kernels with $\gamma &lt; 0$; in particular, we focus on the range $\gamma \in (-1, 0)$. In this regime, it is challenging to obtain a clear and direct description of the long-time asymptotic behaviour of the solutions. Here we present a formal analysis of the velocity distribution's long-time asymptotics and derive for the first time the explicit form of the corresponding asymptotic profile. We also discuss the different asymptotic behaviour expected in the case of homogeneity $\gamma &lt; -1$. In addition, we provide a probabilistic interpretation involving a stochastic process combining collisions with shear flow. The tagged particle velocity $\{v(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a Markov process that arises from the combination of free flights in a shear flow along with random jumps caused by collisions.</description>

Abstract: Traditional interpretations of quantum mechanics often present a dichotomy: either the wavefunction collapses upon measurement (Copenhagen), violating unitarity, or the entire universe branches into countless parallel worlds (Many-Worlds), with significant ontological proliferation. The Branched Hilbert Subspace Interpretation (BHSI) resolves this tension by introducing branching strictly within local Hilbert spaces. This framework reinterprets scenarios such as the Einstein 1927 electron-diffraction thought experiment, in which all quantum events are confined to a local Hilbert space, allowing the Born rule to emerge naturally from branch weights. Crucially, BHSI treats branching as a dynamical process tied to information recording. This leads to a testable proposal: a dual-layer experiment in which the particle transit time between layers is shorter than the sensor response time, enabling a direct probe of measurement timing and mismatched or uncommitted outcomes. We argue that a quantum system behaves as a unified whole, an island of coherence, within which unitary branching is confined to the system boundary, without observable correlations with distant, unentangled systems. Finally, we show that quantum nonlocality (e.g., in Bell tests or tunneling) arises naturally from the intrinsic vector-space structure of local Hilbert spaces, rather than from superluminal signaling.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of quantum processes: An operational framework for free energy and reversible athermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the thermodynamics of quantum processes (quantum channels) by axiomatically introducing the free energy for channels, defined via the quantum relative entropy with an absolutely thermal channel whose fixed output is in equilibrium with a thermal reservoir. This definition finds strong support through its operational interpretations in designated quantum information and thermodynamic tasks. We construct a resource theory of athermality for quantum processes, where free operations are Gibbs preserving superchannels and golden units are unitary channels with respect to absolutely thermal channel having fully degenerate output Hamiltonian. We exactly characterize the one-shot distillation and formation of quantum channels using hypothesis-testing and max-relative entropy with respect to the absolutely thermal channel. These rates converge asymptotically to the channel free energy (up to a multiplicative factor of half the inverse temperature), establishing its operational meaning and proving the asymptotic reversibility of the athermality. We show the direct relation between the resource theory of athermality and quantum information tasks such as private randomness and purity distillation, and thermodynamic tasks of erasure and work extraction. Our work connects the core thermodynamic concepts of free energy, energy, entropy, and maximal extractable work of quantum processes to their information processing capabilities.</description>

      <title>Madelung hydrodynamics of spin-orbit coupling: action principles, currents, and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear in quantum hydrodynamics with spin. While the latter spin-hydrodynamic forces relate to the quantum geometric tensor (QGT), SOC-induced orbital forces originate from a particular current operator that contributes prominently to the spin current. This distinction between force terms reveals two fundamentally different mechanisms generating quantum spin-orbit correlations. Leveraging the Hamiltonian structure of the hydrodynamic system, we also elucidate spin transport features such as the correlation-induced quantum torques and the current shift in the spin Hall effect. This Hall shift leads to a new definition of the transport spin current thereby addressing an open question in spintronics. Finally, we illustrate the framework via the Madelung--Rashba equations for planar SOC configurations and propose a particle-based scheme for numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced posterior sampling via diffusion models for efficient metasurfaces inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse design of metasurfaces faces inherent challenges due to the nonlinear and highly complex relationship between geometric configurations and their electromagnetic behavior. Traditional optimization approaches often suffer from excessive computational demands and a tendency to converge to suboptimal solutions. This study presents a diffusion-based generative framework that incorporates a dedicated consistency constraint and advanced posterior sampling methods to ensure adherence to desired electromagnetic specifications. Through rigorous validation on small-scale metasurface configurations, the proposed approach demonstrates marked enhancements in both accuracy and reliability of the generated designs. Furthermore, we introduce a scalable methodology that extends inverse design capabilities to large-scale metasurfaces, validated for configurations of up to $98 \times 98$ nanopillars. Notably, this approach enables rapid design generation completed in minute by leveraging models trained on substantially smaller arrays ($23 \times 23$). These innovations establish a robust and efficient framework for high-precision metasurface inverse design.</description>
