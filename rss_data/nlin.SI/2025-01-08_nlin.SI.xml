      <title>Breather gas and shielding for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Breathers have been experimentally and theoretically found in many physical systems -- in particular, in integrable nonlinear-wave models. A relevant problem is to study the \textit{breather gas}, which is the limit, for $N\rightarrow \infty $, of $N$-breather solutions. In this paper, we investigate the breather gas in the framework of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation with nonzero boundary conditions, using the inverse scattering transform and Riemann-Hilbert problem. We address aggregate states in the form of $N$-breather solutions, when the respective discrete spectra are concentrated in specific domains. We show that the breather gas coagulates into a single-breather solution whose spectral eigenvalue is located at the center of the circle domain, and a multi-breather solution for the higher-degree quadrature concentration domain. These coagulation phenomena in the breather gas are called \textit{breather shielding}. In particular, when the nonzero boundary conditions vanish, the breather gas reduces to an $n$-soliton solution. When the discrete eigenvalues are concentrated on a line, we derive the corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem. When the discrete spectrum is uniformly distributed within an ellipse, it is equivalent to the case of the line domain. These results may be useful to design experiments with breathers in physical settings.</description>

      <title>On the $N_\infty$-soliton asymptotics for the modified Camassa-Holm equation with linear dispersion and vanishing boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the $N_{\infty}$-soliton asymptotics for the modified Camassa-Holm (mCH) equation with linear dispersion and boundaries vanishing at infinity: $m_t+(m(u^2-u_x^2)^2)_x+\kappa u_x=0,\quad m=u-u_{xx}$ with $\lim_{x\rightarrow \pm \infty }u(x,t)=0$. We mainly analyze the aggregation state of $N$-soliton solutions of the mCH equation expressed by the solution of the modified Riemann-Hilbert problem in the new $(y,t)$-space when the discrete spectra are located in different regions. Starting from the modified RH problem, we find that i) when the region is a quadrature domain with $\ell=n=1$, the corresponding $N_{\infty}$-soliton is the one-soliton solution which the discrete spectral point is the center of the region; ii) when the region is a quadrature domain with $\ell=n$, the corresponding $N_{\infty}$-soliton is an $n$-soliton solution; iii) when the discrete spectra lie in the line region, we provide its corresponding Riemann-Hilbert problem,; and iv) when the discrete spectra lie in an elliptic region, it is equivalent to the case of the line region.</description>

      <title>On Large-Space and Long-Time Asymptotic Behaviors of Kink-Soliton Gases in the Sine-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the large-space and long-time asymptotics of kink-soliton gases in the sine-Gordon (sG) equation, addressing an important open problem highlighted in the recent work [Phys. Rev. E 109 (2024) 061001]. We focus on kink-soliton gases modeled within a Riemann-Hilbert framework and characterized by two types of generalized reflection coefficients, each defined on the interval $[\eta_1, \eta_2]$: $r_0(\lambda) = (\lambda - \eta_1)^{\beta_1} (\eta_2 - \lambda)^{\beta_2} |\lambda - \eta_0|^{\beta_0} \gamma(\lambda)$ and $r_c(\lambda) = (\lambda - \eta_1)^{\beta_1} (\eta_2 - \lambda)^{\beta_2} \chi_c(\lambda) \gamma(\lambda)$, where $0 &lt; \eta_1 &lt; \eta_0 &lt; \eta_2$ and $\beta_j &gt; -1$, \(\gamma(\lambda)\) is a continuous, strictly positive function defined on $[\eta_1, \eta_2]$. The function \(\chi_c(\lambda)\) demonstrates a step-like behavior: it is given by \(\chi_c(\lambda) = 1\) for \(\lambda \in [\eta_1, \eta_0)\) and \(\chi_c(\lambda) = c^2\) for \(\lambda \in (\eta_0, \eta_2]\), with \(c\) as a positive constant distinct from one. To rigorously derive the asymptotic results, we leverage the Deift-Zhou steepest descent method. A central component of this approach is constructing an appropriate \(g\)-function for the conjugation process. Unlike in the KdV equation, the sG presents unique challenges for \(g\)-function formulation, particularly concerning the singularity at the origin. The Riemann-Hilbert problem also requires carefully constructed local parametrices near endpoints \(\eta_j\) and the singularity \(\eta_0\). At the endpoints \(\eta_j\), we employ a modified Bessel parametrix of the first kind. For the singularity \(\eta_0\), the parametrix selection depends on the reflection coefficient: the second kind of modified Bessel parametrix is used for \(r_0(\lambda)\), while a confluent hypergeometric parametrix is applied for \(r_c(\lambda)\).</description>

      <title>Connection formulae for the radial Toda equations I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first in a forthcoming series of works where the authors study the global asymptotic behavior of the radial solutions of the 2D periodic Toda equation of type $A_n$. The principal issue is the connection formulae between the asymptotic parameters describing the behavior of the general solution at zero and infinity. To reach this goal we are using a fusion of the PDE analysis and the Riemann-Hilbert nonlinear steepest descent method of Deift and Zhou which is applicable to 2D Toda in view of its Lax integrability. A principal technical challenge is the extension of the nonlinear steepest descent analysis to Riemann-Hilbert problems of matrix rank greater than $2$. In this paper, we meet this challenge for the case $n=2$ (the rank $3$ case) and it already captures the principal features of the general $n$ case.</description>
