      <title>Research on Credit Risk Early Warning Model of Commercial Banks Based on Neural Network Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of globalized financial markets, commercial banks are confronted with an escalating magnitude of credit risk, thereby imposing heightened requisites upon the security of bank assets and financial stability. This study harnesses advanced neural network techniques, notably the Backpropagation (BP) neural network, to pioneer a novel model for preempting credit risk in commercial banks. The discourse initially scrutinizes conventional financial risk preemptive models, such as ARMA, ARCH, and Logistic regression models, critically analyzing their real-world applications. Subsequently, the exposition elaborates on the construction process of the BP neural network model, encompassing network architecture design, activation function selection, parameter initialization, and objective function construction. Through comparative analysis, the superiority of neural network models in preempting credit risk in commercial banks is elucidated. The experimental segment selects specific bank data, validating the model's predictive accuracy and practicality. Research findings evince that this model efficaciously enhances the foresight and precision of credit risk management.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning the Efficient Frontier of Convex Vector Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07077v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a neural network architecture to approximate the weakly efficient frontier of convex vector optimization problems (CVOP) satisfying Slater's condition. The proposed machine learning methodology provides both an inner and outer approximation of the weakly efficient frontier, as well as an upper bound to the error at each approximated efficient point. In numerical case studies we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is effectively able to approximate the true weakly efficient frontier of CVOPs. This remains true even for large problems (i.e., many objectives, variables, and constraints) and thus overcoming the curse of dimensionality.</description>
