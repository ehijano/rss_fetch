      <title>CHEX-MATE: Dynamical masses for a sample of 101 Planck Sunyaev-Zeldovich-selected galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation (CHEX-MATE) is a programme to study a minimally biased sample of 118 galaxy clusters detected by Planck through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. Accurate and precise mass measurements are required to exploit CHEX-MATE as an astrophysical laboratory and a calibration sample for cosmological probes in the era of large surveys. We measured masses based on the galaxy dynamics, which are highly complementary to weak-lensing or X-ray estimates. We analysed the sample with a uniform pipeline that is stable both for poorly sampled or rich clusters - using spectroscopic redshifts from public (NED, SDSS, and DESI) or private archives - and dedicated observational programmes. We modelled the halo mass density and the anisotropy profile. Membership is confirmed with a cleaning procedure in phase space. We derived masses from measured velocity dispersions under the assumed model. We measured dynamical masses for 101 CHEX-MATE clusters with at least ten confirmed members within the virial radius r_200c. Estimated redshifts and velocity dispersions agree with literature values when available. Validation with weak-lensing masses shows agreement within 8+-16(stat.)+-5(sys.)%, and confirms dynamical masses as an unbiased proxy. Comparison with {\it Planck} masses shows them to be biased low by 34+-3(stat.)+-5(sys.)%. A follow-up spectroscopic campaign is underway to cover the full CHEX-MATE sample.</description>

      <title>Baryon-free $S_8$ tension with Stage IV cosmic shear surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately modelling matter power spectrum effects at small scales, such as baryonic feedback, is essential to avoid significant bias in the estimation of cosmological parameters with cosmic shear. However, Stage IV surveys like LSST will be so precise that significant information can still be extracted from large scales alone. In this work, we simulate LSST Y1-like mock data and perform a cosmic shear analysis, considering different models of baryonic feedback. To focus on large scales, we apply physically motivated scale cuts which account for the redshift dependence of the multipoles in the tomographic bin. Our main focus is to study the changes in the constraining power of $S_8$ and $\Omega_m$ parameters and assess possible effects on the tension with Planck measurements. We find that the $S_8$ tension is clearly detectable at $k_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}=0.20\,h\rm Mpc^{-1}$ in the analysis where we imposed a DES-sized tension, and at $k_{\rm eff}^{\rm max}=0.10\,h\rm Mpc^{-1}$ with a KiDS-sized tension, regardless of whether an incorrect model for baryons is assumed. However, to achieve these results, LSST will need high precision measurement of the redshift distributions, with photo-$z$ biases of the order of $10^{-3}$. Without this, the ability to constrain cosmological parameters independently of baryonic feedback - particularly regarding the $S_8$ tension - will be compromised.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic superfluids in cosmology from a relativistic approach: Revisiting two formulations of superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two formulations of superfluidity are reviewed: Landau's phenomenological two-fluid model and a relativistic effective field theory description. We demonstrate how the two-fluid formalism can be recovered from the nonrelativistic limit of the relativistic effective theory at finite temperatures. We show how self-gravitating, nonrelativistic superfluids are obtained from the Newtonian limit of the relativistic approach on curved spaces. The concepts are presented in an accessible manner for readers who may not be deeply familiar with superfluidity from a condensed matter perspective.</description>

      <title>Exploring the physical origins of halo assembly bias from early times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale linear halo bias encodes the relation between the clustering of dark-matter (DM) halos and that of the underlying matter density field. Although the primary dependence of bias on halo mass is well understood in the context of structure formation, the physical origins of the multiple additional relations at fixed halo mass, commonly known as secondary halo bias, have not been fully elucidated. Of particular relevance is the secondary dependence on halo assembly history, known as halo assembly bias. Our goal is to determine whether the properties of the initial regions from which $z=0$ halos originate produce any secondary bias at $z=0$. By analyzing these initial dependencies in connection with halo assembly bias, we intend to provide insight on the physical origins of the effect. To this end, we select halos at $z=0$ in the IllustrisTNG DM-only simulation and trace back the positions and velocities of their DM particles to $z=12$. The resulting initial regions are characterized according to several shape-related and kinematic properties. The secondary bias signal produced by these properties at $z=0$ is measured using an object-by-object bias estimator, which offers significant analytical advantages. We show that, when split by the properties of their initial DM clouds, $z=0$ halos display significant secondary bias, clearly exceeding the amplitude of the well-known halo assembly bias signal produced by concentration and age. The maximum bias segregation is measured for cloud velocity dispersion and radial velocity, followed by cloud concentration, sphericity, ellipticity and triaxiality. We further show that both velocity dispersion and radial velocity are also the properties of the initial clouds that most strongly correlate with halo age and concentration at fixed halo mass. Our results highlight the importance of linear effects in shaping halo assembly bias.</description>

      <title>Using Cartesian slice plots of a cosmological simulation as input of a convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a uniform partitioning of cubic cells, we cover the total volume of a $\Lambda$CDM cosmological simulation based on particles. We define a visualisation cell as a spatial extension of the cubic cell, so that we collect all simulation particles contained in this visualisation cell to create a series of Cartesian plots in which the over-density of matter is clearly visible. We then use these plots as input to a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the Keras library and TensorFlow for image classification. To assign a class to each plot, we approximate the Hessian of the gravitational potential in the centre of the cubic cells. Each selected cubic cell is then assigned a label of 1,2 or 3, depending on the number of positive eigenvalues obtained for the Householder reduction of the Hessian matrix. We apply the CNN to several models, including two models with different visualisation volumes, one with a cell size of type L (large) and the other with a cell type S (small). A third model that combines the plots of the previous L and S cell types. So far, we have mainly considered a slice parallel to the XY plane to make the plots. The last model is considered based on visualisations of cells that also include slices parallel to the ZX and ZY planes. We find that the accuracy in classificating plots is acceptable, and the ability of the models to predict the class works well. These results allow us to demonstrate the aim of this paper, namely that the usual Cartesian plots contain enough information to identify the observed structures of the cosmic web.</description>

      <title>Modelling the covariance matrix for the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction plays a crucial role in cosmological analysis for spectroscopic galaxy surveys because it can make the density field effectively more linear and more Gaussian. The combination of the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction helps break degeneracies among parameters, then improve the constraints on cosmological parameters. It is therefore important to estimate the covariance matrix between pre- and post-reconstructed power spectra. In this work, we use perturbation theory to estimate the covariance matrix of the related power spectra multipoles, and check the accuracy of the derived covariance model using a large suite of dark matter halo catalogs at $z=0.5$. We find that the diagonal part of the auto covariance is well described by the Gaussian prediction, while the cross covariance deviates from the Gaussian prediction quickly when $k &gt; 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we find the non-Gaussian effect in the non-diagonal part of the cross covariance is comparable to, or even stronger than the pre-reconstruction covariance. By adding the non-Gaussian contribution, we obtain good agreement between analytical and numerical covariance matrices in the non-diagonal part up to $k \simeq 0.15\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The agreement in the diagonal part is also improved, but still under-predicts the correlation in the cross covariance block.</description>

      <title>On Evidence for Elastic Interactions in the Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing quality of cosmological data has revealed some tensions that could be signalling the necessity of incorporating new physics into our cosmological model. One particularly intriguing possibility is the existence of elastic interactions between dark matter and dark energy. Not only do these interactions provide a natural mechanism to relief cosmological tensions, but there is also compelling observational evidence for them, to the extent that a detection could even be claimed. We review the potential of these scenarios in relation to the cosmological tensions and discuss distinctive signatures that can be probed with future data, thus providing a smoking gun for these interactions.</description>

      <title>SENSEI at SNOLAB: Single-Electron Event Rate and Implications for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from data acquired by the SENSEI experiment at SNOLAB after a major upgrade in May 2023, which includes deploying 16 new sensors and replacing the copper trays that house the CCDs with a new light-tight design. We observe a single-electron event rate of $(1.39 \pm 0.11) \times 10^{-5}$ e$^-$/pix/day, corresponding to $(39.8 \pm 3.1)$ e$^-$/gram/day. This is an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the previous lowest single-electron rate in a silicon detector and the lowest for any photon detector in the near-infrared-ultraviolet range. We use these data to obtain a 90% confidence level upper bound of $1.53 \times 10^{-5}$ e$^-$/pix/day and to set constraints on sub-GeV dark matter candidates that produce single-electron events. We hypothesize that the data taken at SNOLAB in the previous run, with an older tray design for the sensors, contained a larger rate of single-electron events due to light leaks. We test this hypothesis using data from the SENSEI detector located in the MINOS cavern at Fermilab.</description>

      <title>Gravothermalizing into primordial black holes, boson stars, and cannibal stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very little is known about the cosmological history from after the end of inflation until Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Various well-motivated models predict that the universe could have undergone a period of matter domination in this early epoch. We demonstrate that if the particles causing matter domination have self-interactions, they can form halos that undergo a gravothermal collapse. This scenario, in principle, provides a novel way to produce primordial black holes within the mass range of $1$ to $10^{26}$ g. We also find that it is not only black holes that can form in the aftermath of a gravothermal evolution. In particular, we show that number-changing annihilations of the particles can create sufficient heat to halt the gravothermal evolution, thus forming a "cannibal star". Likewise, the pressure from the particle's repulsive self-interactions can form a boson star during a gravothermal evolution. Thus, our study highlights that structure formation in the early universe can have a rich complexity.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Quasi-Dilaton Massive Gravity with Non-minimal Kinetic Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the cosmological implications of the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with a non-minimal kinetic coupling. We investigate the resulting gravitational dynamics by introducing a nonzero mass for the graviton. We derive the complete set of background equations of motion and obtain self-accelerating background solutions to explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe using the effective cosmological constant originating from massive gravity. Furthermore, we derive the dispersion relation of gravitational waves to obtain the stability condition of the system. This allows us to use the propagation of gravitational perturbations in a Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology to constrain the quasi-dilaton massive gravity with a non-minimal kinetic coupling theory.</description>

      <title>Precise predictions for the QCD axion contribution to dark radiation with full phase-space evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the QCD axion contribution to the energy density of dark radiation, parameterized by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$, by solving Boltzmann equations for the momentum distribution functions including the effects of quantum statistics for all particles involved in the axion production processes. This approach gives precise prediction for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ independently on whether axions are produced via freeze-out or freeze-in. We focus on axions produced via flavor-conserving and flavor-violating interactions with leptons. Our precise predictions for $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ can differ from those assuming thermal shape for the momentum distribution functions, as commonly done in the literature, by more than the experimental precision of future Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. Current lower limits on the axion couplings from Planck constraints on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ are also affected by our precise computation which, in particular, results in a strongly relaxed bound on flavor-violating axion couplings to tau lepton and muon or electron.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational waves: review and lessons learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) has provided a new tool to study the Universe, with the scientific return enriched when combined with established probes: electromagnetic (EM) radiation and energetic particles. Since the groundbreaking detection in 2017 of merging neutron stars producing GW emission, a gamma-ray burst and an optical 'kilonova', the field has grown rapidly. At present, no additional neutron star mergers have been jointly detected in GW and EM radiation, but with upgrades in EM and GW facilities now is a chance to take stock of almost a decade of observations. We discuss the motivations for following up GW sources and the basic challenges of searching large areas for a rapidly-evolving EM signal. We examine how the kilonova counterpart to GW170817 was discovered and the association confirmed, and outline some of the key physics enabled by this discovery. We then review the status of EM searches since 2017, highlighting areas where more information (in GW alerts or catalogs) can improve efficiency, and discuss what we have learned about kilonovae despite the lack of further multi-messenger detections. We discuss upcoming facilities and the many lessons learned, considering also how these could inform searches for lensed mergers.</description>

      <title>A theoretical investigation of far-infrared fine structure lines at $z&gt;6$ and of the origin of the [OIII]88/[CII]158 enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] The [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ luminosity ratios have shown to be promising tracers of the ionisation state and gas-phase metallicity of the ISM. Observations of galaxies at redshift $z &gt; 6$ show peculiarly higher [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios compared to local sources. No model has so far successfully managed to match the observed emission from both [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$ and [CII]$_{158\mu m}$ as well as their ratio. We use Cloudy to model the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$, [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$, [NII]$_{122\mu m}$ and [NIII]$_{57\mu m}$ emission lines of Ponos: a high-resolution ($m_{\mathrm{gas}} = 883.4\, M_{\odot}$) cosmological zoom-in simulation of a galaxy at redshift $z = 6.5$, which is post-processed using kramses-rt. We modify Carbon, Nitrogen and Oxygen abundances in our Cloudy models to obtain C/O and N/O abundance ratios respectively lower and higher than Solar, more in line with recent high-z observational constraints. We find [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios that are a factor of $\sim 5$ higher compared to models assuming solar abundances. Additionally, we find an overall better agreement of the simulation with high-z observational constraints of the [CII]$_{158\mu m}$-SFR and [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$-SFR relations. This shows that a lower C/O abundance ratio is essential to reproduce the enhanced [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{158\mu m}$ luminosity ratios observed at $z &gt; 6$. By assuming a super-solar N/O ratio, motivated by recent $z &gt; 6$ JWST observations, our models yield an [OIII]$_{88\mu m}$/[NII]$_{122\mu m}$ ratio of $1.3$, which, according to current theoretical models, would be more appropriate for a galaxy with a lower ionisation parameter than the one we estimated for Ponos.</description>

      <title>Gravitational and electromagnetic Cherenkov radiation constraints in modified dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by different approaches to quantum gravity, one could consider that Lorentz invariance is not an exact symmetry of nature at all energy scales. Following this spirit, modified dispersion relations have been used to encapsulate quantum gravity phenomenology. In the present work, we propose a class of Lorentz invariance violating phenomenological dispersion relations, which could be different for each particle species, to study the generalized vacuum Cherenkov radiation process. We identify the kinematic regions where the process is allowed and then compute the energy loss rate due to the emission of vacuum electromagnetic and gravitational Cherenkov radiation. Furthermore, we estimate constraints for the Lorentz invariance breaking parameters of protons and gravitons taking into account the existence (or absence) of vacuum gravitational Cherenkov radiation using ultra high energy cosmic ray detections.</description>

      <title>Thin-wall vacuum decay in the presence of a compact dimension meets the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposal of a rapid sign-switching cosmological constant in the late universe, mirroring a transition from anti-de Sitter (AdS) to de Sitter (dS) space, has significantly improved the fit to observational data and provides a compelling framework for ameliorating major cosmological tensions, such as the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. An attractive theoretical realisation that accommodates the AdS $\to$ dS transition relies on the Casimir forces of fields inhabiting the bulk of a 5-dimensional (5-dim) set up. Among the fields characterising the dark sector, there is a real scalar field $\phi$ endowed with a potential holding two local minima with very small difference in vacuum energy and bigger curvature (mass) of the lower one. Shortly after the false vacuum tunnels to its true vacuum state, $\phi$ becomes more massive and its contribution to the Casimir energy becomes exponentially suppressed. The tunneling process then changes the difference between the total number of fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom contributing to the quantum corrections of the vacuum energy, yielding the AdS $\to$ dS transition. We investigate the properties of this theoretical realisation to validate its main hypothesis and characterise free parameters of the model. We adopt the Coleman-de Luccia formalism for calculating the transition probability within the thin-wall approximation. We show that the Euclidean bounce configuration that drives the transition between $\phi$ vacua has associated at least a sixth order potential. We also show that distinctive features of the required vacuum decay to accommodate the AdS $\to$ dS transition are inconsistent with a 5-dim non-compact description of the instanton, for which the bounce is $O(5)$ symmetric, and instead call for a 5-dim instanton with a compact dimension, for which the bounce is $O(4)\times U(1)$ symmetric.</description>

      <title>SKATR: A Self-Supervised Summary Transformer for SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Square Kilometer Array will initiate a new era of radio astronomy by allowing 3D imaging of the Universe during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization. Modern machine learning is crucial to analyse the highly structured and complex signal. However, accurate training data is expensive to simulate, and supervised learning may not generalize. We introduce a self-supervised vision transformer, SKATR, whose learned encoding can be cheaply adapted for downstream tasks on 21cm maps. Focusing on regression and generative inference of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that SKATR representations are maximally informative and that SKATR generalises out-of-domain to differently-simulated, noised, and higher-resolution datasets.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating Gravitational Wave Background Search with a Network of Space-borne Triangular Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized gravitational wave backgrounds are predicted in many well-motivated models of inflation and phase transitions involving spontaneous parity violation. In this work, we investigate the detection of such parity-violating signals with the network of two space-borne triangular detectors. We derive the general analytical formula for the overlap reduction functions of networks composed of two triangular detectors, by exploiting the system's symmetrical properties under the long-wave approximation. Based on these results, we further assess the detectability of a parity-violating background with alternative LISA-Taiji network configurations. We find that the sensitivity to the parity-violating component can be significantly enhanced at low frequencies by adjusting the orientation of Taiji's constellation plane. This sensitivity gain is approximately an order of magnitude around the millihertz band, making the peak sensitivity comparable to that of the total intensity. This provides a promising opportunity to constrain various parity-violating theories in the millihertz band with upcoming space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of power-law cosmological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the stability analysis of power-law models, focusing on an alternative approach that differs significantly from the standard approaches used in studying power-law models. In the standard approach, stability is studied by reducing the system of background FRW equations to a one-dimensional system for a new background variable $X$ in terms of the number of e-foldings. However, we rewrote the equations, including $H$ also into the system and went on to do the calculations up to second order. We demonstrate by computing the deviations from the power-law exact solution to second-order and show that power-law contraction is never an attractor, regardless of parameter values. Our analysis shows that while first-order corrections align with existing interpretations, second-order corrections introduce significant deviations that cannot be explained by a simple time shift that explains the first-order diverging terms. We also support our claim with numerical results. This new insight has broader implications for the study of attractor behaviour of differential equation solutions and raises questions about the stability of scenarios like the ekpyrotic bounce driven by an exponential potential.</description>

      <title>Stimulated Emission of Dark Matter via Thermal Scattering: Novel Limits for Freeze-In and eV Cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, one of the present authors noticed a stimulated emission process of bosonic dark matter via the two-body decay of a mother particle in a thermal plasma similar to the operation principle of a laser in 2301.08735. In this paper, we show that in a $2 \to 2$ process, including a bosonic final particle (e.g., an axion or dark photon), the stimulated emission occurs as well due to a small angle scattering of the thermal mother particles and thus the phenomenon is more universal. Two important conclusions follow: (1) Care must be taken when studying the freeze-in production of a bosonic dark matter, as the abundance and momentum distribution of dark matter can differ significantly due to this effect. (2) eV-mass-range bosonic dark matter is special and theoretically well-motivated because models for freeze-in or other thermal production of dark matter include the parameter region of cold eV dark matter. We also study the dark matter mass effect for the stimulated emission.</description>

Abstract: There is compelling evidence that the Universe is undergoing a late phase of accelerated expansion. One of the simplest explanations for this behaviour is the presence of dark energy. A plethora of microphysical models for dark energy have been proposed. The hope is that, with the ever increasing precision of cosmological surveys, it will be possible to precisely pin down the model. We show that this is unlikely and that, at best, we will have a phenomenological description for the microphysics of dark energy. Furthermore, we argue that the current phenomenological prescriptions are ill-equipped for shedding light on the fundamental theory of dark energy.</description>

      <title>Partition function approach to non-Gaussian likelihoods: macrocanonical partitions and replicating Markov-chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16218v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte-Carlo techniques are standard numerical tools for exploring non-Gaussian and multivariate likelihoods. Many variants of the original Metropolis-Hastings algorithm have been proposed to increase the sampling efficiency. Motivated by Ensemble Monte Carlo we allow the number of Markov chains to vary by exchanging particles with a reservoir, controlled by a parameter analogous to a chemical potential $\mu$, which effectively establishes a random process that samples microstates from a macrocanonical instead of a canonical ensemble. In this paper, we develop the theory of macrocanonical sampling for statistical inference on the basis of Bayesian macrocanonical partition functions, thereby bringing to light the relations between information-theoretical quantities and thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for macrocanonical sampling, $\texttt{Avalanche Sampling}$, and apply it to various toy problems as well as the likelihood on the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $w$ on the basis of data from the supernova distance redshift relation.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the use of deep network to learn the distribution of data from state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project. To this end, we train a generative adversarial network to generate images composed of three different channels that represent gas density (Mgas), neutral hydrogen density (HI), and magnetic field amplitudes (B). We consider an unconstrained model and another scenario where the model is conditioned on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and the amplitude of density fluctuations $\sigma_{8}$. We find that the generated images exhibit great quality which is on a par with that of data, visually. Quantitatively, we find that our model generates maps whose statistical properties, quantified by probability distribution function of pixel values and auto-power spectra, agree reasonably well with those of the real maps. Moreover, the cross-correlations between fields in all maps produced by the emulator are in good agreement with those of the real images, which indicates that our model generates instances whose maps in all three channels describe the same physical region. Furthermore, a CNN regressor, which has been trained to extract $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ from CAMELS multifield dataset, recovers the cosmology from the maps generated by our conditional model, achieving $R^{2}$ = 0.96 and 0.83 corresponding to $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ respectively. This further demonstrates the great capability of the model to mimic CAMELS data. Our model can be useful for generating data that are required to analyze the information from upcoming multi-wavelength cosmological surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the warm inflation scenario, the early cosmic acceleration is driven by the inflaton coupled to thermal fields, decaying into radiation and leaving a hot universe populated by relativistic particles after the end of inflation. The interaction is usually modeled by a dissipation coefficient $\Upsilon$ that contains the microphysics of the model. In this work, we adopt a well-motivated potential $V(\phi)=\frac{\lambda}{4}\phi^4$ and constrain a variety of $\Upsilon$ parameterizations by using updated Cosmic Microwave Background data from the \textit{Planck} and \textit{BICEP/Keck Array} collaborations. We also use a Bayesian statistical criterion to compare the observational viability of these models. Our results show a significant improvement in the constraints over past results reported in the literature and also that some of these warm inflation models can be competitive compared to Starobinsky inflation.</description>

      <title>Distinctive GWBs from eccentric inspiraling SMBH binaries with a DM spike</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14041v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent detections of a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB) from various pulsar-timing-array (PTA) observations have renewed the interest in the inspiraling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), whose population is believed to be the most promising candidate with possible generalizations from including either orbital eccentricity or dark matter (DM) spike. In this Letter, we show that the inclusion of both can further display distinctive features detectable in future PTA observations. With a typical initial eccentricity $e_0\sim\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ for the inspiraling SMBHBs, even a shallow DM spike can easily drive the orbital eccentricity close to $1$, leaving behind a large turnover eccentricity when GWs begin to dominate the orbital circularization. In particular, the DM spike index $\gamma_\mathrm{sp}$ universally manifests itself in the characteristic strain by $h_c\sim f^{7/6-\gamma_\mathrm{sp}/3}$ in the far infrared and features a novel oscillation structure at low frequencies. Future PTA detection of such characteristics would be the smoking gun for the DM spike and even reveal the nature of DM.</description>

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the acceleration of magnetic monopoles in intergalactic magnetic fields. We demonstrate that monopoles with intermediate to low masses can be accelerated to relativistic velocities. This can significantly affect direct and indirect searches for magnetic monopoles. As an example, we show that the Parker bound is relaxed in the presence of intergalactic fields. We also find that a cosmic population of monopoles can produce significant backreaction on the intergalactic fields.</description>

      <title>Inflationary non-Gaussianities in alpha vacua and consistency with conformal symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the conformal invariance of inflationary non-Gaussianities associated with scalar fluctuations in a non-Bunch-Davies initial state, known as the $\alpha$-vacuum, in single-field slow-roll inflation. The $\alpha$-vacuum is a one-parameter family of states, including the Bunch-Davies one, that preserves the conformal symmetry of inflationary dynamics in a nearly de-Sitter space-time. Working within the leading slow-roll approximation, we compute the four-point scalar correlator (the trispectrum) in $\alpha$-vacuum using the in-in formalism. We check that the conformal Ward identities are met between the three and four-point scalar $\alpha$-vacua correlators. Surprisingly, this contrasts the previously reported negative result of the Ward identities being violated between the two and the three-point correlators. We have also extended the wave-functional method, previously used for correlators with Bunch-Davies initial condition, to compute the three and four-point scalar correlators in $\alpha$-vacua. The results obtained from the wave-function method match the corresponding in-in results, adding further justification to our check of Ward identities with $\alpha$-vacua correlators.</description>

      <title>Classicality of Stochastic Noise Away From Quasi-de Sitter Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a coarse-grained scalar field living on a de~Sitter (dS) background exhibits classical stochastic behavior, driven by a noise whose amplitude is set by the Hubble constant $H$. The coarse-graining is achieved by discarding wave numbers larger than a cutoff $\sigma a H$ and demanding that $\sigma \ll 1$. Similar results hold for quasi-dS space, where the equation of state parameter $w$ is close to $-1$. Here we present exact expressions for the noise amplitude of a free massless field on an inflationary background with constant $w &lt; -1/3$. We find that a classical stochastic behavior can emerge for $-5/3 &lt; w &lt; -1/3$. Furthermore, as we move away from $w = -1$ and approach $w = -1/3$, the constraint $\sigma \ll 1$ is relaxed and larger cutoffs ($\sigma \sim 1$) become feasible, too. However, in general the amplitude of the noise depends on $\sigma$, except in the quasi-dS regime $w \approx -1$.</description>

Abstract: We present an $SO(10)$ model in which a dimension five operator induces kinetic mixing at the GUT scale between the abelian subgroups $U(1)_{B-L}$ and $U(1)_R$. We discuss in this framework gauge coupling unification and proton decay, as well as the appearance of superheavy quasistable strings with $G\mu \sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-5}$, where $\mu$ denotes the dimensionless string tension parameter. We use Bayesian analysis to show that for $G\mu$ values $\sim 4 \times 10^{-7} - 10^{-5}$, the gravitational wave spectrum emitted from the quasistable strings is in good agreement with the recent pulsar timing array data. Corresponding to $G \mu$ values $\sim 10^{-8} - 2 \times 10^{-7}$, proton decay is expected to occur at a rate accessible in the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment. Finally, we present the gravitational wave spectrum emitted by effectively stable strings with $G\mu\approx 10^{-8}$ that have experienced a certain amount of inflation. This can be tested with future detectors in the $\mu$Hz frequency range.</description>

      <title>Non-spherical effects on the mass function of Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations arXiv:2410.03452 show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Ellipsoidal Primordial Black Hole Formation</title>

Abstract: We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</description>

      <title>ProGeny I: a new simple stellar population generator and impact of isochrones / stellar atmospheres / initial mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software to generate simple/single stellar populations (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available for immediate use. The most novel feature of ProGeny is its ability to produce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions (IMFs), allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertainties and corrections for star formation rates and stellar masses are also presented.</description>
