      <title>Unraveling hydrodynamization using ultracold 1D gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum evolution of 1D Bose gases immediately after several variants of high-energy quenches, both experimentally and theoretically. Using the advantages conveyed by the relative simplicity of these nearly integrable many-body systems, we are able to differentiate the behavior of two distinct but often temporally overlapping processes, hydrodynamization and local prethermalization. There is a universal character to our findings, which can be applied to the short-time behavior of any interacting many-body quantum system after a sudden high-energy quench. We specifically discuss its potential relevance to heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Quark confinement from an infrared safe approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the nonabelian dipole problem in the context of a simple semiclassical approach which incorporates some essential features of the infrared sector of Yang-Mills theories in the Landau gauge, in particular, the fact that the running coupling remains of moderate size at infrared scales. We obtain a simple flux-tube solution in a controlled approximation scheme, that we compare to the results of lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards accelerated nuclear-physics parameter estimation from binary neutron star mergers: Emulators for the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations of binary neutron-star (BNS) mergers have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the nuclear equation of state (EOS) and the fundamental interactions that determine its properties. However, Bayesian parameter estimation frameworks do not typically sample over microscopic nuclear-physics parameters that determine the EOS. One of the major hurdles in doing so is the computational cost involved in solving the neutron-star structure equations, known as the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations. In this paper, we explore approaches to emulating solutions for the TOV equations: Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Gaussian Processes (GP), and a data-driven variant of the reduced basis method (RBM). We implement these emulators for three different parameterizations of the nuclear EOS, each with a different degree of complexity represented by the number of model parameters. We find that our MLP-based emulators are generally more accurate than the other two algorithms whereas the RBM results in the largest speedup with respect to the full, high-fidelity TOV solver. We employ these emulators for a simple parameter inference using a potentially loud BNS observation, and show that the posteriors predicted by our emulators are in excellent agreement with those obtained from the full TOV solver.</description>

      <title>Lattice study on finite density QC$_2$D towards zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) at low temperature ($T = 40$ MeV, $32^4$ lattice) for the purpose of extending our previous works~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2022hyy} at $T=80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). Indeed, a rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed, but finite volume effects in a high-density regime sometimes cause a wrong understanding. Therefore, it is important to investigate the temperature dependence down to zero temperature with large-volume simulations. By performing $32^4$ simulations, we obtain essentially similar results to the previous ones, but we are now allowed to get a fine understanding of the phase structure via the temperature dependence. Most importantly, we find that the hadronic-matter phase, which is composed of thermally excited hadrons, shrinks with decreasing temperature and that the diquark condensate scales as $\langle qq \rangle \propto \mu^2$ in the BCS phase, a property missing at $T=80$ MeV. From careful analyses, furthermore, we confirm a tentative conclusion that the topological susceptibility is independent of $\mu$. We also show the temperature dependence of the pressure, internal energy, and sound velocity as a function of $\mu$. The pressure increases around the hadronic-superfluid phase transition more rapidly at the lower temperature, while the temperature dependence of the sound velocity is invisible. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to the smaller statistical error.</description>

      <title>Factorization of photon induced ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate photon-photon scattering in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs). We start by deriving an effective Lagrangian from first principles and then apply factorization techniques from Soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). This approach allows us to decompose the photon-photon scattering cross-section into two primary factors: the transverse phase space parton distribution functions and the hard scattering amplitude. We further analyze the emission of soft photons by final state leptons, incorporating a soft function into the cross section through an evolution method. Our analysis yields detailed predictions for observable angular correlations among the final state leptons. Specifically, we calculate the angular correlations characterized by the azimuthal parameters $\langle\cos 2\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 4\phi\rangle$, highlighting the effects of polarization effects from both initial and final state photons.</description>

      <title>The improved saturation model in nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the nuclear shadowing in deep-inelastic scattering corresponding to kinematic regions accessible by future experiments at electron-ion colliders. The gluon distribution at small $x$ is obtained using an improved dipole model depended on the impact parameter for atomic nucleus and compared with nCETQ15 parametrization group. The nuclear shadowing at small $x$ is defined within the color dipole formalism with respect to the mass number $A$. Its behavior is predicted for light nuclei in a wide range of the impact parameter $b$ and the transverse dipole size $r$. The nuclear saturation at large-$r$ (small $\mu^2$) is observable. The behavior of the nuclear ratio $\sigma^{A}_{\mathrm{dip}}/\sigma_{0}$ is similar to the Golec-Biernat-W$\ddot{\mathrm{u}}$sthoff (GBW) model in a wide range of $r$ for light and heavy nuclei at small $x$.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of TMD parton distributions in Drell-Yan and $Z^0$ boson production in a hadron structure oriented approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first practical implementation of a recently proposed hadron structure oriented (HSO) approach to TMD phenomenology applied to Drell-Yan like processes, including lepton pair production at moderate $Q^2$ and $Z^0$ boson production. We compare and contrast general features of our methodology with other common practices and emphasize the improvements derived from our approach that we view as essential for applications where extracting details of nonperturbative transverse hadron structure is a major goal. These include the HSO's preservation of a basic TMD parton-model-like framework even while accounting for full TMD factorization and evolution, explicit preservation of the integral relationship between TMD and collinear pdfs, and the ability to meaningfully compare different theoretical models of nonperturbative TMD parton distributions. In our examples, we show that there is significant sensitivity at moderate $Q^2$ to both the form of the nonperturbative transverse momentum dependence and the parametrization of collinear parton densities. However, we also find that evolving to $Q^2 = M_Z^2$, without fitting, results in a satisfactory postdiction of existing data for $Z^0$ production, nearly independently of the modeling of nonperturbative transverse momentum behavior. We argue that this demonstrates that moderate $Q$ measurements should be given greater weight than high $Q$ measurements in extractions of nonperturbative transverse momentum dependence. We also obtain new extractions of the nonperturbative Collins-Soper kernel within the HSO approach. We discuss its features and compare with some earlier extractions.</description>
