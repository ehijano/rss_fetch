      <title>Can slow recombination in ordered superconductors explain the excess quasiparticle population?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excess density of quasiparticles is widely observed in superconducting films. This excess causes performance degradation in a variety of superconducting devices, including decoherence in qubits. In this Letter, we evaluate the hypothesis of [1] that the quasiparticle excess is caused by anomalously slow recombination at low quasiparticle densities due to localization in sub-gap states. We probe the density of states in aluminum and niobium films using current-voltage measurements of tunnel junctions and extract upper bounds on the energy scales of the sub-gap states and gap smearing. With these parameters, we evaluate the recombination times predicted by [1] and find that slow recombination is not predicted to occur at observed quasiparticle densities in aluminumand niobium-based superconducting devices. These results suggest that the quasiparticle excess in ordered superconductors is primarily due to non-thermal sources of quasiparticle generation and not slow recombination.</description>

      <title>Impact of charge-density-wave pattern on the superconducting gap in V-based kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs) provide a compelling platform to explore the interplay between superconductivity (SC) and charge-density-wave (CDW) orders. While distinct CDW orders have been identified in K/RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ versus CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, their influence on the SC order parameter remains unresolved. Here, we investigate low-energy quasiparticle excitations in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, uncovering a striking difference in SC gap anisotropy: K/RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ exhibit fully gapped, nearly isotropic $s$-wave states, in contrast to the strongly anisotropic SC gap in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Contrary to previous vortex-state studies suggesting nodal SC in K/RbV$_3$Sb$_5$, our Meissner-state measurements in high-quality crystals demonstrate fully gapped states with reduced anisotropy compared to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Impurity scattering introduced via electron irradiation in K/RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ has a minimal impact on low-energy excitations, and it induces an increase in the SC transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, consistent with more isotropic $s$-wave SC competing with CDW order. Our theoretical analysis attributes the observed SC gap anisotropy differences to distinct CDW modulation patterns: the star-of-David structure unique to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ preserves van Hove singularities near the Fermi level, promoting anisotropic $s$-wave SC with enhanced $T_{\rm c}$ via bond-order fluctuations. These findings establish a systematic framework for understanding the interplay between SC and CDW orders in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$, driven by electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic, charge and orbital properties of parent and Sr-doped La$_2$NiO$_4$ and its pressure evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity on multilayer nickelates under high pressure have stimulated great interest. The magnetic and charge configurations in the normal phase of multilayer nickelates which closely relate to the spin-charge fluctuations remain under strongly debated. In this work, we focus the normal-state magnetic, charge and orbital configurations and its evolutions with hydrostatic pressure and Sr-doping concentration of monolayer nickelate La$_2$NiO$_4$. We reveal that in the ambient pressure tetragonal La2NiO4 displays Neel-type antiferromagnetic order in planer Ni spins with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling; with the increase of pressure, La2NiO4 evolves from insulate into metallic state with the critical pressure about P = 50 GPa; with the substitution of La by Sr, the magnetic ground state evolves from G-type, A-type, to double spin striped antiferromagnetic states, as well as weak charge and orbital orders, at x=1; These results can greatly promote our understanding of the magnetic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, and shed the light of the pairing mechanism of unconventional nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Multi-gap and high-Tc superconductivity in metal-atom-free borocarbides: Effects of dimensional confinement and strain engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pure borocarbides suffer from limited superconducting potential due to intrinsic structural instability, requiring transition/alkali metals as dual-functional stabilizers and dopants. Here, by combining high-throughput screening with anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg (aME) theory, we identify dynamically stable borocarbides where high-Tc superconductivity predominately originates from E symmetry-selective electron-phonon coupling (EPC). The six distinct superconducting gaps emerge from a staircase distribution or uncoupling of EPC strength across each Fermi surface (FS) sheet, constituting a metal-free system with such high gap multiplicity. Crucially, dimensional reduction from bulk to surface strengthens E-symmetry EPC and enhances Tc from 32 K (3D bulk) to 75 K (2D surface), a result that highlights structural confinement as a key design strategy for observing high Tc. External strain further optimizes the competition between EPC strength and characteristic phonon frequency to achieve Tc &gt; 90 K. This work reveals a systematic correlation between structural dimensionality and gap multiplicity and establishes borocarbide as a tunable platform to engineer both high-Tc and multi-gap superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Anharmonicity and Coulomb Pseudopotential Effects in YH$_6$ and YH$_9$ Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anharmonic effects are widely believed to be the primary cause of the overestimation of superconducting transition temperatures of yttrium hydrides YH$_6$ and YH$_9$ in theoretical predictions. However, prior studies indicate that anharmonicity alone may be insufficient to account for this discrepancy. In this work, we employ the stochastic path-integral approach to investigate the quantum and anharmonic effects of ions in yttrium hydrides. Our calculations reveal significant corrections to the electron-phonon coupling parameters and an increase in the average phonon frequency compared to density functional perturbation theory, aligning closely with results from the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. We find that properly taking into account the renormalization of the Coulomb pseudopotential due to the frequency cutoff, which is often overlooked in previous calculations, is critical to predicting transition temperatures consistent with experimental values for both YH$_6$ and YH$_9$. This indicates that, with this correction, anharmonic effects are sufficient to explain the discrepancies between experimental and theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Vacancy-free cubic superconducting NbN enabled by quantum anharmonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium nitride (NbN) is renowned for its exceptional mechanical, electronic, magnetic, and superconducting properties. The ideal 1:1 stoichiometric $\delta$-NbN cubic phase, however, is known to be dynamically unstable, and repeated experimental observations have indicated that vacancies are necessary for its stabilization. In this work, we demonstrate that when the structure is fully relaxed and allowed to distort under quantum anharmonic effects, a previously unreported stable cubic phase with space group $P\bar{4}3m$ emerges - 65 meV/atom lower in free energy than the ideal $\delta$ phase. This discovery is enabled by state-of-the-art first-principles calculations accelerated by machine-learned interatomic potentials. To evaluate the vibrational and superconducting properties with quantum anharmonic effects accounted for, we use the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation (SSCHA) and molecular dynamics spectral energy density (SED) methods. Electron-phonon coupling calculations based on the SSCHA phonon dispersion yield a superconducting transition temperature of $T_\text{c}$ = 20 K, which aligns closely with experimentally reported values for near-stoichiometric NbN. These findings challenge the long-held assumption that vacancies are essential for stabilizing cubic NbN and point to the potential of synthesizing the ideal 1:1 stoichiometric phase as a route to achieving enhanced superconducting performance in this technologically significant material.</description>

      <title>High Temperature Superconductivity Dominated by Inner Underdoped CuO$_2$ Planes in Quadruple-Layer Cuprate (Cu,C)Ba$_2$Ca$_3$Cu$_4$O$_{11+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of trilayer or quadruple-layer cuprates typically surpasses that of single-layer or bilayer systems. This observation is often interpreted within the ``composite picture", where strong proximity effect between inner CuO$_2$ planes (IPs) and outer CuO$_2$ planes (OPs) is crucial. Albeit intriguing, a straightforward scrutinization of this composite picture is still lacking. In this study, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to investigate (Cu,C)Ba$_2$Ca$_3$Cu$_4$O$_{11+\delta}$ (CuC-1234) with a high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of 110~K, we found that the OPs are not superconducting at the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of the material. Instead, the large pairing strength and phase coherence concurrently emerge at the underdoped IPs, suggesting that the high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ is primarily driven by these underdoped IPs. Given that the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of CuC-1234 is comparable to other trilayer or quadruple-layer cuprates, our findings suggest that the conventional ``composite picture" is not universally required for achieving high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$. More importantly, we demonstrate that CuO$_2$ planes free of apical oxygen can support superconductivity up to 110~K even at a doping level of 0.07 holes per Cu, a level that lies deep in the underdoped regime of single- and bilayer cuprates. These findings provide new insights into the origin of high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ in multilayer cuprates.</description>

      <title>Unusual electronic structure in underdoped cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The underdoped cuprate superconductors are characterized by the opening of the pseudogap, while such an aspect of the pseudogap effect should be reflected in the low-energy electronic structure (LEES). Here the effect of the pseudogap on LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors is investigated within the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. The strong coupling of the electrons with the spin excitation induces the pseudogap-state in the particle-hole channel and superconducting (SC) state in the particle-particle channel, where the pseudogap and SC gap respectively originate from the electron normal and anomalous self-energies, and are evaluated by taking into account the vertex correction. As a natural consequence of the interplay between the pseudogap-state and SC-state, the SC transition temperature Tc exhibits a dome-like shape of the doping dependence, however, in a striking contrast to Tc in the underdoped regime, the pseudogap crossover temperature T* is much higher than Tc in the underdoped regime, and then it decreases with the increase of doping, eventually disappearing together with Tc at the end of the SC dome. Concomitantly, the spectral weight on the electron Fermi surface (EFS) at around the antinodal region is suppressed strongly by this pseudogap, and then EFS is truncated to form four disconnected Fermi arcs centered around the nodal region with the largest spectral weight located at around the tips of the disconnected Fermi arcs. Moreover, the dip in the peak-dip-hump structure observed in the energy distribution curve and checkerboard charge ordering found in the ARPES autocorrelation are intrinsically connected with the emergence of the pseudogap. The theory therefore indicates that the same spin excitation that governs both the pseudogap-state and SC-state naturally leads to the exotic features of LEES in the underdoped cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Signature of gate tunable superconducting network in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals materials provide a tunable platform for investigating two-dimensional superconductivity and quantum phases. Using spectra-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy, we study the superconducting states in twisted bilayer graphene and track their evolution from insulating phases. Gate-dependent spectroscopic measurements reveal two distinct regimes: under-doped ({\nu} = -2.3) and optimally doped ({\nu} = -2.6). In the under-doped regime, partial superconductivity arises, forming a network interspersed with non-gapped regions. At optimal doping, the entire unit cell demonstrates superconductivity, with gap size modulation showing an anti-correlation with the local density of states. This gate-dependent transition from an insulating phase to a modulated superconductor uncovers an unexpected spatial hierarchy in pairing behavior and offers direct microscopic insights to constrain theories of superconductivity in moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Electride-like $s$ States Coexisting with Correlated $d$ Electrons in NdNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite exhibiting a similar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band character to cuprates, infinite-layer nickelates host additional electron pockets that distinguish them from single-band cuprates. The elusive orbital origin of these electron pockets has led to competing theoretical scenarios. Here, using polarization-dependent and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we determine the orbital character of the Fermi surfaces in NdNiO$_2$. Our data reveal that the electron-like pocket arises predominantly from interstitial $s$ states, with negligible contributions from rare-earth 5$d$ and 4$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level. The observation of well-defined quantum well states indicates a uniform distribution of these interstitial electrons throughout the film thickness. By comparing with electronic structure of LaNiO$_2$, we find that the rare-earth element modulates the Ni-derived bands and hopping integrals through a chemical pressure effect. These findings clarify the role of rare-earth elements in shaping the low-energy electronic structure and establish the presence of electride-like interstitial $s$ states in a correlated oxide system, where electrons occupy lattice voids rather than atomic orbitals. The electride-like character offer new insight into the self-doping and superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates.</description>

      <title>Generation of new quadratic coefficients within Ginzburg-Landau theory: Applications for specific heat calculations in various high-temperature superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit Landau's theory by renormalizing quadratic coefficients from nonlinear polynomial equations to adapt them to the system's dimensionality. These coefficients are employed to perform detailed specific-heat calculations for several high-temperature superconductors near the superconducting transition. We phenomenologically explain the change in the specific heat jump using Ginzburg-Landau theory, which is applicable to any spatial arrangement and interactions between electrons that influence the system's symmetries. We discuss the effects that may lead to the rapid and non-monotonic variation of the specific heat jump, $\Delta{C_p}/T_{c}$, across the transition over relatively small ranges of fluctuations, focusing particularly on changes attributed to the Sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state. We quantitatively explain the considerable reduction, disappearance, or significant enhancement of the specific heat anomaly at the superconducting transition, considering strong fluctuation corrections to the Ginzburg-Landau theory of low-dimensional systems. Additionally, we study the evolution of specific heat jumps by varying the system's dimensionality and discuss the results in relation to experimental observations of specific-heat jumps in iron-, yttrium-, and bismuth-based superconductors, as well as in $\beta$-pyrochlore oxides superconductors like $KOs_2O_6$.</description>

      <title>Optimized Bistable Vortex Memory Arrays for Superconducting In-Memory Matrix-Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon previously introduced Bistable Vortex Memory (BVM) as a novel, nonvolatile, high-density, and scalable superconductor memory technology, this work presents a methodology that uses BVM arrays to address challenges in data-driven algorithms and neural networks, specifically focusing on matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). The BVM approach introduces a novel superconductor-based methodology for in-memory arithmetic, achieving ultra-high-speed and energy-efficient computation by utilizing BVM arrays for in-memory computation. The design employs a tiled multiplier structure where BVM's inherent current summation capability is combined with Quantizer Buffer (QB) cells to convert the analog accumulated current into a variable number of digital Single Flux Quantum (SFQ) pulses. These pulses are then processed by T1 adder cells, which handle binary addition and carry propagation, thereby forming a complete functional multiplier unit. This paper thus presents an efficient MVM architecture that uses these BVM-based multipliers in a systolic array configuration to enable parallel computation. A key innovation is an optimized BVM array structure specifically tailored for multiplication applications, involving a restructuring of Sense Lines (SLs) with diagonal connections to reduce area and an adjusted input scheme to enhance computational efficiency compared to the general-purpose BVM array design. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a 4-bit multiplier operating at 20 GHz with 50 ps latency and an MVM structure demonstrating operation at 20 GHz. Furthermore, we showcase how this multiplier design can be extended to support Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. This work paves the way for power-efficient neural networks by enabling high-speed in-memory computation.</description>

      <title>The Ferroelectric Superconducting Field Effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ferroelectric field-effect transistor (Fe-FET) is a three-terminal semiconducting device first introduced in the 1950s. Despite its potential, a significant boost in Fe-FET research occurred about ten years ago with the discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnium oxide. This material has been incorporated into electronic processes since the mid-2000s. Here, we observed ferroelectricity in a superconducting Josephson FET (Fe-JoFET) operating at cryogenic temperatures below 1 Kelvin. The Fe-JoFET was fabricated on the InAsOI platform, which features an InAs epilayer hosted by an electrical insulating substrate, using HfO2 as the gate insulator, making it a promising candidate due to its ferroelectric properties. The Fe-JoFET exhibits significant hysteresis in the switching current and normal-state resistance transfer characteristics, which depend on the range of gate voltages. This phenomenon opens a new research area exploring the interaction between ferroelectricity and superconductivity in hybrid superconducting-semiconducting systems, with potential applications in cryogenic data storage and computation. Supporting this, the Fe-JoFET was operated as a cryogenic superconducting single memory cell, exhibiting both dissipative and non-dissipative states. Its non-volatility was tested over a 24-hour measurement period. We also demonstrated that the Fe-JoFET can retain information at temperatures above the superconductor critical temperature, resulting in a temperature-fault-tolerant memory cell resistant to temperature oscillations or, in the worst case, cryostat faults.</description>

      <title>Universal Diagnostic Criterion for Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) is distinguished from the Josephson diode effect (JDE) by its manifestation of nonreciprocal critical current phenomena within a monolithic superconductor, typically linked to finite-momentum Cooper pairing. The long-standing assumption that SDE requires co-breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries proves to be necessary but not sufficient. In this work, we propose a universal diagnostic criterion. Embodied in two concise inequalities, this criterion enables convenient and intuitive assessment of whether an intrinsic SDE can emerge in a given system without requiring extensive numerical calculations. Furthermore, our universal criterion provides explicit design guidelines for material systems exhibiting intrinsic SDE.</description>

      <title>Magnetic force microscopy versus scanning quantum-vortex microscopy: Probing pinning landscape in granular niobium films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the methodology and fundamental principles associated with newly developed experimental technique -- scanning quantum-vortex microscopy [Hovhannisyan et al., Commun. Mater., vol. 6, 42 (2025)]. This approach appears promising for experimental studies of vortex pinning phenomena in superconducting films and nanodevices. In particular, we studied the magnetic properties of magnetron-sputtered niobium (Nb) films by low-temperature magnetic force microscopy. As the temperature approaches the superconducting critical temperature, the pinning potential caused by structural defects weakens; consequently, the attractive interaction between the magnetic tip of the cantilever and a single-quantum vortex begins to dominate. In this scenario the magnetic probe is capable of trapping a vortex during the scanning process. Because the dragged vortex continues interacting with structural defects, it serves as an efficient nano-probe to explore pinning potentials and visualize grain boundaries in granular Nb films, achieving resolutions (30 nm) comparable to the superconducting coherence length.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of the nemato-elastic coupling and dynamics of hybridized collective nematic-phonon excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronically-driven nematic order breaks the rotational symmetry of a system, e.g., through a Pomeranchuk instability of the Fermi surface, with a concomitant distortion of the lattice. As a result, in a metal, the nematic collective mode interacts with two different sets of gapless excitations: the particle-hole excitations of the metal and the lattice fluctuations that become soft at the induced structural transition, namely, the transverse acoustic phonons. However, the \textit{dynamics} of these hybridized collective modes formed by the transverse acoustic phonons and the metallic electronic-nematic fluctuations has remained largely unexplored. Here we address this problem by developing a formalism in which the nemato-elastic coupling is obtained microscopically from the direct coupling between electrons and transverse acoustic phonons enabled by impurities present in the crystal. We then demonstrate the emergence of hybrid nemato-elastic modes that mix the characteristics of the transverse phonons and of the nematic fluctuations. Near the nematic quantum critical point in a metal, two massless modes emerge with intertwined dynamic behaviors, implying that neither mode dominates the response of the system. We systematically study the non-trivial dependence of these collective modes on the longitudinal and transverse momenta, revealing a rich landscape of underdamped and overdamped modes as the proximity to the quantum critical point and the strength of the electron-phonon coupling are changed. Since dynamics play an important role for determining superconducting instabilities, our results have implications for the study of pairing mediated by electronic nematic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Andreev bound state spectroscopy of a quantum-dot-based Aharonov-Bohm interferometer with superconducting terminals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically and numerically investigate an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer with two superconducting terminals and a strongly correlated quantum dot in one arm. Through a rigorous derivation, we prove that this double-path interferometer is spectrally equivalent to a simpler system: an interacting quantum dot coupled to a non-interacting side-coupled proximitized mode and a semiconductor lead. This equivalence reveals a simple interpretation of the interferometer's behavior through the competition of a geometric factor $\chi$, a key parameter characterizing the anomalous part of the hybridization function, with the properties of the side-coupled mode. We identify the conditions for the formation of doublet chimney in the phase diagrams in more general setting. Moreover, we show how the obtained Andreev bound state spectra clearly indicate the presence of Josephson diode effect generated by interferometric phenomena.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic correlations in the Kagome metals $RT_3$B$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $RT_3$B$_2$ ($R=$Y, Lu, $T=$ Co, Os) family hosts a perfect kagome lattice of $T$ atoms, offering an interesting platform to investigate the interplay of electronic structure, superconductivity, and lattice dynamics. Here, we compare two members of this family, LuOs$_3$B$_2$ and YCo$_3$B$_2$, with similar crystallography but differing chemical composition, leading to distinct electronic correlation strengths and spin-orbit coupling effects. We confirm superconductivity in LuOs$_3$B$_2$ with $T_c = 4.75$K, while YCo$_3$B$_2$ remains non-superconducting above 1.8K. First-principles estimates of the electron-phonon coupling for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ are consistent with its observed $T_c$ and suggest a moderate coupling strength. Both materials exhibit kagome-derived electronic features, including quasi-flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities. Fermi surface calculations reveal quasi-one-dimensional behavior along the $c$-axis in YCo$_3$B$_2$, in contrast to the more three-dimensional Fermiology of LuOs$_3$B$_2$. Phonon calculations for LuOs$_3$B$_2$ show imaginary modes, indicating potential lattice instabilities. Experimental estimates of the Wilson and Kadowaki-Woods ratios point to non-negligible electronic correlations in both compounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17036v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rhombohedral graphene multilayers host various broken-symmetry metallic phases as well as superconductors whose pairing mechanism and order parameter symmetry remain unsettled. Strikingly, experiments have revealed prominent new superconducting regions in rhombohedral bilayer and trilayer graphene devices with proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. We propose that these superconductors descend from a common spin-canted normal state that spontaneously breaks a U(1) spin symmetry and thus supports soft magnon modes. In particular, we show that these soft modes can mediate pairing through inter-band scattering events that are symmetry-forbidden in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, thus providing a promising explanation for spin-orbit-enabled pairing. Numerous other experimental observations -- including nontrivial dependence of superconductivity on the spin-orbit coupling strength, in-plane magnetic fields, and Fermi surface structure -- also naturally follow from our scenario.</description>

      <title>Pair Density Waves and Supercurrent Diode Effect in Altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic altermagnets are unusual collinear magnets that feature zero net magnetization with momentum-dependent spin splitting. Here, we show that this spin splitting can induce pair density wave states even in the absence of external magnetic fields. Focusing on BCS-type attractive interactions, we find the stabilization of symmetrically distinct pair density wave states depending on the chemical potential. These states include Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states, both of which break inversion symmetry. We investigate the supercurrent properties and discover non-reciprocal supercurrents for both the Fulde-Ferrell and Fulde-Ferrell* states with distinct spatial dependencies. We propose that the supercurrent diode effect can serve as an experimental tool for distinguishing between different pair density waves in metallic altermagnets and discuss the relation to material candidates.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Meissner effect in pressurized bilayer nickelate with integrated multi-parameter quantum sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent reports on the signatures of high-temperature superconductivity with a critical temperature Tc close to 80 K have triggered great research interest and extensive follow-up studies. Although the zero resistance has been successfully achieved under improved hydrostatic pressure conditions, the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ under high pressure remains controversial. Here, using shallow nitrogen-vacancy centers implanted on the culet of diamond anvils as in-situ quantum sensors, we observe compelling evidence for the Meissner effect in polycrystalline bilayer nickelate samples: the magnetic field expulsion during both field cooling and field warming processes. In particular, we explore the multiparameter measurement capacity of the diamond quantum sensors to extract the weak demagnetization signal of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$. The correlated measurements of Raman spectra and magnetic imaging indicate an incomplete structural transformation related to the displacement of oxygen ions emerging in the non-superconducting region. Our work clarifies the controversy about the Meissner effect of $\mathrm{La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}}$ and contributes to the development of quantum sensing of weak signals under high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Universal approach to light driven "superconductivity" via preformed pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there are many different mechanisms which have been proposed to understand the physics behind light induced ``superconductivity", what seems to be common to the class of materials in which this is observed are strong pairing correlations, which are present in the normal state. Here we argue, that the original ideas of Eliashberg are applicable to such a pseudogap phase and that with exposure to radiation the fermions are redistributed to higher energies where they are less deleterious to pairing. What results then is a photo-induced state with dramatically enhanced number of nearly condensed fermion pairs. In this phase, because the a.c. conductivity, $\sigma(\omega) = \sigma_1(\omega) + i \sigma_2(\omega)$, is dominated by the bosonic contribution, it can be computed using conventional (Aslamazov Larkin) fluctuation theory. We, thereby, observe the expected fingerprint of this photoinduced ``superconducting" state which is a $1/\omega$ dependence in $\sigma_2$ with fits to the data of the same quality as found for the so-called photo-enhanced (Drude) conductivity scenario. Here, however, we have a microscopic understanding of the characteristic low energy scale which appears in transport and which is necessarily temperature dependent. This approach also provides insight into recent observations of concomitant diamagnetic fluctuations. Our calculations suggest that the observed light-induced phase in these strongly paired superconductors has only short range phase coherence without long range superconducting order.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic evidence of symmetry breaking in the superconducting vortices of UTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered heavy-fermion superconductor, UTe2, is an excellent candidate for spin-triplet superconductors where electrons form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with spin S = 1 and odd parity. Unconventional superconductivity often hosts unconventional vortices. Yet, the vortex core and lattice in UTe2 have not been directly visualized and characterized. Here, by using ultralow-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we study the superconducting vortices on the (0-11) surface termination of UTe2 with an out-of-plane external magnetic field. At the center of the vortex core, we observe a robust zero-energy vortex-core state which exhibits a cigar-shaped spatial distribution and extends to ~30 nm along the [100] direction (crystallographic a axis) of UTe2. Along the direction perpendicular to [100], the superconducting gap is deeper and the coherence peak on one side of the vortex core is stronger than on the opposite side, and they are even enhanced in comparison with those under zero field. Due to the anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility in UTe2, the asymmetric dI/dV spectra on the two sides of the vortex core result from the interplay between the magnetization-induced bound current and supercurrent around the vortex core. Our work reveals the important role of magnetization in the vortex behaviors of UTe2 and provides essential microscopic information for understanding its superconducting properties in magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast majority of superconductors have more than one Fermi surface, on which the electrons pair below the critical temperature $T_C$, yet their superconducting behavior can be well described by a single-band Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. This is mostly due to interband scattering, especially in superconductors in the dirty limit, rigidly linking the pairing amplitude of the different bands. This effect has severely limited experimental studies of the complex physics of multiband superconductivity. In this study, we utilize the fact that elementary Pb - as a clean limit system - has two Fermi surfaces that are only weakly coupled by interband scattering, allowing the formation of two separate condensates. By studying crystallographic defects in the form of stacking fault tetrahedra with our millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope, we show how to locally tune interband coupling ranging from weak to strong coupling and modify the superconducting order parameters from two well separated gaps to one merged gap around defects. The experiments critically test the theory of multiband superconductors and give a route to access a wide range of predicted quantum effects in these systems.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneity-driven multiform Spontaneous Hall Effect in conventional and unconventional superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spontaneous Hall effect (SHE), a finite voltage occurring transversal to the electrical current in zero-magnetic field, has been observed in both conventional and unconventional superconductors, appearing as a peak near the superconducting transition temperature. The origin of SHE is strongly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and time-reversal symmetry breaking (BTRS), Abrikosov vortex motion, or extrinsic factors like material inhomogeneities, such as non-uniform critical temperature (Tc) distributions or structural asymmetries. This work is an experimental study of the SHE in various superconducting materials. We focused on conventional, low-Tc, sharp transition Nb and unconventional, intermediate-Tc, smeared transition Fe(Se,Te). Our findings show distinct SHE peaks around the superconducting transition, with variations in height, sign and shape, indicating a possible common mechanism independent of the specific material. We propose that spatial inhomogeneities in the critical temperature, caused by local chemical composition variations, disorder, or other forms of electronic spatial inhomogeneities could explain the appearing of the SHE. This hypothesis is supported by comprehensive finite elements simulations of randomly distributed Tc by varying Tc-distribution, spatial scale of disorder and amplitude of the superconducting transition. The comparison between experimental results and simulations suggest a unified origin for the SHE in different superconductors, whereas different phenomenology can be explained in terms of amplitude of the transition temperature in respect to Tc-distribution.</description>

Two-dimensional platforms such as planar Josephson junctions require an in-plane magnetic field to generate a pair of MBS at its non-superconducting channel ends; however, the fixed direction of the in-plane magnetic field puts a constraint on the realization of a multi-terminal topological planar junction, and hence its ability to physically move multiple MBS -- which is necessary for performing the fusion and braiding operations. Here we show that in a planar Josephson junction coupled to a skyrmion crystal, which can generate multiple pairs of MBS in the absence of any external magnetic field, the non-trivial fusion and braiding operations can be performed. Our numerical calculations, designed for realistic two-dimensional quantum systems, certify the feasibility of experimental realization of the proposed device schemes. We find that both $s$-wave and $d$-wave superconducting leads can generate the MBS; indicating that the MBS movement operations can be performed at higher temperatures using $d$-wave superconducting leads. Our results establish that the skyrmion crystal-coupled planar Josephson junction is a viable platform for the generation and controlled movement of the MBS.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an electronic refrigerator based on a ballistic Andreev interferometer that allows to reach a maximum cooling power per channel up to five orders of magnitude larger than that of the conventional normal metal-insulator-superconductor cooler. This effect is achieved by exploiting the destructive interference that occurs when the superconducting phase difference equals $\pi$. This results in a strongly suppressed charge current below the superconducting gap, while still allowing the extraction of excitations above the gap, leading to a cooler with enhanced performance. Interestingly, we find that such a large cooling power per channel enables the achievement of an electronic temperature close to the theoretical lower bound. Additionally, we derive an approximate expression for this bound in the regime of low bath temperatures. Finally, we propose potential implementations of the ballistic Andreev interferometer cooler using semiconductors, graphene, and topological insulators.</description>
