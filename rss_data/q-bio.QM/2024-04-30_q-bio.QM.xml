      <title>Flock2: A model for orientation-based social flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aerial flocking of birds, or murmurations, have fascinated observers while presenting many challenges to behavioral study and simulation. We examine how the periphery of murmurations remain well bounded and cohesive. We also investigate agitation waves, which occur when a flock is disturbed, developing a plausible model for how they might emerge spontaneously. To understand these behaviors a new model is presented for orientation-based social flocking. Previous methods model inter-bird dynamics by considering the neighborhood around each bird, and introducing forces for avoidance, alignment, and cohesion as three dimensional vectors that alter acceleration. Our method introduces orientation-based social flocking that treats social influences from neighbors more realistically as a desire to turn, indirectly controlling the heading in an aerodynamic model. While our model can be applied to any flocking social bird we simulate flocks of starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, and demonstrate the possibility of orientation waves in the absence of predators. Our model exhibits spherical and ovoidal flock shapes matching observation. Comparisons of our model to Reynolds' on energy consumption and frequency analysis demonstrates more realistic motions, significantly less energy use in turning, and a plausible mechanism for emergent orientation waves.</description>

      <title>Universal Cold RNA Phase Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA's diversity of structures and functions impacts all life forms since primordia. We use calorimetric force spectroscopy to investigate RNA folding landscapes in previously unexplored low-temperature conditions. We find that Watson-Crick RNA hairpins, the most basic secondary structure elements, undergo a glass-like transition below $\mathbf{T_G\sim 20 ^{\circ}}$C where the heat capacity abruptly changes and the RNA folds into a diversity of misfolded structures. We hypothesize that an altered RNA biochemistry, determined by sequence-independent ribose-water interactions, outweighs sequence-dependent base pairing. The ubiquitous ribose-water interactions lead to universal RNA phase transitions below $\mathbf{T_G}$, such as maximum stability at $\mathbf{T_S\sim 5 ^{\circ}}$C where water density is maximum, and cold denaturation at $\mathbf{T_C\sim-50^{\circ}}$C. RNA cold biochemistry may have a profound impact on RNA function and evolution.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of biomarker levels can predict time of recurrence of prostate cancer with strictly positive apparent Shannon information against an exponential attrition prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shariat et al previously investigated the possibility of predicting, from preoperative biomarkers and clinical data, which of any pair of patients would suffer recurrence of prostate cancer first. We wished to establish the extent to which predictions of time of relapse from such a model could be improved upon using Bayesian methodology.
  The same dataset was reanalysed using a Bayesian skew-Student mixture model. Predictions were made of which of any pair of patients would relapse first and of the time of relapse. The benefit of using these biomarkers relative to predictions made without them, was measured by the apparent Shannon information, using as prior a simple exponential attrition model of relapse time independent of input variables.
  Using half the dataset for training and the other half for testing, predictions of relapse time from the strict Cox model gave $-\infty$ nepers of apparent Shannon information, (it predicts that relapse can only occur at times when patients in the training set relapsed). Deliberately smoothed predictions from the Cox model gave -0.001 (-0.131 to +0.120) nepers, while the Bayesian model gave +0.109 (+0.021 to +0.192) nepers (mean, 2.5 to 97.5 centiles), being positive with posterior probability 0.993 and beating the blurred Cox model with posterior probability 0.927.
  These predictions from the Bayesian model thus outperform those of the Cox model, but the overall yield of predictive information leaves scope for improvement of the range of biomarkers in use. The Bayesian model presented here is the first such model for prostate cancer to consider the variation of relapse hazard with biomarker concentrations to be smooth, as is intuitive. It is also the first model to be shown to provide more apparent Shannon information than the Cox model and the first to be shown to provide positive apparent information relative to an exponential prior.</description>

Abstract: Considering a pair of genomes, the goal of rearrangement distance problems is to estimate how distant these genomes are from each other based on genome rearrangements. Seminal works in genome rearrangements assumed that both genomes being compared have the same set of genes (balanced genomes) and, furthermore, only the relative order of genes and their orientations, when they are known, are used in the mathematical representation of the genomes. In this case, the genomes are represented as permutations, originating the Sorting Permutations by Rearrangements problems. The main problems of Sorting Permutations by Rearrangements considered DCJs, reversals, transpositions, or the combination of both reversals and transpositions, and these problems have their complexity known. Besides these problems, other ones were studied involving the combination of transpositions with one or more of the following rearrangements: transreversals, revrevs, and reversals. Although there are approximation results for these problems, their complexity remained open. Some of the results of this thesis are the complexity proofs for these problems. Furthermore, we present a new 1.375-approximation algorithm, which has better time complexity, for the Sorting Permutations by Transpositions. When considering unbalanced genomes, it is necessary to use insertions and deletions to transform one genome into another. In this thesis, we studied Rearrangement Distance problems on unbalanced genomes considering only gene order and their orientations (when they are known), as well as Intergenic Rearrangement Distance problems, which incorporate the information regarding the size distribution of intergenic regions, besides the use of gene order and their orientations (when they are known). We present complexity proofs and approximation algorithms for problems that include reversals and transpositions.</description>

      <title>CRISPR-GPT: An LLM Agent for Automated Design of Gene-Editing Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of genome engineering technology has transformed biomedical research, making it possible to make precise changes to genetic information. However, creating an efficient gene-editing system requires a deep understanding of CRISPR technology, and the complex experimental systems under investigation. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in various tasks, they often lack specific knowledge and struggle to accurately solve biological design problems. In this work, we introduce CRISPR-GPT, an LLM agent augmented with domain knowledge and external tools to automate and enhance the design process of CRISPR-based gene-editing experiments. CRISPR-GPT leverages the reasoning ability of LLMs to facilitate the process of selecting CRISPR systems, designing guide RNAs, recommending cellular delivery methods, drafting protocols, and designing validation experiments to confirm editing outcomes. We showcase the potential of CRISPR-GPT for assisting non-expert researchers with gene-editing experiments from scratch and validate the agent's effectiveness in a real-world use case. Furthermore, we explore the ethical and regulatory considerations associated with automated gene-editing design, highlighting the need for responsible and transparent use of these tools. Our work aims to bridge the gap between beginner biological researchers and CRISPR genome engineering techniques, and demonstrate the potential of LLM agents in facilitating complex biological discovery tasks.</description>

      <title>LINOCS: Lookahead Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying latent interactions within complex systems is key to unlocking deeper insights into their operational dynamics, including how their elements affect each other and contribute to the overall system behavior. For instance, in neuroscience, discovering neuron-to-neuron interactions is essential for understanding brain function; in ecology, recognizing the interactions among populations is key for understanding complex ecosystems. Such systems, often modeled as dynamical systems, typically exhibit noisy high-dimensional and non-stationary temporal behavior that renders their identification challenging. Existing dynamical system identification methods often yield operators that accurately capture short-term behavior but fail to predict long-term trends, suggesting an incomplete capture of the underlying process. Methods that consider extended forecasts (e.g., recurrent neural networks) lack explicit representations of element-wise interactions and require substantial training data, thereby failing to capture interpretable network operators. Here we introduce Lookahead-driven Inference of Networked Operators for Continuous Stability (LINOCS), a robust learning procedure for identifying hidden dynamical interactions in noisy time-series data. LINOCS integrates several multi-step predictions with adaptive weights during training to recover dynamical operators that can yield accurate long-term predictions. We demonstrate LINOCS' ability to recover the ground truth dynamical operators underlying synthetic time-series data for multiple dynamical systems models (including linear, piece-wise linear, time-changing linear systems' decomposition, and regularized linear time-varying systems) as well as its capability to produce meaningful operators with robust reconstructions through various real-world examples.</description>

      <title>BMRetriever: Tuning Large Language Models as Better Biomedical Text Retrievers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing effective biomedical retrieval models is important for excelling at knowledge-intensive biomedical tasks but still challenging due to the deficiency of sufficient publicly annotated biomedical data and computational resources. We present BMRetriever, a series of dense retrievers for enhancing biomedical retrieval via unsupervised pre-training on large biomedical corpora, followed by instruction fine-tuning on a combination of labeled datasets and synthetic pairs. Experiments on 5 biomedical tasks across 11 datasets verify BMRetriever's efficacy on various biomedical applications. BMRetriever also exhibits strong parameter efficiency, with the 410M variant outperforming baselines up to 11.7 times larger, and the 2B variant matching the performance of models with over 5B parameters. The training data and model checkpoints are released at \url{https://huggingface.co/BMRetriever} to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and application to new domains.</description>

      <title>Coupling in situ and remote sensing data to assess $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity over biogeographic gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenges presented by climate change are escalating and pose significant threats to global biodiversity, which in turn increases the risk of species extinctions. Therefore, meticulous monitoring efforts are necessary to mitigate the consequential impacts on both human well-being and environmental equilibrium. Biodiversity mapping is pivotal for establishing conservation priorities, often accomplished by assessing alpha, beta, and gamma diversity levels. Two main data sources, in situ and remote sensing (RS) data, are key for this task. In situ methods entail direct data collection from specific study areas, offering detailed insights into ecological patterns, albeit limited by resource constraints. Conversely, RS provides a broader observational platform, albeit at lower spatial resolution than in situ approaches. RS-derived diversity metrics have potential, particularly in linking spectral and biological diversity through high-resolution imagery for precise differentiation at fine scales. Coupling in situ and RS data underscores their complementary nature, contingent upon various factors including study scale and logistical considerations. In situ methods excel in precision, while RS offers efficiency and broader coverage. Despite prior investigations predominantly relying on limited datasets, our study endeavors to employ both in situ and RS data to assess plant and spectral species diversity across France at a high spatial resolution, integrating diverse metrics to unravel different biogeographical structures while gaining in understanding the relationship between plant and spectral diversity within and across bioregions.</description>

      <title>Calibrar: an R package for fitting complex ecological models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.03141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fitting or parameter estimation of complex ecological models is a challenging optimisation task, with a notable lack of tools for fitting complex, long runtime or stochastic models. calibrar is an R package that is dedicated to the fitting of complex models to data. It is a generic tool that can be used for any type of model, especially those with non-differentiable objective functions and long runtime, including Individual Based Models. calibrar supports multiple phases and constrained optimisation, includes 18 optimisation algorithms, including derivative-based and heuristic ones. It supports any type of parallelization, the restart of interrupted optimisations for long runtime models and the combination of different optimisation methods during the multiple phases of the calibration. User-level expertise in R is necessary to handle calibration experiments with calibrar, but there is no need to modify the model's code, which can be programmed in any language. It implements maximum likelihood estimation methods and automated construction of the objective function from simulated model outputs. For more experienced users, calibrar allows the implementation of user-defined objective functions. The package source code is fully accessible and can be installed directly from CRAN.</description>

      <title>Using convolutional neural networks for the classification of breast cancer images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13661v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important part of breast cancer staging is the assessment of the sentinel axillary node for early signs of tumor spreading. However, this assessment by pathologists is not always easy and retrospective surveys often requalify the status of a high proportion of sentinel nodes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning algorithms that have shown excellent performances in the most challenging visual classification tasks, with numerous applications in medical imaging. In this study I compare twelve different CNNs and different hardware acceleration devices for the detection of breast cancer from microscopic images of breast cancer tissue. Convolutional models are trained and tested on two public datasets. The first one is composed of more than 300,000 images of sentinel lymph node tissue from breast cancer patients, while the second one has more than 220,000 images from inductive breast carcinoma tissue, one of the most common forms of breast cancer. Four different hardware acceleration cards were used, with an off-the-shelf deep learning framework. The impact of transfer learning and hyperparameters fine-tuning are tested. Hardware acceleration device performance can improve training time by a factor of five to twelve, depending on the model used. On the other hand, increasing convolutional depth will augment the training time by a factor of four to six times, depending on the acceleration device used. Increasing the depth and the complexity of the model generally improves performance, but the relationship is not linear and also depends on the architecture of the model. The performance of transfer learning is always worse compared to a complete retraining of the model. Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the model improves the results, with the best model showing a performance comparable to state-of-the-art models.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence in Assessing Cardiovascular Diseases and Risk Factors via Retinal Fundus Images: A Review of the Last Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) methods - in particular, deep learning (DL) - has been on the rise lately for the analysis of different CVD-related topics. The use of fundus images and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in the diagnosis of retinal diseases has also been extensively studied. To better understand heart function and anticipate changes based on microvascular characteristics and function, researchers are currently exploring the integration of AI with non-invasive retinal scanning. There is great potential to reduce the number of cardiovascular events and the financial strain on healthcare systems by utilizing AI-assisted early detection and prediction of cardiovascular diseases on a large scale. Method: A comprehensive search was conducted across various databases, including PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Sciences, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library, using specific keywords related to cardiovascular diseases and artificial intelligence. Results: The study included 87 English-language publications selected for relevance, and additional references were considered. This paper provides an overview of the recent developments and difficulties in using artificial intelligence and retinal imaging to diagnose cardiovascular diseases. It provides insights for further exploration in this field. Conclusion: Researchers are trying to develop precise disease prognosis patterns in response to the aging population and the growing global burden of CVD. AI and deep learning are revolutionizing healthcare by potentially diagnosing multiple CVDs from a single retinal image. However, swifter adoption of these technologies in healthcare systems is required.</description>

      <title>Aligned Diffusion Schr\"odinger Bridges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion Schr\"odinger bridges (DSB) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for recovering stochastic dynamics via their marginal observations at different time points. Despite numerous successful applications, existing algorithms for solving DSBs have so far failed to utilize the structure of aligned data, which naturally arises in many biological phenomena. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework that, for the first time, solves DSBs while respecting the data alignment. Our approach hinges on a combination of two decades-old ideas: The classical Schr\"odinger bridge theory and Doob's $h$-transform. Compared to prior methods, our approach leads to a simpler training procedure with lower variance, which we further augment with principled regularization schemes. This ultimately leads to sizeable improvements across experiments on synthetic and real data, including the tasks of predicting conformational changes in proteins and temporal evolution of cellular differentiation processes.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the CoW with the TopCoW Challenge: Topology-Aware Anatomical Segmentation of the Circle of Willis for CTA and MRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is an important network of arteries connecting major circulations of the brain. Its vascular architecture is believed to affect the risk, severity, and clinical outcome of serious neuro-vascular diseases. However, characterizing the highly variable CoW anatomy is still a manual and time-consuming expert task. The CoW is usually imaged by two angiographic imaging modalities, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA), but there exist limited public datasets with annotations on CoW anatomy, especially for CTA. Therefore we organized the TopCoW Challenge in 2023 with the release of an annotated CoW dataset. The TopCoW dataset was the first public dataset with voxel-level annotations for thirteen possible CoW vessel components, enabled by virtual-reality (VR) technology. It was also the first large dataset with paired MRA and CTA from the same patients. TopCoW challenge formalized the CoW characterization problem as a multiclass anatomical segmentation task with an emphasis on topological metrics. We invited submissions worldwide for the CoW segmentation task, which attracted over 140 registered participants from four continents. The top performing teams managed to segment many CoW components to Dice scores around 90%, but with lower scores for communicating arteries and rare variants. There were also topological mistakes for predictions with high Dice scores. Additional topological analysis revealed further areas for improvement in detecting certain CoW components and matching CoW variant topology accurately. TopCoW represented a first attempt at benchmarking the CoW anatomical segmentation task for MRA and CTA, both morphologically and topologically.</description>
