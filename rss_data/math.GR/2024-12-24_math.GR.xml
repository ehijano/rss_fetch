      <title>Corrigendum and addendum to "Transitive permutation groups where nontrivial elements have at most two fixed points"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article revisits earlier work by the second author together with Kay Magaard. We correct several little results and we briefly discuss why, fortunately, the errors did not affect our main theorems and the classification of simple groups that act with fixity 2. In addition to the submitted article, this version also contains GAP code in a little appendix at the end.</description>

      <title>Lifting relations in right orderable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the following problem: given a chain complex $A_*$ of free $\mathbb{Z}G$-modules, when is $A_*$ isomorphic to the cellular chain complex of some simply connected $G$-CW-complex? Such a chain complex is called realisable. Wall studied this problem in the 60's and reduced it to a problem involving only the second differential $d_2$, now known as the relation lifting problem. We show that if $G$ is right orderable and $d_2$ is given by a matrix of a certain form, then $A_*$ is realisable. As a special case, we solve the relation lifting problem for right orderable groups with cyclic relation module.</description>

      <title>Algebraic and geometric properties of homeomorphism groups of ordinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the homeomorphism groups of ordinals equipped with their order topology, focusing on successor ordinals whose limit capacity is also a successor. This is a rich family of groups that has connections to both permutation groups and homeomorphism groups of manifolds.
  For ordinals of Cantor--Bendixson degree one, we prove that the homeomorphism group is strongly distorted and uniformly perfect, and we classify its normal generators. As a corollary, we recover and provide a new proof of the classical result that the subgroup of finite permutations in the symmetric group on a countably infinite set is the maximal proper normal subgroup.
  For ordinals of higher Cantor--Bendixson degree, we establish a semi-direct product decomposition of the (pure) homeomorphism group. When the limit capacity is one, we further compute the abelianizations and determine normal generating sets of minimal cardinality for these groups.</description>

      <title>Width bounds and Steinhaus property for unit groups of continuous rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an algebraic decomposition theorem for the unit group $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ of an arbitrary non-discrete irreducible, continuous ring $R$ (in von Neumann's sense), which entails that every element of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ is both a product of $7$ commutators and a product of $16$ involutions. Combining this with further insights into the geometry of involutions, we deduce that $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ has the so-called Steinhaus property with respect to the natural rank topology, thus every homomorphism from $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ to a separable topological group is necessarily continuous. Due to earlier work, this has further dynamical ramifications: for instance, for every action of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ by homeomorphisms on a non-void metrizable compact space, every element of $\mathrm{GL}(R)$ admits a fixed point in the latter. In particular, our results answer two questions by Carderi and Thom, even in generalized form.</description>

      <title>The geometry of totally geodesic subvarieties of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a semi-simplicity result for the boundary, in the corresponding Deligne-Mumford compactification, of totally geodesic subvarieties of moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces. Phrased at the level of Teichm\"uller space, this semi-simplicity theorem gives that each component of the boundary is a product of simple factors, each of which behaves metrically like a diagonal embedding. We use this to show that the associated totally geodesic submanifolds of Teichm\"uller space and orbifold fundamental groups are hierarchically hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>On the size of the Schur multiplier of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02793v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain bounds for the size of the Schur multiplier of finite $p$-groups and finite groups, which improve all existing bounds. Moreover, we obtain bounds for the size of the second cohomology group $H^2(G,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})$ of a $p$-group with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$. Denoting the minimal number of generators of a $p$-group $G$ by $d(G)$, our bound depends on the parameters $|G|=p^n$, $|\gamma_2G|=p^k$, $d(G)=d$, $d(G/Z)=\delta$ and $d(\gamma_2G/\gamma_3G)=k'$. For special $p$-groups, we further improve our bound when $\delta-1 &gt; k'$. Moreover, given natural numbers $d$, $\delta$, $k$ and $k'$ satisfying $k=k'$ and $\delta-1 \leq k'$, we construct a capable $p$-group $H$ of nilpotency class two and exponent $p$ such that the size of the Schur multiplier attains our bound.</description>

Abstract: We provide a new geometric characterization for the spine of untwisted outer space of a right-angled Artin group, constructed by Charney, Stambaugh, and Vogtmann. We realize the spine as the natural simplicial complex associated with the category of spatial cube complexes, a new class of locally CAT(0) cube complexes with a simple definition in terms of hyperplane collapses.</description>

      <title>On additive bases in infinite abelian semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.03919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on previous work by Lambert, Plagne and the third author, we study various aspects of the behavior of additive bases in infinite abelian groups and semigroups. We show that, for every infinite abelian group $T$, the number of essential subsets of any additive basis is finite, and also that the number of essential subsets of cardinality $k$ contained in an additive basis of order at most $h$ can be bounded in terms of $h$ and $k$ alone. These results extend the reach of two theorems, one due to Deschamps and Farhi and the other to Hegarty, bearing upon $\mathbf{N}$. Also, using invariant means, we address a classical problem, initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Graham and then generalized by Nash and Nathanson both in the case of $\mathbf{N}$, of estimating the maximal order $X_T(h,k)$ that a basis of cocardinality $k$ contained in an additive basis of order at most $h$ can have. Among other results, we prove that $X_T(h,k)=O(h^{2k+1})$ for every integer $k \ge 1$. This result is new even in the case where $k=1$. Besides the maximal order $X_T(h,k)$, the typical order $S_T(h,k)$ is also studied. Our methods actually apply to a wider class of infinite abelian semigroups, thus unifying in a single axiomatic frame the theory of additive bases in $\mathbf{N}$ and in abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Galois representations with large image in the global Langlands correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global Langlands conjecture for $\text{GL}_n$ over a number field $F$ predicts a correspondence between certain algebraic automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ and certain families $\{ \rho_{\pi,\ell} \}_\ell$ of $n$-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representations of $\text{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)$. In general, it is expected that the image of the residual Galois representation $\overline{\rho}_{\pi,\ell}$ of $\rho_{\pi,\ell}$ should be as large as possible for almost all primes $\ell$, unless there is an automorphic reason for the image to be small.
  In this paper, we study the images of certain compatible systems of Galois representations $\{\rho_{\pi,\ell} \}_\ell$ associated to regular algebraic, polarizable, cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ by using only standard techniques and currently available tools (e.g., Fontaine-Laffaille theory, Serre's modularity conjecture, classification of the maximal subgroups of Lie type groups, and known results about irreducibility of automorphic Galois representations and Langlands functoriality). In particular, when $F$ is a totally real field and $n$ is an odd prime number $\leq 293$, we prove that (under certain automorphic conditions) the images of the residual representations $\overline{\rho}_{\pi,\ell}$ are as large as possible for infinitely many primes $\ell$. In fact, we prove the large image conjecture (i.e., large image for almost all primes $\ell$) when $F=\mathbb{Q}$ and $n=5$.</description>

      <title>Bender--Knuth Billiards in Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system, and write $S=\{s_i:i\in I\}$, where $I$ is a finite index set. Fix a nonempty convex subset $\mathscr{L}$ of $W$. If $W$ is of type $A$, then $\mathscr{L}$ is the set of linear extensions of a poset, and there are important Bender--Knuth involutions $\mathrm{BK}_i\colon\mathscr{L}\to\mathscr{L}$ indexed by elements of $I$. For arbitrary $W$ and for each $i\in I$, we introduce an operator $\tau_i\colon W\to W$ (depending on $\mathscr{L}$) that we call a noninvertible Bender--Knuth toggle; this operator restricts to an involution on $\mathscr{L}$ that coincides with $\mathrm{BK}_i$ in type $A$. Given a Coxeter element $c=s_{i_n}\cdots s_{i_1}$, we consider the operator $\mathrm{Pro}_c=\tau_{i_n}\cdots\tau_{i_1}$. We say $W$ is futuristic if for every nonempty finite convex set $\mathscr{L}$, every Coxeter element $c$, and every $u\in W$, there exists an integer $K\geq 0$ such that $\mathrm{Pro}_c^K(u)\in\mathscr{L}$. We prove that finite Coxeter groups, right-angled Coxeter groups, rank-3 Coxeter groups, affine Coxeter groups of types $\widetilde A$ and $\widetilde C$, and Coxeter groups whose Coxeter graphs are complete are all futuristic. When $W$ is finite, we actually prove that if $s_{i_N}\cdots s_{i_1}$ is a reduced expression for the long element of $W$, then $\tau_{i_N}\cdots\tau_{i_1}(W)=\mathscr{L}$; this allows us to determine the smallest integer $\mathrm{M}(c)$ such that $\mathrm{Pro}_c^{{\mathrm{M}}(c)}(W)=\mathscr{L}$ for all $\mathscr{L}$. We also exhibit infinitely many non-futuristic Coxeter groups, including all irreducible affine Coxeter groups that are not of type $\widetilde A$, $\widetilde C$, or $\widetilde G_2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relatively little is known about the discrete horospheres in hyperbolic groups, even in simple settings. In this paper we work with hyperbolic one-ended right-angled Coxeter groups and describe two graph structures that mimic the intrinsic metric on a classical horosphere: the Rips graph and the divergence graph (the latter due to Cohen, Goodman-Strauss, and Rieck). We develop, analyze, and implement algorithms based on finite-state machines that draw large finite portions of these graphs, and deduce various geometric corollaries about the path metrics induced by these graph structures.</description>

      <title>Almost classical skew bracoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate two sub-classes of skew bracoids, the first consists of those we term almost a brace, meaning the multiplicative group decomposes as a certain semi-direct product, and then those that are almost classical, which additionally specifies the relationship between the multiplicative group and the additive. Skew bracoids with these properties have applications in Hopf-Galois theory, in particular for questions concerning the Hopf-Galois correspondence, and can also yield solutions to the set-theoretic Yang-Baxter equation. We use this skew bracoid perspective to give a new construction building on the induced Hopf-Galois structures of Crespo, Rio and Vela, recover a result of Greither and Pareigis on the Hopf-Galois correspondence, and examine the solutions that arise from skew bracoids, in particular where more than one solution may be drawn from a single skew bracoid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on groups were studied quite recently. Motivated mainly by the fact that weight zero Rota-Baxter operators and averaging operators are Koszul dual to each other, we propose the concepts of averaging group and averaging Hopf algebra, and study relationships among them and the existing averaging Lie algebras. We also show that an averaging group induces a disemigroup and a rack, respectively. As the free object is one of the most significant objects in a category, we also construct explicitly the free averaging group on a set.</description>
