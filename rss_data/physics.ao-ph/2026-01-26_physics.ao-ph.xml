      <title>Black Carbon scavenging in liquid Arctic clouds: the role of size and mixing state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black carbon (BC) contributes to Arctic warming by absorbing sunlight and darkening snow. Its atmospheric lifetime critically determines its concentration and climate impact, yet the processes controlling its removal remain poorly constrained in the Arctic. From 18 months of single-particle measurements at the Zeppelin Observatory (Svalbard), we analysed 37 liquid cloud events (~200 hours) to investigate the link between BC properties and in-cloud scavenging, providing the most extensive in-cloud single particle BC dataset to date. While large BC cores (DrBC&gt;200 nm) were consistently scavenged, smaller cores were only partly removed. However, even thin soluble coatings significantly enhanced their scavenging, showing that mixing state modulates BC scavenging in the CCN-limited regime typical of Arctic low-level clouds. Seasonal variability in clear sky BC mixing state further suggests corresponding changes in scavenging efficiency. Our results demonstrate that besides size, the size-resolved BC mixing state is a key variable for BC scavenging in the Arctic and models should take it into consideration to accurately predict BC-cloud interaction.</description>

      <title>Climate-Adaptive and Cascade-Constrained Machine Learning Prediction for Sea Surface Height under Greenhouse Warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has achieved remarkable success in climate and marine science. Given that greenhouse warming fundamentally reshapes ocean conditions such as stratification, circulation patterns and eddy activity, evaluating the climate adaptability of the ML models is crucial. While physical constraints have been shown to enhance the performance of ML models, kinetic energy (KE) cascade has not been used as a constraint despite its importance in regulating multi-scale ocean motions. Here we develop two sea surface height (SSH) prediction models (with and without KE cascade constraint) and quantify their climate adaptability at the Kuroshio Extension. Both models exhibit only slight performance degradation under greenhouse warming conditions. Incorporating the KE cascade as a physical constraint significantly improves the model performance, reducing eddy kinetic energy errors by 14.7% in the present climate and 15.9% under greenhouse warming. Additional validations using satellite observations and in the Gulf Stream region further confirm the robustness of the proposed models. Compared with the KE spectrum constraint, both constraints improve the cross-scale transfer and spectrum of KE, but the KE cascade constraint yields larger improvements in the cross-scale transfer. This work presents the first application of the KE cascade as a physical constraint for ML-based ocean state prediction and demonstrates its robust adaptability across climates, offering guidance for the further development of global ML models for both present and future conditions.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic vs dynamic representation of the inverse barometer effect in a global ocean model and its potential for probabilistic storm surge forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global ocean model NEMO is run in a series of stand-alone configurations (2015-2022) to investigate the potential for improving global medium-range storm surge forecasts by including the inverse barometer effect. The analysis focus on the residual water level, i.e. the water level variations not due to tides. Here, we compare a control experiment, where the inverse barometer effect was not included, against a run dynamically forced with mean sea level pressure. In the control experiment, the inverse barometer effect was then calculated diagnostically and added to the ocean model sea surface elevation, resulting in a total of three experiments to investigate. We compare against the global GESLA3 water level data set and find that the inclusion of the inverse barometer effect reduces the root-mean-square error by $\sim 1~cm$ on average. When we mask out all data where the observed residual water level is less than $\pm1$ or $\pm2$ standard deviations, including the inverse barometer effect reduces the RMS error by $4-5$ cm. While both methods reduce water level errors, there are regional differences in their performance. The run with dynamical pressure forcing is seen to perform slightly better than diagnostically adding the inverse barometer effect in enclosed basins such as the Baltic Sea. Finally, an ensemble forecast experiment with the Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts demonstrates that when the diagnostic inverse barometer effect is included for a severe storm surge event in the North Sea (Storm Xaver, December 2013), the ensemble spread of water level provides a stronger and earlier indication of the observed maximum surge level than the when the effect is excluded.</description>
