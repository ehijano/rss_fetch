      <title>Modeling the impact of Climate transition on real estate prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a model to quantify the impact of the climate transition on a property in housing market. We begin by noting that property is an asset in an economy. That economy is organized in sectors, driven by its productivity which is a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the climate transition is declined thanks to the carbon price, a continuous deterministic process. We then extend the sales comparison approach and the income approach to valuate an energy inefficient real estate asset. We obtain its value as the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient building following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as well as the actualized renovation costs and the actualized sum of the future additional energy costs. These costs are due to the inefficiency of the building, before an optimal renovation date which depends on the carbon price process. Finally, we carry out simulations based on the French economy and the house price index of France. Our results allow to conclude that the order of magnitude of the depreciation obtained by our model is the same as the empirical observations.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Energy Algorithmic Trading: Integrating Hidden Markov Models with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantitative finance, machine learning methods are essential for alpha generation. This study introduces a new approach that combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio optimization. During the COVID period (2019-2022), this dual-model approach achieved a 97% return with a Sharpe ratio of 0.992. It incorporates two risk models to enhance risk management, showing efficiency during volatile periods. The methodology was implemented on the QuantConnect platform, which was chosen for its robust framework and experimental reproducibility. The system, which predicts future price movements, includes a three-year warm-up to ensure proper algorithm function. It targets highly liquid, large-cap energy stocks to ensure stable and predictable performance while also considering broker payments. The dual-model alpha system utilizes log returns to select the optimal state based on the historical performance. It combines state predictions with neural network outputs, which are based on historical data, to generate trading signals. This study examined the architecture of the trading system, data pre-processing, training, and performance. The full code and backtesting data are available under the MIT license.</description>
