      <title>Advancing Similarity Search with GenAI: A Retrieval Augmented Generation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces an innovative Retrieval Augmented Generation approach to similarity search. The proposed method uses a generative model to capture nuanced semantic information and retrieve similarity scores based on advanced context understanding. The study focuses on the BIOSSES dataset containing 100 pairs of sentences extracted from the biomedical domain, and introduces similarity search correlation results that outperform those previously attained on this dataset. Through an in-depth analysis of the model sensitivity, the research identifies optimal conditions leading to the highest similarity search accuracy: the results reveals high Pearson correlation scores, reaching specifically 0.905 at a temperature of 0.5 and a sample size of 20 examples provided in the prompt. The findings underscore the potential of generative models for semantic information retrieval and emphasize a promising research direction to similarity search.</description>

      <title>An innovative data collection method to eliminate the preprocessing phase in web usage mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The underlying data source for web usage mining (WUM) is commonly thought to be server logs. However, access log files ensure quite limited data about the clients. Identifying sessions from this messy data takes a considerable effort, and operations performed for this purpose do not always yield excellent results. Also, this data cannot be used for web analytics efficiently. This study proposes an innovative method for user tracking, session management, and collecting web usage data. The method is mainly based on a new approach for using collected data for web analytics extraction as the data source in web usage mining. An application-based API has been developed with a different strategy from conventional client-side methods to obtain and process log data. The log data has been successfully gathered by integrating the technique into an enterprise web application. The results reveal that the homogeneous structured data collected and stored with this method is more convenient to browse, filter, and process than web server logs. This data stored on a relational database can be used effortlessly as a reliable data source for high-performance web usage mining activity, real-time web analytics, or a functional recommendation system.</description>

      <title>A Closer Look on Gender Stereotypes in Movie Recommender Systems and Their Implications with Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The movie recommender system typically leverages user feedback to provide personalized recommendations that align with user preferences and increase business revenue. This study investigates the impact of gender stereotypes on such systems through a specific attack scenario. In this scenario, an attacker determines users' gender, a private attribute, by exploiting gender stereotypes about movie preferences and analyzing users' feedback data, which is either publicly available or observed within the system. The study consists of two phases. In the first phase, a user study involving 630 participants identified gender stereotypes associated with movie genres, which often influence viewing choices. In the second phase, four inference algorithms were applied to detect gender stereotypes by combining the findings from the first phase with users' feedback data. Results showed that these algorithms performed more effectively than relying solely on feedback data for gender inference. Additionally, we quantified the extent of gender stereotypes to evaluate their broader impact on digital computational science. The latter part of the study utilized two major movie recommender datasets: MovieLens 1M and Yahoo!Movie.

      <title>Evaluating Interval-based Tokenization for Pitch Representation in Symbolic Music Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbolic music analysis tasks are often performed by models originally developed for Natural Language Processing, such as Transformers. Such models require the input data to be represented as sequences, which is achieved through a process of tokenization. Tokenization strategies for symbolic music often rely on absolute MIDI values to represent pitch information. However, music research largely promotes the benefit of higher-level representations such as melodic contour and harmonic relations for which pitch intervals turn out to be more expressive than absolute pitches. In this work, we introduce a general framework for building interval-based tokenizations. By evaluating these tokenizations on three music analysis tasks, we show that such interval-based tokenizations improve model performances and facilitate their explainability.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Retrieval Based on Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a question-answering system based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Chinese Wikipedia and Lawbank as retrieval sources. Using TTQA and TMMLU+ as evaluation datasets, the system employs BGE-M3 for dense vector retrieval to obtain highly relevant search results and BGE-reranker to reorder these results based on query relevance. The most pertinent retrieval outcomes serve as reference knowledge for a Large Language Model (LLM), enhancing its ability to answer questions and establishing a knowledge retrieval system grounded in generative AI.
  The system's effectiveness is assessed through a two-stage evaluation: automatic and assisted performance evaluations. The automatic evaluation calculates accuracy by comparing the model's auto-generated labels with ground truth answers, measuring performance under standardized conditions without human intervention. The assisted performance evaluation involves 20 finance-related multiple-choice questions answered by 20 participants without financial backgrounds. Initially, participants answer independently. Later, they receive system-generated reference information to assist in answering, examining whether the system improves accuracy when assistance is provided.
  The main contributions of this research are: (1) Enhanced LLM Capability: By integrating BGE-M3 and BGE-reranker, the system retrieves and reorders highly relevant results, reduces hallucinations, and dynamically accesses authorized or public knowledge sources. (2) Improved Data Privacy: A customized RAG architecture enables local operation of the LLM, eliminating the need to send private data to external servers. This approach enhances data security, reduces reliance on commercial services, lowers operational costs, and mitigates privacy risks.</description>

      <title>A Generative AI-driven Metadata Modelling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since decades, the modelling of metadata has been core to the functioning of any academic library. Its importance has only enhanced with the increasing pervasiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven information activities and services which constitute a library's outreach. However, with the rising importance of metadata, there arose several outstanding problems with the process of designing a library metadata model impacting its reusability, crosswalk and interoperability with other metadata models. This paper posits that the above problems stem from an underlying thesis that there should only be a few core metadata models which would be necessary and sufficient for any information service using them, irrespective of the heterogeneity of intra-domain or inter-domain settings. To that end, this paper advances a contrary view of the above thesis and substantiates its argument in three key steps. First, it introduces a novel way of thinking about a library metadata model as an ontology-driven composition of five functionally interlinked representation levels from perception to its intensional definition via properties. Second, it introduces the representational manifoldness implicit in each of the five levels which cumulatively contributes to a conceptually entangled library metadata model. Finally, and most importantly, it proposes a Generative AI-driven Human-Large Language Model (LLM) collaboration based metadata modelling approach to disentangle the entanglement inherent in each representation level leading to the generation of a conceptually disentangled metadata model. Throughout the paper, the arguments are exemplified by motivating scenarios and examples from representative libraries handling cancer information.</description>

      <title>KGIF: Optimizing Relation-Aware Recommendations with Knowledge Graph Information Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While deep-learning-enabled recommender systems demonstrate strong performance benchmarks, many struggle to adapt effectively in real-world environments due to limited use of user-item relationship data and insufficient transparency in recommendation generation. Traditional collaborative filtering approaches fail to integrate multifaceted item attributes, and although Factorization Machines account for item-specific details, they overlook broader relational patterns. Collaborative knowledge graph-based models have progressed by embedding user-item interactions with item-attribute relationships, offering a holistic perspective on interconnected entities. However, these models frequently aggregate attribute and interaction data in an implicit manner, leaving valuable relational nuances underutilized.
  This study introduces the Knowledge Graph Attention Network with Information Fusion (KGIF), a specialized framework designed to merge entity and relation embeddings explicitly through a tailored self-attention mechanism. The KGIF framework integrates reparameterization via dynamic projection vectors, enabling embeddings to adaptively represent intricate relationships within knowledge graphs. This explicit fusion enhances the interplay between user-item interactions and item-attribute relationships, providing a nuanced balance between user-centric and item-centric representations. An attentive propagation mechanism further optimizes knowledge graph embeddings, capturing multi-layered interaction patterns. The contributions of this work include an innovative method for explicit information fusion, improved robustness for sparse knowledge graphs, and the ability to generate explainable recommendations through interpretable path visualization.</description>

      <title>Reasoning-Enhanced Self-Training for Long-Form Personalized Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Personalized text generation requires a unique ability of large language models (LLMs) to learn from context that they often do not encounter during their standard training. One way to encourage LLMs to better use personalized context for generating outputs that better align with the user's expectations is to instruct them to reason over the user's past preferences, background knowledge, or writing style. To achieve this, we propose Reasoning-Enhanced Self-Training for Personalized Text Generation (REST-PG), a framework that trains LLMs to reason over personal data during response generation. REST-PG first generates reasoning paths to train the LLM's reasoning abilities and then employs Expectation-Maximization Reinforced Self-Training to iteratively train the LLM based on its own high-reward outputs. We evaluate REST-PG on the LongLaMP benchmark, consisting of four diverse personalized long-form text generation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that REST-PG achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, with an average relative performance gain of 14.5% on the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Multi-task retriever fine-tuning for domain-specific and efficient RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become ubiquitous when deploying Large Language Models (LLMs), as it can address typical limitations such as generating hallucinated or outdated information. However, when building real-world RAG applications, practical issues arise. First, the retrieved information is generally domain-specific. Since it is computationally expensive to fine-tune LLMs, it is more feasible to fine-tune the retriever to improve the quality of the data included in the LLM input. Second, as more applications are deployed in the same real-world system, one cannot afford to deploy separate retrievers. Moreover, these RAG applications normally retrieve different kinds of data. Our solution is to instruction fine-tune a small retriever encoder on a variety of domain-specific tasks to allow us to deploy one encoder that can serve many use cases, thereby achieving low-cost, scalability, and speed. We show how this encoder generalizes to out-of-domain settings as well as to an unseen retrieval task on real-world enterprise use cases.</description>

      <title>Re-ranking the Context for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by incorporating external knowledge to generate a response within a context with improved accuracy and reduced hallucinations. However, multi-modal RAG systems face unique challenges: (i) the retrieval process may select irrelevant entries to user query (e.g., images, documents), and (ii) vision-language models or multi-modal language models like GPT-4o may hallucinate when processing these entries to generate RAG output. In this paper, we aim to address the first challenge, i.e, improving the selection of relevant context from the knowledge-base in retrieval phase of the multi-modal RAG. Specifically, we leverage the relevancy score (RS) measure designed in our previous work for evaluating the RAG performance to select more relevant entries in retrieval process. The retrieval based on embeddings, say CLIP-based embedding, and cosine similarity usually perform poorly particularly for multi-modal data. We show that by using a more advanced relevancy measure, one can enhance the retrieval process by selecting more relevant pieces from the knowledge-base and eliminate the irrelevant pieces from the context by adaptively selecting up-to-$k$ entries instead of fixed number of entries. Our evaluation using COCO dataset demonstrates significant enhancement in selecting relevant context and accuracy of the generated response.</description>

      <title>InterFormer: Towards Effective Heterogeneous Interaction Learning for Click-Through Rate Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which predicts the probability of a user clicking an ad, is a fundamental task in recommender systems. The emergence of heterogeneous information, such as user profile and behavior sequences, depicts user interests from different aspects. A mutually beneficial integration of heterogeneous information is the cornerstone towards the success of CTR prediction. However, most of the existing methods suffer from two fundamental limitations, including (1) insufficient inter-mode interaction due to the unidirectional information flow between modes, and (2) aggressive information aggregation caused by early summarization, resulting in excessive information loss. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel module named InterFormer to learn heterogeneous information interaction in an interleaving style. To achieve better interaction learning, InterFormer enables bidirectional information flow for mutually beneficial learning across different modes. To avoid aggressive information aggregation, we retain complete information in each data mode and use a separate bridging arch for effective information selection and summarization. Our proposed InterFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public datasets and a large-scale industrial dataset.</description>

      <title>Minimum Weighted Feedback Arc Sets for Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Minimum Weighted Feedback Arc Set (MWFAS) problem is fundamentally connected to the Ranking Problem -- the task of deriving global rankings from pairwise comparisons. Recent work [He et al. ICML2022] has advanced the state-of-the-art for the Ranking Problem using learning-based methods, improving upon multiple previous approaches. However, the connection to MWFAS remains underexplored. This paper investigates this relationship and presents efficient combinatorial algorithms for solving MWFAS, thus addressing the Ranking Problem. Our experimental results demonstrate that these simple, learning-free algorithms not only significantly outperform learning-based methods in terms of speed but also generally achieve superior ranking accuracy.</description>

      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Graphs (GraphRAG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a powerful technique that enhances downstream task execution by retrieving additional information, such as knowledge, skills, and tools from external sources. Graph, by its intrinsic "nodes connected by edges" nature, encodes massive heterogeneous and relational information, making it a golden resource for RAG in tremendous real-world applications. As a result, we have recently witnessed increasing attention on equipping RAG with Graph, i.e., GraphRAG. However, unlike conventional RAG, where the retriever, generator, and external data sources can be uniformly designed in the neural-embedding space, the uniqueness of graph-structured data, such as diverse-formatted and domain-specific relational knowledge, poses unique and significant challenges when designing GraphRAG for different domains. Given the broad applicability, the associated design challenges, and the recent surge in GraphRAG, a systematic and up-to-date survey of its key concepts and techniques is urgently desired. Following this motivation, we present a comprehensive and up-to-date survey on GraphRAG. Our survey first proposes a holistic GraphRAG framework by defining its key components, including query processor, retriever, organizer, generator, and data source. Furthermore, recognizing that graphs in different domains exhibit distinct relational patterns and require dedicated designs, we review GraphRAG techniques uniquely tailored to each domain. Finally, we discuss research challenges and brainstorm directions to inspire cross-disciplinary opportunities. Our survey repository is publicly maintained at https://github.com/Graph-RAG/GraphRAG/.</description>

      <title>Network-Based Video Recommendation Using Viewing Patterns and Modularity Analysis: An Integrated Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of video-on-demand (VOD) services has led to a paradox of choice, overwhelming users with vast content libraries and revealing limitations in current recommender systems. This research introduces a novel approach by combining implicit user data, such as viewing percentages, with social network analysis to enhance personalization in VOD platforms. The methodology constructs user-item interaction graphs based on viewing patterns and applies centrality measures (degree, closeness, and betweenness) to identify important videos. Modularity-based clustering groups related content, enabling personalized recommendations. The system was evaluated on a documentary-focused VOD platform with 328 users over four months. Results showed significant improvements: a 63% increase in click-through rate (CTR), a 24% increase in view completion rate, and a 17% improvement in user satisfaction. The approach outperformed traditional methods like Naive Bayes and SVM. Future research should explore advanced techniques, such as matrix factorization models, graph neural networks, and hybrid approaches combining content-based and collaborative filtering. Additionally, incorporating temporal models and addressing scalability challenges for large-scale platforms are essential next steps. This study contributes to the state of the art by introducing modularity-based clustering and ego-centric ranking methods to enhance personalization in video recommendations. The findings suggest that integrating network-based features and implicit feedback can significantly improve user engagement, offering a cost-effective solution for VOD platforms to enhance recommendation quality.</description>

      <title>RDRec: Rationale Distillation for LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based recommender models that bridge users and items through textual prompts for effective semantic reasoning have gained considerable attention. However, few methods consider the underlying rationales behind interactions, such as user preferences and item attributes, limiting the reasoning capability of LLMs for recommendations. This paper proposes a rationale distillation recommender (RDRec), a compact model designed to learn rationales generated by a larger language model (LM). By leveraging rationales from reviews related to users and items, RDRec remarkably specifies their profiles for recommendations. Experiments show that RDRec achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both top-N and sequential recommendations. Our source code is released at https://github.com/WangXFng/RDRec.</description>
