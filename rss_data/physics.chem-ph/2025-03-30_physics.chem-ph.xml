      <title>Radiative stabilization of the indenyl cation: Recurrent fluorescence in a closed-shell polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several small polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with closed-shell electronic structure have been identified in the cold, dark environment Taurus Molecular Cloud-1. We measure efficient radiative cooling through the combination of recurrent fluorescence (RF) and IR emission in the closed-shell indenyl cation (C$_{9}$H$_{7}^{+}$), finding good agreement with a master equation model including molecular dynamics trajectories to describe internal-energy dependent properties for RF. We find that C$_{9}$H$_{7}^{+}$ formed with up to $E_{c}=5.85$\,eV vibrational energy, which is $\approx$2\,eV above the dissociation threshold, radiatively cool rather than dissociate. The efficient radiative stabilization dynamics are likely common to other closed-shell PAHs present in space, contributing to their abundance.</description>

      <title>Ostwald Ripening of Buoyancy-Driven Microbubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbubble solutions have a wide range of industrial applications, including heat transfer, agriculture, and water treatment. Therefore, understanding and controlling the size variation of bubbles is critical. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework for Ostwald ripening in buoyancy-driven microbubbles by introducing a height-dependent size distribution function. For the first time, we show that the population balance equation in steady state can be interpreted within the Lifshitz-Slezov-Wagner theory when the distribution function is redefined as the density distribution of the buoyancy-induced flux. Notably, in this form of Ostwald ripening, the distribution function approaches a scaled universal distribution, not over time, but as a function of height. We analytically derive the scaled universal distribution and show that the fifth power of the mean radius of the bubbles grows linearly with height.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Accuracy of Quantum-Selected Configuration Interaction Calculations using Multireference Perturbation Theory: Application to Aromatic Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) is a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm for quantum chemistry calculations. This method identifies electron configurations having large weights for the target state using quantum devices and allows CI calculations to be performed with the selected configurations on classical computers. In principle, the QSCI algorithm can take advantage of the ability to handle large configuration spaces while reducing the negative effects of noise on the calculated values. At present, QSCI calculations are limited by qubit noise during the input state preparation and measurement process, restricting them to small active spaces. These limitations make it difficult to perform calculations with quantitative accuracy. The present study demonstrates a computational scheme based on multireference perturbation theory calculations on a classical computer, using the QSCI wavefunction as a reference. This method was applied to ground and excited state calculations for two typical aromatic molecules, naphthalene and tetracene. The incorporation of the perturbation treatment was found to provide improved accuracy. Extension of the reference space based on the QSCI-selected configurations as a means of further improvement was also investigated.</description>

      <title>Analogue of the Mpemba effect in classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The name "Mpemba effect" was given to the finding that "If two systems are cooled, the water that starts hotter may freeze first", confirmed by numerous of observations. Now this paradoxical state-ment obtained a more general form "the state that is initially more distant from its equilibrium state comes to this state earlier". Though seemingly violating the fundamental laws of physical chemistry, this effect has been experimentally demonstrated for aqueous and various other systems, up to quan-tum dots. It was widely discussed in the American Journal of Physics, Nature, and other highly reputa-ble journals, but the fundamental physical mechanism(s) underlying this effect remained elusive. Here I describe a simple mechanical system demonstrating the Mpemba effect ("the state that is initially more distant from its equilibrium state comes to this state earlier"), and show what physical mechanism causes this effect in this system.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy in the condensed phase using equivariant transformer accelerated molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) provides rich information about how the electronic states of molecules, proteins, and solid-state materials interact with each other and their surrounding environment. Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations offer an appealing route to uncover how nuclear motions mediate electronic energy relaxation and their manifestation in electronic spectroscopies, but are computationally expensive. Here we show that, by using an equivariant transformer-based machine learning architecture trained with only ~2500 ground state and ~100 excited state electronic structure calculations, one can construct accurate machine-learned potential energy surfaces for both the ground-state electronic surface and excited-state energy gap. We demonstrate the utility of this approach for simulating the dynamics of Nile blue in ethanol, where we experimentally validate and decompose the simulated 2DES to establish the nuclear motions of the chromophore and the solvent that couple to the excited state, connecting the spectroscopic signals to their molecular origin.</description>

      <title>Non-linear and non-empirical double hybrid density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nLanE) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nLanE-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nLanE-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through SIE4x4 and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</description>

      <title>ML-based Method for Solving the Microkinetic Model of Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis with Varying Catalyst/Reactor Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a physics-informed machine learning framework to accelerate the computation of the microkinetic model of Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. A neural network, trained within the NVIDIA Modulus framework, approximates the fraction of vacant catalytic sites with high accuracy. The combination of implicit differentiation and the Newton-Raphson method enhances derivative calculations, ensuring physical consistency. Computational efficiency improves significantly, with speedups up to $ 10^4 $ times on a GPU. This versatile methodology generalizes across catalysts and reactors, offering a robust tool for chemical engineering applications, including model approximation and catalyst parameter fitting from experimental data.</description>

      <title>High-resolution cryoEM structure determination of soluble proteins after soft-landing ESIBD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft-landing electrospray ion beam deposition (ESIBD), i.e. the chemically selective, intact deposition of large and complex molecules on surfaces in vacuum, is a well-established sample preparation method for scanning probe microscopy (SPM), where it facilitates the high-resolution imaging of large and complex molecules. Inherited from mass spectrometry, the advantageous properties of ESIBD, chemical purity and selectivity, as well as precise control over the sample environment in vacuum, are also desirable in combination with other analytical methods. Therefore, recently ESIBD has been pursued for the fabrication of samples for electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) with proteins introduced into the gas phase via native electrospray ionisation (native ESIBD). However, the general applicability of this approach and the optimal conditions for an ESIBD-based cryoEM workflow remain unclear. Here, we present instrumentation and methods for a dedicated ESIBD+cryoEM workflow, based on precise control over deposition conditions and sample environment. We establish optimal conditions for gentle deposition of the proteins, for growing homogeneous, ultra-thin, amorphous ice, and for avoiding contamination, which allows for atomic-resolution cryoEM imaging of multiple protein systems. Our results confirm the retention of the protein's native secondary structure and general shape. ESIBD+cryoEM directly links native MS chemical insights with cryoEM's structural precision, offering a versatile platform for structural biology applications.</description>

      <title>Simulating Molecular Single Vibronic Level Fluorescence Spectra with ab initio Hagedorn Wavepacket Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a practical, ab initio time-dependent method using Hagedorn wavepackets to efficiently simulate single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectra of polyatomic molecules from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. We apply the method to compute SVL spectra of anthracene by performing wavepacket dynamics on a 66-dimensional harmonic potential energy surface constructed from density functional theory calculations. The Hagedorn approach captures both mode distortion and Duschinsky rotation within the harmonic approximation. We not only reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^1$ and $\overline{11}^1$ levels, but are also able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments. Notably, all spectra were obtained from the same wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for the emission spectrum from the ground vibrational level of the electronically excited state.</description>

      <title>Triplet J-driven DNP, a proposal to increase the sensitivity of solution-state NMR without microwave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) is an important method to enhance the limited sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Using the existing mechanisms such as Overhauser DNP (ODNP) is still difficult to achieve significant enhancement of NMR signals in solutions at a high magnetic field. The recently proposed J-driven DNP (JDNP) condition (when the exchange interaction of two electron spins matches their Lamour frequency) may enable signal enhancement in solution as it requires only dipolar interaction between the biradical polarization agent and the analyte. However, likewise ODNP, the current JDNP strategy still requires the saturation of the electron polarization with high microwave power which has poor penetration and is associated with heating effects in most liquids. The replacement of high-power microwave irradiation is possible if the temporal electron polarization imbalance is created by a different wavelength such as the visible light. Here, we propose a triplet JDNP mechanism which first exploits the light-induced singlet fission process (i.e., a singlet exciton is converted into two triplet excitons). As the JDNP condition is fulfilled, a triplet-to-triplet cross-relaxation process will occur with different rates and consequently lead to the creation of hyperpolarization on the coupled nuclear spin states. This communication discusses the theory behind the triplet JDNP proposal, as well as the polarizing agents and conditions that will enable the new approach to enhance the sensitivity of NMR without the need of microwave irradiation.</description>

      <title>Density functional benchmark for quadruple hydrogen bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen bonding is an important non-covalent interaction that plays a major role in molecular self-organization and supramolecular structures. It can be described accurately with ab initio quantum chemical wave function methods, which become computationally expensive for large molecular assemblies. Density functional theory (DFT) offers a better balance between accuracy and computational cost, and can be routinely applied to large systems. A large number of density functional approximations (DFAs) has been developed, but their accuracy depend on the application, necessitating benchmark studies to guide their selection for use in applications. Some of us have recently determined highly accurate hydrogen bonding energies of 14 quadruply hydrogen-bonded dimers by extrapolating coupled-cluster energies to the complete basis set limit as well as extrapolating electron correlation contributions with a continued-fraction approach [U. Ahmed et al, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2024, 26, 24470]. In this work, we study the reproduction of these bonding energies at the DFT level using 152 DFAs. The top ten functionals are composed of eight variants of the Berkeley functionals both with and without dispersion corrections, and two Minnesota 2011 functionals augmented with a further dispersion correction. We find the B97M-V functional with the non-local correlation functional replaced by an empirical D3BJ dispersion correction to be the best functional, while changes to the dispersion part in other Berkeley functionals lead to poorer performance in our study.</description>

      <title>Line tension from dual-geometry sessile droplet measurements: Combining contact-angle size-dependence data for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets to determine the line tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a thermodynamic analysis of various contributions to the size dependence of the contact-angle cosine for both axisymmetric and cylindrical sessile droplets. This shows that a commonly used method to determine the line tension from the slope of the contact-angle cosine dependence on the three-phase contact-line curvature (for axisymmetric droplets) provides a certain combination of the line tension, the adsorptions at the three interfaces, and the macroscopic contact angle. To extract the contribution related to the contact line in the leading order and determine the line tension, we propose a simple technique using droplet-size dependences of the contact angle for axisymmetric and cylindrical droplets under the same conditions.</description>
