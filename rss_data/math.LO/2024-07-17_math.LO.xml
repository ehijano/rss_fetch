      <title>The Algebras of Lewis's Counterfactuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The logico-algebraic study of Lewis's hierarchy of variably strict conditional logics has been essentially unexplored, hindering our understanding of their mathematical foundations, and the connections with other logical systems. This work aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive logico-algebraic analysis of Lewis's logics. We begin by introducing novel finite axiomatizations for varying strengths of Lewis's logics, distinguishing between global and local consequence relations on Lewisian sphere models. We then demonstrate that the global consequence relation is strongly algebraizable in terms of a specific class of Boolean algebras with a binary operator representing the counterfactual implication; in contrast, we show that the local consequence relation is generally not algebraizable, although it can be characterized as the degree-preserving logic over the same algebraic models. Further, we delve into the algebraic semantics of Lewis's logics, developing two dual equivalences with respect to particular topological spaces. In more details, we show a duality with respect to the topological version of Lewis's sphere models, and also with respect to Stone spaces with a selection function; using the latter, we demonstrate the strong completeness of Lewis's logics with respect to sphere models. Finally, we draw some considerations concerning the limit assumption over sphere models.</description>

      <title>Pseudo T-closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pseudo algebraically closed, pseudo real closed, and pseudo $p$-adically closed fields are examples of unstable fields that share many similarities, but have mostly been studied separately. In this text, we propose a unified framework for studying them: the class of pseudo $T$-closed fields, where $T$ is an enriched theory of fields. These fields verify a "local-global" principle for the existence of points on varieties with respect to models of $T$. This approach also enables a good description of some fields equipped with multiple $V$-topologies, particularly pseudo algebraically closed fields with a finite number of valuations. One important result is a (model theoretic) classification result for bounded pseudo $T$-closed fields, in particular we show that under specific hypotheses on $T$, these fields are NTP$_2$ of finite burden.</description>

      <title>Many-valued coalgebraic logic over semi-primal varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14581v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study many-valued coalgebraic logics with semi-primal algebras of truth-degrees. We provide a systematic way to lift endofunctors defined on the variety of Boolean algebras to endofunctors on the variety generated by a semi-primal algebra. We show that this can be extended to a technique to lift classical coalgebraic logics to many-valued ones, and that (one-step) completeness and expressivity are preserved under this lifting. For specific classes of endofunctors, we also describe how to obtain an axiomatization of the lifted many-valued logic directly from an axiomatization of the original classical one. In particular, we apply all of these techniques to classical modal logic.</description>

      <title>Rich doctrines and Henkin's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find a possible interpretation of Henkin's Theorem in the language of existential implicational doctrines. Under some smallness assumption, starting from an implicational existential doctrine, with non-trivial fibers, we construct a new doctrine which is rich -- meaning that for every formula $\varphi(x)$ there is a constant $c$ such that $\exists x\varphi(x)$ has the same truth-value of $\varphi(c)$ -- and consistent. To obtain this result, we add a suitable amount of constants and axioms to the starting doctrine. We then show that a rich consistent doctrine admits an appropriate morphism towards the doctrine of subsets -- a model. Henkin's Theorem for doctrines follows from these two results, modeling our proof on the main lines of the original theorem.</description>
