      <title>Thick Lunar Crust Amplifies Gravitational-Wave Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) in the $10^{-3}-0.1$ Hz band encode unique signatures of the early universe and merging compact objects, but they are beyond the reach of existing observatories. Theoretical models suggest that the Moon could act as a resonant detector, but the unknown influence of its rugged surface and heterogeneous interior has cast doubt on this prospect. Here, we resolve this long-standing uncertainty by constructing the first high-resolution, structurally realistic model of the lunar GW response. We achieve this by combining high-fidelity spectral-element simulations with the analytical power of normal-mode perturbation theory, thereby resolving topographical effects down to $3.7$ km grid spacing while maintaining the capacity to discern global free-oscillation patterns. This dual-methodology approach not only recovers the expected predominant quadrupole ($l=2$) oscillation mode, but also exposes a systematic signal amplification of $(10-20)\%$ in thick-crust regions. This enhancement is traced by our normal-mode analysis to a mode-coupling process, in which the original quadrupolar oscillation induced by the passing GWs distributes energy into a series of higher-order modes, the hybridized eigenmodes of the laterally heterogeneous Moon. Near certain eigen-frequencies and at specific locations, we observe up to tenfold amplification, highlighting the power of numerical simulations in resolving these structurally fine-tuned features. Our work establishes the Moon as an accurately calibrated resonant GW detector, and the resulting amplification maps provide quantitative guide for the optimal landing site selection.</description>

      <title>Estimating Soil Electrical Parameters in the Canadian High Arctic from Impedance Measurements of the MIST Antenna Above the Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The MIST experiment aims to detect the cosmological 21-cm signal through sky observations at 25-125 MHz using a wide-beam antenna. The antenna is mounted above the soil and the beam characteristics are highly dependent on the soil's electrical properties. Accurate models for the beam obtained from electromagnetic simulations are crucial for detecting the 21-cm signal. Determining the soil properties to inform the beam simulations is therefore a very high priority for MIST. Here we report the first electrical characterization of the MIST observation site in the Canadian High Arctic, which was conducted in July, 2022. The electrical parameters were estimated using impedance measurements of the instrument's antenna, which is a very advantageous approach for MIST. Our best-fit soil model is consistent with a thawed active layer underlain by permafrost, and the parameters were estimated with a precision close to the requirements for the detection of the cosmological 21-cm signal.</description>
