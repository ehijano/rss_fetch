      <title>The Distributional Consequences of Paid-Priority Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note examines the distributional implications of introducing a fast-track queue for accessing a service when agents are heterogeneous in both income and service valuation. Relative to a single free queue, I show that willingness to adopt the priority system is determined solely by income, regardless of service valuation. High-income individuals benefit from the fast-track access, while low-income individuals are worse off and remain in the free line. Middle-income individuals weakly prefer the single free queue; yet, under the priority regime, they pay for fast-track access. Thus, the use of the priority queue does not reveal preferences for the priority system.</description>

      <title>Capability Accumulation and Conditional Convergence: Towards a Dynamic Theory of Economic Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a dynamic model of economic complexity that endogenously generates a transition between unconditional and conditional convergence. In this model, convergence turns conditional as the capability intensity of activities rises. We solve the model analytically, deriving closed-form solutions for the boundary separating unconditional from conditional convergence and show that this model also explains the path-dependent diversification process known as the principle of relatedness. This model provides an explanation for transitions between conditional and unconditional convergence and path-dependent diversification.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Sorting: Comparative Statics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sorting literature, comparative statics for multidimensional assignment models with general output functions and input distributions is an important open question. We provide a complete theory of comparative statics for technological change in general multidimensional assignment models. Our main result is that any technological change is uniquely decomposed into two distinct components. The first component (gradient) gives a characterization of changes in marginal earnings through a Poisson equation. The second component (divergence-free) gives a characterization of labor reallocation. For U.S. data, we quantify equilibrium responses in sorting and earnings with respect to cognitive skill-biased technological change.</description>

      <title>Recession Detection Using Classifiers on the Anticipation-Precision Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an algorithm for detecting US recessions in real time. The algorithm constructs hundreds of millions of recession classifiers by combining unemployment and vacancy data. Classifiers are then selected to avoid both false negatives (missed recessions) and false positives (nonexistent recessions). The selected classifiers are perfect in a statistical sense: they identify all 15 historical recessions in the 1929--2021 training period without any false positives. By further selecting classifiers that lie on the high-precision segment of the anticipation-precision frontier, the algorithm delivers early detection without sacrificing accuracy. On average between 1929 and 2021, the selected classifier ensemble signals recessions 2.1 months after their true onset, with a standard deviation of detection errors of 1.8 months. The classifier ensemble is much faster than the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee: between 1979 and 2021, the committee takes on average 6.3 months to determine recession starts, while the classifier ensemble only takes 1.2 months. Applied to September 2025 data, the classifier ensemble gives a 64% probability that the US economy has entered a recession. A placebo test and backtests confirm the algorithm's reliability.</description>

      <title>Channel Adoption Pathways and Post-Adoption Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of digital shopping channels has prompted many traditional retailers to invest in e-commerce websites and mobile apps. While prior literature shows that multichannel customers are more valuable, it overlooks how the motive for adopting a new channel shapes post-adoption behavior. Using transaction-level data from a major Brazilian pet supplies retailer, we study offline-only consumers who adopt online shopping via four distinct pathways: organic adoption, the COVID-19 pandemic, Black Friday promotions, and a loyalty program. We examine how these pathways affect post-adoption spend, profitability, and channel usage using consumer-level panel data and difference-in-differences estimates. We find that all adopters increase spending relative to offline-only consumers, but their post-adoption behaviors differ systematically by adoption motive. Promotion-driven adopters engage in forward buying and exhibit lower subsequent profitability, whereas COVID-19 adopters display stronger offline persistence consistent with consumer inertia and habit theory. Our findings have important managerial implications: firms should design promotions that discourage stockpiling, reinforce habits among customers pushed online by external shocks, and explicitly account for heterogeneity in channel adoption motives when forecasting customer lifetime value and assessing the breakeven and ROI of promotions designed to induce the adoption of new channels.</description>

      <title>From Coverage to Consequences: BMI, Health Behaviors, and Self-rated Health After Medicaid Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging Tennessee's 2005 Medicaid contraction, I study the impact of losing public health insurance on body weight and relevant health behaviors. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data from 1997 to 2010, I estimate synthetic difference-in-differences models. The estimates suggest that the reform increased Body Mass Index by 0.38 points and the overweight or obesity prevalence (BMI$\geq$25) by $\sim$4\% among Tennessean childless adults. My findings -- a 21\% increase in the share of childless adults reporting ``poor'' health status (the lowest level on the five-point scale), a reduction in Medicaid-reimbursed utilization of pain and anti-inflammatory medications, and a reduction in participation in moderate physical activities -- suggest that worsening unmanaged health conditions may be a key pathway through which coverage loss affected weight gain. Additionally, my analysis offers practical guidance for conducting robust inference in single treated cluster settings with limited pre-treatment data.</description>
