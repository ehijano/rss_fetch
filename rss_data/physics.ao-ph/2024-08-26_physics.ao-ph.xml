      <title>Improving Typhoon Predictions by Integrating Data-Driven Machine Learning Models with Physics Models Based on the Spectral Nudging and Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of data-driven machine learning (ML) models in meteorology, typhoon track forecasts have become increasingly accurate. However, current ML models still face challenges, such as underestimating typhoon intensity and lacking interpretability. To address these issues, this study establishes an ML-driven hybrid typhoon model, where forecast fields from the Pangu-Weather model are used to constrain the large-scale forecasts of the Weather Research and Forecasting model based on the spectral nudging method (Pangu_SP). The results show that forecasts from the Pangu_SP experiment obviously outperform those by using the Global Forecast System as the initial field (GFS_INIT) and from the Integrated Forecasting System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF IFS) for the track forecast of Typhoon Doksuri (2023). The predicted typhoon cloud patterns from Pangu_SP are also more consistent with satellite observations. Additionally, the typhoon intensity forecasts from Pangu_SP are notably more accurate than those from the ECMWF IFS, demonstrating that the hybrid model effectively leverages the strengths of both ML and physical models. Furthermore, this study is the first to explore the significance of data assimilation in ML-driven hybrid dynamical systems. The findings reveal that after assimilating water vapor channels from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager onboard Fengyun-4B, the errors in typhoon intensity forecasts are reduced.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Model-based Downscaling of Observed Sea Surface Height over Kuroshio Extension since 2000</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite altimetry has been widely utilized to monitor global sea surface dynamics, enabling investigation of upper ocean variability from basin-scale to localized eddy ranges. However, the sparse spatial resolution of observational altimetry limits our understanding of oceanic submesoscale variability, prevalent at horizontal scales below 0.25o resolution. Here, we introduce a state-of-the-art generative diffusion model to train high-resolution sea surface height (SSH) reanalysis data and demonstrate its advantage in observational SSH downscaling over the eddy-rich Kuroshio Extension region. The diffusion-based model effectively downscales raw satellite-interpolated data from 0.25o resolution to 1/16o, corresponding to approximately 12-km wavelength. This model outperforms other high-resolution reanalysis datasets and neural network-based methods. Also, it successfully reproduces the spatial patterns and power spectra of satellite along-track observations. Our diffusion-based results indicate that eddy kinetic energy at horizontal scales less than 250 km has intensified significantly since 2004 in the Kuroshio Extension region. These findings underscore the great potential of deep learning in reconstructing satellite altimetry and enhancing our understanding of ocean dynamics at eddy scales.</description>

      <title>EWMoE: An effective model for global weather forecasting with mixture-of-experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weather forecasting is a crucial task for meteorologic research, with direct social and economic impacts. Recently, data-driven weather forecasting models based on deep learning have shown great potential, achieving superior performance compared with traditional numerical weather prediction methods. However, these models often require massive training data and computational resources. In this paper, we propose EWMoE, an effective model for accurate global weather forecasting, which requires significantly less training data and computational resources. Our model incorporates three key components to enhance prediction accuracy: 3D absolute position embedding, a core Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layer, and two specific loss functions. We conduct our evaluation on the ERA5 dataset using only two years of training data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EWMoE outperforms current models such as FourCastNet and ClimaX at all forecast time, achieving competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art models Pangu-Weather and GraphCast in evaluation metrics such as Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Additionally, ablation studies indicate that applying the MoE architecture to weather forecasting offers significant advantages in improving accuracy and resource efficiency.
