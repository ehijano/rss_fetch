      <title>The Ensemble Epanechnikov Mixture Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the high-dimensional setting, Gaussian mixture kernel density estimates become increasingly suboptimal. In this work we aim to show that it is practical to instead use the optimal multivariate Epanechnikov kernel. We make use of this optimal Epanechnikov mixture kernel density estimate for the sequential filtering scenario through what we term the ensemble Epanechnikov mixture filter (EnEMF). We provide a practical implementation of the EnEMF that is as cost efficient as the comparable ensemble Gaussian mixture filter. We show on a static example that the EnEMF is robust to growth in dimension, and also that the EnEMF has a significant reduction in error per particle on the 40-variable Lorenz '96 system.</description>

      <title>Effective Off-Policy Evaluation and Learning in Contextual Combinatorial Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore off-policy evaluation and learning (OPE/L) in contextual combinatorial bandits (CCB), where a policy selects a subset in the action space. For example, it might choose a set of furniture pieces (a bed and a drawer) from available items (bed, drawer, chair, etc.) for interior design sales. This setting is widespread in fields such as recommender systems and healthcare, yet OPE/L of CCB remains unexplored in the relevant literature. Typical OPE/L methods such as regression and importance sampling can be applied to the CCB problem, however, they face significant challenges due to high bias or variance, exacerbated by the exponential growth in the number of available subsets. To address these challenges, we introduce a concept of factored action space, which allows us to decompose each subset into binary indicators. This formulation allows us to distinguish between the ''main effect'' derived from the main actions, and the ''residual effect'', originating from the supplemental actions, facilitating more effective OPE. Specifically, our estimator, called OPCB, leverages an importance sampling-based approach to unbiasedly estimate the main effect, while employing regression-based approach to deal with the residual effect with low variance. OPCB achieves substantial variance reduction compared to conventional importance sampling methods and bias reduction relative to regression methods under certain conditions, as illustrated in our theoretical analysis. Experiments demonstrate OPCB's superior performance over typical methods in both OPE and OPL.</description>

      <title>Plug-in estimation of Schr\"odinger bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a procedure for estimating the Schr\"odinger bridge between two probability distributions. Unlike existing approaches, our method does not require iteratively simulating forward and backward diffusions or training neural networks to fit unknown drifts. Instead, we show that the potentials obtained from solving the static entropic optimal transport problem between the source and target samples can be modified to yield a natural plug-in estimator of the time-dependent drift that defines the bridge between two measures. Under minimal assumptions, we show that our proposal, which we call the \emph{Sinkhorn bridge}, provably estimates the Schr\"odinger bridge with a rate of convergence that depends on the intrinsic dimensionality of the target measure. Our approach combines results from the areas of sampling, and theoretical and statistical entropic optimal transport.</description>

      <title>Solving Oscillator ODEs via Soft-constrained Physics-informed Neural Network with Small Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper compared physics-informed neural network (PINN), conventional neural network (NN) and numerical discretization methods on solving differential equations through literature research. We formalized the mathematical framework and computational flow of the soft-constrained PINN method for solving differential equations (e.g., ODEs/PDEs). Its working mechanism and its accuracy and efficiency were experimentally verified by solving typical linear and non-linear oscillator ODEs. The implementation of the PINN method based on DeepXDE is not only light code and efficient in training, but also flexible across platforms. PINN greatly reduces the need for labeled data: when the nonlinearity of the ODE is weak, a very small amount of supervised training data plus a small amount of collocation points are sufficient to predict the solution; in the minimalist case, only one or two training points (with initial values) are needed for first- or second-order ODEs, respectively. Strongly nonlinear ODE also require only an appropriate increase in the number of training and collocation points, which still has significant advantages over conventional NN. With the aid of collocation points and the use of physical information, PINN has the ability to extrapolate data outside the time domain covered by the training set, and is robust to noisy data, thus with enhanced generalization capabilities. Training is accelerated when the gains obtained along with the reduction in the amount of data outweigh the delay caused by the increase in the loss function terms. The soft-constrained PINN method can easily impose a physical law (e.g., energy conservation) constraint by adding a regularization term to the total loss function, thus improving the solution performance of ODEs that obey this physical law.</description>

      <title>Chernoff Bounds for Tensor Expanders on Riemannian Manifolds Using Graph Laplacian Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the advancement of probability tail bound analysis, a crucial statistical tool for assessing the probability of large deviations of random variables from their expected values. Traditional tail bounds, such as Markov's, Chebyshev's, and Chernoff bounds, have proven valuable across numerous scientific and engineering fields. However, as data complexity grows, there is a pressing need to extend tail bound estimation from scalar variables to high-dimensional random objects. Existing studies often rely on the assumption of independence among high-dimensional random objects, an assumption that may not always be valid. Building on the work of researchers like Garg et al. and Chang, who employed random walks to model high-dimensional ensembles, this study introduces a more generalized approach by exploring random walks over manifolds. To address the challenges of constructing an appropriate underlying graph for a manifold, we propose a novel method that enhances random walks on graphs approximating the manifold. This approach ensures spectral similarity between the original manifold and the approximated graph, including matching eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and eigenfunctions. Leveraging graph approximation technique proposed by Burago et al. for manifolds, we derive the tensor Chernoff bound and establish its range for random walks on a Riemannian manifold according to the underlying manifold's spectral characteristics.</description>

      <title>Learning Flock: Enhancing Sets of Particles for Multi~Sub-State Particle Filtering with Neural Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A leading family of algorithms for state estimation in dynamic systems with multiple sub-states is based on particle filters (PFs). PFs often struggle when operating under complex or approximated modelling (necessitating many particles) with low latency requirements (limiting the number of particles), as is typically the case in multi target tracking (MTT). In this work, we introduce a deep neural network (DNN) augmentation for PFs termed learning flock (LF). LF learns to correct a particles-weights set, which we coin flock, based on the relationships between all sub-particles in the set itself, while disregarding the set acquisition procedure. Our proposed LF, which can be readily incorporated into different PFs flow, is designed to facilitate rapid operation by maintaining accuracy with a reduced number of particles. We introduce a dedicated training algorithm, allowing both supervised and unsupervised training, and yielding a module that supports a varying number of sub-states and particles without necessitating re-training. We experimentally show the improvements in performance, robustness, and latency of LF augmentation for radar multi-target tracking, as well its ability to mitigate the effect of a mismatched observation modelling. We also compare and illustrate the advantages of LF over a state-of-the-art DNN-aided PF, and demonstrate that LF enhances both classic PFs as well as DNN-based filters.</description>

      <title>On Quasi-Localized Dual Pairs in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scattered data approximation, the span of a finite number of translates of a chosen radial basis function is used as approximation space and the basis of translates is used for representing the approximate. However, this natural choice is by no means mandatory and different choices, like, for example, the Lagrange basis, are possible and might offer additional features. In this article, we discuss different alternatives together with their canonical duals. We study a localized version of the Lagrange basis, localized orthogonal bases, such as the Newton basis, and multiresolution versions thereof, constructed by means of samplets. We argue that the choice of orthogonal bases is particularly useful as they lead to symmetric preconditioners. All bases under consideration are compared numerically to illustrate their feasibility for scattered data approximation. We provide benchmark experiments in two spatial dimensions and consider the reconstruction of an implicit surface as a relevant application from computer graphics.</description>

      <title>Scalable and non-iterative graphical model estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphical models have found widespread applications in many areas of modern statistics and machine learning. Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and its variants have become the default method for undirected graphical model estimation, and are thus ubiquitous in the field. As the IPF is an iterative approach, it is not always readily scalable to modern high-dimensional data regimes. In this paper we propose a novel and fast non-iterative method for positive definite graphical model estimation in high dimensions, one that directly addresses the shortcomings of IPF and its variants. In addition, the proposed method has a number of other attractive properties. First, we show formally that as the dimension p grows, the proportion of graphs for which the proposed method will outperform the state-of-the-art in terms of computational complexity and performance tends to 1, affirming its efficacy in modern settings. Second, the proposed approach can be readily combined with scalable non-iterative thresholding-based methods for high-dimensional sparsity selection. Third, the proposed method has high-dimensional statistical guarantees. Moreover, our numerical experiments also show that the proposed method achieves scalability without compromising on statistical precision. Fourth, unlike the IPF, which depends on the Gaussian likelihood, the proposed method is much more robust.</description>

      <title>Deviations from the Nash equilibrium and emergence of tacit collusion in a two-player optimal execution game with reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning algorithms in financial trading is becoming increasingly prevalent. However, the autonomous nature of these algorithms can lead to unexpected outcomes that deviate from traditional game-theoretical predictions and may even destabilize markets. In this study, we examine a scenario in which two autonomous agents, modeled with Double Deep Q-Learning, learn to liquidate the same asset optimally in the presence of market impact, using the Almgren-Chriss (2000) framework. Our results show that the strategies learned by the agents deviate significantly from the Nash equilibrium of the corresponding market impact game. Notably, the learned strategies exhibit tacit collusion, closely aligning with the Pareto-optimal solution. We further explore how different levels of market volatility influence the agents' performance and the equilibria they discover, including scenarios where volatility differs between the training and testing phases.</description>

      <title>Spike-and-slab shrinkage priors for structurally sparse Bayesian neural networks</title>

Abstract: Network complexity and computational efficiency have become increasingly significant aspects of deep learning. Sparse deep learning addresses these challenges by recovering a sparse representation of the underlying target function by reducing heavily over-parameterized deep neural networks. Specifically, deep neural architectures compressed via structured sparsity (e.g. node sparsity) provide low latency inference, higher data throughput, and reduced energy consumption. In this paper, we explore two well-established shrinkage techniques, Lasso and Horseshoe, for model compression in Bayesian neural networks. To this end, we propose structurally sparse Bayesian neural networks which systematically prune excessive nodes with (i) Spike-and-Slab Group Lasso (SS-GL), and (ii) Spike-and-Slab Group Horseshoe (SS-GHS) priors, and develop computationally tractable variational inference including continuous relaxation of Bernoulli variables. We establish the contraction rates of the variational posterior of our proposed models as a function of the network topology, layer-wise node cardinalities, and bounds on the network weights. We empirically demonstrate the competitive performance of our models compared to the baseline models in prediction accuracy, model compression, and inference latency.</description>

      <title>Lighter, Better, Faster Multi-Source Domain Adaptation with Gaussian Mixture Models and Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), a task in transfer learning where one adapts multiple heterogeneous, labeled source probability measures towards a different, unlabeled target measure. We propose a novel framework for MSDA, based on Optimal Transport (OT) and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our framework has two key advantages. First, OT between GMMs can be solved efficiently via linear programming. Second, it provides a convenient model for supervised learning, especially classification, as components in the GMM can be associated with existing classes. Based on the GMM-OT problem, we propose a novel technique for calculating barycenters of GMMs. Based on this novel algorithm, we propose two new strategies for MSDA: GMM-Wasserstein Barycenter Transport (WBT) and GMM-Dataset Dictionary Learning (DaDiL). We empirically evaluate our proposed methods on four benchmarks in image classification and fault diagnosis, showing that we improve over the prior art while being faster and involving fewer parameters.

Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts, which yields the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional distribution moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Optimal Transport has been proposed as a probabilistic framework in Machine Learning for comparing and manipulating probability distributions. This is rooted in its rich history and theory, and has offered new solutions to different problems in machine learning, such as generative modeling and transfer learning. In this survey we explore contributions of Optimal Transport for Machine Learning over the period 2012 -- 2023, focusing on four sub-fields of Machine Learning: supervised, unsupervised, transfer and reinforcement learning. We further highlight the recent development in computational Optimal Transport and its extensions, such as partial, unbalanced, Gromov and Neural Optimal Transport, and its interplay with Machine Learning practice.</description>

Abstract: Scoring sleep stages in polysomnography recordings is a time-consuming task plagued by significant inter-rater variability. Therefore, it stands to benefit from the application of machine learning algorithms. While many algorithms have been proposed for this purpose, certain critical architectural decisions have not received systematic exploration. In this study, we meticulously investigate these design choices within the broad category of encoder-predictor architectures. We identify robust architectures applicable to both time series and spectrogram input representations. These architectures incorporate structured state space models as integral components and achieve statistically significant performance improvements compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the extensive Sleep Heart Health Study dataset. We anticipate that the architectural insights gained from this study along with the refined methodology for architecture search demonstrated herein will not only prove valuable for future research in sleep staging but also hold relevance for other time series annotation tasks.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inception Score</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper, as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) for quantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In this context, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equal to the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements on the system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from the presence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there exists a classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Operator SVD with Neural Networks via Nested Low-Rank Approximation</title>

Abstract: Computing eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of a given linear operator, or finding its leading eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is a fundamental task in many machine learning and scientific computing problems. For high-dimensional eigenvalue problems, training neural networks to parameterize the eigenfunctions is considered as a promising alternative to the classical numerical linear algebra techniques. This paper proposes a new optimization framework based on the low-rank approximation characterization of a truncated singular value decomposition, accompanied by new techniques called \emph{nesting} for learning the top-$L$ singular values and singular functions in the correct order. The proposed method promotes the desired orthogonality in the learned functions implicitly and efficiently via an unconstrained optimization formulation, which is easy to solve with off-the-shelf gradient-based optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework for use cases in computational physics and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization and Convergence by Enhancing Implicit Regularization</title>

Abstract: In this work, we propose an Implicit Regularization Enhancement (IRE) framework to accelerate the discovery of flat solutions in deep learning, thereby improving generalization and convergence. Specifically, IRE decouples the dynamics of flat and sharp directions, which boosts the sharpness reduction along flat directions while maintaining the training stability in sharp directions. We show that IRE can be practically incorporated with {\em generic base optimizers} without introducing significant computational overload. Experiments show that IRE consistently improves the generalization performance for image classification tasks across a variety of benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet) and models (ResNets and ViTs). Surprisingly, IRE also achieves a $2\times$ {\em speed-up} compared to AdamW in the pre-training of Llama models (of sizes ranging from 60M to 229M) on datasets including Wikitext-103, Minipile, and Openwebtext. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees, showing that IRE can substantially accelerate the convergence towards flat minima in Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM).</description>

      <title>A Manifold Perspective on the Statistical Generalization of Graph Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have been successfully extended to operate on graphs, giving rise to Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs combine information from adjacent nodes by successive applications of graph convolutions. GNNs have been implemented successfully in various learning tasks while the theoretical understanding of their generalization capability is still in progress. In this paper, we leverage manifold theory to analyze the statistical generalization gap of GNNs operating on graphs constructed on sampled points from manifolds. We study the generalization gaps of GNNs on both node-level and graph-level tasks. We show that the generalization gaps decrease with the number of nodes in the training graphs, which guarantees the generalization of GNNs to unseen points over manifolds. We validate our theoretical results in multiple real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Flows: Calibrated Bayesian Inference with Diffusion-Based Models</title>

Abstract: Beyond estimating parameters of interest from data, one of the key goals of statistical inference is to properly quantify uncertainty in these estimates. In Bayesian inference, this uncertainty is provided by the posterior distribution, the computation of which typically involves an intractable high-dimensional integral. Among available approximation methods, sampling-based approaches come with strong theoretical guarantees but scale poorly to large problems, while variational approaches scale well but offer few theoretical guarantees. In particular, variational methods are known to produce overconfident estimates of posterior uncertainty and are typically non-identifiable, with many latent variable configurations generating equivalent predictions. Here, we address these challenges by showing how diffusion-based models (DBMs), which have recently produced state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling tasks, can be repurposed for performing calibrated, identifiable Bayesian inference. By exploiting a previously established connection between the stochastic and probability flow ordinary differential equations (pfODEs) underlying DBMs, we derive a class of models, inflationary flows, that uniquely and deterministically map high-dimensional data to a lower-dimensional Gaussian distribution via ODE integration. This map is both invertible and neighborhood-preserving, with controllable numerical error, with the result that uncertainties in the data are correctly propagated to the latent space. We demonstrate how such maps can be learned via standard DBM training using a novel noise schedule and are effective at both preserving and reducing intrinsic data dimensionality. The result is a class of highly expressive generative models, uniquely defined on a low-dimensional latent space, that afford principled Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>AdapTable: Test-Time Adaptation for Tabular Data via Shift-Aware Uncertainty Calibrator and Label Distribution Handler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, tabular data often suffer from distribution shifts due to their widespread and abundant nature, leading to erroneous predictions of pre-trained machine learning models. However, addressing such distribution shifts in the tabular domain has been relatively underexplored due to unique challenges such as varying attributes and dataset sizes, as well as the limited representation learning capabilities of deep learning models for tabular data. Particularly, with the recent promising paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA), where we adapt the off-the-shelf model to the unlabeled target domain during the inference phase without accessing the source domain, we observe that directly adopting commonly used TTA methods from other domains often leads to model collapse. We systematically explore challenges in tabular data test-time adaptation, including skewed entropy, complex latent space decision boundaries, confidence calibration issues with both overconfident and under-confident, and model bias towards source label distributions along with class imbalances. Based on these insights, we introduce AdapTable, a novel tabular test-time adaptation method that directly modifies output probabilities by estimating target label distributions and adjusting initial probabilities based on calibrated uncertainty. Extensive experiments on both natural distribution shifts and synthetic corruptions demonstrate the adaptation efficacy of the proposed method.</description>
