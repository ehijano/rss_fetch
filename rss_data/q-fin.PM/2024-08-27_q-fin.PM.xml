      <title>A new approach to the theory of optimal income tax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14476</link>

Abstract: The Nobel-price winning Mirrlees' theory of optimal taxation inspired a long sequence of research on its refinement and enhancement. However, an issue of concern has been always the fact that, as was shown in many publications, the optimal schedule in Mirrlees' paradigm of maximising the total utility (constructed from individually optimised individual ones) usually did not lead to progressive taxation (contradicting the ethically supported practice in developed economies), and often even assigned minimal tax rates to the higher paid strata of society. The first objective of this paper is to support this conclusion by proving a theorem on optimal tax schedule in (practically most exploited) piecewise-linear environment under a simplest natural utility function. The second objective is to suggest a new paradigm for optimal taxation, where instead of just total average utility maximization one introduces a standard deviation of utility as a second parameter (in some analogy with Marcowitz portfolio optimization). We show that this approach leads to transparent and easy interpreted optimality criteria for income tax.</description>
