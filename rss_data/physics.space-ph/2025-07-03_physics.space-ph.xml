      <title>Surface Waves at Switchback Boundaries in the Young Solar Wind from Parker Solar Probe Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Switchbacks (SBs) are localized magnetic field deflections in the solar wind, marked by abrupt changes in the magnetic field direction relative to the ambient solar wind. Observations onboard Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at heliocentric distances below 50 Solar Radii (Rs) showed that within SBs, perturbations in the magnetic field ({\Delta}B) and the bulk solar wind velocity ({\Delta}V) align, i.e., {\Delta}B~{\Delta}V, producing enhanced radial velocity spikes. In this study, we examine the characteristics of SB boundaries, with particular attention to the role of boundary shear flow instabilities (Kelvin-Helmholtz instability - KHI) for surface wave phenomena based on the in situ magnetic field, plasma speed, and plasma density measurements from PSP. The results indicate that SB boundaries can be unstable for generating KHI-driven surface waves, suggesting that the wave activity observed at SB boundaries is caused by shear flow instabilities. In addition, the continued development of KHI may lead to boundary erosion, contributing to the radial evolution of SBs via structural weakening or broadening. However, when {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V are closely aligned, the boundary remains stable unless the velocity shear significantly exceeds the magnetic shear. Since the observed velocity shear typically ranges from 40% to 90% of magnetic shear, the instability condition is generally not satisfied. Thus, the configuration leading to the instability arises from deviations from precise alignment of {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V in the young solar wind, and the release of the KHI presumably leads to the formation of the {\Delta}B and {\Delta}V alignment observed at SB boundaries located at 35-55 Rs.</description>

      <title>Type II radio bursts and space weather phenomena: A statistical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present for the first time a comprehensive statistical study between type II radio bursts from the metric (m) to the dekameric-hectometric (DH) domain and their associated solar and space weather (SW) phenomena, namely, solar flares (SFs), sunspot (SN) configurations, filament eruptions, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), their interplanetary (IP) counterparts (ICMEs) and shocks, in situ detected particles and geomagnetic storms (GSs). The m-only and m+DH radio signatures are identified from dynamic spectra provided by the ground-based RSTN stations distributed over the globe together with Wind/WAVES satellite data. The DH-only type IIs are adopted from a ready catalog based on Wind/WAVES spacecraft data. We perform the temporal and spatial association between the radio emission and the listed above activity events during solar cycle (SC) 24, separately for the three sub-categories, m-only, m+DH and DH-only type IIs. A quantitative assessment on the occurrence rates is presented as a function of the strength of the specific SW phenomena: highest rates are obtained with CMEs, SFs, filament eruptions, and SN configurations, whereas a much weaker relationship is found with ICMEs, IP shocks, energetic particles, and GSs. The potential of the obtained rates to be used in empirical or physics-based models for SW forecasting is discussed.</description>

      <title>CAM-NET: An AI Model for Whole Atmosphere with Thermosphere and Ionosphere Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds, temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and generalization capabilities.</description>
