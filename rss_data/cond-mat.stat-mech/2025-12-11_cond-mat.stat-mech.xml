      <title>Beyond Ginibre statistics in open Floquet chaotic systems with localized leaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the spectral properties of driven quantum systems with a classically chaotic counterpart and spatially localized openness, such as optical or microwave billiards with leaks, deviate from predictions of Ginibre ensembles. Our analysis focuses on the leaky quantum standard map (QSM) of the kicked rotor. We compare its complex resonance spectrum with both Ginibre and truncated circular orthogonal ensembles (TCOEs). We find that the long-lived resonances follow TCOE statistics, reproducing the density of states and level spacing correlations, but depart from Ginibre predictions. Short-lived resonances, however, do not show a clear correspondence with either random-matrix ensemble. We also demonstrate that increasing the leak size takes the density of states of the TCOE toward the Ginibre limit, yet their spectral correlations remain distinct.</description>

      <title>Single particle dynamical signature of topology induced by single mode cavities in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Witnessing and tracking topological phase transitions induced by interactions with the environment is a crucial challenge. Among the various experimental approaches to detect topological properties, the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) has emerged as a powerful bulk probe in one-dimensional chiral systems, allowing the extraction of the topological invariant from single-particle dynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of thermodynamically consistent stochastic phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a toy model of two kinetically coupled stochastic oscillators whose dynamics is described as a Markov jump process among $N$ discrete phase states. For large $N$, it maps onto the deterministic two-oscillator Kuramoto model of synchronization. Despite its simplicity, we postulate its relevance for understanding more complex and realistic oscillator systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the model exhibits a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition between the unsynchronized and synchronized states. We show that this transition is not governed by any extremum dissipation principle -- depending on system parameters, synchronization may either reduce or enhance the dissipation. Close to the phase transition, we observe a divergent behavior of fluctuations and responses with $N$ and characterize their universal scaling behavior. In particular, the covariances of the oscillator phases and the local entropy productions are shown to diverge towards $-\infty$, a phenomenon that has not been reported before. Finally, we study the behavior of information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that mutual information and information flow between oscillators display different scaling with $N$ in synchronized and unsynchronized states, and thus can act as order parameters of synchronization.</description>

      <title>Burgers equation from non-thermal stationary states in nearly-integrable gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a gas of particles interacts with much a larger reservoir the dynamics of density on large scales is typically governed by diffusion. We study this paradigmatic problem for weakly coupled integrable systems and show that this picture is altered when transport is investigated on top of long-lived non-thermal states. Remarkably, for states non-invariant under parity we find Burgers equation arising in the hydrodynamic limit. We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear Euler-scale coupling of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions, which we call velocity swap models. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath.</description>

      <title>Hitting the blinking target under stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first hitting times of a stochastic process, i.e., the first time a process reaches a particular level, are of significant interest across various scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and economics. We modify the standard setup by allowing the target to spontaneously switch between two states, either active or inactive, and investigate the distribution of first hitting times accrued while the target is active. For this setup, we provide closed formulas for the distribution of the first hitting time. Additionally, we can introduce stochastic resetting to the underlying process and, utilizing our results, derive the formulas for the first time the active target is hit by the process under stochastic resetting. Interestingly, we show that resetting in this setup still leaves some memory; the system is no longer Markovian, which prevents a straightforward application of standard techniques. The analytical results are accompanied by computer simulations of Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Burgers dynamics for Poisson point process initial conditions of the Weibull class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the statistical properties of one-dimensional Burgers dynamics with stochastic initial conditions for the velocity potential defined by a Poisson point process whose intensity follows a power law with exponent $\alpha &gt; -1$. Working in the inviscid limit and exploiting the geometrical construction of solutions in terms of first-contact parabolas, we derive explicit analytical expressions for a broad set of statistical quantities. These include the one- and two-point probability distributions of the velocity, the multiplicity functions of voids and shocks, and the velocity and density correlation functions together with their associated power spectra. We also show that the full hierarchy of $n$-point distributions factorizes into a sequence of two-point conditional probabilities. This class of initial conditions leads to self-similar evolution and produces probability distributions characterized by stretched-exponential tails, with tail exponents spanning the full range from unity to infinity. The associated characteristic length scale grows as a power law of time, with an exponent lying between zero and one half.</description>

      <title>Measurement-and Feedback-Driven Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions on a Quantum Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes are essential for implementing quantum error-correction on quantum hardware. When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter. Our results demonstrate that adaptive quantum circuits provide a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.</description>

      <title>Slow dynamics and magnon bound states in the 2D long-range quantum Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of long-range quantum Ising models represents a current frontier in experimental physics, notably in trapped ions or Rydberg atomic systems. However, a theoretical description of these dynamics beyond 1D remains a significant challenge for conventional methods. Here, we address this challenge by means of neural quantum states to simulate global quenches from the fully polarized ferromagnetic state in the 2D quantum Ising model with power-law decaying interactions. From these numerically exact simulations, we find that the dynamics exhibit slow relaxation with long-lived oscillations. We explain this behavior through a theory for the formation of magnon bound states, which are generated, as we show, through effective attractive interactions between magnons that persist over several lattice sites due to the power-law nature of the interactions. Our results are readily observable in current quantum simulation platforms realizing long-range interacting models such as in Rydberg atomic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to construct atypical high-energy eigenstates in quantum systems by using ground states of Hamiltonians deformed by conserved charges. For the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX chain we study a chiral Hamiltonian built from the scalar-chirality charge and total magnetization and solve it exactly by Bethe ansatz. Its ground state is a magnetized, current-carrying XXX eigenstate that breaks SU(2), time-reversal, and parity yet stays critical. This zero-entropy macrostate shows ballistic spin and chirality transport and admits realistic cold-atom and Rydberg platforms.</description>

      <title>Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09317v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Logarithmic Barrier: Activity-Induced Recovery of Phase Separation Dynamics in Confined Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation in confined environments is a fundamental process underlying geological flows, porous filtration, emulsions, and intracellular organization. Yet, how confinement and activity jointly govern coarsening kinetics and interfacial morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of passive and active fluids embedded in complex porous media. By generating porous host structures via a freeze-quench protocol, we systematically control the average pore size and demonstrate that confinement induces a crossover from the Lifshitz-Slyozov power-law growth to logarithmically slowed coarsening, ultimately arresting domain evolution. Analysis of correlation functions and structure factors reveals that confined passive systems exhibit fractal interfaces, violating Porod's law and indicating rough morphological arrest. In contrast, introducing self-propulsion dramatically changes the coarsening pathway: activity restores smooth interfaces, breaks the confinement-induced scaling laws, and drives a transition from logarithmic to ballistic domain growth at high activity levels. Our findings reveal an activity-controlled mechanism to overcome geometric restrictions and unlock coarsening in structurally heterogeneous environments. These insights establish a unifying framework for nonequilibrium phase transitions in porous settings, with broad relevance to active colloids, catalytic media, and biologically crowded systems, where living matter routinely reorganizes within geometric constraints to sustain function.</description>

Abstract: We investigate thermalization and time-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate formation in ultracold Dy-164 using a nonlinear boson diffusion equation. As compared to alkali atoms such as K-39 or Rb-87, the strong magnetic dipole interaction modifies the scattering-length dependence of the transport coefficients that govern thermalization and condensate formation. A prediction for the time-dependent condensate fraction in Dy-164 is made.</description>

      <title>First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the L\'evy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.</description>

Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic dynamical equation yielding non-equilibrium universal scaling. It exhibits notorious non-perturbative aspects. The KPZ fixed point is strong-coupling, all the more in $d&gt;1$. Strikingly, another, even stronger-coupling fixed point of the KPZ equation, called inviscid Burgers fixed point, has been recently unveiled. These non-pertubative features can be theoretically accessed and studied in a controlled way in all dimensions using the functional renormalisation group. We propose an overview of the related results, which provide a unified picture of the fixed-point structure and associated scaling regimes of the KPZ equation in $d=1$ and in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Self-organized hyperuniformity in a minimal model of population dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By generalizing a class of models recently introduced to account for protracted transients in biological systems, we identify a novel mechanism for hyperuniformity. In this model, competition of particles over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. We show that, in its spatially extended form, this many-particle model exhibits hyperuniform density fluctuations. Through explicit coarse-graining, we develop a hydrodynamic theory that conforms closely with the results of stochastic simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, hyperuniformity arises from the divergence of the interaction range as the system approaches the critical point. These findings may find applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics, and ecology.</description>

      <title>Metastable phase separation and information retrieval in multicomponent mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.</description>

      <title>Arrow of Time in Three-Particle System and Its General Origin in Classical and Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified formulation of the origin of the arrow of time in classical and quantum mechanics. We begin with a mechanical analysis of a one-dimensional three-particle system, which provides a concrete setting in which macroscopic irreversibility emerges despite microscopically reversible dynamics. By abstracting this mechanism, we show that the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the macroscopic level arises solely from the non-injective nature of coarse-graining maps. We then formalize this principle in classical mechanics and prove a general noncommutativity theorem: a reversible microscopic time-reversal map T does not commute with a coarse-graining map $\varphi$ whenever $\varphi$ is non-injective. The same mathematical structure extends naturally to quantum mechanics. Using density matrices, anti-unitary time reversal, and CPTP coarse-graining maps, we derive the quantum analogue of the theorem and demonstrate that macroscopic time asymmetry follows inevitably from information loss, without requiring any asymmetry in the underlying microscopic laws. Thus, classical and quantum mechanics share a common mathematical origin of the arrow of time: the loss of microscopic information inherent in coarse-graining.</description>

      <title>Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.</description>

      <title>Reduced density fluctuations via anti-aligning in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We highlight the importance of long-range correlations in active matter systems of self-propelling particles even in the absence of global order or steric interactions by demonstrating that long-range density fluctuations are reduced. We show this analytically for a one-dimensional lattice process employing a Poisson representation. Within this framework, we are able to derive the fluctuating hydrodynamics for the Poisson fields. The emergent imaginary noise indicates the non-Poissonian nature of the number fluctuations and manifests in a non-trivial structure factor $S(k)$ which we are computing analytically. Numerically, we corroborate the relevance of these findings for off-lattice Vicsek-type models with anti-aligning interactions for which we observe apparent non-universal hyperuniformity which we suggest to interpret as a reduction with integer power-law to a finite value.</description>

      <title>Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical 3+4-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for \emph{strong ergodicity breaking} in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed $p$-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics take place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</description>

      <title>Open interacting particle systems and Ising measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first survey some open questions concerning stochastic interacting particle systems with open boundaries. Then an asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries that generalizes the lattice gas model of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn (KLS) is introduced and invariance of the one-dimensional Ising measure is proved. The stationary current is computed in explicit form and is shown to exhibit current reversal at some density. Based on the extremal-current principle for one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with one conservation law, the phase diagram for boundary-induced phase transitions is conjectured for this case. There are two extremal-current phases, unlike in the conventional open asymmetric simple exclusion process, which exhibits only one extremal-current phase or the previously considered conventional open KLS model with one or three extremal-current phases.</description>

      <title>Stoquasticity is not enough: towards a sharper diagnostic for Quantum Monte Carlo simulability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.</description>
