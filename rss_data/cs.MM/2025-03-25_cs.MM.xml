      <title>Audio-Enhanced Vision-Language Modeling with Latent Space Broadening for High Quality Data Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer-based multimodal models are widely used in industrial-scale recommendation, search, and advertising systems for content understanding and relevance ranking. Enhancing labeled training data quality and cross-modal fusion significantly improves model performance, influencing key metrics such as quality view rates and ad revenue. High-quality annotations are crucial for advancing content modeling, yet traditional statistical-based active learning (AL) methods face limitations: they struggle to detect overconfident misclassifications and are less effective in distinguishing semantically similar items in deep neural networks. Additionally, audio information plays an increasing role, especially in short-video platforms, yet most pre-trained multimodal architectures primarily focus on text and images. While training from scratch across all three modalities is possible, it sacrifices the benefits of leveraging existing pre-trained visual-language (VL) and audio models. To address these challenges, we propose kNN-based Latent Space Broadening (LSB) to enhance AL efficiency and Vision-Language Modeling with Audio Enhancement (VLMAE), a mid-fusion approach integrating audio into VL models. This system deployed in production systems, leading to significant business gains.</description>

      <title>RDTF: Resource-efficient Dual-mask Training Framework for Multi-frame Animated Sticker Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, great progress has been made in video generation technology, attracting the widespread attention of scholars. To apply this technology to downstream applications under resource-constrained conditions, researchers usually fine-tune the pre-trained models based on parameter-efficient tuning methods such as Adapter or Lora. Although these methods can transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, fewer training parameters lead to poor fitting ability, and the knowledge from the source domain may lead to the inference process deviating from the target domain. In this paper, we argue that under constrained resources, training a smaller video generation model from scratch using only million-level samples can outperform parameter-efficient tuning on larger models in downstream applications: the core lies in the effective utilization of data and curriculum strategy. Take animated sticker generation (ASG) as a case study, we first construct a discrete frame generation network for stickers with low frame rates, ensuring that its parameters meet the requirements of model training under constrained resources. In order to provide data support for models trained from scratch, we come up with a dual-mask based data utilization strategy, which manages to improve the availability and expand the diversity of limited data. To facilitate convergence under dual-mask situation, we propose a difficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method, which decomposes the sample entropy into static and adaptive components so as to obtain samples from easy to difficult. The experiment demonstrates that our resource-efficient dual-mask training framework is quantitatively and qualitatively superior to efficient-parameter tuning methods such as I2V-Adapter and SimDA, verifying the feasibility of our method on downstream tasks under constrained resources. Code will be available.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation with Multi-Constraint Consistency Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consistency regularization has prevailed in semi-supervised semantic segmentation and achieved promising performance. However, existing methods typically concentrate on enhancing the Image-augmentation based Prediction consistency and optimizing the segmentation network as a whole, resulting in insufficient utilization of potential supervisory information. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Constraint Consistency Learning (MCCL) approach to facilitate the staged enhancement of the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we first design a feature knowledge alignment (FKA) strategy to promote the feature consistency learning of the encoder from image-augmentation. Our FKA encourages the encoder to derive consistent features for strongly and weakly augmented views from the perspectives of point-to-point alignment and prototype-based intra-class compactness. Moreover, we propose a self-adaptive intervention (SAI) module to increase the discrepancy of aligned intermediate feature representations, promoting Feature-perturbation based Prediction consistency learning. Self-adaptive feature masking and noise injection are designed in an instance-specific manner to perturb the features for robust learning of the decoder. Experimental results on Pascal VOC2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that our proposed MCCL achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

      <title>Challenging Dataset and Multi-modal Gated Mixture of Experts Model for Remote Sensing Copy-Move Forgery Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Remote Sensing Copy-Move Question Answering (RSCMQA) task focuses on interpreting complex tampering scenarios and inferring the relationships between objects. Currently, publicly available datasets often use randomly generated tampered images, which lack spatial logic and do not meet the practical needs of defense security and land resource monitoring. To address this, we propose a high-quality manually annotated RSCMQA dataset, Real-RSCM, which provides more realistic evaluation metrics for the identification and understanding of remote sensing image tampering. The tampered images in the Real-RSCM dataset are subtle, authentic, and challenging, posing significant difficulties for model discrimination capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a multimodal gated mixture of experts model (CM-MMoE), which guides multi-expert models to discern tampered information in images through multi-level visual semantics and textual joint modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CM-MMoE provides a stronger benchmark for the RSCMQA task compared to general VQA and CMQA models. Our dataset and code are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CM-MMoE.</description>

      <title>Merge Mode for Template-based Intra Mode Derivation (TIMD) in ECM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an intra coding tool, named Merge mode for Template-based Intra Mode Derivation (TIMD). TIMD-Merge has been adopted in the 15\textsuperscript{th} version of the Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) software that explores video coding technologies beyond Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard. This proposed tool operates on top of the regular TIMD mode that applies a template-based search on a causal adjacent template at top and at left of the current block, in order to find the best Intra Prediction Modes (IPMs) that matches the template. The proposed TIMD-Merge in this paper addresses a shortcoming in the regular TIMD method where due to texture discrepancy, the adjacent template information around the block is not reliable. To do so, the proposed TIMD-Merge constructs a list of all TIMD-coded blocks in relatively larger template area than the template of the regular TIMD, which also includes non-adjacent neighboring blocks. This list, called the merge list, is then sorted on the template to give one best set of TIMD modes. The use of TIMD-Merge mode is signalled at the block level and the implementation in the ECM-14.0 demonstrates -0.08\% performance improvement in terms of luma BDR gain, with negligible encoding and decoding runtime increase of 100.6% and 100.2%, respectively.</description>

      <title>DPC: Dual-Prompt Collaboration for Tuning Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Base-New Trade-off (BNT) problem universally exists during the optimization of CLIP-based prompt tuning, where continuous fine-tuning on base (target) classes leads to a simultaneous decrease of generalization ability on new (unseen) classes. Existing approaches attempt to regulate the prompt tuning process to balance BNT by appending constraints. However, imposed on the same target prompt, these constraints fail to fully avert the mutual exclusivity between the optimization directions for base and new. As a novel solution to this challenge, we propose the plug-and-play Dual-Prompt Collaboration (DPC) framework, the first that decoupling the optimization processes of base and new tasks at the prompt level. Specifically, we clone a learnable parallel prompt based on the backbone prompt, and introduce a variable Weighting-Decoupling framework to independently control the optimization directions of dual prompts specific to base or new tasks, thus avoiding the conflict in generalization. Meanwhile, we propose a Dynamic Hard Negative Optimizer, utilizing dual prompts to construct a more challenging optimization task on base classes for enhancement. For interpretability, we prove the feature channel invariance of the prompt vector during the optimization process, providing theoretical support for the Weighting-Decoupling of DPC. Extensive experiments on multiple backbones demonstrate that DPC can significantly improve base performance without introducing any external knowledge beyond the base classes, while maintaining generalization to new classes.

      <title>Serial Low-rank Adaptation of Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained vision foundation models in a parameter-efficient manner is critical for downstream vision tasks, considering the practical constraints of computational and storage costs. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a well-established technique in this domain, achieving impressive efficiency by reducing the parameter space to a low-rank form. However, developing more advanced low-rank adaptation methods to reduce parameters and memory requirements remains a significant challenge in resource-constrained application scenarios. In this study, we consider on top of the commonly used vision transformer and propose Serial LoRA, a novel LoRA variant that introduces a shared low-rank matrix serially composite with the attention mechanism. Such a design extracts the underlying commonality of parameters in adaptation, significantly reducing redundancy. Notably, Serial LoRA uses only 1/4 parameters of LoRA but achieves comparable performance in most cases. We conduct extensive experiments on a range of vision foundation models with the transformer structure, and the results confirm consistent superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection and Localization for Speech Deepfakes via Feature Pyramid Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of AI-driven generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic speech deepfakes - synthetic audio signals that can imitate target speakers' voices - raising critical security concerns. Existing methods for detecting speech deepfakes primarily rely on supervised learning, which suffers from two critical limitations: limited generalization to unseen synthesis techniques and a lack of explainability. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing a novel interpretable one-class detection framework, which reframes speech deepfake detection as an anomaly detection task. Our model is trained exclusively on real speech to characterize its distribution, enabling the classification of out-of-distribution samples as synthetically generated. Additionally, our framework produces interpretable anomaly maps during inference, highlighting anomalous regions across both time and frequency domains. This is done through a Student-Teacher Feature Pyramid Matching system, enhanced with Discrepancy Scaling to improve generalization capabilities across unseen data distributions. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to the considered baselines, validating the effectiveness of framing speech deepfake detection as an anomaly detection problem.</description>

      <title>MAO: Efficient Model-Agnostic Optimization of Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though CLIP-based prompt tuning significantly enhances pre-trained Vision-Language Models, existing research focuses on reconstructing the model architecture, e.g., additional loss calculation and meta-networks. These approaches generally lead to increased complexity and extended training cost. To maintain the efficiency of the tuning process, we propose plug-and-play Model-Agnostic Optimization (MAO) for prompt tuning. Without altering any components of the prompt tuning backbone, we introduce a Data-Driven Enhancement framework to optimize the distribution of the initial data, and incorporate an Alterable Regularization module to boost the task-specific feature processing pipeline, thereby improving overall performance while maintaining low computational cost. Extensive experiments on MAO demonstrate its outstanding performance and efficiency. The code of MAO is available at: https://github.com/JREion/M.A.O .</description>

      <title>EvAnimate: Event-conditioned Image-to-Video Generation for Human Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional human animation transforms a static reference image into a dynamic sequence by applying motion cues such as poses. These motion cues are typically derived from video data but are susceptible to limitations including low temporal resolution, motion blur, overexposure, and inaccuracies under low-light conditions. In contrast, event cameras provide data streams with exceptionally high temporal resolution, a wide dynamic range, and inherent resistance to motion blur and exposure issues. In this work, we propose EvAnimate, a framework that leverages event streams as motion cues to animate static human images. Our approach employs a specialized event representation that transforms asynchronous event streams into 3-channel slices with controllable slicing rates and appropriate slice density, ensuring compatibility with diffusion models. Subsequently, a dual-branch architecture generates high-quality videos by harnessing the inherent motion dynamics of the event streams, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal consistency. Specialized data augmentation strategies further enhance cross-person generalization. Finally, we establish a new benchmarking, including simulated event data for training and validation, and a real-world event dataset capturing human actions under normal and extreme scenarios. The experiment results demonstrate that EvAnimate achieves high temporal fidelity and robust performance in scenarios where traditional video-derived cues fall short.</description>

      <title>Speech Emotion Recognition with ASR Transcripts: A Comprehensive Study on Word Error Rate and Fusion Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text data is commonly utilized as a primary input to enhance Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) performance and reliability. However, the reliance on human-transcribed text in most studies impedes the development of practical SER systems, creating a gap between in-lab research and real-world scenarios where Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) serves as the text source. Hence, this study benchmarks SER performance using ASR transcripts with varying Word Error Rates (WERs) from eleven models on three well-known corpora: IEMOCAP, CMU-MOSI, and MSP-Podcast. Our evaluation includes both text-only and bimodal SER with six fusion techniques, aiming for a comprehensive analysis that uncovers novel findings and challenges faced by current SER research. Additionally, we propose a unified ASR error-robust framework integrating ASR error correction and modality-gated fusion, achieving lower WER and higher SER results compared to the best-performing ASR transcript. These findings provide insights into SER with ASR assistance, especially for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>STA-V2A: Video-to-Audio Generation with Semantic and Temporal Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Visual and auditory perception are two crucial ways humans experience the world. Text-to-video generation has made remarkable progress over the past year, but the absence of harmonious audio in generated video limits its broader applications. In this paper, we propose Semantic and Temporal Aligned Video-to-Audio (STA-V2A), an approach that enhances audio generation from videos by extracting both local temporal and global semantic video features and combining these refined video features with text as cross-modal guidance. To address the issue of information redundancy in videos, we propose an onset prediction pretext task for local temporal feature extraction and an attentive pooling module for global semantic feature extraction. To supplement the insufficient semantic information in videos, we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with Text-to-Audio priors initialization and cross-modal guidance. We also introduce Audio-Audio Align, a new metric to assess audio-temporal alignment. Subjective and objective metrics demonstrate that our method surpasses existing Video-to-Audio models in generating audio with better quality, semantic consistency, and temporal alignment. The ablation experiment validated the effectiveness of each module. Audio samples are available at https://y-ren16.github.io/STAV2A.</description>

      <title>VideoAutoArena: An Automated Arena for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models in Video Analysis through User Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) with advanced video analysis capabilities have recently garnered significant attention. However, most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice questions in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench, which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation-and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks-we introduce VideoAutoArena, an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework, designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended, adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated, scalable evaluation framework, incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system, we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations, demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability. Additionally, we introduce a fault-driven evolution strategy, progressively increasing question complexity to push models toward handling more challenging video analysis scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that VideoAutoArena effectively differentiates among state-of-the-art LMMs, providing insights into model strengths and areas for improvement. To further streamline our evaluation, we introduce VideoAutoBench as an auxiliary benchmark, where human annotators label winners in a subset of VideoAutoArena battles. We use GPT-4o as a judge to compare responses against these human-validated answers. Together, VideoAutoArena and VideoAutoBench offer a cost-effective, and scalable framework for evaluating LMMs in user-centric video analysis.</description>

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have made significant strides in video understanding but struggle with long videos due to the limitations of their backbone LLMs. Existing solutions rely on length extrapolation, which is memory-constrained, or visual token compression, which primarily leverages low-level temporal redundancy while overlooking the more effective high-level knowledge redundancy. To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%.

      <title>Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05858</link>

Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Grounded Chain-of-Thought for Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12799</link>

Abstract: Despite great progress, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are prone to visual hallucination, greatly impeding their trustworthy applications. In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of visual-spatial reasoning, and propose a new learning task for MLLMs, termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). Different from recent visual CoT studies, which focus more on visual knowledge reasoning, GCoT is keen to helping MLLMs to recognize and ground the relevant visual cues step by step, thereby predicting the correct answer with grounding coordinates as the intuitive basis. To facilitate this task, we also carefully design and construct a dataset called multimodal grounded chain-of-thought (MM-GCoT) consisting of 24,022 GCoT examples for 5,033 images. Besides, a comprehensive consistency evaluation system is also introduced, including the metrics of answer accuracy, grounding accuracy and answer-grounding consistency. We further design and conduct a bunch of experiments on 12 advanced MLLMs, and reveal some notable findings: i. most MLLMs performs poorly on the consistency evaluation, indicating obvious visual hallucination; ii. visual hallucination is not directly related to the parameter size and general multimodal performance, i.e., a larger and stronger MLLM is not less affected by this issue. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the proposed dataset can help existing MLLMs to well cultivate their GCoT capability and reduce the inconsistent answering significantly. Moreover, their GCoT can be also generalized to exiting multimodal tasks, such as open-world QA and REC.</description>
