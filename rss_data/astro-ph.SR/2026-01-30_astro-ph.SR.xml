      <title>27 years of Spaceborne IR Astronomy: An ISO, Spitzer, WISE and NEOWISE Survey for Large-Amplitude Variability in Young Stellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared observations can probe photometric variability across the full evolutionary range of young stellar objects (YSOs), from deeply embedded protostars to pre-main-sequence stars with dusty disks. We present 3-8 micron light curves extending 27 years from 1997 to 2024 obtained with three space-based IR telescopes: ISO, Spitzer and WISE. Although unevenly sampled with large gaps in coverage, these light curves show variability on time scales ranging from days to decades. We focus on the Spitzer-identified YSOs with disks and envelopes that exhibit variations of a factor of two or more in this wavelength range. We identified seven YSOs where the light curves are dominated by bursts of sustained (&gt; 5 yr) high flux, including four that show a steep decay ending the burst and three that are ongoing as of the final observation. We find six YSOs that are undergoing declines, which may be the end of bursts that began before 1997. The most common form of variability, exhibited by 26 YSOs in our sample, show variations over time intervals of years to months but do not exhibit sustained bursts or fades. The Spitzer [3.6]-[4.5] and WISE [3.5]-[4.6] colors either increase or remain constant with increasing brightness, inconsistent with dust extinction as being the primary source of the large-amplitude variability.</description>

      <title>A rotation-based census of blue lurker candidates in open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue lurkers (BLs) are rejuvenated main-sequence stars hidden among normal main-sequence stars on color-magnitude diagrams of star clusters. In comparison, the blue straggler stars, formed via similar mass transfers or mergers, occupy a distinct space in the color-magnitude diagrams. We compile a list of BL candidates in open clusters using available rotation catalogs. BLs can be identified using either unusually faster rotation compared to similar mass stars, which is a signature of recent accretion, or the presence of a companion, which can only be formed by mass donation, e.g., an extremely low mass white dwarf. Here, we searched for fast-rotating stars on the main sequence of open clusters using Kepler, TESS, and spectroscopic rotation indicators, such as rotation periods and $v\sin i$ measurements. We identified 97 new BL candidates across 35 open clusters, almost tripling the previously known sample of 36. Based on the estimated completeness of $\approx$3\%, thousands of BLs are likely hidden within the cluster population. Detailed spectroscopic and time-series analyses will be essential to confirm their mass-transfer histories.</description>

      <title>The First Quantitative Study of Tail Regrowth of CME-Driven Disconnection in Comet C/2023 P1 Nishimura</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet C/2023 P1 (Nishimura) was observed by the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI), onboard the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, from 2023 September 1 to 14. During this period, the ion tail of the comet exhibited continual fluctuations and four tail disconnection events (TDEs), each coinciding with the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this work, we report on the ion tail dynamics of the best observed TDE, which occurred on September 11. The SoloHI white-light images reveal an abrupt bending, subsequent kinks, and severing of a downstream portion of the pre-existing ion tail. The onset of disconnection occurred $\sim$6.5 hours after the projected passage of the CME leading edge in the images, consistent with a CME flank encounter. After the disconnection, the ion tail reformed within $\sim$24 hours, with a regrowth rate of $\sim$86$\pm7~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, indicating the rate at which newly ionized material forms along the magnetic field draped around the comet's coma. After the TDE, the detached tail drifted anti-sunward at an estimated speed of $\sim$295$\pm20~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, comparable to the local CME flank's speed, suggesting that the severed plasma was most likely carried away from the comet by the CME. This study provides the first direct, quantitative characterization of comet-CME interactions and the subsequent regrowth phase of a cometary TDE. These measurements were achievable by SoloHI's unique inner-heliospheric coverage, thanks to a combination of high photometric sensitivity, short exposure times, and a wide field of view that preserves the fine-scale tail dynamics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a compact hierarchical triple main-sequence star system while searching for binary stars with compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have discovered a compact hierarchical triple main-sequence star system, which is cataloged as Gaia DR3 1010268155897156864 or TIC 21502513. Hereafter, we call it ``G1010''. G1010 consists of a primary (the most massive) star and inner binary that orbit each other. The primary star is a $0.85_{-0.03}^{+0.03}\;{\rm M}_\odot$ main-sequence (MS) star, and the inner binary components are $0.63_{-0.02}^{+0.02}$ and $0.61_{-0.02}^{+0.02}\;{\rm M}_\odot$ MS stars. The outer and inner orbital periods are $277.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ and $\sim 18.26$ days, respectively. G1010 is categorized as a single-lined spectroscopic binary, and its orbital solution indicates that G1010 possibly accompanies a massive compact object, such as a neutron star or massive white dwarf. In order to confirm the presence of a massive compact object, we have performed several-times low signal-to-ratio (SNR) and one-time high SNR spectroscopic observations, and determined the outer orbital parameters. Moreover, we have deeply analyzed the high SNR spectroscopic data, and found that G1010 accompanies not a massive compact object, but an inner binary. We have investigated G1010's light curve in Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), and concluded that the inner binary is actually an eclipsing binary, not included in TESS Eclipsing Binary Stars. We have obtained the inner orbital parameters from the TESS light curve. G1010 is similar to compact hierarchical triple star systems previously discovered by eclipse timing variation analysis. Our discovery has shown that such triple star systems can be discovered by combination of low- and high-SNR spectroscopic observations with the help of Gaia DR3 and the upcoming Gaia DR4/DR5.</description>

      <title>The Pre-He White Dwarfs in Eclipsing Binaries. V. TIC 399725538</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present echelle spectra of TIC 399725538 obtained in Korea and Thailand to investigate the physical properties and evolutionary scenarios of EL CVn-type binaries. The time-series spectra yielded the radial velocities (RVs) of the primary component and its atmospheric parameters, $T_{\rm eff,A}=7194\pm70$ K and $v_{\rm A}\sin i=68\pm9$ km s$^{-1}$. Joint modeling of our RVs and the archival TESS data provided component masses of $M_{\rm A}=1.930\pm0.054$ $M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm B}=0.211\pm0.005$ $M_\odot$, radii of $R_{\rm A}=1.922\pm0.020$ $R_\odot$ and $R_{\rm B}=0.207\pm0.005$ $R_\odot$, and luminosities of $L_{\rm A}=8.87\pm0.39$ $L_\odot$ and $L_{\rm B}=0.546\pm0.034$ $L_\odot$. The surface gravity and distance derived from this modeling are consistent with the model-independent $\log g_{\rm B}$ obtained from the direct observables and with the Gaia distance. The third light of $l_3=0.136\pm0.003$ comes mainly from two neighboring stars, TIC 399725539 and TIC 399725544. Comparison with stellar models indicates that TIC 399725538 A lies within the instability region of $\delta$ Sct$-$$\gamma$ Dor hybrids, whereas its extremely low-mass companion is markedly underluminous compared to theoretical white dwarf (WD) counterparts. Multifrequency analysis of the binary-subtracted residual lights revealed three significant signals, two of which correspond to aliases at two and four times the dominant frequency $f_1=0.0848$ day$^{-1}$. The $f_1$ frequency is likely a $\gamma$ Dor-type pulsation arising from the brighter A component, though further confirmation is required. Our results demonstrate that TIC 399725538 is a short-period EL CVn system belonging to the thick-disk population, consisting of a main-sequence $\gamma$ Dor pulsator and a helium-core WD precursor formed through stable mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Strontium-84 Enrichments in Presolar Grains Provide First Evidence of p-process Nucleosynthesis in Core-collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study reports detection of rare p-process isotopes within presolar grains. Presolar grains are relic dust grains from dying stars. These microscopic dust particles are found in primitive solar system materials. Their distinct isotopic compositions record the nucleosynthetic processes in their parent stars and the Galactic chemical environment in which these stars formed. We studied presolar graphite grains of high-density type from the Murchison meteorite and found five grains with subgrains that show enrichments in 84Sr compared to the solar abundance.84Sr is the neutron-deficient isotope of strontium that can be produced in the deep oxygen-rich interior of high-mass stars that end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. The observed 84Sr excesses cannot be produced in low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars, the source of most high-density presolar graphites found in meteorites. High-density graphites with embedded 84Sr excesses are, instead, compatible with a core-collapse supernovae origin. The graphite subgrains condensed from carbon-rich materials in the outer layers of core-collapse supernovae, where 84Sr was destroyed by neutron captures during hydrostatic evolution of the stars and their final explosion. Based on current theoretical stellar models, a few percent of contribution from the inner regions of core-collapse supernovae, which are enriched in p-process nuclides, to the outer carbon-rich regions is the most likely explanation for the observed enrichment of 84Sr in the subgrains of the high-density graphites. In this study, we present the first observational evidence that core-collapse supernovae produce and eject isotopes made by the p-process.</description>

      <title>Proposal of a Novel Physical Parameter Characterizing Solar Wind Speed in a Wave-Driven Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Empirical solar wind speed models play an important role in enabling space weather forecasting with low computational cost. Among these, one model called WS model is based on the asymptotic expansion factor. However, it is known that it fails in the case of pseudostreamers. In this study, as a first step toward constructing a solar wind speed empirical model based on physical parameters, we investigated the effect of the radial profile of flux-tube shape on the solar wind speed using one-dimensional numerical simulations. In the simulations, ad hoc Alfv\'en waves are injected from the photosphere at $r=R_\odot$ as the energy source, and the MHD equations are solved out to the interplanetary space at $r=70R_\odot$ to reproduce solar wind acceleration. As a result, even when the coronal base magnetic field and the asymptotic expansion factor are fixed, the final solar wind speed varies by approximately 300 km s$^{-1}$ depending on changes in the expansion height or non-monotonic expansion. Additionally, across all simulations performed, a better correlation is found with the quantities that reflect the information about the radial profile of flux-tube shape than the asymptotic expansion factor. Our results suggest that, as a physical characteristic parameter of the solar wind speed, an operation that can account for the expansion factor throughout the corona is necessary.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Classifications of Extremely Metal-poor Candidates Selected from Gaia XP Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely metal-poor stars are intrinsically rare, but emerging methods exist to accurately classify them from all-sky Gaia XP low-resolution spectra. To assess their overall accuracy for targeting metal-poor stars, we present a high-resolution spectroscopic followup of 75 very metal-poor candidates selected from the catalog by R. Andrae, V. Chandra, and H. W. Rix. We discover 2 new extremely metal-poor ($\rm{[Fe / H]}&lt;-3$) stars and 20 new very metal-poor ($\rm{[Fe/H]} &lt; -2$) stars. Abundances of up to 22 elements are derived from 1D local thermodynamic equilibrium analysis and kinematic parameters are derived using Gaia astrometry and spectroscopic radial velocities. The chemodynamical properties are mostly consistent with expectations for halo stars, but we discover an Mg-enhanced CEMP star ($\mathrm{[Mg/Fe]} = 0.89$) and an Mg-poor star from an accreted ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. The Gaia XP metallicity estimates are consistent with our $\rm{[Fe/H]}$ measurements down to $\rm{[Fe/H]}\sim -3.0$, but estimates worsen in highly extincted regions. We find that 4 other XP-based metallicity catalogs succeed in mitigating contaminants and can also classify metal-poor stars robustly to $\rm{[Fe/H]}\sim -3.0$. Our results demonstrate the utility of Gaia XP spectra for identifying the most metal-poor stars across the Galaxy.</description>

      <title>MgAl burning chain in M 54: the globular cluster-like properties of a nuclear star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present the chemical abundances of Fe, Mg, Al, Si, and K for a sample of 233 likely member stars of M 54. All the stars were observed with the FLAMES high-resolution multi-object spectrograph mounted at the VLT. Our analysis confirmed the presence of a large metallicity range in M 54, with the majority of the stars having -1.8 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1.0 dex and few stars with [Fe/H] &gt; -1.0 dex. The mean value of the total sample is [Fe/H] = -1.40 ({\sigma} = 0.22 dex). A Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis revealed that the observed spread in [Fe/H] is compatible with a non-null intrinsic iron dispersion. We also found that the metallicity distribution function and the broadening of the red giant branch of M 54 are not compatible with a single age, but instead they suggest a wide age range from ~ 13 Gyr to ~ 1 - 2 Gyr or a smaller age range if a significant He enhancement (Y ~ 0.35/0.40) is present in the most metal-rich stars. We identified among the stars in M 54 the entire pattern of anticorrelations linked to the MgAl burning cycle. In particular, the metal-rich component displays a higher level of H-burning with the presence of more extended anticorrelations than the metal-poor component. No Mg-poor ([Mg/Fe]&lt;0.0 dex) stars are identified in M 54. The evidence collected so far cannot be explained neither with a globular cluster-like scenario nor with a galactic chemical evolution. The chemical properties of M 54 can be explained within a scenario where this system formed through the merging of two globular clusters, the metal-poor one with standard characteristics and the more metal-rich one with more pronounced chemical anomalies, a possibly younger than the first one. M 54 is confirmed as a key stellar system for explaining the chemical evolution of a nuclear star cluster.</description>

      <title>Wave generation via oscillatory reconnection at a three-dimensional magnetic null point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work conducts a three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to investigate wave generating, time-dependent reconnection around a magnetic null point. A non-periodic perturbation (in the $xz$-plane) triggers oscillatory reconnection (OR) at the 3D null, resulting in a self-sustained oscillation with a constant period $P$. We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfv\'en wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology.</description>

      <title>Mixing-induced thermal instabilities and coronal condensations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cool, dense material is frequently observed to permeate the hot, tenuous solar corona in the form of prominences, spicules and coronal rain. Both the cool material and surrounding corona exist at temperatures that are effectively thermally stable, in that their local radiative losses occur on relatively long timescales compared to the dynamics. However, as the solar atmosphere evolves, driving mixing between the condensations and surrounding hot material, intermediate temperatures form, which can become subject to highly efficient radiative losses. The thermal energy lost due to radiation can far exceed the turbulent heating thus the system undergoes mixing-induced cooling. Here, a 3D radiative MHD simulation is performed of the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability (KHI) occurring between a cool condensation and the hot solar corona. During the evolution, thermal instabilities form naturally within the mixing layer, and grow with time to produce long, narrow structures that extend perpendicular to the magnetic field. The thermal instabilities form self-consistently within the mixing layer as small isolated events, and are then stretched by the background flows to create long structures in relatively narrow planes. The turbulent flows agitate the condensations and cause them to fragment, creating smaller localised clumps of cool, dense (prominence-like) material that can merge and further fragment. In the presented simulation, the thermal instabilities act to replenish the cool, dense material lost due to mixing, with the total mass of cool material being approximately constant through time. By analysing the thermal energy loss due to optically-thin radiation, thermal instabilities are found to account for 15-20\% of all radiative losses in the turbulent plasma.</description>

      <title>Detection of hot subdwarf binaries and sdB stars using machine learning methods and a large sample of Gaia XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subdwarfs (hot sds) are compact, evolved stars near the Extreme Horizontal Branch (EHB) and are key to understanding stellar evolution and the ultraviolet excess in galaxies. We extend our previous analysis of Gaia XP spectra of hot subdwarf stars to a much larger sample, enabling a comprehensive study of their physical and binary properties. Our goal is to identify patterns in Gaia XP spectra, investigate binarity, and assess the influence of parameters such as temperature, helium abundance, and variability. We analyse approximately 20000 hot subdwarf candidates selected from the literature, combining Gaia XP data with published parameters. We apply Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to the XP coefficients, which represent the Gaia XP spectra in a compact, feature-based form, to construct a similarity map. We then use self-organizing maps (SOMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify spectra as binaries or singles, and as cool and helium-poor or hot and helium-rich. The spectra are normalised using asymmetric least squares baseline fitting to emphasise individual spectral features. The BP-RP colour dominates the similarity map, with additional influence from temperature, helium abundance, and variability. Most binaries, identified via the Virtual Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), cluster in two filaments linked to main sequence companions. CNN classification suggests a strong correlation between variability and binarity, with binary fractions exceeding 60 percent for active hot subdwarfs. Gaia XP spectra combined with dimensionality reduction and machine learning effectively reveal patterns in hot subdwarf properties. Our findings indicate that binarity and environmental density strongly shape the evolutionary paths of hot subdwarfs, and we identify possible contamination by main sequence and cataclysmic variable stars in the base sample.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic power spectra and visibilities of damped mixed modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.21745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observational studies of red giant stars have estimated the visibility of their mixed oscillation modes, which is a proxy of the average energy of these modes. Among other things, they demonstrated that although the damping rate of the oscillations in the core of many red giants appears to be negligible, other red giants exhibit high core damping rates that are sometimes consistent with the infinite value limit. Up until now, it has not been possible to link the mixed mode visibilities to core damping rates in a quantitative way. In this study, we use the progressive wave picture to derive an analytical function expressing the approximate resonance pattern of red giants up to a proportionality factor. This function can model the influence of the damping on the oscillations, as well as take into account other effects such as mode asymmetries. In particular, this expression can be used to obtain a quantitative estimate for the visibility of mixed modes and to predict the detectability of mixed mode and multiplet signatures under different core damping rates. Here, we conduct a parameter study to investigate how the damping processes affect these aspects. We find that the visibility approaches the value expected for an infinite core damping rate already at finite values. Furthermore, we find that both the mixed mode and the multiplet signatures disappear at finite core damping rates. This implies that the observational characteristics of red giants with finite core damping rates can appear as if their core damping rate were infinite, providing an explanation for the observed populations. Moreover, we have used our method to quantitatively estimate the core damping rates of red giants with unusually low mixed mode amplitudes from their observed visibilities.</description>

      <title>Progress towards a 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code for outflow wind modelling: II. 3-D applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive hot stars play crucial role in the dynamics of galaxies. These stars influence their surroundings through strong winds which are highly structured processes. The theoretical study of the non-symmetric phenomena of the stellar winds are becoming important these days, mainly because 1-D models are not sufficient enough.
  We present a new version of our Monte Carlo radiative transfer code Andy Antares with improved treatment of the velocity field for arbitrary geometries. Our aim is to develop a numerical scheme that can incorporate a general velocity field defined at discrete points. Our main objective is to calculate radiative transfer in a general input hydrodynamic model.
  The Andy Antares code currently calculates pure radiative transfer. The input model is pre-calculated by another hydrodynamical code. The whole radiative transfer calculation is then processed in a Cartesian grid. Radiative transfer is solved using the Monte Carlo approach in 3-D regardless of the input hydrodynamical model's dimension. The velocity field at any given point is interpolated using the trilinear interpolation. The optical depth is then integrated numerically along the photon's path.
  We verified the accuracy of the numerical velocity interpolation by comparison with results obtained for analytical velocity fields, achieving successful outcomes. We also tested the radiative transfer solution on a 3-D model generated from a 2-D hydrodynamic model, and obtained emergent radiation.
  The code is suitable for the numerical solution of radiative transfer in 3-D with arbitrary velocity fields.</description>

      <title>EWOCS-V: Is Wd1-72 a recent post-interaction WR+O binary?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutionary origin of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars at Solar metallicity is unclear. Single-star evolution from massive O stars, possibly via a Luminous Blue Variable phase, is challenged by binary period distributions of different WR subtypes. Wd1-72 is a WN7b+O binary embedded in the collective wind of the Galactic young massive cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). It is surrounded by highly structured nebulosity, with cometary tails pointing away from Wd 1 and quasi-spherical droplets towards it. In this letter, we demonstrate that this morphology can be qualitatively reproduced by a hydrodynamic simulation of non-conservative Roche Lobe Overflow (RLOF) mass-loss into a cluster wind. Our model is based on a detailed binary evolution track consistent with key known properties of Wd1-72. Our work suggests Wd1-72 could be only ~10 kyr post-RLOF, and the hydrogen-free nature of Wd1-72 favours this being a second or subsequent RLOF episode. Follow-up observations could make Wd1-72 a valuable benchmark for probing mass-loss and mass-transfer in forming gravitational-wave binary-progenitor systems.</description>

      <title>Inclination Bias in Techniques Used to Identify Be Star Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several methods for identifying Be star candidates are reviewed for observational bias with respect to system inclination, that is the angle between the stellar/disk rotation axis and the observer's line of sight, with focus on two photometric methods that leverage narrow-band filters centred on H$\alpha$ and a spectroscopic method using a H$\alpha$ peak-finding algorithm. Tests for bias were performed using a sample of 20,000 synthetic Be stars drawn from a Salpeter initial mass function and computed libraries of spectral energy distributions and H$\alpha$ profiles. The spectroscopic method showed substantial bias against high inclinations ($i &gt; 80^\circ$). Both photometric methods were biased against low inclinations, with one also biased against inclinations above $80^\circ$, resulting in a surplus in the Be star candidate detection rate for moderate inclinations ($ 50^\circ &lt; i &lt; 80^\circ$). Inclination probability distributions, including the random $\sin i$ factor, are given for the three methods that can be applied to observational samples.</description>

      <title>BE Lyncis is not a Black Hole Binary: Lessons From Gaia and Hipparcos Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BE Lyncis (BE Lyn) is a well-studied high-amplitude $\delta$ Scuti variable star (HADS). Recently, Niu et al. (2026) analyzed a 39-year baseline of times of maximum light of BE Lyn, reporting that it is the most eccentric binary known ($e \approx 0.9989$) and hosts the nearest black hole (BH) known to date. We analyze Hipparcos and Gaia astrometry of BE Lyn, predicting what the observed proper motion anomaly (PMA) over the 25 year baseline between the two missions would be were the companion really a $\gtrsim 17.5\,M_{\odot}$ BH. We find that the predicted PMA is at least an order of magnitude larger than the observed value of $\approx 1.7 \pm 0.8$ mas yr$^{-1}$, regardless of the assumed orientation of the orbit. We predict the expected Gaia DR3 RUWE for different orientations of the putative BH binary, finding that it ranges from $\approx 2.5$-$4.0$, much larger than the reported value of $1.073$. The observed value is instead consistent with a low-mass secondary or a single star. We find that BE Lyncis would have received a 7-parameter acceleration solution if it were a BH binary, in contradiction with its absence from the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalogs. Finally, we show that the reported orbit is impossible because the luminous star would overflow its Roche lobe at periastron, irrespective of inclination. We recommend caution in interpreting light-travel time effect (LTTE) models that require very high eccentricities, face-on inclinations, or large companion masses. The observed pulsation timing variations are most likely simply a result of red noise or pulsation phase evolution.</description>

      <title>Projection effects in star-forming regions: I. Nearest-neighbour statistics and observational biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars form as molecular clouds fragment into networks of dense cores, filaments, and subclusters. The characteristic spacing of these cores is a key observable imprint of fragmentation physics and is commonly measured using nearest-neighbour (NN) statistics. However, NN separations are derived from projected two-dimensional (2D) positions, while fragmentation occurs in three dimensions (3D). Using spherical and fractal toy models, we show that the standard geometric deprojection factor of $4/\pi\simeq1.27$ is inadequate because projection not only foreshortens separations but also rewires the NN network, while finite angular resolution merges close neighbours and inflates apparent spacings. We quantify these competing biases with Monte Carlo experiments spanning a wide range of morphologies, sample sizes, and effective resolutions. From these we derive an empirical correction factor that depends on both sample size and resolution: for small ($N\lesssim10$) or poorly resolved samples ($\lesssim$10 resolution elements across the field), intrinsic NN spacings exceed projected values by only 20 to 40%, whereas for well-sampled ($N\gtrsim100$), well-resolved data ($\gtrsim$30-50 resolution elements), true 3D separations are typically larger by a factor of $\sim$2. This calibration enables observers to convert measured 2D NN spacings into corresponding 3D estimates, with typical morphology-driven uncertainties of order 30 to 40%, and we demonstrate how it alters inferred fragmentation scales in observed and simulated core populations.

      <title>The Third Option: Color Phase Curves to Characterize the Atmospheres of Temperate Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing the atmospheres of rocky exoplanets has proven to be challenging for JWST. Transit spectroscopy of the TRAPPIST-1 planets has been impacted by the effects of spots and faculae on the host star. Secondary eclipses have detected hot rocks, but evidence for atmospheres has been difficult to obtain. However, there is a third option that we call color phase curves. This method will apply to synchronously rotating non-transiting planets as well as transiting planets. A color phase curve uses photometry at a long-IR wavelength near the peak of the planetary thermal emission (e.g., 21 microns) divided by photometry at a shorter wavelength where the star dominates more strongly (e.g., 12 microns). We avoid wavelengths having potentially strong molecular absorption (e.g., 15 microns) to minimize degeneracies in the color phase curve, and we aim to detect and characterize the planetary atmosphere via its longitudinal heat transfer. The ratio of two wavelengths observed nearly simultaneously is designed to isolate thermal emission from the planet, discriminate against the star, and largely cancel instrumental systematic effects. Moreover, we show that invoking mass-radius relations, and using self-consistent physical models, will permit the longitudinal heat transfer to be measured independent of the orbital inclination. Radial velocity surveys are detecting many new exoplanets, including temperate rocky worlds with Earth-like masses. Most of those planets will not transit, but color phase curves have the potential to detect and characterize their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The Initial Mass Function as the Equilibrium State of a Variational Process: why the IMF cannot be sampled stochastically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar initial mass function (sIMF) is often treated as a stochastic probability distribution, yet such an interpretation implies Poisson noise that is inconsistent with growing observational evidence. In particular, the observed relation between the mass of the most massive star formed in an embedded cluster and the cluster's total stellar mass supports a deterministic sampling process, known as optimal sampling. However, the physical origin of optimal sampling has not been formally established in the literature. In this work, we show that the stellar mass distribution implied by optimal sampling emerges from applying the Maximum Entropy principle to the fragmentation of star-forming clumps, whose structure is set by density-dependent cooling in the optically thin regime. Here, the maximum entropy leads to unbiased distributions. By applying calculus of variations to minimize the entropy functional obtained assuming fragmentation, we recover the power-law form of the sIMF, and we show that any distribution deviating from the sIMF violates the Maximum Entropy principle. This work provides a first-principles foundation for the deterministic nature of star formation. Thus, the sIMF is the distribution resulting from a maximally unbiased system.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Resonance Detectability during Binary Neutron Star Inspiral: Accurate Mismatch Computations for Low-lying Dynamical Tides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute deviations from observed gravitational wave signals, where the amplitude of the signal is unchanged. As an example, we consider the detectability of low lying dynamical tides in binary neutron star or neutron star black hole mergers. Tidal forces can excite oscillatory modes of one or both of the stars in the binary when the orbital frequency of the binary system sweeps through the resonant mode frequency dissipating energy into the vibrational mode. The orbital energy loss to the vibrational mode extracts energy from the orbital motion, advancing the time to merger. The inspiral then continues with an excess phase and a time advance. Both will cause a mismatch when fitting to a system that has not gone through the resonance. To resolve this effect, we compute the mismatch for current and planned detectors using both a quasi-analytical approach that relies on the computation of moment integrals and an optimized version of the standard numerical match function. We conclude that detectability can occur for time advances of the order of 1 ms with advanced LVK detectors for an excess energy-flux that is a few percent of the gravitational wave emission. Our results contrast with previous work, which model this effect solely as a phase shift of the waveform or by using the difference in the number of cycles induced by the resonant behavior. We show that tidal resonance effects primarily cause a time advance of the merger, rather than a phase difference, and that the single-frequency approximation commonly used in the literature significantly overestimates the detectability of this effect.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Generation of Neutron Star Equations of State Using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a machine learning model based on a structured variational autoencoder (VAE) framework to reconstruct and generate neutron star (NS) equations of state (EOS). The VAE consists of an encoder network that maps high-dimensional EOS data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder network that reconstructs the full EOS from the latent representation. The latent space includes supervised NS observables derived from the training EOS data, as well as latent random variables corresponding to additional unspecified EOS features learned automatically. Sampling the latent space enables the generation of new, causal, and stable EOS models that satisfy astronomical constraints on the supervised NS observables, while allowing Bayesian inference of the EOS incorporating additional multimessenger data, including gravitational waves from LIGO/Virgo and mass and radius measurements of pulsars. Based on a VAE trained on a Skyrme EOS dataset, we find that a latent space with two supervised NS observables, the maximum mass $(M_{\max})$ and the canonical radius $(R_{1.4})$, together with one latent random variable controlling the EOS near the crust--core transition, can already reconstruct Skyrme EOSs with high fidelity, achieving mean absolute percentage errors of approximately $(0.15\%)$ for $(M_{\max})$ and $(R_{1.4})$ derived from the decoder-reconstructed EOS.</description>

With the aim of exploring the global observable properties of those compact stars, we investigate the total masses and radii, the tidal deformabilities and especially the fundamental (f -) mode oscillations. While we choose two typical models in this work, this method applies to any analytical equations of state. By comparing with the multi-messenger observations, one can constrain the corresponding parameters in those models.</description>

Abstract: The Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) survey is an ESO large programme designed to obtain multi-epoch spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). It will provide binary fractions and orbital configurations of binary systems, and search for dormant black-hole binary candidates (OB+BH). Here we present projected rotational velocities (vsini) of all sources and, using the multiplicity properties presented in previous papers, we derive the vsini distributions of apparent single stars, single lined spectroscopic (SB1) binaries, and SB2 systems. We identify a locus in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram where rotational velocities decrease significantly; we interpret this feature as broadly corresponding to the terminal-age main sequence. The main sequence cohort is distinguished by a broad range of vsini values, but with a strong peak in the distribution in the range 30-60 km/s, close to the resolution limit of 30 km/s. Sources in this low vsini peak are distributed throughout the main sequence, and are also present in the SB1 sample, though less prominent than in the single star distribution. A preliminary analysis of the lowest vsini cohort, that includes SB1 systems, implies that roughly one third may be nitrogen rich and we speculate that this cohort is a mix of pristine single stars, long period binaries, and merger products. The SB2 systems appear to be mostly short period binaries in synchronous rotation and have vsini estimates distributed around a mean value of approximately 140 km/s . Higher vsini sources are also present in the single and SB1 systems, all of which have tail to higher vsini values, consistent with tidal and mass-transfer effects. The supergiants, with a few exceptions, have low vsini, the bulk of these systems being essentially unresolved at current spectral resolution.</description>

Abstract: Stellar convection in the presence of magnetic field affects the emergent intensity, as well as the structure and evolution of cool main-sequence dwarfs. We aim to understand the effect of faculae-like field strengths on near-surface stellar convection using 3D radiative MHD simulations of near-surface magneto-convection. We compare simulations of F, G, K and M main-sequence stars with a small-scale dynamo (SSD) to faculae-like spatially averaged field strengths (from 100 to 500 G). We focus on the effect of imposed magnetic field on the thermodynamic stratification and velocities, along with the bolometric intensity and surface field strength. Imposed magnetic fields result in reduced average density and gas pressure near the surface compared to the SSD simulations. The temperature stratification also shows a dip at and just below the stellar surface. The changes in average bolometric intensity are within a percent, with different trends with field strength for different stellar types. In addition, the convective velocities are reduced. The magnitude of changes in thermodynamic quantities are related to field strength as well as the stellar $T_{\rm eff}$. Faculae-strength magnetic fields modify the near surface convection by reducing gas pressure and density as well as suppressing convection in regions with strong field concentrations. The strength of these effects depends on the stellar type.</description>

      <title>A persistent bow shock in a diskless magnetised accreting white dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stellar bow shocks are formed when an outflow interacts with the interstellar medium. In white dwarfs accreting from a binary companion, outflows are associated with either strong winds from the donor star, the accretion disk, or a thermonuclear runaway explosion on the white dwarf surface. To date, only six accreting white dwarfs are known to harbour disk-wind driven bow shocks that are not associated to thermonuclear explosions. Here, we report the discovery of a bow shock associated with a high-proper-motion disk-less accreting white dwarf, 1RXS J052832.5+283824. We show that the white dwarf has a strong magnetic field in the range B~42-45 MG, making RXJ0528+2838 the a bonafide known polar-type cataclysmic variable harbouring a bow shock. The resolved bow shock is shown to be inconsistent with a past thermonuclear explosion, or being inflated by a donor wind, ruling out all accepted scenarios for inflating a bow shock around this system. Modelling of the energetics reveals that the observed bow shock requires a persistent power source with a luminosity significantly exceeding the system accretion energy output. This implies the presence of a powerful, previously unrecognized energy loss mechanism - potentially tied to magnetic activity - that may operate over sufficiently long timescales to influence the course of binary evolution.</description>

      <title>A Cosmic Miracle: A Remarkably Luminous Galaxy at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44$ Confirmed with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11263</link>

Abstract: JWST has revealed a stunning population of bright galaxies at surprisingly early epochs, $z&gt;10$, where few such sources were expected. Here we present the most distant example of this class yet -- MoM-z14, a luminous ($M_{\rm{UV}}=-20.2$) source in the COSMOS field at $z_{\rm{spec}}=14.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ that expands the observational frontier to a mere 280 million years after the Big Bang. The redshift is confirmed with NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy through a sharp Lyman-$\alpha$ break and $\sim3\sigma$ detections of five rest-UV emission lines. The number density of bright $z_{\rm{spec}}\sim14-15$ sources implied by our "Mirage or Miracle" survey spanning $\sim350$ arcmin$^{2}$ is $&gt;100\times$ larger ($182^{+329}_{-105}\times$) than pre-JWST consensus models. The high EWs of UV lines ($\sim15{-}35$ \AA) signal a rising star-formation history, with a $\sim10\times$ increase in the last 5 Myr ($\rm{SFR_{\rm{5Myr}}}/\rm{SFR_{\rm{50Myr}}}=9.9^{+3.0}_{-5.8}$). The source is extremely compact (circularized $r_{\rm{e}} = 74^{+15}_{-12}$ pc), and yet elongated ($b/a=0.25^{+0.11}_{-0.06}$), suggesting an AGN is not the dominant source of UV light. The steep UV slope ($\beta=-2.5^{+0.2}_{-0.2}$) implies negligible dust attenuation and a young stellar population. The absence of a strong damping wing provides tentative evidence that the immediate surroundings of MoM-z14 may be partially ionized at a redshift where virtually every reionization model predicts a $\sim100\%$ neutral fraction. The nitrogen emission and highly super-solar [N/C]$&gt;1$ hint at an abundance pattern similar to local globular clusters that may have once hosted luminous supermassive stars. Since this abundance pattern is also common among the most ancient stars born in the Milky Way, we may be directly witnessing the formation of such stars in dense clusters, connecting galaxy evolution across the entire sweep of cosmic time.</description>

      <title>SPHEREx Re-Observation of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS in December 2025: Detection of Increased Post-Perihelion Activity, Refractory Coma Dust, and New Coma Gas Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In December-2025, the NASA SPHEREx spacecraft re-observed ISO 3I/ATLAS post-perihelion, finding a much more active object compared to August-2025 SPHEREx pre-perihelion observations, with marked evidence for development into an cometary body fully sublimating all its ices. The new imaging spectrophotometry was dominated by spatially resolved features due to light scattered by dust, along with thermal emission, plus gas-line emissions from CN (0.93 um), H2O (2.7 um), organic C-H (3.2 to 3.6 um), CO2 (4.25 to 4.27 um), and CO (4.6 to 4.8 um). The CO2 gas-coma continues to be extended out to a 3 arcmin radius. The continuum spectral signature of H2O-ice absorption had mostly disappeared, replaced by scattered-light plus thermal-emission from organo-silicaceous dust grains while the H2O gas-emission is 40x times brighter. The CO- and CO2-gas comae were circularly symmetric, while the other comae appear morphologically similar to the dust-coma with its pear-shaped, solar-pointing, large icy dust grains dust tail. The new appearance of CN and C-H features suggests that these carbon-rich ice species were contained either in H2O phases or were trapped under them.</description>

      <title>Spatial distribution of organics in the Horsehead nebula: signposts of chemistry driven by atomic carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) Complex organic molecules (COMs) are considered essential precursors to prebiotic species. While COMs were once expected to be efficiently destroyed under UV-irradiated conditions, detections in photodissociation regions (PDRs) have challenged this view. However, the mechanisms by which UV radiation contributes to their formation are still uncertain. Here, we present moderately resolved maps of simple and complex organic molecules at the UV-illuminated edge of the Horsehead nebula, obtained by combining ALMA and IRAM 30m single-dish observations at $\sim 15^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. We analyze the spatial distribution of species such as C$^{17}$O, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, CH$_3$CN, and HC$_3$N. By incorporating previous C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O single-dish data as well as PdBI maps of H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH, we derive profiles of gas density, temperature, thermal pressure, and column densities of the organic species as a function of distance from the UV source. Our results show that most organic species$-$particularly H$_2$CO, CH$_2$CO, CH$_3$CHO, HNCO, and CH$_3$CN$-$exhibit enhanced column densities at the UV-illuminated edge compared to cloud interiors, possibly indicating efficient dust-grain surface chemistry driven by the diffusion of atomic C and radicals produced via photodissociation of CO and CH$_3$OH, as supported by recent laboratory experiments. The exceptions, HC$_3$N and CH$_3$OH, can be attributed to inefficient formation on dust grains and ineffective non-thermal desorption into the gas phase, respectively. Additionally, contributions from gas-phase hydrocarbon photochemistry$-$possibly seeded by grain-surface products$-$cannot be ruled out. Further chemical modeling is needed to confirm the efficiency of these pathways for the studied species, which could have important implications for other cold, UV-irradiated environments such as protoplanetary disks.</description>
