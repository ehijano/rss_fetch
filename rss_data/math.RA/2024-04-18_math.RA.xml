      <title>On retract varieties of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A retract variety is defined as a class of algebras closed under isomorphisms, retracts and products. Let a principal retract variety be generated by one algebra and a set-principal retract variety be generated by some set of algebras. It is shown that (a) not each set-principal retract variety is principal, and (b) not each retract variety is set-principal. A class of connected monounary algebras $\mathcal{S}$ such that every retract variety of monounary algebras is generated by algebras that have all connected components from $\mathcal{S}$ and at most two connected components are isomorphic is defined, this generating class is constructively described. All set-principal retract varieties of monounary algebras are characterized via degree function of monounary algebras.</description>

      <title>Two Homomorphisms from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian $Y_{\hbar,\ve+\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n))$ to the affine Yangian $Y_{\hbar,\ve}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1))$ which is different from the one in arXiv:2312.09933. By using this homomorphism, we give a homomorphism from $Y_{\hbar,\ve}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n))\otimes Y_{\hbar,\ve+n\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m))$ to $Y_{\hbar,\ve}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m+n))$. As an application, we construct a homomorphism from the affine Yangian $Y_{\hbar,\ve+n\hbar}(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(m))$ to the centralizer algebra of the pair of affine Lie algebras $(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(m+n),\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}(n))$ and the coset vertex algebra of the pair of rectangular $W$-algebras $(\mathcal{W}^k(\mathfrak{gl}(2m+2n),(2^{m+n})),\mathcal{W}^{k+m}(\mathfrak{gl}(2n),(2^{n})))$.</description>

      <title>Nilpotent symplectic alternating algebras II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper and its sequel we continue our study of nilpotent symplectic alternating algebras. In particular we give a full classification of such algebras of dimension $10$ over any field. It is known that symplectic alternating algebras over $\mbox{GF}(3)$ correspond to a special rich class $\mathcal{C}$ of $2$-Engel $3$-groups of exponent $27$ and under this correspondence we will see that the nilpotent algebras correspond to a subclass of $\mathcal{C}$ that are those groups in $\mathcal{C}$ that have an extra group theoretical property that we refer to as being powerfully nilpotent and can be described also in the context of $p$-groups where $p$ is an arbitrary prime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_n(\textbf{F}_q)$ of traceless matrices over a finite field of odd characteristic $p$ can be generated by $2$ elements with a single exception $(n, p)= (3, 3)$. We establish a curious trace identity in $\mathfrak{sl}_3(\textbf{F})$ over any field $\textbf{F}$ of characteristic $3$ that obstructs $2$-generation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersolvable hyperplane arrangements and matroids are known to give rise to certain Koszul algebras, namely their Orlik-Solomon algebras and graded Varchenko-Gel'fand algebras. We explore how this interacts with group actions, particularly for the braid arrangement and the action of the symmetric group, where the Hilbert functions of the algebras and their Koszul duals are given by Stirling numbers of the first and second kinds, respectively. The corresponding symmetric group representations exhibit branching rules that interpret Stirling number recurrences, which are shown to apply to all supersolvable arrangements. They also enjoy representation stability properties that follow from Koszul duality.</description>

      <title>A Universal Property of the Spectrum of a Ring and the Semiring of its Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arithmetic valuations are intimately connected with the structure of the ideals of a commutative ring. We show how the generalized idempotent semiring valuations of Jeffrey and Noah Giansiracusa can be used to make this connection explicit. Through this generalized valuation theory sufficiently complete positive valuations give rise to Galois correspondences with the lattice of ideals of a commutative ring. Up to isomorphism the semiring of ideals of a commutative ring can be defined as a universal factoring semiring for positive valuations. We then further show that this valuation theory can formally connect Joyal's \textit{notion de z\'eros} and universal property of the spectrum of a ring to arithmetic valuation theory. We show that up to isomorphism as a coframe, the closed Zariski topology on a spectrum of a commutative ring can be defined as the universal factoring semiring of additively and multiplicatively idempotent valuations.</description>

      <title>The Terwilliger algebras of doubly regular tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Terwilliger algebras of asymmetric association schemes of rank $3$, whose nonidentity relations correspond to doubly regular tournaments, are shown to have thin irreducible modules, and to always be of dimension $4k+9$ for some positive integer $k$. It is determined that asymmetric rank $3$ association schemes of order up to $23$ are determined up to combinatorial isomorphism by the list of their complex Terwilliger algebras at each vertex, but this no longer true at order $27$. To distinguish order $27$ asymmetric rank $3$ association schemes, it is shown using computer calculations that the list of rational Terwilliger algebras at each vertex will suffice.</description>

      <title>Computing finite index congruences of finitely presented semigroups and monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we describe an algorithm for computing the left, right, or 2-sided congruences of a finitely presented semigroup or monoid with finitely many classes, and alternative algorithm when the finitely presented semigroup or monoid is finite. We compare the two algorithms presented to existing algorithms and implementations. The first algorithm is a generalization of Sims' low index subgroup algorithm for finding the congruences of a monoid. The second algorithm involves determining the distinct principal congruences, and then finding all of their possible joins. Variations of this algorithm have been suggested in numerous contexts by numerous authors. We show how to utilise the theory of relative Green's relations, and a version of Schreier's Lemma for monoids, to reduce the number of principal congruences that must be generated as the first step of this approach. Both of the algorithms described in this paper are implemented in the GAP package Semigroups, and the first algorithm is available in the C++ library libsemigroups and in its python bindings libsemigroups_pybind.</description>

      <title>Compressed commuting graphs of matrix rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce compressed commuting graph of rings. It can be seen as a compression of the standard commuting graph (with the central elements added) where we identify the vertices that generate the same subring. The compression is chosen in such a way that it induces a functor from the category of rings to the category of graphs, which means that our graph takes into account not only the commutativity relation in the ring, but also the commutativity relation in all of its homomorphic images. Furthermore, we show that this compression is best possible for matrix algebras over finite fields. We compute the compressed commuting graphs of finite fields and rings of $2 \times 2$ matrices over finite fields.</description>

We construct a linear basis for both free metabelian Novikov and free metabelian Lie-admissible algebras. Additionally, we describe a space of symmetric polynomials for both the free metabelian Novikov algebra and the free metabelian Lie-admissible algebra.</description>

      <title>Sandpile Groups of Cayley Graphs of $\mathbb{F}_2^r$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.06919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sandpile group of a connected graph $G$, defined to be the torsion part of the cokernel of the graph Laplacian, is a subtle graph invariant with combinatorial, algebraic, and geometric descriptions. Extending and improving previous works on the sandpile group of hypercubes, we study the sandpile groups of the Cayley graphs of $\mathbb{F}_2^r$, focusing on their poorly understood Sylow-$2$ component. We find the number of Sylow-$2$ cyclic factors for "generic" Cayley graphs and deduce a bound for the non-generic ones. Moreover, we provide a sharp upper bound for their largest Sylow-$2$ cyclic factors. In the case of hypercubes, we give exact formulae for the largest $n-1$ Sylow-$2$ cyclic factors. Some key ingredients of our work include the natural ring structure on these sandpile groups from representation theory, and calculation of the $2$-adic valuations of binomial sums via the combinatorics of carries.</description>

Abstract: We construct a flat model structure on the category $_{\mathcal{Q},R}{\mathsf{Mod}}$ of additive functors from a small preadditive category $\mathcal{Q}$ satisfying certain conditions to the module category $_{R}{\mathsf{Mod}}$ over an associative ring $R$, whose homotopy category is the $\mathcal{Q}$-shaped derived category introduced by Holm and Jorgensen. Moreover, we prove that for an arbitrary associative ring $R$, an object in $_{\mathcal{Q},R}{\mathsf{Mod}}$ is Gorenstein projective (resp., Gorenstein injective, Gorenstein flat, projective coresolving Gorenstein flat) if and only if so is its value on each object of $\mathcal{Q}$, and hence improve a result by Dell'Ambrogio, Stevenson and \v{S}\v{t}ov\'{\i}\v{c}ek.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a natural generalization of the Grothendieck group $\mathrm{K}_0$ to the case of possibly unpointed categories admitting pushouts by using the concept of heaps recently introduced by Brezinzki. In case of a monoidal category, the defined $\mathrm{K}_0$ is shown to be a truss. It is shown that the construction generalizes the classical $\mathrm{K}_0$ of an abelian category as the group retract along the isomorphism class of the zero object. We finish by applying this construction to construct the integers with addition and multiplication as the decategorification of finite sets and show that in this $\mathrm{K}_0\left(\underline{\mathrm{Top}}\right)$ one can identify a CW-complex with the iterated product of its cells.</description>

Abstract: In [Incer Romeo, I. X., \textit{The Algebra of Contracts}. Ph.D. Thesis, UC Berkeley (2022)] an algebraic perspective on assume-guarantee contracts is proposed. This proposal relies heavily on a construction involving Boolean algebras. However, the structures thus proposed lack a clearly prescribed set of basic operations, necessary if we want to see them as a class of algebras (in the sense of Universal Algebra). In this article, by prescribing a suitable set of basic operations on contracts, we manage to describe these algebras as (a generating set of members of) well-known varieties.</description>
