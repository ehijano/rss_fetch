      <title>Option Pricing with a Compound CARMA(p,q)-Hawkes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-exciting point process with a continuous-time autoregressive moving average intensity process, named CARMA(p,q)-Hawkes model, has recently been introduced. The model generalizes the Hawkes process by substituting the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck intensity with a CARMA(p,q) model where the associated state process is driven by the counting process itself. The proposed model preserves the same degree of tractability as the Hawkes process, but it can reproduce more complex time-dependent structures observed in several market data. The paper presents a new model of asset price dynamics based on the CARMA(p,q) Hawkes model. It is constructed using a compound version of it with a random jump size that is independent of both the counting and the intensity processes and can be employed as the main block for pure jump and (stochastic volatility) jump-diffusion processes. The numerical results for pricing European options illustrate that the new model can replicate the volatility smile observed in financial markets. Through an empirical analysis, which is presented as a calibration exercise, we highlight the role of higher order autoregressive and moving average parameters in pricing options.</description>

      <title>Profit and loss decomposition in continuous time and approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06733v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial institutions and insurance companies that analyze the evolution and sources of profits and losses often look at risk factors only at discrete reporting dates, ignoring the detailed paths. Continuous-time decompositions avoid this weakness and also make decompositions consistent across different reporting grids. We construct a large class of continuous-time decompositions from a new extended version of It\^o's formula and uniquely identify a preferred decomposition from the axioms of exactness, symmetry and normalization. This unique decomposition turns out to be a stochastic limit of recursive Shapley values, but it suffers from a curse of dimensionality as the number of risk factors increases. We develop an approximation that breaks this curse when the risk factors almost surely have no simultaneous jumps.</description>

      <title>Analysis of optimal portfolio on finite and small-time horizons for a stochastic volatility model with multiple correlated assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.06778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the portfolio optimization problem in a financial market where the underlying stochastic volatility model is driven by n-dimensional Brownian motions. At first, we derive a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation including the correlations among the standard Brownian motions. We use an approximation method for the optimization of portfolios. With such approximation, the value function is analyzed using the first-order terms of expansion of the utility function in the powers of time to the horizon. The error of this approximation is controlled using the second-order terms of expansion of the utility function. It is also shown that the one-dimensional version of this analysis corresponds to a known result in the literature. We also generate a close-to-optimal portfolio near the time to horizon using the first-order approximation of the utility function. It is shown that the error is controlled by the square of the time to the horizon. Finally, we provide an approximation scheme to the value function for all times and generate a close-to-optimal portfolio.</description>

      <title>Mean-Variance Optimization for Participating Life Insurance Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the equity holders' mean-variance optimal portfolio choice problem for (non-)protected participating life insurance contracts. We derive explicit formulas for the optimal terminal wealth and the optimal strategy in the multi-dimensional Black-Scholes model, showing the existence of all necessary parameters. In incomplete markets, we state Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for the value function. Moreover, we provide a numerical analysis of the Black-Scholes market. The equity holders on average increase their investment into the risky asset in bad economic states and decrease their investment over time.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansion for the Hartman-Watson distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.09579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2001.09579v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hartman-Watson distribution with density $f_r(t)$ is a probability distribution defined on $t \geq 0$ which appears in several problems of applied probability. The density of this distribution is expressed in terms of an integral $\theta(r,t)$ which is difficult to evaluate numerically for small $t\to 0$. Using saddle point methods, we obtain the first two terms of the $t\to 0$ expansion of $\theta(\rho/t,t)$ at fixed $\rho &gt;0$. An error bound is obtained by numerical estimates of the integrand, which is furthermore uniform in $\rho$. As an application we obtain the leading asymptotics of the density of the time average of the geometric Brownian motion as $t\to 0$. This has the form $\mathbb{P}(\frac{1}{t} \int_0^t e^{2(B_s+\mu s)} ds \in da) \sim (2\pi t)^{-1/2} g(a,\mu) e^{-\frac{1}{t} J(a)} da/a$, with an exponent $J(a)$ which reproduces the known result obtained previously using Large Deviations theory.</description>

      <title>Estimation of bid-ask spreads in the presence of serial dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a basic model in which the dynamic of the transaction prices is a geometric Brownian motion disrupted by a microstructure white noise, corresponding to the random alternation of bids and asks, we propose moment-based estimators along with their statistical properties. We then make the model more realistic by considering serial dependence: we assume a geometric fractional Brownian motion for the price, then an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process for the microstructure noise. In these two cases of serial dependence, we propose again consistent and asymptotically normal estimators. All our estimators are compared on simulated data with existing approaches, such as Roll, Corwin-Schultz, Abdi-Ranaldo, or Ardia-Guidotti-Kroencke estimators.</description>
