      <title>Hopfield model with quasi-diagonal connection matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a Hopfield neural network with a quasi-diagonal connection matrix. We use the term "quasi-diagonal matrix" to denote a matrix with all elements equal zero except the elements on the first super- and sub-diagonals of the principle diagonal. The nonzero elements are arbitrary real numbers. Such matrix generalizes the well-known connection matrix of the one dimensional Ising model with open boundary conditions where all nonzero elements equal +1. We present a simple description of the fixed points of the Hopfield neural network and their dependence on the matrix elements. The obtained results also allow us to analyze the cases of a) the nonzero elements constitute arbitrary super- and sub-diagonals and b) periodic boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Modeling Amorphous and Amorphous Porous Palladium: A Deep Neural Network Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous and amorphous porous palladium are key materials for catalysis, hydrogen storage, and functional applications, but their complex structures present computational challenges. This study employs a deep neural network trained on 33,310 atomic configurations from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to model their interatomic potential. The AI-driven approach accurately predicts structural and thermal properties while significantly reducing computational costs. Validation against density functional theory confirms its reliability in reproducing forces, energies, and structural distributions. These findings highlight AI's potential in accelerating the study of amorphous materials and advancing their applications in energy and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.</description>

      <title>Parameter Symmetry Breaking and Restoration Determines the Hierarchical Learning in AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of learning in modern large AI systems is hierarchical, often characterized by abrupt, qualitative shifts akin to phase transitions observed in physical systems. While these phenomena hold promise for uncovering the mechanisms behind neural networks and language models, existing theories remain fragmented, addressing specific cases. In this paper, we posit that parameter symmetry breaking and restoration serve as a unifying mechanism underlying these behaviors. We synthesize prior observations and show how this mechanism explains three distinct hierarchies in neural networks: learning dynamics, model complexity, and representation formation. By connecting these hierarchies, we highlight symmetry -- a cornerstone of theoretical physics -- as a potential fundamental principle in modern AI.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes introduce probabilistic landscape models defined on high-dimensional discrete sequence spaces. The models are motivated primarily by fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology, but links to statistical physics and computer science are mentioned where appropriate. Elementary and advanced results on the structure of landscapes are described with a focus on features that are relevant to evolutionary searches, such as the number of local maxima and the existence of fitness-monotonic paths. The recent discovery of submodularity as a biologically meaningful property of fitness landscapes and its consequences for their accessibility is discussed in detail.</description>

      <title>A note on the physical interpretation of neural PDE's</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight a formal and substantial analogy between Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and discrete dynamical systems (DDS) in relaxation form. The analogy offers a transparent interpretation of the weights in terms of physical information-propagation processes and identifies the model function of the forward ML step with the local attractor of the corresponding discrete dynamics. Besides improving the explainability of current ML applications, this analogy may also facilitate the development of a new class ML algorithms with a reduced number of weights.</description>

      <title>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the spreading of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the operator growth hypothesis with questions of localization. We analytically show that an almost factorial growth of the operator norm - as recently proven for the random Ising model - is inconsistent with an exponential localization of $A$. Assuming that a quasi-local unitary $U$ exists which maps $H$ onto an effective Hamiltonian $\tilde H=UHU^\dagger=\sum_n E_n \tau^z_n +\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \tau^z_i\tau^z_j+\dots$, we show that $\tilde A=UAU^\dagger$ is a quasi-local operator which in the many-body case does not remain exponentially localized in general leading to an almost factorial norm growth. Therefore the unitary $U$ in many-body systems with maximal norm growth either does not exist and such systems are always ergodic or unusual non-ergodic phases described by $\tilde H$ do exist which violate the operator growth hypothesis and in which operators spread, implying that transport will eventually set in. We analytically and symbolically verify our results for the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models. For the XXX case, the symbolic calculations are consistent with a maximal norm growth. Furthermore, we find no indication of a weakened exponential localization of $A$, expected for strong disorder and low commutator orders if the unitary $U$ does exist. Finally, we try to perturbatively construct $U$ by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. While it is straightforward to show that this construction converges in the Anderson case, we find no indications for a convergence in the interacting case, suggesting that $U$ does not exist and that many-body localization is absent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete time crystalline phases have attracted significant theoretical and experimental attention in the last few years. Such systems require a seemingly impossible combination of nonadiabatic driving and a finite-entropy long-time state, which, surprisingly, is possible in nonergodic systems. Previous works have often relied on disorder for the required nonergodicity; here, we describe the construction of a discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in nondisordered, nonintegrable Ising-type systems. After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time?
  This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.</description>

      <title>Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.</description>

Abstract: Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. We present concise, non-replica derivations of key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Using a cavity approach, we analyze high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points and manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Swift discovery of spin-crossover materials for their potential application in quantum information devices requires techniques which enable efficient identification of suitably bistable candidates. To this end, we screened the Cambridge Structural Database to develop a specialized database of 1,439 materials and computed spin-switching energies from density functional theory for each material. The database was used to train an equivariant graph convolutional neural network to predict the magnitude of the spin-conversion energy. A test mean absolute error was 360 meV. For candidate identification, we equipped the system with a relevance-based classifier. This approach leads to a nearly four-fold improvement in identifying potential spin-crossover systems of interest as compared to conventional high-throughput screening.</description>

      <title>Inferring High-Order Couplings with Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, based on the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, are essential for modeling interactions between pairs of variables in data-driven problems across disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their considerable success, these methods typically fail to capture higher-order interactions that are often essential for understanding complex systems. Conversely, modern machine learning methods capture these complex interactions, but the computational cost of interpretable frameworks makes them impractical for real-world applications. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient way to capture statistical correlations using hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. In this study, we introduce a new method that maps RBMs to generalized Potts models, allowing for the extraction of interactions up to any specified order. This method utilizes large-$N$ approximations, enabled by the RBM's simple structure, to extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. Furthermore, we propose a robust framework for extracting higher-order interactions in more complex probabilistic models and a simple gauge-fixing method within the effective many-body Potts model. Our validation on synthetic datasets confirms the method's ability to recover two- and three-body interactions accurately. When applied to protein sequence data, the framework competently reconstructs protein contact maps and provides performance comparable to the best inverse Potts models. These findings confirm that RBMs are an effective and streamlined tool for exploring higher-order interactions within complex systems.</description>

      <title>Soil creep facilitated by cyclic variations of environmental conditions</title>

Abstract: Sloped terrains tend to creep downward over time, even when their slope is below the nominal angle of repose. This behavior can result from periodic variations in environmental conditions, such as daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. We study this process by considering a model of an athermal yield stress material under an applied stress lower than the critical yield stress value $\sigma_c$. Normally, in such a situation the material does not flow at all. However, under cyclic temporal variation of system parameters a finite amount of irreversible deformation can remain after each cycle, and a long term steady-state flow of the whole system can be induced. In our model, we cycle the strength of internal elastic interactions to mimic the effect of cyclic variation of environmental conditions in the real soils. We find that the amount of deformation per cycle increases if $\sigma_c$ is approached from below, and it decreases and even vanishes at a novel critical stress $\sigma_0&lt;\sigma_c$ when this, in turn, is reached from above. Interestingly, $\sigma_0$ plays a role similar to the endurance limit in the context of fatigue damage propagation. Despite the model's simplicity, our results offer a fresh perspective on subcritical landform evolution, with implications for the creep of hill slopes over long periods and the precursors to runaway landslides.</description>

Abstract: We show that classical DNA unzipping transition which is equivalently described by quantum mechanical localization-delocalization transition in the ground state of non-Hermitian single impurity Hatano-Nelson Hamiltonian is underpinned by generalized parity ({\bf P})-time reversal ({\bf T}) symmetry breaking transition. We also study the one-dimensional discretized version of Hatano-Nelson model in the presence of the single impurity and random disorder on a finite-size lattice. These discrete models are useful to study unzipping of a single adsorbed polymer from a surface. Our results show that the discrete models also undergo a phase transition from a PT unbroken phase to a broken phase. Interestingly, the generalized PT phase transition points coincide with the localization-delocalization transition for continuum as well as lattice models.</description>

      <title>KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19756v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.</description>

      <title>Cascade of phase transitions in the training of Energy-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14689v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Randomness and Gapped Itinerant Carriers in a Frustrated Quantum Magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a state manifesting extraordinary many-body entanglement, and the material NaYbSe$_2$ is thought to be one of the most promising candidates for its realization. Through low-temperature heat capacity and thermal conductivity measurements we identify an apparent contradiction familiar to many QSL candidates: while entropy is stored by apparently gapless excitations, the itinerant carriers of entropy are gapped. By studying the compositional series NaYb$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ across a percolation transition of the magnetic lattice, we suggest that this contradiction can be resolved by the presence of entanglement scales of random sizes. Moreover, as we truncate the scale of entanglement by magnetic dilution, we show that the itinerant magnetic entropy carrier in NaYb$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ is not the result of long-range entanglement but rather depends on the propagation of the simplest entangled object of all: the spin dimer.</description>

      <title>Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>

Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we explore how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is initially broken and subsequently restored, whereas in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, consistent with the principles of quantum thermalization. Notably, the growth of entanglement asymmetry exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts, contrasting with the behavior of charge variance. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry can increase and decrease, while quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.</description>
