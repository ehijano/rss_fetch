      <title>An Open-Ended Approach to Understanding Local, Emergent Conservation Laws in Biological Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While fields like Artificial Life have made huge strides in quantifying the mechanisms that distinguish living systems from non-living ones, particular mechanisms remain difficult to reproduce in silico. Known as open-endedness, we've been successful in finding mechanisms that generate new states, but have been less successful in finding mechanisms that generate new rules. Here, we weigh whether or not analyzing the effects of internal and external system constraints on a system's dynamics would be a fruitful avenue to understanding open-endedness. We discuss the connection between physical constraints and the ways that the system can physically reach possible states while those constraints are present. It seems that the physical constraints that define biological objects (and dynamics) are maintained by dynamics that occur from within the system. This is in opposition to current modeling approaches where system constraints are maintained externally. We suggest that constraints can be characterized as variables whose values are either completely conserved, quasi-conserved, or conditionally conserved. Regardless of whether or not a constrained variable is a part of the biological object or present in the object's environment, we discuss how the accessible system states under that constraint can lead to local, emergent conservation laws (rules), with examples. Finally, we discuss the possible benefits of formally understanding how system constraints that emerge from within a system lead to system dynamics that can be characterized as new, emergent rules -- particularly for artificial intelligence, hybrid life, embodiment, astrobiology, and more. Understanding how new, local rules might emerge from within the system is crucial for understanding how open-ended systems continually discover new update rules, in addition to continually discovering new states.</description>

      <title>The Radical Pair Mechanism Cannot Explain Telecommunication Frequency Effects on Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to investigate whether the radical pair mechanism (RPM) can explain the effects of telecommunication frequency radiation on reactive oxygen species production, we modelled the effects of oscillating magnetic fields on radical pair systems. Our analysis indicates that the RPM cannot account for the biological effects observed under exposure to telecommunication frequencies due to negligible effects under low-amplitude conditions used in experimental setups. Observable effects on radical pairs at these frequencies would require hyperfine coupling constants that are precisely fine-tuned to large values that far exceed those naturally occurring within biological systems. We conclude that some other mechanism must be responsible for the effects of telecommunication frequency fields in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws for a Generic Swimmer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a minimal model of a swimmer without body deformation based on force and torque dipoles which allows accurate 3D Navier-Stokes calculations. Our model can reproduce swimmer propulsion for a large range of Reynolds numbers, and generate wake vortices in the inertial regime, reminiscent of the flow generated by the flapping tails of real fish. We performed a numerical exploration of the model from low to high Reynolds numbers and obtained universal laws using scaling arguments. We collected data from a wide variety of micro-organisms, thereby extending the experimental data presented in (M. Gazzola et al., Nature Physics 10, 758, 2014). Our theoretical scaling laws compare very well with experimental data across the different regimes, from Stokes to turbulent flows. We believe that this model, due to its relatively simple design, will be very useful for obtaining numerical simulations of collective effects within fish schools composed of hundreds of individuals.</description>

      <title>Collapse of active nematic order through a two-stage dynamic transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel two-stage transition of the ordered active nematic state of a system of bundled microtubules into a biphasic active fluid. Specifically, we show that upon light-induced solidification of the underlying medium, microtubule-kinesin motor mixtures first undergo a cascade of folding in on themselves, which is then followed by a progressive formation of isotropic fluid domains, transforming the system into a biphasic active suspension. Using an active lyotropic model, we show that the two-stage transition in the system is governed by screening effects that become important upon substrate changes, leading to higher activity modes to become important. Specifically, the combined effect of friction and quadrupolar activity leads to the hierarchical folding that follows the intrinsic bend instability. Our results demonstrate the dynamics of the collapse of orientational order in active nematics and present a new route for controlling active matter by modifying the activity through changing the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>A network aggregation model for the dynamics and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases at the brain scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with the assembly of specific proteins into oligomers and fibrillar aggregates. At the brain scale, these protein assemblies can diffuse through the brain and seed other regions, creating an autocatalytic protein progression. The growth and transport of these assemblies depend on various mechanisms that can be targeted therapeutically. Here, we use spatially-extended nucleation-aggregation-fragmentation models for the dynamics of prion-like neurodegenerative protein-spreading in the brain to study the effect of different drugs on whole-brain Alzheimer's disease progression.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions drive capillary waves in active liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active liquid crystals exert nonequilibrium stresses on their surroundings through constant consumption of energy, giving rise to dynamical steady states not present in equilibrium. The paradigmatic example of an active liquid crystal is a suspension of microtubule bundles powered by kinesin motor proteins, which exhibits self-sustained spatiotemporal chaotic flows. This system has been modelled using continuum theories that couple the microtubule orientation to active flows. Recently the focus has shifted to the interfacial properties of mixtures of active liquid crystals and passive fluids. Active/passive interfaces have been shown to support propagating capillary waves in the absence of inertia and offer a promising route for relating experimental parameters to those of the continuum theory. In this paper we report the derivation of a minimal model that captures the linear dynamics of the interface between an active liquid crystal and a passive fluid. We show that the dynamics of the interface, although powered by active flows throughout the bulk, is qualitatively captured by equations that couple non-reciprocally interface height and nematic director at the interface. This minimal model reproduces the dynamical structure factor evaluated from numerical simulations and the qualitative form of the wave dispersion relation seen in experiments.</description>

      <title>A Unified Intracellular pH Landscape with SITE-pHorin: a Quantum-Entanglement-Enhanced pH Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An accurate map of intracellular organelle pH is crucial for comprehending cellular metabolism and organellar functions. However, a unified intracellular pH spectrum using a single probe is still lack. Here, we developed a novel quantum entanglement-enhanced pH-sensitive probe called SITE-pHorin, which featured a wide pH-sensitive range and ratiometric quantitative measurement capabilities. Subsequently, we measured the pH of various organelles and their sub-compartments, including mitochondrial sub-spaces, Golgi stacks, endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and endosomes in COS-7 cells. For the long-standing debate on mitochondrial compartments pH, we measured the pH of mitochondrial cristae as 6.60 \pm 0.40, the pH of mitochondrial intermembrane space as 6.95 \pm 0.30, and two populations of mitochondrial matrix pH at approximately 7.20 \pm 0.27 and 7.50 \pm 0.16, respectively. Notably, the lysosome pH exhibited a single, narrow Gaussian distribution centered at 4.79 \pm 0.17. Furthermore, quantum chemistry computations revealed that both the deprotonation of the residue Y182 and the discrete curvature of deformed benzene ring in chromophore are both necessary for the quantum entanglement mechanism of SITE-pHorin. Intriguingly, our findings reveal an accurate pH gradient (0.6-0.9 pH unit) between mitochondrial cristae and matrix, suggesting prior knowledge about \Delta pH (0.4-0.6) and mitochondrial proton motive force (pmf) are underestimated.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric fluctuations and self-folding of active interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the structure and dynamics of the interface separating a passive fluid from a microtubule-based active fluid. Turbulent-like active flows power giant interfacial fluctuations, which exhibit pronounced asymmetry between regions of positive and negative curvature. Experiments, numerical simulations, and theoretical arguments reveal how the interface breaks up the spatial symmetry of the fundamental bend instability to generate local vortical flows that lead to asymmetric interface fluctuations. The magnitude of interface deformations increases with activity: In the high activity limit, the interface self-folds invaginating passive droplets and generating a foam-like phase, where active fluid is perforated with passive droplets. These results demonstrate how active stresses control the structure, dynamics, and break-up of soft, deformable, and reconfigurable liquid-liquid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Empowering AlphaFold2 for protein conformation selective drug discovery with AlphaFold2-RAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Small molecule drug design hinges on obtaining co-crystallized ligand-protein structures. Despite AlphaFold2's strides in protein native structure prediction, its focus on apo structures overlooks ligands and associated holo structures. Moreover, designing selective drugs often benefits from the targeting of diverse metastable conformations. Therefore, direct application of AlphaFold2 models in virtual screening and drug discovery remains tentative. Here, we demonstrate an AlphaFold2 based framework combined with all-atom enhanced sampling molecular dynamics and induced fit docking, named AF2RAVE-Glide, to conduct computational model based small molecule binding of metastable protein kinase conformations, initiated from protein sequences. We demonstrate the AF2RAVE-Glide workflow on three different protein kinases and their type I and II inhibitors, with special emphasis on binding of known type II kinase inhibitors which target the metastable classical DFG-out state. These states are not easy to sample from AlphaFold2. Here we demonstrate how with AF2RAVE these metastable conformations can be sampled for different kinases with high enough accuracy to enable subsequent docking of known type II kinase inhibitors with more than 50% success rates across docking calculations. We believe the protocol should be deployable for other kinases and more proteins generally.</description>

      <title>Navigating the nexus: a perspective of centrosome -cytoskeleton interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A structural relationship between the centrosome and cytoskeleton has been recognized for many years. Centrosomes typically reside near the nucleus, establishing and maintaining the nucleus-centrosome axis. This spatial arrangement is critical for determining cell polarity during interphase and ensuring the proper assembly of the spindle apparatus during mitosis. Centrosomes also engage in physical interactions with various components of the cytoskeleton, balancing internal cellular architecture and polarity in a manner specific to tissue type and developmental stage. Numerous crosslinking proteins facilitate these interactions, promoting both cytoskeletal and centrosomal nucleation. This article provides an overview of how cytoskeletal elements and centrosomes coordinate their actions to regulate complex cellular functions such as cell migration, adhesion, and division. The reciprocal influence between cytoskeletal dynamics and centrosomal positioning underscores their integral roles in cellular organization and function.</description>

      <title>LinearAlifold: Linear-Time Consensus Structure Prediction for RNA Alignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the consensus structure of a set of aligned RNA homologs is a convenient method to find conserved structures in an RNA genome, which has many applications including viral diagnostics and therapeutics. However, the most commonly used tool for this task, RNAalifold, is prohibitively slow for long sequences, due to a cubic scaling with the sequence length, taking over a day on 400 SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-related genomes (~30,000nt). We present LinearAlifold, a much faster alternative that scales linearly with both the sequence length and the number of sequences, based on our work LinearFold that folds a single RNA in linear time. Our work is orders of magnitude faster than RNAalifold (0.7 hours on the above 400 genomes, or ~36$\times$ speedup) and achieves higher accuracies when compared to a database of known structures. More interestingly, LinearAlifold's prediction on SARS-CoV-2 correlates well with experimentally determined structures, substantially outperforming RNAalifold. Finally, LinearAlifold supports two energy models (Vienna and BL*) and four modes: minimum free energy (MFE), maximum expected accuracy (MEA), ThreshKnot, and stochastic sampling, each of which takes under an hour for hundreds of SARS-CoV variants. Our resource is at: https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearAlifold (code) and http://linearfold.org/linear-alifold (server).</description>

      <title>Symmetry's Edge in Cortical Dynamics: Multiscale Dynamics of Ensemble Excitation and Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating a quantitative theory for the cortex poses several challenges and raises numerous questions. For instance, what are the significant scales of the system? Are they micro, meso or macroscopic? What are the relevant interactions? Are they pairwise, higher order or mean-field? And what are the control parameters? Are they noisy, dissipative or emergent?
  To tackle these issues, we suggest using an approach akin to what has transformed our understanding of the state of matter. This includes identifying invariances in the ensemble dynamics of various neuron functional classes, searching for order parameters that connect important degrees of freedom and distinguish macroscopic system states, and identifying broken symmetries in the order parameter space to comprehend the emerging laws when many neurons interact and coordinate their activation.
  By utilizing multielectrode and multiscale neural recordings, we measure the scale-invariant balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons at a population level, referred to as ensemble E/I balance. This differs from the input E/I balance typically studied at the single-neuron level, focusing instead on the collective behavior of large neural populations. We investigate a set of parameters that can assist us in differentiating between various functional system states (such as the wake/sleep cycle) and pinpointing broken symmetries that serve different information processing and memory functions. Furthermore, we identify broken symmetries that result in pathological states like seizures.
  This study provides new insights into the multiscale dynamics of excitation and inhibition in cortical networks, advancing our understanding of the underlying principles governing neural computation and dysfunction.</description>

      <title>Deciphering circulating tumor cells binding in a microfluidic system thanks to a parameterized mathematical model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of metastases is a crucial process in which some questions remain unanswered. In this work, we focus on tumor cells circulating in the bloodstream, the so-called Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs). Our aim is to characterize their trajectories under the influence of hemodynamic and adhesion forces. We focus on already available in vitro measurements performed with a microfluidic device corresponding to the trajectories of CTCs -- without or with different protein depletions -- interacting with an endothelial layer. A key difficulty is the weak knowledge of the fluid velocity that has to be reconstructed. Our strategy combines a differential equation model -- a Poiseuille model for the fluid velocity and an ODE system for the cell adhesion model -- and a robust and well-designed calibration procedure. The parameterized model quantifies the strong influence of fluid velocity on adhesion and confirms the expected role of several proteins in the deceleration of CTCs. Finally, it enables the generation of synthetic cells, even for unobserved experimental conditions, opening the way to a digital twin for flowing cells with adhesion.</description>
