      <title>Feedback Stabilizability of a generalized Burgers-Huxley equation with kernel around a non-constant steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate a generalized Burgers-Huxley equation with a smooth kernel defined in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in\{1,2,3\}$, focusing on feedback stabilizability around a non-constant steady state. Initially, employing the Banach fixed point theorem, we establish the local existence and uniqueness of a strong solution, which is subsequently extended globally using an energy estimate. To analyze stabilizability, we linearize the model around a non-constant steady state and examine the stabilizability of the principal system. For the principal system, we develop a feedback control operator by solving an appropriate algebraic Riccati equation. This allows for the construction of both finite and infinite-dimensional feedback operators. By applying this feedback operator and establishing necessary regularity results, we utilize the Banach fixed point theorem to demonstrate the stabilizability of the entire system. Furthermore, we also explore the stabilizability of the model problem around the zero steady state and validate our findings through numerical simulations using the finite element method for both zero and non-constant steady states.</description>

      <title>Differential Evolution for Grassmann Manifold Optimization: A Projection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel evolutionary algorithm for optimizing real-valued objective functions defined on the Grassmann manifold Gr}(k,n), the space of all k-dimensional linear subspaces of R^n. While existing optimization techniques on Gr}(k,n) predominantly rely on first- or second-order Riemannian methods, these inherently local methods often struggle with nonconvex or multimodal landscapes. To address this limitation, we adapt the Differential Evolution algorithm - a global, population based optimization method - to operate effectively on the Grassmannian. Our approach incorporates adaptive control parameter schemes, and introduces a projection mechanism that maps trial vectors onto the manifold via QR decomposition. The resulting algorithm maintains feasibility with respect to the manifold structure while enabling exploration beyond local neighborhoods. This framework provides a flexible and geometry-aware alternative to classical Riemannian optimization methods and is well-suited to applications in machine learning, signal processing, and low-rank matrix recovery where subspace representations play a central role. We test the methodology on a number of examples of optimization problems on Grassmann manifolds.</description>

      <title>On Opial's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opial's Lemma is a fundamental result in the convergence analysis of sequences generated by optimization algorithms in real Hilbert spaces. We introduce the concept of Opial sequences - sequences for which the limit of the distance to each point in a given set exists. We systematically derive properties of Opial sequences, contrasting them with the well-studied Fej\'er monotone sequences, and establish conditions for weak and strong convergence. Key results include characterizations of weak convergence via weak cluster points (reaffirming Opial's Lemma), strong convergence via strong cluster points, and the behavior of projections onto Opial sets in terms of asymptotic centers. Special cases and examples are provided to highlight the subtle differences in convergence behaviour and projection properties compared to the Fej\'er monotone case.</description>

      <title>Scheduling problem of aircrafts on a same runway and dual runways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the scheduling problems of landing and takeoff aircrafts on a same runway and dual runways are addressed. In contrast to the approaches based on mixed integer optimization models in existing works, our approach focuses on the minimum separation times between aircrafts by introducing some necessary assumptions. A dynamic programming algorithm is proposed and numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Newton-PIPG: A Fast Hybrid Algorithm for Quadratic Programs in Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Newton-PIPG, an efficient method for solving quadratic programming (QP) problems arising in optimal control, subject to additional set constraints. Newton-PIPG integrates the Proportional-Integral Projected Gradient (PIPG) method with the Newton method, thereby achieving both global convergence and local quadratic convergence. The PIPG method, an operator-splitting algorithm, seeks a fixed point of the PIPG operator. Under mild assumptions, we demonstrate that this operator is locally smooth, enabling the application of the Newton method to solve the corresponding nonlinear fixed-point equation. Furthermore, we prove that the linear system associated with the Newton method is locally nonsingular under strict complementarity conditions. To enhance efficiency, we design a specialized matrix factorization technique that leverages the typical sparsity of optimal control problems in such systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that Newton-PIPG achieves high accuracy and reduces computation time, particularly when feasibility is easily guaranteed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on establishing the foundational paradigm of a novel optimization theory based on convolution with convex kernels. Our goal is to devise a morally deterministic model of locating the global optima of an arbitrary function, which is distinguished from most commonly used statistical models. Limited preliminary numerical results are provided to test the efficiency of some specific algorithms derived from our paradigm, which we hope to stimulate further practical interest.</description>

      <title>Diffusion at Absolute Zero: Langevin Sampling using Successive Moreau Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for sampling from Gibbs distributions of the form $\pi(x)\propto\exp(-U(x))$ by considering a family $(\pi^{t})_t$ of approximations of the target density which is such that $\pi^{t}$ exhibits favorable properties for sampling when $t$ is large, and $\pi^{t} \to \pi$ as $t \to 0$. This sequence is obtained by replacing (parts of) the potential $U$ by its \MoreauName{} envelope. Through the sequential sampling from $\pi^{t}$ for decreasing values of $t$ by a Langevin algorithm with appropriate step size, the samples are guided from a simple starting density to the more complex target quickly. We prove the ergodicity of the method as well as its convergence to the target density without assuming convexity or differentiability of the potential $U$. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we show experimental results that support the superiority of the method in terms of convergence speed and mode-coverage of multi-modal densities to current algorithms. The experiments range from one-dimensional toy-problems to high-dimensional inverse imaging problems with learned potentials.</description>

      <title>Valid Cuts for the Design of Potential-based Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of a cost minimal network for flows obeying physical laws is an important problem for the design of electricity, water, hydrogen, and natural gas infrastructures. We formulate this problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program with potential-based flows. The non-convexity of the constraints stemming from the potential-based flow model together with the binary variables indicating the decision to build a connection make these programs challenging to solve. We develop a novel class of valid inequalities on the fractional relaxations of the binary variables. Further, we show that this class of inequalities can be separated in polynomial time for solutions to a fractional relaxation. This makes it possible to incorporate these inequalities into a branch-and-cut framework. The advantage of these inequalities is lastly demonstrated in a computational study on the design of real-world gas transport networks.</description>

      <title>Approximating Dispatchable Regions in Three-Phase Radial Networks with Conditions for Exact SDP Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of dispatchable region plays a pivotal role in quantifying the capacity of power systems to accommodate renewable generation. In this paper, we extend the previous approximations of the dispatchable regions on direct current (DC), linearized, and nonlinear single-phase alternating current (AC) models to unbalanced three-phase radial (tree) networks and provide improved outer and inner approximations of dispatchable regions. Based on the nonlinear bus injection model (BIM), we relax the non-convex problem that defines the dispatchable region to a solvable semidefinite program (SDP) and derive its strong dual problem (which is also an SDP). Utilizing the special mathematical structure of the dual problem, an SDP-based projection algorithm is developed to construct a convex polytopic outer approximation to the SDP-relaxed dispatchable region. Moreover, we provide sufficient conditions to guarantee the exact SDP relaxation by adding the power loss as a penalty term, thereby providing a theoretical guarantee for determining an inner approximation of the dispatchable region. Through numerical simulations, we validate the accuracy of our approximation of the dispatchable region and verify the conditions for exact SDP relaxation.</description>

      <title>Distributed Constrained Online Nonconvex Optimization with Compressed Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents. For a time-varying graph, we propose a distributed online primal-dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources. We show that the proposed algorithm establishes an $\mathcal{O}( {{T^{\max \{ {1 - {\theta_1},{\theta_1}} \}}}} )$ network regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}( {T^{1 - {\theta_1}/2}} )$ network cumulative constraint violation bound, where $T$ is the number of iterations and ${\theta_1} \in ( {0,1} )$ is a user-defined trade-off parameter. When Slater's condition holds (i.e, there is a point that strictly satisfies the inequality constraints at all iterations), the network cumulative constraint violation bound is reduced to $\mathcal{O}( {T^{1 - {\theta_1}}} )$. These bounds are comparable to the state-of-the-art results established by existing distributed online algorithms with perfect communication for distributed online convex optimization with (time-varying) inequality constraints. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Polynomial stability of wind turbine tower models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stabilization of mathematical models describing the structural dynamics of monopile wind turbine towers. In the fore-aft plane, we show that the system becomes polynomially stable with an energy decay rate of $t^{-1}$ under static output feedback that relies on the velocity and/or angular velocity of the nacelle. Additionally, we prove that a tuned mass damper (TMD) in the nacelle ensures polynomial stability with the same energy decay rate, offering a viable alternative to active control. For the side-to-side plane, we analyze a model incorporating a hydraulic power transmission system and prove that feedback from the nacelle's angular velocity and the generator load torque leads to polynomial stability of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of sparsity-enforcing regularisation for linear inverse problems, we consider the minimisation of a square-root Lasso cost function. We show that a simple modification of the Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) for the Lasso problem leads to a minimiser of this cost function and we investigate the convergence properties of this algorithm. We also consider the group square-root Lasso, where sparsity is enforced for groups of variables instead of individual ones.</description>

      <title>Approximate stationarity in disjunctive optimization: concepts, qualification conditions, and application to MPCCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with stationarity conditions and qualification conditions for optimization problems with disjunctive constraints. This class covers, among others, optimization problems with complementarity, vanishing, or switching constraints which are notoriously challenging due to their highly combinatorial structure. The focus of our study is twofold. First, we investigate approximate stationarity conditions and the associated strict constraint qualifications which can be used to infer stationarity of local minimizers. While such concepts are already known in the context of so-called Mordukhovich-stationarity, we introduce suitable extensions associated with strong stationarity. Second, a qualification condition is established which, based on an approximately Mordukhovich- or strongly stationary point, can be used to infer its Mordukhovich- or strong stationarity, respectively. In contrast to the aforementioned strict constraint qualifications, this condition depends on the involved sequences justifying approximate stationarity and, thus, is not a constraint qualification in the narrower sense. However, it is much easier to verify as it merely requires to check the (positive) linear independence of a certain family of gradients. In fact, it provides a characterization of stationarity and, thus, is weaker than these strict constraint qualifications. In order to illustrate the obtained findings, they are applied to optimization problems with complementarity constraints where they can be naturally extended to the well-known concepts of weak and Clarke-stationarity.</description>

      <title>CAMmary: A Review of Spacecraft Collision Avoidance Manoeuvre Design Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring safety for spacecraft operations has become a paramount concern due to the proliferation of space debris and the saturation of valuable orbital regimes. In this regard, the Collision Avoidance Manoeuvre (CAM) has emerged as a critical requirement for spacecraft operators, aiming to efficiently navigate through potentially hazardous encounters. Currently, when a conjunction is predicted, operators dedicate a considerable amount of time and resources to designing a CAM. Given the increased frequency of conjunctions, autonomous computation of fuel-efficient CAMs is crucial to reduce costs and improve the performance of future operations. To facilitate the transition to an autonomous CAM design, it is useful to provide an overview of its state-of-the-art. In this survey article, a collection of the most relevant research contributions in the field is presented. We review and categorize existing CAM techniques based on their underlying principles, such as (i) analytic, semi-analytic, or numerical solutions; (ii) impulsive or continuous thrust; (iii) deterministic or stochastic approaches, (iv) free or fixed manoeuvring time; (v) free or fixed thrust direction. Finally, to determine the validity of the algorithms potentially implementable for autonomous use, we perform a numerical comparison on a large set of conjunctions. With this analysis, the algorithms are evaluated in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, and optimality of the computed policy. Through this comprehensive survey, we aim to provide insights into the state-of-the-art CAM methodologies, identify gaps in current research, and outline potential directions for future developments in ensuring the safety and sustainability of spacecraft operations in increasingly congested orbital environments.</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Analysis of Decoupled Policies for Multi-Location Inventory Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The difference in performance between centralized and decentralized control strategies crucially informs design choices in real-world control systems. Although computing and executing centralized control algorithms is often more costly than decentralized methods, their performance enhancements may far outweigh these costs. In this work, we study the value of centralization within the context of the well-known inventory control problem, where a planner seeks to identify optimal inventory levels that meet stochastic demand while minimizing ordering costs, holding costs, and shortage costs. We consider multilocation systems in which the inventories are coupled through a single ordering channel and the associated ordering cost function belongs to one of two classes of nonlinear cost functions that often arise in practical settings. For each of these classes, we derive constant-factor competitive ratios between the optimal coupled and decoupled policies and show they are almost tight. We then demonstrate that online algorithms also achieve tight competitive ratios for this problem. We conclude with numerical simulations that validate these results.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear Model Reduction to Spectral Submanifolds via Oblique Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics in a primary Spectral Submanifold (SSM) constructed over the slowest modes of a dynamical system provide an ideal reduced-order model for nearby trajectories. Modeling the dynamics of trajectories further away from the primary SSM, however, is difficult if the linear part of the system exhibits strong non-normal behavior. Such non-normality implies that simply projecting trajectories onto SSMs along directions normal to the slow linear modes will not pair those trajectories correctly with their reduced counterparts on the SSMs. In principle, a well-defined nonlinear projection along a stable invariant foliation exists and would exactly match the full dynamics to the SSM-reduced dynamics. This foliation, however, cannot realistically be constructed from practically feasible amounts and distributions of experimental data. Here we develop an oblique projection technique that is able to approximate this foliation efficiently, even from a single experimental trajectory of a significantly non-normal and nonlinear beam.</description>

      <title>Towards explainable data-driven predictive control with regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven predictive control (DPC), using linear combinations of recorded trajectory data, has recently emerged as a popular alternative to traditional model predictive control (MPC). Without an explicitly enforced prediction model, the effects of commonly used regularization terms (and the resulting predictions) can be opaque. This opacity may lead to practical challenges, such as reliance on empirical tuning of regularization parameters based on closed-loop performance, and potentially misleading heuristic interpretations of norm-based regularizations. However, by examining the structure of the underlying optimal control problem (OCP), more precise and insightful interpretations of regularization effects can be derived. In this paper, we demonstrate how to analyze the predictive behavior of DPC through implicit predictors and the trajectory-specific effects of quadratic regularization. We further extend these results to cover typical DPC modifications, including DPC for affine systems, offset regularizations, slack variables, and terminal constraints. Additionally, we provide a simple but general result on (recursive) feasibility in DPC. This work aims to enhance the explainability and reliability of DPC by providing a deeper understanding of these regularization mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inferential Motion Planning Using Heavy-Tailed Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots rely on motion planning to navigate safely and efficiently while performing various tasks. In this paper, we investigate motion planning through Bayesian inference, where motion plans are inferred based on planning objectives and constraints. However, existing Bayesian motion planning methods often struggle to explore low-probability regions of the planning space, where high-quality plans may reside. To address this limitation, we propose the use of heavy-tailed distributions -- specifically, Student's-$t$ distributions -- to enhance probabilistic inferential search for motion plans. We develop a novel sequential single-pass smoothing approach that integrates Student's-$t$ distribution with Monte Carlo sampling. A special case of this approach is ensemble Kalman smoothing, which depends on short-tailed Gaussian distributions. We validate the proposed approach through simulations in autonomous vehicle motion planning, demonstrating its superior performance in planning, sampling efficiency, and constraint satisfaction compared to ensemble Kalman smoothing. While focused on motion planning, this work points to the broader potential of heavy-tailed distributions in enhancing probabilistic decision-making in robotics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of On-policy Policy Gradient Methods under the Distribution Mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policy gradient methods are one of the most successful methods for solving challenging reinforcement learning problems. However, despite their empirical successes, many SOTA policy gradient algorithms for discounted problems deviate from the theoretical policy gradient theorem due to the existence of a distribution mismatch. In this work, we analyze the impact of this mismatch on the policy gradient methods. Specifically, we first show that in the case of tabular parameterizations, the methods under the mismatch remain globally optimal. Then, we extend this analysis to more general parameterizations by leveraging the theory of biased stochastic gradient descent. Our findings offer new insights into the robustness of policy gradient methods as well as the gap between theoretical foundations and practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective robust controller synthesis with integral quadratic constraints in discrete-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel framework for the robust controller synthesis problem in discrete-time systems using dynamic Integral Quadratic Constraints (IQCs). We present an algorithm to minimize closed-loop performance measures such as the $\mathcal H_\infty$-norm, the energy-to-peak gain, the peak-to-peak gain, or a multi-objective mix thereof. While IQCs provide a powerful tool for modeling structured uncertainties and nonlinearities, existing synthesis methods are limited to the $\mathcal H_\infty$-norm, continuous-time systems, or special system structures. By minimizing the energy-to-peak and peak-to-peak gain, the proposed synthesis can be utilized to bound the peak of the output, which is crucial in many applications requiring robust constraint satisfaction, input-to-state stability, reachability analysis, or other pointwise-in-time bounds. Numerical examples demonstrate the robustness and performance of the controllers synthesized with the proposed algorithm.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to the exponential stability for one-dimensional linear wave equations with in-domain localized damping and several types of Wentzell (or dynamic) boundary conditions. In a quite general boundary setting, we establish the exponential decay of solutions towards the corresponding steady states. The results are obtained either by the multiplier method or spectral analysis in an $L^2$-functional framework, and then with input-to-state technics in an $L^p$-functional framework for $p \in (2,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Almost Bayesian: The Fractal Dynamics of Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the behavior of stochastic gradient descent is related to Bayesian statistics by showing that SGD is effectively diffusion on a fractal landscape, where the fractal dimension can be accounted for in a purely Bayesian way. By doing this we show that SGD can be regarded as a modified Bayesian sampler which accounts for accessibility constraints induced by the fractal structure of the loss landscape. We verify our results experimentally by examining the diffusion of weights during training. These results offer insight into the factors which determine the learning process, and seemingly answer the question of how SGD and purely Bayesian sampling are related.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Reward for Liquidity Providers in Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find the equilibrium contract that an automated market maker (AMM) offers to their strategic liquidity providers (LPs) in order to maximize the order flow that gets processed by the venue. Our model is formulated as a leader-follower stochastic game, where the venue is the leader and a representative LP is the follower. We derive approximate closed-form equilibrium solutions to the stochastic game and analyze the reward structure. Our findings suggest that under the equilibrium contract, LPs have incentives to add liquidity to the pool only when higher liquidity on average attracts more noise trading. The equilibrium contract depends on the external price, the pool reference price, and the pool reserves. Our framework offers insights into AMM design for maximizing order flow while ensuring LP profitability.</description>

      <title>Tropical Bisectors and Carlini-Wagner Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pasque et al. showed that using a tropical symmetric metric as an activation function in the last layer can improve the robustness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against state-of-the-art attacks, including the Carlini-Wagner attack. This improvement occurs when the attacks are not specifically adapted to the non-differentiability of the tropical layer. Moreover, they showed that the decision boundary of a tropical CNN is defined by tropical bisectors. In this paper, we explore the combinatorics of tropical bisectors and analyze how the tropical embedding layer enhances robustness against Carlini-Wagner attacks. We prove an upper bound on the number of linear segments the decision boundary of a tropical CNN can have. We then propose a refined version of the Carlini-Wagner attack, specifically tailored for the tropical architecture. Computational experiments with MNIST and LeNet5 showcase our attacks improved success rate.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this survey is to serve both as a gentle introduction and a coherent overview of state-of-the-art Frank--Wolfe algorithms, also called conditional gradient algorithms, for function minimization. These algorithms are especially useful in convex optimization when linear optimization is cheaper than projections.
  The selection of the material has been guided by the principle of highlighting crucial ideas as well as presenting new approaches that we believe might become important in the future, with ample citations even of old works imperative in the development of newer methods. Yet, our selection is sometimes biased, and need not reflect consensus of the research community, and we have certainly missed recent important contributions. After all the research area of Frank--Wolfe is very active, making it a moving target. We apologize sincerely in advance for any such distortions and we fully acknowledge: We stand on the shoulder of giants.</description>

      <title>Uncomputability of Global Optima for Nonconvex Functions in the Oracle Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While it is well known that finding approximate optima of non-convex functions is computationally intractable, we show that the problem is, in fact, uncomputable in the oracle model. Specifically, we prove that no algorithm with access only to a function oracle can compute the global minimum or even an $\epsilon$-approximation of the minimizer or minimal value. We then characterize a necessary and sufficient condition under which global optima become computable, based on the existence of a computable predicate that subsumes the global optimality condition. As an illustrative example, we consider the basin of attraction around a global minimizer as such a property and propose a simple algorithm that converges to the global minimum when a bound on the basin is known. Finally, we provide numerical experiments on standard benchmark functions to demonstrate the algorithm's practical performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with a class of neural SDEs and studies the limiting behavior of the associated sampled optimal control problems as the sample size grows to infinity. The neural SDEs with N samples can be linked to the N-particle systems with centralized control. We analyze the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation corresponding to the N-particle system and establish regularity results which are uniform in N. The uniform regularity estimates are obtained by the stochastic maximum principle and the analysis of a backward stochastic Riccati equation. Using these uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the minima of objective functionals and optimal parameters of the neural SDEs as the sample size N tends to infinity. The limiting objects can be identified with suitable functions defined on the Wasserstein space of Borel probability measures. Furthermore, quantitative algebraic convergence rates are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Single-loop Projection-free and Projected Gradient-based Algorithms for Nonconvex-concave Saddle Point Problems with Bilevel Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a broad class of constrained saddle point problems with a bilevel structure, wherein the upper-level objective function is nonconvex-concave and smooth over compact and convex constraint sets, subject to a strongly convex lower-level objective function. This class of problems finds wide applicability in machine learning, encompassing robust multi-task learning, adversarial learning, and robust meta-learning. Our study extends the current literature in two main directions: (i) We consider a more general setting where the upper-level function is not necessarily strongly concave or linear in the maximization variable. (ii) While existing methods for solving saddle point problems with a bilevel structure are projection-based algorithms, we propose a one-sided projection-free method employing a linear minimization oracle. Specifically, by utilizing regularization and nested approximation techniques, we introduce a novel single-loop one-sided projection-free algorithm, requiring $\cO(\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations to attain an $\epsilon$-stationary solution, moreover, when the objective function in the upper-level is linear in the maximization component, our result improve to $\cO(\epsilon^{-3})$. Subsequently, we develop an efficient single-loop fully projected gradient-based algorithm capable of achieving an $\epsilon$-stationary solution within $\cO(\epsilon^{-5})$ iterations. This result improves to $\cO(\epsilon^{-4})$ when the upper-level objective function is strongly concave in the maximization component. Finally, we tested our proposed methods against the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving a robust multi-task regression problem to showcase the superiority of our algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Digital twins for cardiac electrophysiology are an enabling technology for precision cardiology. Current forward models are advanced enough to simulate the cardiac electric activity under different pathophysiological conditions and accurately replicate clinical signals like torso electrocardiograms (ECGs). In this work, we address the challenge of matching subject-specific QRS complexes using anatomically accurate, physiologically grounded cardiac digital twins. By fitting the initial conditions of a cardiac propagation model, our non-invasive method predicts activation patterns during sinus rhythm. For the first time, we demonstrate that distinct activation maps can generate identical surface ECGs. To address this non-uniqueness, we introduce a physiological prior based on the distribution of Purkinje-muscle junctions. Additionally, we develop a digital twin ensemble for probabilistic inference of cardiac activation. Our approach marks a significant advancement in the calibration of cardiac digital twins and enhances their credibility for clinical application.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of joint optimization involving coding and control policies for a controlled Markovian sytem over a finite-rate noiseless communication channel. While structural results on the optimal encoding and control have been obtained in the literature, their implementation has been prohibitive in general, except for linear models. We develop regularity and existence results on optimal policies. We then obtain rigorous approximation and near optimality results for jointly optimal coding and control policies. To this end, we first develop existence, regularity, and structural properties on optimal policies, followed by rigorous approximations and reinforcement learning results. Notably, we establish near optimality of finite model approximations obtained via predictor quantization as well as sliding finite window approximations, and their reinforcement learning convergence to near optimality. A detailed comparison of the approximation schemes and their reinforcement learning performance is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in industrial applications. However, finding optimal or close-to-optimal solutions can often be extremely hard. Because some of these problems can be mapped to the ground-state search of the Ising model, tremendous effort has been devoted to developing solvers for Ising-type problems over the past decades. Recent advances in controlling and manipulating both quantum and classical systems have enabled novel computing paradigms such as quantum simulators and coherent Ising machines to tackle hard optimization problems. Here, we examine and benchmark several physics-inspired optimization algorithms, including coherent Ising machines, gain-dissipative algorithms, simulated bifurcation machines, and Hopfield neural networks, which we collectively refer to as stochastic-driven nonlinear dynamical systems. Most importantly, we benchmark these algorithms against random Ising problems with planted solutions and compare them to simulated annealing as a baseline leveraging the same software stack for all solvers. We further study how different numerical integration techniques and graph connectivity affect performance. This work provides an overview of a diverse set of new optimization paradigms.</description>
