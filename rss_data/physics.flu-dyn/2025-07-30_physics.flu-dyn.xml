      <title>The invariant rate of energy extraction by polymers in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymeric turbulence, flows of fluids with dilute polymer additives at high Reynolds numbers, exhibits striking deviations from the Kolmogorovean behaviour of Newtonian turbulence. Recent experiments as well as simulations have uncovered a robust self-similar energy spectrum scaling as $k^{-2.3}$, in sharp contrast to the $k^{-5/3}$ scaling of Newtonian flows. The origin of this novel scaling, however, has remained unresolved. In this work, we uncover the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this emergent behaviour. Using fundamental governing equations aided by scaling arguments, we show that the fluid energy cascade is depleted by the polymers at a constant rate across a wide range of scales. This constant depletion rate acts as a second invariant, alongside the total energy flux, thereby setting the scaling properties of the spectrum. Our results reveal that polymeric turbulence is governed by two simultaneous invariants, unlike the single-invariant structure of Newtonian turbulence, and suggest new strategies for turbulence control through suitably engineered and targeted polymer design.</description>

      <title>On buoyancy in disperse two-phase flow and its impact on well-posedness of two-fluid models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maxey \&amp; Riley's (\textit{Phys. Fluids}, vol.~26, 1983, 883) analytical solution for the flow around a small sphere at low particle Reynolds number tells us that the fluid-particle interaction force decomposes into a contribution from the local flow disturbance caused by the particle's boundary -- consisting of the drag, Faxen, virtual-mass, and history forces -- and another contribution from the stress of the background flow, termed generalized-buoyancy force. There is also a consensus that, for general disperse two-phase flow, the interfacial force density, resulting from averaging the fluid's and particles' equations of motion, decomposes in a likewise manner. However, there has been a long-standing controversy about the physical closure separating the generalized-buoyancy from the interfacial force density, especially whether or not pseudo-stresses, such as the Reynolds stress, should be attributed to the background flow. Furthermore, most existing propositions for this closure involve small-particle approximations. Here, we show that all existing buoyancy closures are mathematically inconsistent with at least one of three simple thought experiments designed to determine the roles of pseudo-stresses and small-particle approximations. We then derive the unique closure consistent with these thought experiments. It fully incorporates all pseudo-stresses, requires no approximation, and is supported by particle-resolved numerical simulations. Remarkably, it exhibits a low-pass filter property, attenuating buoyancy at short wavelengths, that prevents it from causing Hadamard instabilities, constituting a first-principle-based solution to the long-standing ill-posedness problem of two-fluid models. When employing the derived closure, even the simplest two-fluid model, the dissipation-free one-pressure model, is hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Intraventricular Flow Patterns via Modal Decomposition Techniques in Idealized Left Ventricle Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation, propagation, and breakdown of the main vortex ring (VR) is essential for characterizing left ventricular (LV) hemodynamics, as its dynamics have been linked to the onset and progression of cardiovascular diseases. In this study, two idealized LV geometries, a semi-ellipsoidal chamber and a more rounded configuration, are analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations under physiological conditions, with the aim of investigating the fluid mechanisms that govern VR evolution during diastole. Modal decomposition techniques, specifically proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD), are employed to identify dominant coherent structures and track their temporal behavior.
  To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time such an analysis is conducted with the explicit goal of unraveling the physics of vortex ring dynamics in idealized ventricular chambers. The comparative approach reveals that geometric morphology plays a central role in modulating the flow: in one case, early interaction between the VR and the ventricular wall, driven by the chamber's shape, triggers strong nonlinear interactions and a more intricate dynamic evolution. In the other, the vortex ring propagates more freely toward the apex before dissipating, resulting in a more organized flow pattern and simpler spectral content.
  These findings advance the understanding of flow-based indicators relevant to early diagnosis and treatment planning in cardiovascular disease. Moreover, they illustrate how the choice of ventricular geometry can influence not only the simulated hemodynamics, but also the effectiveness of data-driven analysis tools, depending on the clinical context under study.</description>

      <title>diffSPH: Differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for Adjoint Optimization and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present diffSPH, a novel open-source differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) framework developed entirely in PyTorch with GPU acceleration. diffSPH is designed centrally around differentiation to facilitate optimization and machine learning (ML) applications in Computational Fluid Dynamics~(CFD), including training neural networks and the development of hybrid models. Its differentiable SPH core, and schemes for compressible (with shock capturing and multi-phase flows), weakly compressible (with boundary handling and free-surface flows), and incompressible physics, enable a broad range of application areas. We demonstrate the framework's unique capabilities through several applications, including addressing particle shifting via a novel, target-oriented approach by minimizing physical and regularization loss terms, a task often intractable in traditional solvers. Further examples include optimizing initial conditions and physical parameters to match target trajectories, shape optimization, implementing a solver-in-the-loop setup to emulate higher-order integration, and demonstrating gradient propagation through hundreds of full simulation steps. Prioritizing readability, usability, and extensibility, this work offers a foundational platform for the CFD community to develop and deploy novel neural networks and adjoint optimization applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reduced Order Modeling Based on HODMD to Predict Intraventricular Flow Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient modeling of cardiac blood flow is crucial for advancing data-driven tools in cardiovascular research and clinical applications. Recently, the accuracy and availability of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodologies for simulating intraventricular flow have increased. However, these methods remain complex and computationally costly. This study presents a reduced order model (ROM) based on higher order dynamic mode decomposition (HODMD). The proposed approach enables accurate reconstruction and long term prediction of left ventricle flow fields. The method is tested on two idealized ventricular geometries exhibiting distinct flow regimes to assess its robustness under different hemodynamic conditions. By leveraging a small number of training snapshots and focusing on the dominant periodic components representing the physics of the system, the HODMD-based model accurately reconstructs the flow field over entire cardiac cycles and provides reliable long-term predictions beyond the training window. The reconstruction and prediction errors remain below 5\% for the first geometry and below 10\% for the second, even when using as few as the first 3 cycles of simulated data, representing the transitory regime. Additionally, the approach reduces computational costs with a speed-up factor of at least $10^{5}$ compared to full-order simulations, enabling fast surrogate modeling of complex cardiac flows. These results highlight the potential of spectrally-constrained HODMD as a robust and interpretable ROM for simulating intraventricular hemodynamics. This approach shows promise for integration in real-time analysis and patient specific models.</description>

      <title>Effect of Nozzle Geometry on the Performance of Non-Assist Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs large-eddy simulations with a flamelet progress variable approach to systematically quantify the influence of nozzle geometry on combustion efficiency, mixing, and blowout resistance in non-assist methane flares. Five canonical nozzle shapes-circle, low aspect ratio ellipse, high aspect ratio ellipse, diamond, and square-were evaluated under relevant industrial flare conditions. Results demonstrate that cornered geometries enhance near-field recirculation, promote mixing, and sustain flame attachment, resulting in up to a 5% improvement in combustion efficiency compared with streamlined nozzles. The square nozzle performed best irrespective of the wind direction (orientation) and maintained a combustion efficiency greater than 96.5% even at the highest tested crosswind velocities, while other streamlined designs exhibited early flame lift-off, reduced recirculation, and efficiency losses. Analysis of mixing and vorticity reveals that sharp-edged nozzles accelerate scalar homogenization and buffer flames against crosswind-induced strain, directly translating to increased blowout resistance.</description>

      <title>Data-driven quantum Koopman method for simulating nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation offers potential exponential speedups for simulating certain physical systems, but its application to nonlinear dynamics is inherently constrained by the requirement of unitary evolution. We propose the quantum Koopman method (QKM), a data-driven framework that bridges this gap through transforming nonlinear dynamics into linear unitary evolution in higher-dimensional observable spaces. Leveraging the Koopman operator theory to achieve a global linearization, our approach maps system states into a hierarchy of Hilbert spaces using a deep autoencoder. Within the linearized embedding spaces, the state representation is decomposed into modulus and phase components, and the evolution is governed by a set of unitary Koopman operators that act exclusively on the phase. These operators are constructed from diagonal Hamiltonians with coefficients learned from data, a structure designed for efficient implementation on quantum hardware. This architecture enables direct multi-step prediction, and the operator's computational complexity scales logarithmically with the observable space dimension. The QKM is validated across diverse nonlinear systems. Its predictions maintain relative errors below 6% for reaction-diffusion systems and shear flows, and capture key statistics in 2D turbulence. This work establishes a practical pathway for quantum-accelerated simulation of nonlinear phenomena, exploring a framework built on the synergy between deep learning for global linearization and quantum algorithms for unitary dynamics evolution.</description>

      <title>Numerical Analysis of Cavitation Dynamics on Free Ogee Spillways Using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating complex hydraulic conditions, particularly two-phase flows over spillway chutes, can be achieved with high accuracy using three-dimensional numerical models. This study investigates the potential for vacuum generation and cavitation phenomena on the Aghchai Dam service spillway through numerical simulations conducted in Flow-3D. The analysis focuses on two specific flow rates, 4400 and 1065 cubic meters per second, as determined by experimental data. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method is employed to accurately calculate the free surface flow. Simulation results at a discharge rate of 4400 cubic meters per second indicate a high likelihood of cavitation at critical locations, including the ogee curve and the angle transition in the chute channel. These areas require specific mitigation measures to prevent cavitation-induced damage. In contrast, at the lower flow rate of 1065 cubic meters per second, the risk of cavitation is minimal due to reduced flow velocity and the absence of flow separation from the bed. The numerical findings align closely with empirical observations, demonstrating the reliability of the simulation approach in predicting cavitation behavior.</description>

      <title>A Gauge-Theoretic Action Principle for Viscous Incompressible Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel action principle for two dimensional incompressible fluid dynamics that naturally incorporates both vorticity and viscous dissipation via gauge field couplings. The action features a Chern Simons like term, $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho} A_\mu \partial_\nu A_\rho$, capturing the topological structure of vorticity, alongside a quadratic term $(\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho} \partial_\nu A_\rho)^2$ representing viscous damping. Incompressibility is enforced through a Lagrange multiplier, while coupling to an external potential allows applications in geophysical flows. We derive the equations of motion, recovering the vorticity formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier Stokes equations and explicitly identifying the kinematic viscosity. This gauge theoretic framework leads to a Helmholtz type equation for vorticity linking topological and dissipative phenomena in viscous incompressible fluids. Analysis of Noether symmetries reveals conserved charges arising from gauge invariance and spatial translations, while viscosity explicitly breaks time reversal symmetry within this topological setting. Furthermore, the velocity vorticity gauge correspondence naturally suggests a Lindblad operator structure, providing a pathway toward a quantum description of viscous dissipation and allowing quantization of dissipative hydrodynamics. This framework also highlights how vorticity emerges as a natural Lindblad operator, capturing the transition from coherent rotational motion to thermal disorder.</description>

      <title>Stokes drag on a sphere in a three-dimensional anisotropic porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on a sphere in a static anisotropic porous medium. This problem is analysed using the Brinkman-Debye-Bueche equations with an axisymmetric shielding (or permeability) tensor. Using the exact Green's functions for this model fluid within a single-layer boundary element formulation, we numerically compute the friction tensor for a translating sphere subjected to stick boundary conditions. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for small anisotropy using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. By benchmarking this result against the numerical solutions, we find that a linear approximation is valid in a broad parameter regime. Our results are important for studying self-diffusion in general anisotropic porous media, but can also be applied to small tracers in nematic fluids composed of disk- or rod-like crowders.</description>
