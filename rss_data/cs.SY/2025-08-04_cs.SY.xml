      <title>Data-Driven Motion Planning for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven motion-planning framework for nonlinear systems that constructs a sequence of overlapping invariant polytopes. Around each randomly sampled waypoint, the algorithm identifies a convex admissible region and solves data-driven linear-matrix-inequality problems to learn several ellipsoidal invariant sets together with their local state-feedback gains. The convex hull of these ellipsoids, still invariant under a piece-wise-affine controller obtained by interpolating the gains, is then approximated by a polytope. Safe transitions between nodes are ensured by verifying the intersection of consecutive convex-hull polytopes and introducing an intermediate node for a smooth transition. Control gains are interpolated in real time via simplex-based interpolation, keeping the state inside the invariant polytopes throughout the motion. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on system dynamics models, our method requires only data to compute safe regions and design state-feedback controllers. The approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving safe, dynamically feasible paths for complex nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Integrating Opinion Dynamics into Safety Control for Decentralized Airplane Encounter Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the airspace becomes increasingly congested, decentralized conflict resolution methods for airplane encounters have become essential. While decentralized safety controllers can prevent dangerous midair collisions, they do not always ensure prompt conflict resolution. As a result, airplane progress may be blocked for extended periods in certain situations. To address this blocking phenomenon, this paper proposes integrating bio-inspired nonlinear opinion dynamics into the airplane safety control framework, thereby guaranteeing both safety and blocking-free resolution. In particular, opinion dynamics enable the safety controller to achieve collaborative decision-making for blocking resolution and facilitate rapid, safe coordination without relying on communication or preset rules. Extensive simulation results validate the improved flight efficiency and safety guarantees. This study provides practical insights into the design of autonomous controllers for airplanes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compensation of Nonlinear Friction in Mechanical Systems Without Velocity Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction is an unavoidable phenomenon that exists in all mechanical systems incorporating parts with relative motion. It is well-known that friction is a serious impediment for precise servo control, hence the interest to devise a procedure to compensate for it -- a subject that has been studied by many researchers for many years. The vast majority of friction compensation schemes reported in the literature rely on the availability of velocity measurements, an information that is hard to obtain. A second limitation of the existing procedures is that they rely on mathematical models of friction that contain several unknown parameters, some of them entering nonlinearly in the dynamic equations. In this paper we propose a globally convergent tracking controller for a mechanical system perturbed by static and Coulomb friction, which is a reliable mathematical model of the friction phenomenon, that does not rely one measurement of velocity. The key component is an immersion and invariance-based adaptive speed observer, used for the friction compensation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first globally convergent solution to this challenging problem. We also present simulation results of the application of our observer for systems affected by friction, which is described by the more advanced LuGre model.</description>

      <title>Optimal Messaging Strategy for Incentivizing Agents in Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a finite-horizon discrete-time dynamic system jointly controlled by a designer and one or more agents, where the designer can influence the agents' actions through selective information disclosure. At each time step, the designer sends a message to the agent(s) from a prespecified message space. The designer may also take an action that directly influences system dynamics and rewards. Each agent uses its received message (and its own information) to choose its action. We are interested in the setting where the designer would like to incentivize each agent to play a specific strategy. We consider a notion of incentive compatibility that is based on sequential rationality at each realization of the common information between the designer and the agent(s). Our objective is to find a messaging and action strategy for the designer that maximizes its total expected reward while incentivizing each agent to follow a prespecified strategy. Under certain assumptions on the information structure of the problem, we show that an optimal designer strategy can be computed using a backward inductive algorithm that solves a family of linear programs.</description>

      <title>Neural Co-state Projection Regulator: A Model-free Paradigm for Real-time Optimal Control with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based approaches, notably Reinforcement Learning (RL), have shown promise for solving optimal control tasks without explicit system models. However, these approaches are often sample-inefficient, sensitive to reward design and hyperparameters, and prone to poor generalization, especially under input constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce the neural co-state projection regulator (NCPR), a model-free learning-based optimal control framework that is grounded in Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) and capable of solving quadratic regulator problems in nonlinear control-affine systems with input constraints. In this framework, a neural network (NN) is trained in a self-supervised setting to take the current state of the system as input and predict a finite-horizon trajectory of projected co-states (i.e., the co-state weighted by the system's input gain). Subsequently, only the first element of the NN's prediction is extracted to solve a lightweight quadratic program (QP). This workflow is executed in a feedback control setting, allowing real-time computation of control actions that satisfy both input constraints and first-order optimality conditions.
  We test the proposed learning-based model-free quadratic regulator on (1) a unicycle model robot reference tracking problem and (2) a pendulum swing-up task. For comparison, reinforcement learning is used on both tasks; and for context, a model-based controller is used in the unicycle model example. Our method demonstrates superior generalizability in terms of both unseen system states and varying input constraints, and also shows improved sampling efficiency.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional observer design for stable linear systems by model reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a low-dimensional observer design for stable, single-input single-output, continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.</description>

      <title>Cyber-Physical Co-Simulation of Load Frequency Control under Load-Altering Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating Information and Communications Technology (ICT) devices into the power grid brings many benefits. However, it also exposes the grid to new potential cyber threats. Many control and protection mechanisms, such as Load Frequency Control (LFC), responsible for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations and Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) disconnecting portion of the load during an emergency, are dependent on information exchange through the communication network. The recently emerging Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) utilize a botnet of high-wattage devices to introduce load fluctuation. In their dynamic form (DLAAs), they manipulate the load in response to live grid frequency measurements for increased efficiency, posing a notable threat to grid stability. Recognizing the importance of communication networks in power grid cyber security research, this paper presents an open-source co-simulation environment that models the power grid with the corresponding communication network, implementing grid protective mechanisms. This setup allows the comprehensive analysis of the attacks in concrete LFC and UFLS scenarios.</description>

      <title>Petri Net Modeling and Deadlock-Free Scheduling of Attachable Heterogeneous AGV Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for automation and flexibility drives the widespread adoption of heterogeneous automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This work intends to investigate a new scheduling problem in a material transportation system consisting of attachable heterogeneous AGVs, namely carriers and shuttles. They can flexibly attach to and detach from each other to cooperatively execute complex transportation tasks. While such collaboration enhances operational efficiency, the attachment-induced synchronization and interdependence render the scheduling coupled and susceptible to deadlock. To tackle this challenge, Petri nets are introduced to model AGV schedules, well describing the concurrent and sequential task execution and carrier-shuttle synchronization. Based on Petri net theory, a firing-driven decoding method is proposed, along with deadlock detection and prevention strategies to ensure deadlock-free schedules. Furthermore, a Petri net-based metaheuristic is developed in an adaptive large neighborhood search framework and incorporates an effective acceleration method to enhance computational efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments using real-world industrial data validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against the scheduling policy applied in engineering practice, an exact solver, and four state-of-the-art metaheuristics. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to provide managerial insights.</description>

      <title>Learning to optimize with guarantees: a complete characterization of linearly convergent algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-stakes engineering applications, optimization algorithms must come with provable worst-case guarantees over a mathematically defined class of problems. Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices performance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We address the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to improve its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems - for example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control (MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its worst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we characterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for classes of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting from a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the modifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our results apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for nonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for strongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over polyhedral feasibility sets. We showcase effectiveness of the approach on solving optimization problems with tight iteration budgets in application to ill-conditioned systems of linear equations and MPC for linear systems.</description>

      <title>AoI-Aware Resource Allocation with Deep Reinforcement Learning for HAPS-V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) networks are designed to meet the hyper-reliable and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements of safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the 6G infrastructure brings redundancy to the network, ensuring continuity of communications even under extreme conditions. In particular, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) stand out for their wide coverage and low latency advantages, supporting communication reliability and enhancing information freshness, especially in rural areas and regions with infrastructure constraints. In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the age-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. The proposed method improves information freshness and overall network reliability by enabling independent learning without centralized coordination. The findings reveal the potential of HAPS-supported solutions, combined with DDPG-based learning, for efficient AoI-aware resource allocation in platoon-based autonomous vehicle systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms, showing that our proposed method outperforms them.</description>

      <title>A Practical Finite Element Approach for Simulating Dynamic Crack Growth in Cu/Ultra Low-k Interconnect Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a practical finite element modeling strategy, the Crack Element Method (CEM), for simulating the dynamic crack propagation in two-dimensional structures. The method employs an element-splitting algorithm based on the Edge-based Smoothed Finite Element Method (ES-FEM) to capture the element-wise crack growth while reducing the formation of poorly shaped elements that can compromise numerical accuracy and computational performance. A fracture energy release rate formulation is also developed based on the evolving topology of the split elements. The proposed approach is validated through a series of classical benchmark problems, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness in addressing dynamic fracture scenarios. Finally, the applicability of the CEM is illustrated in a case study involving patterned Cu/Ultra Low-k interconnect structures.</description>

      <title>Subband Architecture Aided Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The feedforward selective fixed-filter method selects the most suitable pre-trained control filter based on the spectral features of the detected reference signal, effectively avoiding slow convergence in conventional adaptive algorithms. However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and the performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power spectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel selective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the off-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different frequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the on-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT filter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband signal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking technique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter, enabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and strong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Organic Electrochemical Neurons: Nonlinear Tools for Complex Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid oscillator architectures that combine feedback oscillators with self-sustained negative resistance oscillators have emerged as a promising platform for artificial neuron design. In this work, we introduce a modeling and analysis framework for amplifier-assisted organic electrochemical neurons, leveraging nonlinear dynamical systems theory. By formulating the system as coupled differential equations describing membrane voltage and internal state variables, we identify the conditions for self-sustained oscillations and characterize the resulting dynamics through nullclines, phase-space analysis, and bifurcation behavior, providing complementary insight to standard circuit-theoretic arguments of the operation of oscillators. Our simplified yet rigorous model enables tractable analysis of circuits integrating classical feedback components (e.g., operational amplifiers) with novel devices exhibiting negative differential resistance, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECT). This approach reveals the core mechanisms behind oscillation generation, demonstrating the utility of dynamic systems theory in understanding and designing complex hybrid circuits. Beyond neuromorphic and bioelectronic applications, the proposed framework offers a generalizable foundation for developing tunable, biologically inspired oscillatory systems in sensing, signal processing, and adaptive control.</description>

Abstract: For conducting resource adequacy studies, we synthesize multiple long-term wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms simultaneously by using the spatio-temporal features: spatial and temporal correlation, waveforms, marginal and ramp rates distributions of waveform, power spectral densities, and statistical characteristics. Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios requires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and antithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density analysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize plausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples through a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN, we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal information from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the GDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible waveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated performance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power scenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical characteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM with a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the GAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.</description>

      <title>Online Fine-Tuning of Carbon Emission Predictions using Real-Time Recurrent Learning for State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for fine-tuning the predictions of structured state space models (SSMs) at inference time using real-time recurrent learning. While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static during deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously updating model parameters in response to incoming data. We evaluate our approach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset collected from embedded automotive hardware. Experimental results show that our method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference, demonstrating its potential for dynamic, resource-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human drivers naturally balance the risks of different concerns while driving, including traffic rule violations, minor accidents, and fatalities. However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous driving systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we further formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of driving risks, including both collision risks and traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.</description>

      <title>Prescribed-Time Boresight Control of Spacecraft Under Pointing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04312v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes an integrated boresight guidance and control (IBGC) scheme to address the boresight reorientation problem of spacecraft under temporal and pointing constraints. A $C^1$ continuous, saturated prescribed-time adjustment (PPTA) function is presented, along with the establishment of a practical prescribed-time stability criterion. Utilizing the time scale transformation technique and the PPTA function, we propose a prescribed-time guidance law that guides the boresight vector from almost any initial orientation in free space to a small neighborhood of the goal orientation within a preassigned time, while avoiding all forbidden zones augmented with safety margins. Subsequently, a prescribed-time disturbance observer (PTDO) is derived to reconstruct the external disturbances. By leveraging barrier and PPTA functions, a PTDO-based reduced-attitude tracking controller is developed, which ensures prescribed-time boresight tracking within a ``safe tube''. By judiciously setting the safety margins, settling times, and safe tube for the guidance and control laws, the proposed IBGC scheme achieves pointing-constrained boresight reorientation within a required task completion time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IBGC scheme.</description>

      <title>PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</description>

      <title>System Identification from Partial Observations under Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the partially observed linear system identification, where the goal is to obtain reasonably accurate estimation of the balanced truncation of the true system up to order $k$ from output measurements. We consider the challenging case of system identification under adversarial attacks, where the probability of having an attack at each time is $\Theta(1/k)$ while the value of the attack is arbitrary. We first show that the $\ell_1$-norm estimator exactly identifies the true Markov parameter matrix for nilpotent systems under any type of attack. We then build on this result to extend it to general systems and show that the estimation error exponentially decays as $k$ grows. The estimated balanced truncation model accordingly shows an exponentially decaying error for the identification of the true system up to a similarity transformation. This work is the first to provide the input-output analysis of the system with partial observations under arbitrary attacks.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization of Process Parameters of a Sensor-Based Sorting System using Gaussian Processes as Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method with three example process parameters.</description>

      <title>Learning to Drift with Individual Wheel Drive: Maneuvering Autonomous Vehicle at the Handling Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles, is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits. While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control. Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world environments.</description>
