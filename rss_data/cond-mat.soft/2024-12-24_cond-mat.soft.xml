      <title>Active matter as the underpinning agency for extraordinary sensitivity of biological membranes to electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interaction of electric fields with biological cells is indispensable for many physiological processes. Thermal electrical noise in the cellular environment has long been considered as the minimum threshold for detection of electrical signals by cells. However, there is compelling experimental evidence that the minimum electric field sensed by certain cells, and organisms, is many orders of magnitude weaker than the thermal electrical noise limit estimated purely under equilibrium considerations. We resolve this discrepancy by proposing a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics model for active electromechanical membranes and hypothesize the role of activity in modulating the minimum electrical field that can be detected by a biological membrane. Active membranes contain proteins that use external energy sources to carry out specific functions and drive the membrane away from equilibrium. The central idea behind our model is that active mechanisms, attributed to different sources, endow the membrane with the ability to sense and respond to electric fields that are deemed undetectable based on equilibrium statistical mechanics. Our model for active membranes is capable of reproducing different experimental data available in the literature by varying the activity. Elucidating how active matter can modulate the sensitivity of cells to electric signals can open avenues for a deeper understanding of physiological and pathological processes.</description>

      <title>Tunable Assembly of Confined Janus Microswimmers in Sub-kHz Electic Fields under Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active systems comprising micron-sized self-propelling units, also termed microswimmers, are promising candidates for the bottom-up assembly of small structures and reconfigurable materials. Here we leverage field-driven colloidal assembly to induce structural transformations in dense layers of microswimmers driven by an alternating current (AC) electric field and confined in a microfabricated trap under the influence of gravity. By varying the electric field frequency, we realize significant structural transformations, from a gas-like state at high frequencies to dynamically rearranging dense crystalline clusters at lower frequencies, characterized by vorticity in their dynamics. We demonstrate the ability to switch between these states on-demand, showing that the clustering mechanism differs from motility-induced phase separation. Our results offer a valuable framework for designing high-density active matter systems with controllable structural properties, envisioned to advance the development of artificial materials with self-healing and reconfiguration capabilities.</description>

      <title>On the Spectral Shape of the Structural Relaxation in Deeply Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural relaxation in deeply supercooled liquids is non-exponential. In susceptibility representation, $\chi^{\prime\prime}(\nu)$, the spectral shape of the structural relaxation is observed as an asymmetrically broadened peak with a $\nu^{1}$ low- and $\nu^{-\beta}$ high-frequency behavior. In this perspective article we discuss common notions, recent results and open questions regarding the spectral shape of the structural relaxation. In particular, we focus on the observation that a high-frequency behavior of $\nu^{-1/2}$ appears to be a generic feature in a broad range of different deeply supercooled liquids. Moreover, we review extensive evidence that contributions from orientational cross-correlations can lead to deviations from the generic spectral shape in certain substances, in particular in dielectric loss spectra. Additionally, intramolecular dynamics can contribute significantly to the spectral shape in substances containing more complex and flexible molecules. Finally, we discuss the open questions regarding potential physical origins of the generic $\nu^{-1/2}$ behavior and the evolution of the spectral shape towards higher temperatures.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal characterization of emergent behavior of self-propelled oil droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To further understand the complex behavior of swimming microorganisms, the spontaneous motion of nonliving matter provides essential insights. While substantial research has focused on quantitatively analyzing complex behavioral patterns, characterizing these dynamics aiming for inclusive comparison to the behavior of living systems remains challenging. In this study, we experimentally and numerically investigated the 'life-like' behavior of an oil droplet in an aqueous surfactant solution by identifying behavioral modes of spontaneous motion patterns in response to varying physical parameters, such as volume and oil concentration. Leveraging data-driven nonparametric dynamical systems analysis, we discovered the low dimensionality and nonlinearity of the underlying dynamical system governing oil droplet motion. Notably, our simulations demonstrate that the two-dimensional Langevin equations effectively reproduce the overall behavior experimentally observed while retaining the rational correspondence with physical parameter interpretations. These findings not only elucidate the fundamental dynamics governing the spontaneous motion of oil droplet systems but also suggest potential pathways for developing more descriptive models that bridge the gap between nonliving and living behaviors.</description>

      <title>Shape of Polystyrene Droplets on Soft PDMS: Exploring the Gap Between Theory and Experiment at the Three-Phase Contact Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The shapes of liquid polystyrene (PS) droplets on viscoelastic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates are investigated experimentally using atomic force microscopy for a range of droplet sizes and substrate elasticities. These shapes, which comprise the PS-air, PS-PDMS, and PDMS-air interfaces as well as the three-phase contact line, are compared to theoretical predictions using axisymmetric sharp-interface models derived through energy minimization. We find that the polystyrene droplets are cloaked by a thin layer of uncrosslinked molecules migrating from the PDMS substrate. By incorporating the effects of cloaking into the surface energies in our theoretical model, we show that the global features of the experimental droplet shapes are in excellent quantitative agreement for all droplet sizes and substrate elasticities. However, our comparisons also reveal systematic discrepancies between the experimental results and the theoretical predictions in the vicinity of the three-phase contact line. Moreover, the relative importance of these discrepancies systematically increases for softer substrates and smaller droplets. We demonstrate that global variations in system parameters, such as surface tension and elastic shear moduli, cannot explain these differences but instead point to a locally larger elastocapillary length, whose possible origin is discussed thoroughly.</description>

      <title>Fluid-Derived Lattices for Unbiased Modeling of Bacterial Colony Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial colonies can form a wide variety of shapes and structures based on ambient and internal conditions. To help understand the mechanisms that determine the structure of and the diversity within these colonies, various numerical modeling techniques have been applied. The most commonly used ones are continuum models, agent-based models, and lattice models. Continuum models are usually computationally fast, but disregard information at the level of the individual, which can be crucial to understanding diversity in a colony. Agent-based models resolve local details to a greater level, but are computationally costly. Lattice-based approaches strike a balance between these two limiting cases. However, this is known to come at the price of introducing undesirable artifacts into the structure of the colonies. For instance, square lattices tend to produce square colonies even where an isotropic shape is expected. Here, we aim to overcome these limitations and therefore study lattice-induced orientational symmetry in a class of hybrid numerical methods that combine aspects of lattice-based and continuum descriptions. We characterize these artifacts and show that they can be circumvented through the use of a disordered lattice which derives from an unstructured fluid. The main advantage of this approach is that the lattice itself does not imbue the colony with a preferential directionality. We demonstrate that our implementation enables the study of colony growth involving millions of individuals within hours of computation time on an ordinary desktop computer, while retaining many of the desirable features of agent-based models. Furthermore, our method can be readily adapted for a wide range of applications, opening up new avenues for studying the formation of colonies with diverse shapes and complex internal interactions.</description>

      <title>Scaling Description of the Relaxation Dynamics and Dynamical Heterogeneity of an Active Glass-forming Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active glasses refer to a class of driven non-equilibrium systems that share remarkably similar dynamical behavior as conventional glass-formers in equilibrium. Glass-like dynamical characteristics have been observed in various biological systems from micro to macro length scales. As activity induces additional fluctuations in the system, studying how they couple with density fluctuations is an interesting question to address. Via extensive molecular dynamics simulations, We show that activity enhances density fluctuations more strongly than its passive counterpart. Increasing activity beyond a limit results in the sub-Arrhenieus-type relaxation behavior in active glasses. We also propose a unified scaling theory that can rationalize the relaxation spectrum over a broad parameter range using the concept of an effective temperature. In particular, we show that our scaling theory can capture the dynamical crossover from super to sub-Arrhenius relaxation behavior by changing activity from small to large values. Furthermore, We present non-trivial system size dependencies of the relaxation time at large activity limits that have not been found in any passive systems or even in active systems at small activities.</description>

      <title>Trypanosoma brucei moving in microchannels and through constrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei), a single-celled parasite and natural microswimmer, is responsible for fatal sleeping sickness in infected mammals, including humans. Understanding how T. brucei interacts with fluid environments and navigates through confining spaces is crucial not only for medical and clinical applications but also for a fundamental understanding of how life organizes in a confined microscopic world. Using a hybrid multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD)--molecular dynamics (MD) approach, we present our investigations on the locomotion of an in silico T. brucei in three types of fluid environments: bulk fluid, straight cylindrical microchannels, and microchannels with constrictions. We observe that the helical swimming trajectory of the in silico T. brucei becomes rectified in straight cylindrical channels compared to bulk fluid. The swimming speed for different channel widths is governed by the diameter of the helical trajectory. The speed first slightly increases as the channel narrows and then decreases when the helix diameter is compressed. An optimal swimming speed is achieved, when the channel width is approximately twice the bulk helix diameter. It results from an interplay of the trypanosome's hydrodynamic interactions with the cylindrical channel walls and the high deformability of the parasite. In microchannels with constrictions, the motions of the anterior and posterior ends, the end-to-end distance, and the log-rolling motion of the cell body are characterized and show salient differences compared to the straight-channel case. Depending on the constriction length and width, we observe characteristic slip, stuck, and stuck-slip motions of the model T. brucei within the constriction. Our findings may provide some mechanical insights into how T. brucei moves through blood vessels and tissues, and across the blood-brain barrier.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can take place even in a moderately dense inertial suspension consisting of frictionless soft particles. This DST can be regarded as an ignited-quenched transition in the inertial suspension. An approximate kinetic theory well recovers the results of the Langevin simulation in the wide range of the volume fraction without any fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Elastic interactions compete with persistent cell motility to drive durotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The directed migration of cells toward stiffer substrate regions or durotaxis is relevant to tissue development and tumor progression. Here, we introduce a phenomenological model for single cell durotaxis that incorporates both elastic deformation-mediated cell-substrate interactions and the stochasticity of cell migration. Our model is motivated by a key observation in an early demonstration of durotaxis: a single, contractile cell at a sharp interface between a softer and a stiffer region of an elastic substrate reorients and migrates towards the stiffer region. We model migrating cells as self-propelling, persistently motile agents that exert contractile traction forces on their elastic substrate. The resulting substrate deformations induce elastic interactions with mechanical boundaries, captured by an elastic potential. Cell dynamics are governed by two critical parameters: the strength of the traction-induced boundary interaction (A) and the persistence of cell motility (Pe). The resulting elastic forces and torques align cells perpendicular (parallel) to the boundary and accumulate (deplete) them at clamped (free) boundaries. A clamped boundary induces an attractive potential, promoting durotaxis, while a free boundary generates a repulsive potential, preventing anti-durotaxis. By analyzing steady-state position and orientation probabilities, we show how accumulation and depletion depend on elastic potential strength and motility. We compare our findings with biological microswimmers and other active particles that accumulate at confining boundaries. The model defines metrics for boundary accumulation and durotaxis, presenting a phase diagram with three regimes: durotaxis, adurotaxis, and motility-induced accumulation. Our model predicts how durotaxis depends on cell contractility and motility, offering insights and testable predictions for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamic length increases monotonically in pinned and unpinned glass forming systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Random First Order Transition Theory (RFOT) predicts that transport proceeds by cooperative movement of particles in domains whose sizes increase as a liquid is compressed above a characteristic volume fraction, $\phi_d$. The rounded dynamical transition around $\phi_d$, which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ($&gt; \phi_d$). Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around $\phi_d$, which not only depends on the pinning method but is different from $\phi_d$ of the actual liquid. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wave length limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multi particle structure factor, $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamic length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in glass forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>On the effects of membrane viscosity on transient red blood cell dynamics</title>

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is currently used to design and improve the hydraulic properties of biomedical devices, wherein the large scale blood circulation needs to be simulated by accounting for the mechanical response of red blood cells (RBCs) at mesoscales. In many practical instances, biomedical devices work on time-scales comparable to the intrinsic relaxation time of RBCs: thus, a systematic understanding of the time-dependent response of erythrocyte membranes is crucial for the effective design of such devices. So far, this information has been deduced from experimental data, which do not necessarily adapt to the the broad variety of the fluid dynamic conditions that can be encountered in practice. This work explores the novel possibility of studying the time-dependent response of an erythrocyte membrane to external mechanical loads via ab-initio, mesoscale numerical simulations, with a primary focus on the detailed characterisation of the RBC relaxation time $t_c$ following the arrest of the external mechanical load. The adopted mesoscale model exploits a hybrid Immersed Boundary-Lattice Boltzmann Method (IB-LBM), coupled with the Standard Linear Solid model (SLS) to account for the RBC membrane viscosity. We underscore the key importance of the 2D membrane viscosity $\mu_{m}$ to correctly reproduce the relaxation time of the RBC membrane. A detailed assessment of the dependencies on the typology and strength of the applied mechanical loads is also provided. Overall, our findings open interesting future perspectives for the study of the non-linear response of RBCs immersed in time-dependent strain fields.</description>
