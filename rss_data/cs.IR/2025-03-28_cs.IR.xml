      <title>D4R -- Exploring and Querying Relational Graphs Using Natural Language and Large Language Models -- the Case of Historical Documents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: D4R is a digital platform designed to assist non-technical users, particularly historians, in exploring textual documents through advanced graphical tools for text analysis and knowledge extraction. By leveraging a large language model, D4R translates natural language questions into Cypher queries, enabling the retrieval of data from a Neo4J database. A user-friendly graphical interface allows for intuitive interaction, enabling users to navigate and analyse complex relational data extracted from unstructured textual documents. Originally designed to bridge the gap between AI technologies and historical research, D4R's capabilities extend to various other domains. A demonstration video and a live software demo are available.</description>

      <title>FAIR-QR: Enhancing Fairness-aware Information Retrieval through Query Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval systems such as open web search and recommendation systems are ubiquitous and significantly impact how people receive and consume online information. Previous research has shown the importance of fairness in information retrieval systems to combat the issue of echo chambers and mitigate the rich-get-richer effect. Therefore, various fairness-aware information retrieval methods have been proposed. Score-based fairness-aware information retrieval algorithms, focusing on statistical parity, are interpretable but could be mathematically infeasible and lack generalizability. In contrast, learning-to-rank-based fairness-aware information retrieval algorithms using fairness-aware loss functions demonstrate strong performance but lack interpretability. In this study, we proposed a novel and interpretable framework that recursively refines query keywords to retrieve documents from underrepresented groups and achieve group fairness. Retrieved documents using refined queries will be re-ranked to ensure relevance. Our method not only shows promising retrieval results regarding relevance and fairness but also preserves interpretability by showing refined keywords used at each iteration.</description>

      <title>Alleviating LLM-based Generative Retrieval Hallucination in Alipay Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</description>

      <title>Are We Solving a Well-Defined Problem? A Task-Centric Perspective on Recommendation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RecSys) leverage user interaction history to predict and suggest relevant items, shaping user experiences across various domains. While many studies adopt a general problem definition, i.e., to recommend preferred items to users based on past interactions, such abstraction often lacks the domain-specific nuances necessary for practical deployment. However, models are frequently evaluated using datasets from online recommender platforms, which inherently reflect these specificities. In this paper, we analyze RecSys task formulations, emphasizing key components such as input-output structures, temporal dynamics, and candidate item selection. All these factors directly impact offline evaluation. We further examine the complexities of user-item interactions, including decision-making costs, multi-step engagements, and unobservable interactions, which may influence model design and loss functions. Additionally, we explore the balance between task specificity and model generalizability, highlighting how well-defined task formulations serve as the foundation for robust evaluation and effective solution development. By clarifying task definitions and their implications, this work provides a structured perspective on RecSys research. The goal is to help researchers better navigate the field, particularly in understanding specificities of the RecSys tasks and ensuring fair and meaningful evaluations.</description>

      <title>Bias-Aware Agent: Enhancing Fairness in AI-Driven Knowledge Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in retrieving accessible information have evolved faster in the last few years compared to the decades since the internet's creation. Search engines, like Google, have been the number one way to find relevant data. They have always relied on the user's abilities to find the best information in its billions of links and sources at everybody's fingertips. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has completely transformed the field of information retrieval. The LLMs excel not only at retrieving relevant knowledge but also at summarizing it effectively, making information more accessible and consumable for users. On top of it, the rise of AI Agents has introduced another aspect to information retrieval i.e. dynamic information retrieval which enables the integration of real-time data such as weather forecasts, and financial data with the knowledge base to curate context-aware knowledge. However, despite these advancements the agents remain susceptible to issues of bias and fairness, challenges deeply rooted within the knowledge base and training of LLMs. This study introduces a novel approach to bias-aware knowledge retrieval by leveraging agentic framework and the innovative use of bias detectors as tools to identify and highlight inherent biases in the retrieved content. By empowering users with transparency and awareness, this approach aims to foster more equitable information systems and promote the development of responsible AI.</description>

      <title>Improvement Graph Convolution Collaborative Filtering with Weighted addition input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have been extensively applied in the field of machine learning to find features of graphs, and recommendation systems are no exception. The ratings of users on considered items can be represented by graphs which are input for many efficient models to find out the characteristics of the users and the items. From these insights, relevant items are recommended to users. However, user's decisions on the items have varying degrees of effects on different users, and this information should be learned so as not to be lost in the process of information mining.
  In this publication, we propose to build an additional graph showing the recommended weight of an item to a target user to improve the accuracy of GNN models. Although the users' friendships were not recorded, their correlation was still evident through the commonalities in consumption behavior. We build a model WiGCN (Weighted input GCN) to describe and experiment on well-known datasets. Conclusions will be stated after comparing our results with state-of-the-art such as GCMC, NGCF and LightGCN. The source code is also included at https://github.com/trantin84/WiGCN.</description>

      <title>CombiGCN: An effective GCN model for Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have opened up a potential line of research for collaborative filtering (CF). The key power of GNNs is based on injecting collaborative signal into user and item embeddings which will contain information about user-item interactions after that. However, there are still some unsatisfactory points for a CF model that GNNs could have done better. The way in which the collaborative signal are extracted through an implicit feedback matrix that is essentially built on top of the message-passing architecture of GNNs, and it only helps to update the embedding based on the value of the items (or users) embeddings neighboring. By identifying the similarity weight of users through their interaction history, a key concept of CF, we endeavor to build a user-user weighted connection graph based on their similarity weight.
  In this study, we propose a recommendation framework, CombiGCN, in which item embeddings are only linearly propagated on the user-item interaction graph, while user embeddings are propagated simultaneously on both the user-user weighted connection graph and user-item interaction graph graphs with Light Graph Convolution (LGC) and combined in a simpler method by using the weighted sum of the embeddings for each layer. We also conducted experiments comparing CombiGCN with several state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Can Zero-Shot Commercial APIs Deliver Regulatory-Grade Clinical Text DeIdentification?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically assess the performance of three leading API-based de-identification systems - Azure Health Data Services, AWS Comprehend Medical, and OpenAI GPT-4o - against our de-identification systems on a ground truth dataset of 48 clinical documents annotated by medical experts. Our analysis, conducted at both entity-level and token-level, demonstrates that our solution, Healthcare NLP, achieves the highest accuracy, with a 96% F1-score in protected health information (PHI) detection, significantly outperforming Azure (91%), AWS (83%), and GPT-4o (79%). Beyond accuracy, Healthcare NLP is also the most cost-effective solution, reducing processing costs by over 80% compared to Azure and GPT-4o. Its fixed-cost local deployment model avoids the escalating per-request fees of cloud-based services, making it a scalable and economical choice. Our results underscore a critical limitation: zero-shot commercial APIs fail to meet the accuracy, adaptability, and cost-efficiency required for regulatory-grade clinical de-identification. Healthcare NLP's superior performance, customization capabilities, and economic advantages position it as the more viable solution for healthcare organizations seeking compliance and scalability in clinical NLP workflows.</description>

      <title>Network Density Analysis of Health Seeking Behavior in Metro Manila: A Retrospective Analysis on COVID-19 Google Trends Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examined the temporal aspect of COVID-19-related health-seeking behavior in Metro Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines through a network density analysis of Google Trends data. A total of 15 keywords across five categories (English symptoms, Filipino symptoms, face wearing, quarantine, and new normal) were examined using both 15-day and 30-day rolling windows from March 2020 to March 2021. The methodology involved constructing network graphs using distance correlation coefficients at varying thresholds (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8) and analyzing the time-series data of network density and clustering coefficients. Results revealed three key findings: (1) an inverse relationship between the threshold values and network metrics, indicating that higher thresholds provide more meaningful keyword relationships; (2) exceptionally high network connectivity during the initial pandemic months followed by gradual decline; and (3) distinct patterns in keyword relationships, transitioning from policy-focused searches to more symptom-specific queries as the pandemic temporally progressed. The 30-day window analysis showed more stable, but less search activities compared to the 15-day windows, suggesting stronger correlations in immediate search behaviors. These insights are helpful for health communication because it emphasizes the need of a strategic and conscientious information dissemination from the government or the private sector based on the networked search behavior (e.g. prioritizing to inform select symptoms rather than an overview of what the coronavirus is).</description>

      <title>Ontology Matching with Large Language Models and Prioritized Depth-First Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ontology matching (OM) plays a key role in enabling data interoperability and knowledge sharing, but it remains challenging due to the need for large training datasets and limited vocabulary processing in machine learning approaches. Recently, methods based on Large Language Model (LLMs) have shown great promise in OM, particularly through the use of a retrieve-then-prompt pipeline. In this approach, relevant target entities are first retrieved and then used to prompt the LLM to predict the final matches. Despite their potential, these systems still present limited performance and high computational overhead. To address these issues, we introduce MILA, a novel approach that embeds a retrieve-identify-prompt pipeline within a prioritized depth-first search (PDFS) strategy. This approach efficiently identifies a large number of semantic correspondences with high accuracy, limiting LLM requests to only the most borderline cases. We evaluated MILA using the biomedical challenge proposed in the 2023 and 2024 editions of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Our method achieved the highest F-Measure in four of the five unsupervised tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art OM systems by up to 17%. It also performed better than or comparable to the leading supervised OM systems. MILA further exhibited task-agnostic performance, remaining stable across all tasks and settings, while significantly reducing LLM requests. These findings highlight that high-performance LLM-based OM can be achieved through a combination of programmed (PDFS), learned (embedding vectors), and prompting-based heuristics, without the need of domain-specific heuristics or fine-tuning.</description>
