      <title>Project Hermes: A Model-Agnostic Validation Layer for Wearable Health Prediction Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of wearable-based health prediction systems has accelerated rapidly, yet these systems face a fundamental challenge: they generate alerts under substantial uncertainty without principled mechanisms for user-specific validation. While large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to healthcare tasks, existing work focuses predominantly on diagnosis generation and risk prediction rather than post-prediction validation of detected signals. We introduce Project Hermes, a model-agnostic validation layer that treats signal confirmation as a sequential decision problem. Hermes operates downstream of arbitrary upstream predictors, using LLM-generated contextual queries to elicit targeted user feedback and performing Bayesian confidence updates to distinguish true positives from false alarms. In a 60-day longitudinal case study of migraine prediction, Hermes achieved a 34% reduction in false positive rate (from 61.7% to 12.5%) while maintaining 89% sensitivity, with mean lead time of 4.2 hours before symptom onset. Critically, Hermes does not perform diagnosis or make novel predictions; it validates whether signals detected by upstream models are clinically meaningful for specific individuals at specific times. This work establishes validation as a first-class computational problem distinct from prediction, with implications for trustworthy deployment of consumer health AI systems.</description>

      <title>AAVGen: Precision Engineering of Adeno-associated Viral Capsids for Renal Selective Targeting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are promising vectors for gene therapy, but their native serotypes face limitations in tissue tropism, immune evasion, and production efficiency. Engineering capsids to overcome these hurdles is challenging due to the vast sequence space and the difficulty of simultaneously optimizing multiple functional properties. The complexity also adds when it comes to the kidney, which presents unique anatomical barriers and cellular targets that require precise and efficient vector engineering. Here, we present AAVGen, a generative artificial intelligence framework for de novo design of AAV capsids with enhanced multi-trait profiles. AAVGen integrates a protein language model (PLM) with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and a reinforcement learning technique termed Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO). The model is guided by a composite reward signal derived from three ESM-2-based regression predictors, each trained to predict a key property: production fitness, kidney tropism, and thermostability. Our results demonstrate that AAVGen produces a diverse library of novel VP1 protein sequences. In silico validations revealed that the majority of the generated variants have superior performance across all three employed indices, indicating successful multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, structural analysis via AlphaFold3 confirms that the generated sequences preserve the canonical capsid folding despite sequence diversification. AAVGen establishes a foundation for data-driven viral vector engineering, accelerating the development of next-generation AAV vectors with tailored functional characteristics.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Data-Driven Model of the Flight Dynamics of Hawks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant analysis of bird flight, generative physics models for flight dynamics do not currently exist. Yet the underlying mechanisms responsible for various flight manoeuvres are important for understanding how agile flight can be accomplished. Even in a simple flight, multiple objectives are at play, complicating analysis of the overall flight mechanism. Using the data-driven method of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) on motion capture recordings of hawks, we show that multiple behavioral states such as flapping, turning, landing, and gliding, can be modeled by simple and interpretable modal structures (i.e. the underlying wing-tail shape) which can be linearly combined to reproduce the experimental flight observations. Moreover, the DMD model can be used to extrapolate naturalistic flapping. Flight is highly individual, with differences in style across the hawks, but we find they share a common set of dynamic modes. The DMD model is a direct fit to data, unlike traditional models constructed from physics principles which can rarely be tested on real data and whose assumptions are typically invalid in real flight. The DMD approach gives a highly accurate reconstruction of the flight dynamics with only three parameters needed to characterize flapping, and a fourth to integrate turning manoeuvres. The DMD analysis further shows that the underlying mechanism of flight, much like simplest walking models, displays a parametric coupling between dominant modes suggesting efficiency for locomotion.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Hazard Patterns and Co-Mutation Profiles of KRAS G12C and G12D in Real-World NSCLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: KRAS mutations are the largest oncogenic subset in NSCLC. While KRAS G12C is now targetable, no approved therapies exist for G12D. We examined time-to-next-treatment (TTNT) and overall survival (OS) differences between G12C and G12D, allowing for time-varying hazard effects. Methods: De-identified data from AACR Project GENIE BPC NSCLC v2.0-public were analyzed. TTNT served as a real-world surrogate for progression-free survival. Co-mutations (TP53, STK11, KEAP1, SMARCA4, MET), TMB, and PD-L1 were harmonized. Kaplan-Meier, multivariable Cox, and a pre-specified piecewise Cox model (split at median TTNT = 23 months) were applied. Schoenfeld residuals assessed proportional hazards; bootstrap resampling (B=1000) evaluated stability. Results: Among 162 TTNT-evaluable patients (G12C n=130; G12D n=32), median TTNT was 28.6 versus 32.0 months (log-rank p=0.79). Adjusted Cox regression showed no overall hazard difference (HR=0.85; 95% CI 0.53-1.37; p=0.50), but Schoenfeld testing indicated borderline non-proportionality (p=0.053). Piecewise Cox modeling revealed time-varying effects: early TTNT hazard favored G12D (HR=0.41; 95% CI 0.17-0.97; p=0.043) with significant KRAS x period interaction (HR=3.33; p=0.021) and late-period attenuation (HR=1.38; 95% CI 0.77-2.47; p=0.285). Bootstrap resampling confirmed this pattern (median HRearly=0.39; HRlate=1.41). Among 278 OS-evaluable patients (133 deaths), G12D showed improved OS (adjusted HR=0.63; 95% CI 0.39-0.99; p=0.048). G12C tumors exhibited higher TMB (9.79 vs 7.83 mut/Mb; p=0.002) and greater STK11/KEAP1 enrichment. Conclusions: KRAS G12D demonstrated early TTNT advantage and improved OS. Late-period TTNT differences were non-significant (post-hoc power: 12.3%). These exploratory findings require validation in larger cohorts but support allele-specific therapeutic development for G12D.</description>

      <title>Exact Discrete Stochastic Simulation with Deep-Learning-Scale Gradient Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exact stochastic simulation of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) is essential when discreteness and noise drive system behavior, but the hard categorical event selection in Gillespie-type algorithms blocks gradient-based learning. We eliminate this constraint by decoupling forward simulation from backward differentiation, with hard categorical sampling generating exact trajectories and gradients propagating through a continuous massively-parallel Gumbel-Softmax straight-through surrogate. Our approach enables accurate optimization at parameter scales over four orders of magnitude beyond existing simulators. We validate for accuracy, scalability, and reliability on a reversible dimerization model (0.09% error), a genetic oscillator (1.2% error), a 203,796-parameter gene regulatory network achieving 98.4% MNIST accuracy (a prototypical deep-learning multilayer perceptron benchmark), and experimental patch-clamp recordings of ion channel gating (R^2 = 0.987) in the single-channel regime. Our GPU implementation delivers 1.9 billion steps per second, matching the scale of non-differentiable simulators. By making exact stochastic simulation massively parallel and autodiff-compatible, our results enable high-dimensional parameter inference and inverse design across systems biology, chemical kinetics, physics, and related CTMC-governed domains.</description>

      <title>Physiologically Informed Deep Learning: A Multi-Scale Framework for Next-Generation PBPK Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a cornerstone of model-informed drug development (MIDD), providing a mechanistic framework to predict drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Despite its utility, adoption is hindered by high computational costs for large-scale simulations, difficulty in parameter identification for complex biological systems, and uncertainty in interspecies extrapolation. In this work, we propose a unified Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework that bridges mechanistic rigor and data-driven flexibility. We introduce three contributions: (1) Foundation PBPK Transformers, which treat pharmacokinetic forecasting as a sequence modeling task; (2) Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models (PCDM), a generative approach that uses a physics-informed loss to synthesize biologically compliant virtual patient populations; and (3) Neural Allometry, a hybrid architecture combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Neural ODEs to learn continuous cross-species scaling laws. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% under constraints while offering a path to faster simulation.</description>

      <title>Statistical methods for reference-free single-molecule localisation microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MINFLUX (Minimal Photon Flux) is a single-molecule imaging technique capable of resolving fluorophores at a precision of &lt;5 nm. Interpretation of the point patterns generated by this technique presents challenges due to variable emitter density, incomplete bio-labelling of target molecules and their detection, error prone measurement processes, and the presence of spurious (non-structure associated) fluorescent detections. Together, these challenges ensure structural inferences from single-molecule imaging datasets are non-trivial in the absence of strong a priori information, for all but the smallest of point patterns. In addition, current methods often require subjective parameter tuning and presuppose known structural templates, limiting reference-free discovery. We present a statistically grounded, end-to-end analysis framework. Focusing on MINFLUX derived datasets and leveraging Bayesian and spatial statistical methods, a pipeline is presented that demonstrates 1) uncertainty aware clustering of measurements into emitter groups that performs better than current gold standards, 2) rapid identification of molecular structure supergroups, and 3) reconstruction of repeating structures within the dataset without substantial prior knowledge. This pipeline is demonstrated using simulated and real MINFLUX datasets, where emitter clustering and centre detection maintain high performance (emitter subset assignment accuracy &gt; 0.75) across all conditions evaluated, while structural inference achieves reliable discrimination (F1 approx. 0.9) at high labelling efficiency. Template-free reconstruction of Nup96 and DNA-Origami 3x3 grids are achieved.</description>

      <title>Compositional amortized inference for large-scale hierarchical Bayesian models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14429v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amortized Bayesian inference (ABI) with neural networks has emerged as a powerful simulation-based approach for estimating complex mechanistic models. However, extending ABI to hierarchical models, a cornerstone of modern Bayesian analysis, has been a major hurdle due to the need to simulate and process massive datasets. Our study tackles these challenges by extending compositional score matching (CSM), a divide-and-conquer strategy for Bayesian updating using diffusion models. We develop a new error-damping estimator to address previous stability issues of CSM when aggregating large numbers of data points. We first verified the numerical stability with up to 100,000 data points on a controlled benchmark. We then evaluated our method on a hierarchical AR model, achieving competitive performance to direct ABI baselines on smaller problem sizes while using less than one full model simulation for larger problem sizes. Finally, we address a large-scale inverse problem in advanced microscopy with over 750,000 parameters, demonstrating its relevance to real scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Apparent Selection Pressure for Dynamic Range and Channel Capacity in Bacterial Chemotactic Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial chemotactic sensing converts noisy chemical signals into running and tumbling. We analyze the static sensing limits of mixed Tar/Tsr chemoreceptor clusters in individual Escherichia coli cells using a heterogeneous Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. By sweeping a seven-dimensional parameter space, we compute three sensing performance metrics-channel capacity, dynamic range, and effective Hill coefficient. Across E. coli-like parameter regimes, we consistently observe pronounced global maxima of channel capacity and global maxima of the related dynamic range, whereas the effective Hill coefficient does not exhibit comparable optimization. The capacity-achieving input distribution is bimodal, which implies that individual cells maximize information by sampling both low- and high-concentration regimes. Together, these results suggest that, at the individual-cell level, channel capacity and dynamic range may be selected for in E. coli receptor clusters.</description>

      <title>AntibodyDesignBFN: High-Fidelity Fixed-Backbone Antibody Design via Discrete Bayesian Flow Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The computational design of antibodies with high specificity and affinity is a cornerstone of modern therapeutic development. While deep generative models have demonstrated potential, they often struggle to balance high-fidelity geometric conditioning with the discrete nature of amino acid sequences. In this work, we present AntibodyDesignBFN, a novel framework for fixed-backbone antibody design based on Discrete Bayesian Flow Networks (BFN). Unlike standard diffusion models, BFNs operate on a continuous probability simplex, enabling a fully differentiable generative process that seamlessly integrates geometric gradients. By combining a lightweight Geometric Transformer with Invariant Point Attention (IPA) and a resource-efficient training strategy, our model establishes a new state-of-the-art. Evaluations on a rigorous 2025 temporal test set (43 complexes) demonstrate that AntibodyDesignBFN achieves an unprecedented Amino Acid Recovery(AAR) of 67.8%, significantly outperforming leading graph-based baselines. Furthermore, the model is highly efficient, enabling millisecond-scale inference on consumer-grade hardware. AntibodyDesignBFN thus offers a powerful, accessible, and mathematically robust framework for next generation antibody engineering. Code and model checkpoints are available at https://github.com/YueHuLab/AntibodyDesignBFN and https://huggingface.co/YueHuLab/AntibodyDesignBFN.</description>

      <title>VillageNet: Graph-based, Easily-interpretable, Unsupervised Clustering for Broad Biomedical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clustering large high-dimensional datasets with diverse variable is essential for extracting high-level latent information from these datasets. Here, we developed an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we call "Village-Net". Village-Net is specifically designed to effectively cluster high-dimension data without priori knowledge on the number of existing clusters. The algorithm operates in two phases: first, utilizing K-Means clustering, it divides the dataset into distinct subsets we refer to as "villages". Next, a weighted network is created, with each node representing a village, capturing their proximity relationships. To achieve optimal clustering, we process this network using a community detection algorithm called Walk-likelihood Community Finder (WLCF), a community detection algorithm developed by one of our team members. A salient feature of Village-Net Clustering is its ability to autonomously determine an optimal number of clusters for further analysis based on inherent characteristics of the data. We present extensive benchmarking on extant real-world datasets with known ground-truth labels to showcase its competitive performance, particularly in terms of the normalized mutual information (NMI) score, when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm is computationally efficient, boasting a time complexity of O(N*k*d), where N signifies the number of instances, k represents the number of villages and d represents the dimension of the dataset, which makes it well suited for effectively handling large-scale datasets.</description>
