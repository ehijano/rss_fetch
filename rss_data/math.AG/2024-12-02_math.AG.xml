      <title>Phase limit sets of linear spaces and discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the closure of the coamoeba of a linear space/hyperplane complement is the union of products of coamoebas of hyperplane complements coming from flags of flats, and relate this to the Bergman fan. Using the Horn-Kapranov parameterization of a reduced discriminant, this gives a partial description of the phase limit sets of discriminants and duals of toric varieties. When d=3, we show that each 3-dimensional component of the phase limit set of the discriminant is a prism over a discriminant coamoeba in dimension 2, which has a polyhedral description by a result of Nilsson and Passare.</description>

      <title>On the Goppa morphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the geometric foundations of the space of geometric Goppa codes using the Tsfasman-Vladut H-construction. These codes are constructed from level structures, which extend the classical Goppa framework by incorporating invertible sheaves and trivializations. A key contribution is the definition of the Goppa morphism, a map from the moduli space of level structures, denoted $LS_{g,n,d}$, to the Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$. This morphism allows problems related to distinguishing attacks and key recovery in the context of geometric Goppa codes to be translated into a geometric language, addressing questions about the equations defining the image of the Goppa morphism and its fibers. Furthermore, we identify the ranges of the degree parameter $d$ that should be avoided to maintain security against distinguishers. Our results, valid over arbitrary base fields, also apply to convolutional Goppa codes.</description>

      <title>Categorical resolutions of cuspidal singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a projective variety with an isolated $A_2$ singularity. We study its bounded derived category and prove that there exists a crepant categorical resolution $\pi_*\colon \widetilde{\mathcal{D}} \to D^b(X)$, which is a Verdier localization. More importantly, we give an explicit description of a generating set for its kernel. In the case of an even dimensional variety with a single $A_2$ singularity, we prove that this generating set is given by two $2$-spherical objects. If $X$ is a cubic fourfold with an isolated $A_2$ singularity, we show that this resolution restricts to a crepant categorical resolution $\widetilde{\mathcal{A}}_X$ of the Kuznetsov component $\mathcal{A}_X \subset D^b(X)$, which is equivalent to the bounded derived category of a K3 surface.</description>

      <title>Euler Discriminant of Complements of Hyperplanes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler discriminant of a family of very affine varieties is defined as the locus where the Euler characteristic drops. In this work, we study the Euler discriminant of families of complements of hyperplanes. We prove that the Euler discriminant is a hypersurface in the space of coefficients, and provide its defining equation in two cases: (1) when the coefficients are generic, and (2) when they are constrained to a proper subspace. In the generic case, we show that the multiplicities of the components can be recovered combinatorially. This analysis also recovers the singularities of an Euler integral. In the appendix, we discuss a relation to cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>The integral identity conjecture in motivic homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integral identity conjecture of Kontsevich and Soibelman plays an important role in proving the existence of motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants for three-dimensional noncommutative Calabi-Yau manifolds. There are a number of different formulations of this conjecture in different contexts and accordingly, there are corresponding solutions to them. The methods devoted to solving this conjecture are diverse, ranging from $\ell$-adic cohomology of rigid analytic varieties to Hrushovski-Kazhdan motivic integration and motivic Fubini theorem for tropicalization maps,... In a recent work, Ivorra deduces a functorial version of the integral identity in the stable homotopy of schemes, from the Braden hyperbolic localization theorem. This functorial version concerns Ayoub's nearby cycles functor associated with a $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant function $f \colon X \longrightarrow \mathbb{A}^1$ on vector bundles with a linear action of $\mathbb{G}_m$ on algebraic varieties over a field of characteristic zero. In the present work, we follow the functorial approach by Ivorra and extend the scope of the original conjecture by Kontsevich and Soibelman by studying more generally the case of $\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant functions on algebraic $S$-spaces with a $\tau$-locally linearizable action of $\mathbb{G}_m$ over a noetherian scheme $S$ and extend the functorial integral identity to these cases. Our result is functorial, it allows more flexibity on the characteristic of the base scheme and the formulation exists in the world of motives which can realizes to other settings, e.g., \'etale realization, Betti realization, virtual motives... We also prove a result which is independent of interest and already appears in the work of others, namely, the motivic version of the functorial compatibility of the Bernstein isomorphisms with constant term functors.</description>

      <title>Stability condition on a singular surface and its resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a surface with an ADE-singularity and let $\widetilde{X}$ be its crepant resolution. In this paper, we show that there exists a Bridgeland stability condition $\sigma_X$ on ${\rm D}^b(X)$ and a weak stability condition $\sigma_{\widetilde{X}}$ on the derived category of the desingularisation ${\rm D}^b(\widetilde{X})$, such that pushforward of $\sigma_{\widetilde{X}}$-semistable objects are $\sigma_X$-semistable
  We first construct Bridgeland stability conditions on ${\rm D}^b(\widetilde{X})$ associated to the contraction $\widetilde{X} \longrightarrow X$, generalizing the results of Tramel and Xia in \cite{TX22}, Then we deform it to a weak stability condition $\sigma_{\widetilde{X}}$ and show that it descends to ${\rm D}^b(X)$, producing the stability condition $\sigma_X$.</description>

      <title>Geometry of fibers of the multiplication map of deep linear neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of the algebraic set of tuples of composable matrices which multiply to a fixed matrix, using tools from the theory of quiver representations. In particular, we determine its codimension $C$ and the number $\theta$ of its top-dimensional irreducible components. Our solution is presented in three forms: a Poincar\'e series in equivariant cohomology, a quadratic integer program, and an explicit formula. In the course of the proof, we establish a surprising property: $C$ and $\theta$ are invariant under arbitrary permutations of the dimension vector. We also show that the real log-canonical threshold of the function taking a tuple to the square Frobenius norm of its product is $C/2$. These results are motivated by the study of deep linear neural networks in machine learning and Bayesian statistics (singular learning theory) and show that deep linear networks are in a certain sense ``mildly singular".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically study relative and absolute ${\Delta}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-crystals on the (log-) prismatic site of a smooth (resp.~ semi-stable) formal scheme. Using explicit computation of stratifications, we classify (local) relative crystals by certain nilpotent connections, and classify (local) absolute crystals by certain enhanced connections. By using a $p$-adic Riemann--Hilbert functor and an infinite dimensional Sen theory over the Kummer tower, we globalize the results on absolute crystals and further classify them by certain small (global) $\mathbb{B}_{\mathrm{dR}}^+$-local systems.</description>

      <title>The Unipotent Chabauty-Kim-Kantor Method for Relative Completions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kantor's Thesis was the first step in unifying the Chabauty-Kim and Lawrence-Venkatesh methods via relative completion. In this work, we refine Kantor's approach by addressing its limitations, achieving the first unification where a dimension inequality between local and global Galois cohomology implies Diophantine finiteness for curves. This results in a new conditional proof of Faltings' and Siegel's theorems and introduces a novel p-adic analytic method for computing rational points on hyperbolic curves, offering advantages over the Chabauty-Kim and Lawrence-Venkatesh approaches.
  Our technical contributions are threefold. First, we establish the density of Kantor's p-adic period map. Second, our method applies to all curves of genus g &gt;= 2, extending beyond the specific modular curves considered in Kantor's thesis. Third, we resolve the representability problem for Kantor's global Selmer stack. Previously, Kantor's method required additional conjectures in p-adic Hodge theory to represent his Selmer stack--a priori a rigid analytic stack--in a category with a suitable dimension theory. We overcome this by replacing the unipotent completions used in Kim's framework with the unipotent radicals of Kantor's relative completions, derived from monodromy representations associated with the relative cohomology of a Kodaira-Parshin family.
  Kantor's method is a step toward the Effective Faltings Problem, which seeks not only to establish finiteness of rational points on hyperbolic curves but to compute them explicitly. While the Lawrence-Venkatesh method is unconditional, it has not yet been made effective for any curve. In contrast, the Chabauty-Kim method, though conditional, has been made effective in various settings. Our Unipotent Chabauty-Kim-Kantor method addresses key challenges in Kantor's program and highlights its potential for both theoretical and computational advances.</description>

      <title>On the perturbations of Noetherian local domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how the properties of being reduced, integral domain, and normal, behave under small perturbations of the defining equations of a noetherian local ring. It is not hard to show that the property of being a local integral domain (reduced, normal ring) is not stable under small perturbations in general. We prove that perturbation stability holds in the following situations: (1) perturbation of being an integral domain for factorial excellent Henselian local rings; (2) perturbation of normality for excellent local complete intersections containing a field of characteristic zero; and (3) perturbation of reducedness for excellent local complete intersections containing a field of characteristic zero, and for factorial Nagata local rings.</description>

      <title>On the Rich Landscape of Complete Intersection Monomial Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this survey is to explore complete intersection monomial curves from a contemporary perspective. The main goal is to help readers understand the intricate connections within the field and its potential applications. The properties of any monomial curve singularity will be first reviewed, highlighting the interaction between combinatorial and algebraic properties. Next, we will revisit the two main characterizations of complete intersection monomial curves. One is based on deep algebraic properties given by Herzog and Kunz in 1971, while the other is based on a combinatorial approach given by Delorme in 1976. Our aim is to bridge the gap between these perspectives present in the current literature. Then, we will focus on recent advances that show an intriguing connection between numerical semigroups and Alexander polynomials of knots. Finally, we will revisit the deformation theory of these curves and provide an answer to a question posed by Buchweitz and Greuel regarding curve deformations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study and classify representations of a torsion group $G$ over an idempotent semifield with special attention on the case over the Boolean semifield $\mathbb{B}$. We also study tropical subrepresentations of the Boolean regular representation $\mathbb{B}[G]$ of a finite group $G$. These are equivalent to the matroids on ground set $G$ for which left-multiplication by each element of $G$ is a matroid automorphism. We completely classify the tropical subrepresentations of $\mathbb{B}[G]$ for rank 3. When $G$ is an abelian group, our approach can be seen as a generalization of Golomb rulers. In doing so, we also introduce an interesting class of matroids obtained from equivalence relations on finite sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore several facets of tropical subrepresentations of a linear representation of a group over the tropical semifield $\mathbb{T}$. A key role in the study of tropical subrepresentations is played by two types of modules over a semiring: weakly free and quasi-free modules. We also investigate subgroups of $\text{GL}_n(K)$ for $K=\mathbb{T}$, $ \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, and automorphisms of weakly free modules and tropical prevarieties defined by tropical linear equations. As an application of our results, we provide an intrinsic description of tropical subrepresentation via certain quasi-free modules, and prove that a tropical subrepresentation is equivalent to a valuated matroidal representation.</description>

Abstract: We define an $\infty$-category $\mathrm{CycSyn}$ of $p$-typical cyclotomic synthetic spectra and prove that the motivic filtration on $\mathrm{THH}(R;\mathbf{Z}_p)$, defined by Bhatt, Morrow, and Scholze when $R$ is quasisyntomic and by Hahn, Raksit, and Wilson in the chromatically quasisyntomic case, naturally admits the structure of a $p$-typical cyclotomic synthetic spectrum. As a consequence, we obtain new bounds on the syntomic cohomology of connective chromatically quasisyntomic $\mathbf{E}_\infty$-ring spectra.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Compactification of a Cartan Subalgebra of a Semisimple Lie Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak h$ be a Cartan subalgebra of a complex semisimple Lie algebra $\mathfrak g.$ We define a compactification $\bar{\mathfrak h}$ of $\mathfrak h$, which is analogous to the closure $\bar H$ of the corresponding maximal torus $H$ in the adjoint group of $\mathfrak g$ in its wonderful compactification, which was introduced and studied by De Concini and Procesi \cite{DCP}. We determine the irreducible components of the boundary $\bar{\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ of $\mathfrak h$ in terms of certain maximal root subsystems described by Borel-de Siebenthal theory. We prove that $\bar{\mathfrak h} - \mathfrak h$ is equidimensional, and we prove that $\bar{\mathfrak h}$ is a normal variety. As a consequence, we find an affine paving of $\bar{\mathfrak h}$, and when $\mathfrak g$ is classical, we determine the number of strata in each dimension in terms of Stirling numbers and their variants, thereby computing the Betti numbers of $\bar{\mathfrak h}.$ In the general case, we relate the order relation on strata given by closures of strata to the poset of hyperplane arrangements studied by Orlik and Solomon, and determine the cup product in the cohomology of $\bar{\mathfrak h}.$ Our work has similarities to results of Braden et al \cite{BHMPW} on matroid Schubert varieties, but the connection to root systems facilitates greater precision in some of our results.</description>

We show that, if there exist a meromorphic fibration $\pi \colon X\dashrightarrow B$ and a pseudo-automorphism $f_B\colon B\dashrightarrow B$ which preserves a big line bundle $L\in Pic(B)$ and such that $f_B\circ \pi=\pi\circ f$, then $f_B$ has finite order.
  As a corollary we show that, for projective irreducible symplectic manifolds of type $K3^{[n]}$ or generalized Kummer, the first dynamical degree characterizes the birational transformations admitting a Zariski-dense orbit.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of multi-scale differentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:1910.13492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a compactification of the moduli spaces of abelian differentials on Riemann surfaces with prescribed zeroes and poles. This compactification, called the moduli space of multi-scale differentials, is a complex orbifold with normal crossing boundary. Locally, our compactification can be described as the normalization of an explicit blowup of the incidence variety compactification, which was defined in [BCGGM18] as the closure of the stratum of abelian differentials in the closure of the Hodge bundle. We also define families of projectivized multi-scale differentials, which gives a proper Deligne-Mumford stack, and our compactification is the orbifold corresponding to it. Moreover, we perform a real oriented blowup of the unprojectivized moduli space of multi-scale differentials such that the $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb R)$-action in the interior of the moduli space extends continuously to the boundary.</description>

      <title>On the local behavior of weighted orbital integrals and the affine Springer fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.15091v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper deals with two problems that seem to be of different nature: the local behavior of the weighted orbital integrals and the dependence of the affine Springer fibers on the root valuation datum of their defining elements. The intersection happens when we try to count the number of points on the fundamental domains of the affine Springer fibers: the number of points can be expressed in terms of certain weighted orbital integrals and vice versa.
  For the first problem, we prove the homogeneity of the Arthur-Shalika germ expansion of the weighted orbital integrals, and establish its parabolic descent. This is then applied to our conjecture about the dependence of the Poincar\'e polynomials of the fundamental domains on the root valuation datum. We show that the generating series of the number of points on the fundamental domains with respect to the root valuation datum of the defining elements is a rational fraction, and we bound its denominator with datum associated to the nilpotent orbits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variant of the Peskine--Szpiro Acyclicity Lemma, and hence a way to certify exactness of a complex of finite modules over a large class of (possibly) noncommutative rings. Specifically, over the class of Auslander regular rings. In the case of relative $\mathscr{D}_{X}$-modules, for example $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s_{1}, \dots, s_{r}]$-modules, the hypotheses have geometric realizations making them easier to authenticate. We demonstrate the efficacy of this lemma and its various forms by: independently recovering some results related to Bernstein--Sato polynomials; establishing a new result about quasi-free structures of free multi-derivations of hyperplane arrangements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.14881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the topological Milnor fibration and the motivic Milnor fibre of a regular complex function with only normal crossing singularities by introducing their common extension: the complete Milnor fibration. We give two equivalent constructions: the first one extending the classical Kato-Nakayama log-space, and the second one, more geometric, based on the real oriented multigraph construction, a version of the real oriented deformation to the normal cone. As an application, we recover A'Campo's model of the topological Milnor fibration, by quotienting the motivic Milnor fibration with suitable powers of $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, and show that it determines the classical motivic Milnor fibre.
  We also give precise formulae expressing how the introduced objects change under blowings-up. As an application, we show that the motivic Milnor fibre is well-defined as an element of a suitable Grothendieck ring without requiring that the Lefschetz motive be invertible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09418v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate homologically finite-dimensional objects in the derived category of a given small dg-enhanced triangulated category. Using these we define reflexivity, hfd-closedness, and the Gorenstein property for triangulated categories, and discuss crepant categorical contractions. We illustrate the introduced notions on examples of categories of geometric and algebraic origin and provide geometric applications. In particular, we apply our results to prove a bijection between semiorthogonal decompositions of the derived category of a singular variety and the derived category of its smoothing with support on the central fiber.</description>

      <title>The geometric exceptional set in Manin's conjecture for Batyrev and Tschinkel's example</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Batyrev and Tschinkel's example is a Fermat cubic surface bundle $X$ which is a Fano $5$-fold. It is the first example for which Manin's conjecture can never hold for a proper closed exceptional set. Recently, Lehmann, Sengupta, and Tanimoto proposed a conjectural geometric description of the exceptional set in Manin's conjecture and showed that it is always contained in a thin set. Over a field of characteristic $0$, we explicitly construct finitely many thin maps such that any thin map $f:Y\rightarrow X$ with equal or larger $a$- and $b$-values in lexicographical order factors rationally through one of them. In particular, this defines a thin set which coincides with Lehmann-Sengupta-Tanimoto's conjectural exceptional set.</description>

      <title>Bernstein--Sato polynomials of locally quasi-homogeneous divisors in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of a locally quasi-homogeneous polynomial $f \in R = \mathbb{C}[x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}]$. We construct, in the analytic category, a complex of $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s]$-modules that can be used to compute the $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s]$-dual of $\mathscr{D}_{X}[s] f^{s-1}$ as the middle term of a short exact sequence where the outer terms are well understood. This extends a result by Narv\'{a}ez Macarro where a freeness assumption was required.
  We derive many results about the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial. First, we prove each nonvanishing degree of the zeroeth local cohomology of the Milnor algebra $H_{\mathfrak{m}}^{0} (R / (\partial f))$ contributes a root to the Bernstein--Sato polynomial, generalizing a result of M. Saito's (where the argument cannot weaken homogeneity to quasi-homogeneity). Second, we prove the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial admit a partial symmetry about $-1$, extending a result of Narv\'{a}ez Macarro that again required freeness. We give applications to very small roots, the twisted Logarithmic Comparison Theorem, and more precise statements when $f$ is additionally assumed to be homogeneous.
  Finally, when $f$ defines a hyperplane arrangement in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$ we give a complete formula for the zeroes of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial of $f$. We show all zeroes except the candidate root $-2 + (2 / \text{deg}(f))$ are (easily) combinatorially given; we give many equivalent characterizations of when the only non-combinatorial candidate root $-2 + (2/ \text{deg}(f))$ is in fact a zero of the Bernstein--Sato polynomial. One equivalent condition is the nonvanishing of $H_{\mathfrak{m}}^{0}( R / (\partial f))_{\text{deg}(f) - 1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Yanchevski\u{i} had asked whether conic bundle surfaces over $\mathbf{P}^1_k$ are unirational when $k$ is a finite field. We give a partial answer to his question by showing that for quasi-finite fields $k$ (e.g. finite fields) a regular conic bundle $X$ over $\mathbf{P}^1_k$ is unirational if all non-split fibres lie over rational points. For large finite fields $k$, this beats a previous result of Mestre. Under the same assumption, we also prove that all rational points of $X$ are $R$-equivalent.</description>

In particular, we study the category of equivariant coherent sheaves on a regular projective curve whose quotient curve has genus zero and prove existence of a tilting object in this case. We also give a link between wallpaper groups and real hereditary curves, providing details to an old observation made by Helmut Lenzing.</description>

We show that two surface germs in $\mathbb{R}^3$, Lipschitz normally embedded and with isolated singularity, are ambient bi-Lipschitz equivalent if, and only if, they are outer bi-Lipschitz equivalent and ambient topologically equivalent.</description>

Abstract: The space of degree d smooth projective hypersurfaces of CP n admits a scanning map to a certain space of sections. We compute a rational homotopy model of the action by conjugation of the group U (n + 1) on this space of sections, from which we deduce that the scanning map induces a monomorphism on cohomology when d &gt; 2. Our main technique is the rational homotopy theory of Sullivan and, more specifically, a Sullivan model for the action by conjugation of a connected topological group on a space of sections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $a$ be an integer which is not of the form $n^2$ or $-3 n^2$ for $n\in \mathbb{Z}$. Let $E_a$ be the elliptic curve with rational $3$-isogeny defined by $E_a:y^2=x^3+a$, and $K:=\mathbb{Q}(\mu_3)$. Assume that the $3$-Selmer group of $E_a$ over $K$ vanishes. It is shown that there is an explicit infinite set of cubefree integers $m$ such that the $3$-Selmer groups over $K$ of $E_{m^2 a}$ and $E_{m^4 a}$ both vanish. In particular, the ranks of these cubic twists are seen to be $0$ over $K$. Our results are proven by studying stability properties of $3$-Selmer groups in cyclic cubic extensions of $K$, via local and global Galois cohomological techniques.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the standard comparison used by mathematicians between the idempotent complete pretriangulated dg-categories, over a unitary and commutative ring $k$, and the idempotent complete $k$-linear stable $\infty$-categories. Our approach is completely included in the $\infty$-categorical theory. To achieve the target we will reinterpret the Morita theory for dg-categories and we set the Morita theory for $k$-linear stable $\infty$-category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The modularity of an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb Q$ can be expressed either as an analytic statement that the $L$-function is the Mellin transform of a modular form, or as a geometric statement that $E$ is a quotient of a modular curve $X_0(N)$. For elliptic curves over number fields these notions diverge; a conjecture of Hamahata asserts that for every elliptic curve $E$ over a totally real number field there is a correspondence between a Hilbert modular variety and the product of the conjugates of $E$. In this paper we prove the conjecture by explicit computation for many cases where $E$ is defined over a real quadratic field and the geometric genus of the Hilbert modular variety is $1$.</description>
