      <title>Creating attosecond breathing ions by coherent shake-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shake-up is a fundamental phenomenon in photoionisation of many-electron systems whereby the ionisation of one electron is accompanied by the simultaneous excitation of another. As a single-photon two-electron excitation, it is the most basic manifestation of electron correlation in nature. In a standard experiment using, for example, a synchrotron light source, shake-up states are populated incoherently and their relative excitation intensities describe the process completely. In this work, we use high-accuracy ab initio theoretical methods to show that the physics of shake-up differs qualitatively when ionisation is achieved with an attosecond pulse such as those produced by free-electron laser or high-harmonic generation sources. These coherent light sources possess sufficient bandwidth to enable the new phenomenon of coherent shake-up, a process whose result cannot be described solely by the shake-up state populations. We show theoretically that the ensuing coherent many-electron wavepackets exhibit attosecond quantum beats in the form of a radial expansion and contraction of the electron density which we term "breathing ions". We predict that such attosecond oscillatory dynamics will persist for as long as nanoseconds before being damped by radiative decay. Our modelling shows that the predicted coherent shake-up dynamics are readily measurable by presently available attosecond-pump attosecond-probe techniques.</description>

      <title>The role of spatiotemporal couplings in harmonic vortex generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the impact of spatiotemporal couplings (STCs) on high-order harmonic generation (HHG) driven by spatiotemporal vortex beams. Our investigation demonstrates how STCs shape key properties of the generated harmonic beams, including their intensity distribution and different chirps. By analyzing these chirps, we establish a clear connection between STCs and the observed harmonic structures. Furthermore, we examine the HHG process in both the near- and far-fields, identifying the conditions under which these perspectives align and provide consistent results. By clarifying the role of spatiotemporal vortex beams in HHG, this work contributes to a broader understanding of the interplay between spatiotemporal effects and harmonic generation, while offering a framework to merge differing interpretations in the literature.</description>

      <title>Atomic Transition Probabilities for UV and Optical Lines of Gd II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new branching fraction measurements for 156 ultraviolet and optical transitions of Gd II. These transitions range in wavelength (wavenumber) from 2574 to 6766 Angstroms (38838 - 14777 cm-1) and originate in one odd-parity and 11 even-parity upper levels. Nine of the 12 levels, accounting for 126 of the 156 transitions, are studied for the first time. Branching fractions are determined for three levels studied previously for the purpose of comparison. The levels studied for the first time are high lying, ranging in energy from 36845 to 40774 cm-1. The branching fractions are determined from emission spectra from two different high-resolution spectrometers. These are combined with radiative lifetimes reported in an earlier study to produce a set of transition probabilities and log(gf) values with accuracy ranging from 5% to 30%. Comparison is made to experimental and theoretical transition probabilities from the literature where such data exist. Abundances derived from these new log(gf) values for 21 Gd II lines in two metal-poor stars yield results consistent with previous studies, and they demonstrate that the new log(gf) values can be used in stellar abundance analysis as a self-consistent extension of previous work.</description>

      <title>Non-resonant inter-species interaction and its effect on the position response function of cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of non-equilibrium statistical physics, the position response of a particle, coupled to a bath, subjected to an external force is a topic of broad interest. A topic of further interest is two distinguishable sets of interacting particles in contact with two different baths. Here, we report the experimental evidence of the modification of the position response function (PRF) of an ensemble of cold atoms in a magneto-optical trap when it is placed alongside a dilute cloud of cold atoms of a different species. Our experiment consists of a mass-imbalanced cold atomic mixture of Potassium and Sodium atoms. We focus on the position response of Potassium atoms when subjected to a sudden displacement in the presence of a cold Sodium atomic cloud. Notably, we find that, in the underdamped regime of motion, the oscillation frequency of motion of the cold atoms changes as much as 30 $\%$ depending on the effective inter-species light-assisted interaction strength. On the other hand, in the overdamped regime, there is a reduction, as high as 10.5 $\%$ in the damping coefficient, depending on the interaction strength. Using a quantum Langevin approach, we develop a framework that aligns well with experimental results, with potential applications in mass and charge transport studies under varied physical conditions simulated in cold atoms.</description>

      <title>CERN AD/ELENA Antimatter Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22471v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CERN AD/ELENA Antimatter program studies the fundamental charge, parity, time (CPT) reversal invariance through high-precision studies of antiprotons, antihydrogen, and antiprotonic atoms. Utilizing the world-unique Antiproton Decelerator (AD) and the Extra Low Energy Antiproton (ELENA) decelerator, the program supports multiple groundbreaking experiments aimed at testing fundamental symmetries, probing gravity with antimatter, and investigating potential asymmetric antimatter/dark matter interactions. Some experiments focus on precision spectroscopy of antihydrogen, while others conduct the most precise tests of CPT invariance in the baryon sector by comparing proton and antiproton properties. Other efforts are dedicated to measure the ballistic properties of antihydrogen under gravity and performing antiproton-based studies of neutron skins in exotic nuclei. These efforts have led to major breakthroughs, including the first trapped antihydrogen, antihydrogen's first gravitational acceleration measurement, and record-breaking precision CPT-tests in the baryon sector.
  With continuous advancements in antimatter cooling, trapping, and transport, CERN's program is opening new frontiers in fundamental physics. Future goals, described in this document and reaching to timelines beyond 2040, include further improving the precision of antimatter studies, developing transportable antimatter traps, and advancing our understanding of quantum field theory, gravity, and dark matter interactions. Furthermore, new areas of hadron physics with antiprotons will be explored through studies of the Pontecorvo reaction, antineutron annihilation dynamics and hypernuclei decays. The CERN AD/ELENA Antimatter program remains at the forefront of experimental physics, pushing the limits of precision measurements to unravel the mysteries of the universe.</description>

      <title>Topological optical skyrmion transfer to matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of structured light to mimic exotic topological skyrmion textures, encountered in high-energy physics, cosmology, magnetic materials, and superfluids has recently received considerable attention. Despite their promise as mechanisms for data encoding and storage, there has been a lack of studies addressing the transfer and storage of the topology of optical skyrmions to matter. Here, we demonstrate a high-fidelity mapping of skyrmion topology from a laser beam onto a gas of cold atoms, where it is detected in its new non-propagating form. Within the spatial overlap of the beam and atom cloud, the skyrmion topological charge is preserved, with a reduction from $Q \simeq 0.91$ to $Q \simeq 0.84$ mainly due to the beam width exceeding the sample size. Our work potentially opens novel avenues for topological photonics state storage and the analysis of more complex structured light topologies.</description>

      <title>Fast Magnetic Coil Controller for Cold Atom Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold atoms experiments employ magnetic fields, commonly generated by coils, as an essential tool to control and manipulate atomic samples. In these experiments, it is often necessary to rapidly switch the magnetic field between two values. However, typical power supplies have a limited switching time for the current flowing through the coil that is inversely proportional to the maximum voltage they can supply and directly proportional to the inductance of the coil. We present a control scheme implemented as an electronic circuit that overcomes this limitation, a faster control is achieved by momentarily applying an on-demand high voltage when the control signal variation surpasses the limits that the conventional power supply can follow, allowing a faster current flow into the magnetic coil. In our specific application, we show that with this control the coil current can follow control signals continuously from negative to positive and vice versa with a ~5 kHz bandwidth and a maximum switching speed of ~40 $\mu$s between -1A and 1 A even though the time constant of the coil is of ~2 ms. Improving by more than a factor of ten the bandwidth and making the switching speed 20 times faster than that of a typical power supply. By appropriately selecting the components of the circuit, the switching time and the bandwidth can be finely tuned to any desired value. Moreover, our scheme can be easily adapted to different applications within a wide range of inductive and power requirements.</description>

      <title>Revisiting inelastic Cu+H collisions and the non-LTE Galactic evolution of copper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22566v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Galactic evolution of copper remains poorly understood, partly due to the strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) affecting Cu I lines. A key source of uncertainty in non-LTE modelling is the treatment of inelastic Cu+H collisions. We present new rate coefficients based on a combined asymptotic LCAO and free electron model approach, which show significant differences from previous calculations. Applying these updated rates to non-LTE stellar modelling, we find reduced line-to-line scatter and improved consistency between metal-poor dwarfs and giants. Our non-LTE analysis reveals a strong upturn in the [Cu/Fe] trend towards lower [Fe/H] &lt; -1.7. We show that this may reflect the interplay between external enrichment of Cu-rich material of the Milky Way halo at low metallicities, and metallicity-dependent Cu yields from rapidly rotating massive stars. This highlights the unique diagnostic potential of accurate Cu abundances for understanding both stellar and Galactic evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10211v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate x-ray second harmonic generation (SHG) with strong-field-driven high harmonic generation (HHG) from core electrons in gas-phase atoms, highlighting its potential as a powerful spectroscopic tool for studying atomic and molecular systems. Our simulations confirm the generation of HHG with x-ray SHG (HHG-XSHG) from atomic core electrons through the rescattering of electrons from x-ray two-photon excitation and subsequent tunneling ionization in an optical laser field. The resulting HHG-XSHG spectrum features a broadband multi-peak structure and a distinct spectral cutoff in the x-ray regime. These findings indicate that HHG-XSHG is a valuable technique for probing core-electron dynamics, generating attosecond x-ray pulses, and exploring nonlinear interactions, effectively merging laser-driven attosecond technology with nonlinear x-ray methodologies provided by x-ray free-electron lasers.</description>

      <title>Recoil corrections with finite nuclear size in hydrogenic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Formulas for the combined nuclear-recoil and finite-nuclear-size effects of order $(Z\,\alpha)^5$ and $(Z\,\alpha)^6$ are derived without any expansion in the nuclear charge radius $r_C$, making them applicable to both electronic and muonic atoms. The obtained results are particularly relevant for high-precision determinations of root-mean-square charge radii from muonic atom spectroscopy. We demonstrate that calculations of the atomic isotope shift based on the widely used Breit approximation give rise to an unphysical nuclear-size contribution that is linear in the nuclear charge radius $r_C$ at order $(Z\,\alpha)^5$. This spurious term vanishes in a full QED treatment, leaving the correct contribution quadratic in $r_C$. For electronic atoms, this quadratic term is significantly smaller than the spurious linear contribution.</description>

      <title>Generic transverse stability of kink structures in atomic and optical nonlinear media with competing attractive and repulsive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence and stability of one-dimensional (1D) topological kink configurations immersed in higher-dimensional bosonic gases and nonlinear optical setups. Our analysis pertains, in particular, to the two- and three-dimensional extended Gross-Pitaevskii models with quantum fluctuations describing droplet-bearing environments but also to the two-dimensional cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation containing higher-order corrections to the nonlinear refractive index. Contrary to the generic dark soliton transverse instability, the kink structures are generically robust under the interplay of low-amplitude attractive and high-amplitude repulsive interactions. A quasi-1D effective potential picture dictates the existence of these defects, while their stability is obtained numerically and analytically through linearization analysis and direct dynamics in the presence of external fluctuations showcasing their unprecedented resilience. These generic (across different models) findings should be detectable in current cold atom and optics experiments, offering insights towards controlling topological excitations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a scheme for constructing versatile quantum simulators using ultracold Rydberg atoms in long-lived circular and elliptical states. By exciting different subspaces of internal atomic states, the atoms can be used to simulate two effective spin species with different spin-spin interactions. The strengths of transverse and longitudinal spin-spin interactions, both intra- and inter-species, can be controlled within a wide range of values. This setup can be used to simulate two-species spin models or lattice models with two sublattices. We show examples of specific models which can be realized.</description>

Abstract: We present a protocol for automated fitting of magnetic Moment Tensor Potential explicitly including magnetic moments in its functional form. For the fitting of this potential we use energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) of configurations selected with an active learning algorithm. These selected configurations are computed using constrained density functional theory, which enables calculating energies and their derivatives for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (excited) magnetic states. We test our protocol on the system of B1-CrN and demonstrate that the automatically trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potential reproduces mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties, of B1-CrN in the paramagnetic state with respect to density functional theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>Exact Results for the Ericson Transition in Stochastic Quantum Scattering and Experimental Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At lower energies, the resonances in scattering experiments are often isolated. The crucial parameter is the ratio of average resonance width and average mean level spacing. Towards larger energies, this parameter grows, because the resonances overlap. Eventually the cross-section becomes a random function and the scattering matrix elements follow a universal Gaussian distribution. For more than sixty years, this Ericson transition awaits a concise analytical treatment. We provide a complete solution within the Heidelberg approach which provides a full-fledged model of the scattering process. As a side result, we obtain explicit formulae for the moments of the distributions. We compare with microwave experiments.</description>
