      <title>Transparent Tagging for Strategic Social Nudges on User-Generated Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social network platforms (SNP), such as X and TikTok, rely heavily on user-generated content to attract users and advertisers, yet they have limited control over content provision, which leads to the proliferation of misinformation across platforms. As countermeasures, SNPs have implemented various policies, such as tweet labeling, to notify users about potentially misleading information, influencing users' responses, either favorably or unfavorably, to the tagged contents. The population-level response creates a social nudge to the content provider that encourages it to supply more authentic content without exerting direct control over the provider. Yet, when designing such tagging policies to leverage social nudges, SNP must be cautious about the potential misdetection of misinformation (wrongly detecting factual content as misinformation and vice versa), which impairs its credibility to generic users and, hence, its ability to create social nudges. This work establishes a Bayesian persuaded branching process to study SNP's tagging policy design under misdetection. Misinformation circulation is modeled by a multi-type branching process, where users are persuaded through tagging to give positive and negative comments that influence the spread of misinformation. When translated into posterior belief space, the SNP's problem is reduced to an equality-constrained convex optimization, the optimal condition of which is given by the Lagrangian characterization. The key finding is that SNP's optimal policy is simply transparent tagging, i.e., revealing the content's authenticity to the user, albeit midsection, which nudges the provider not to generate misinformation. We corroborate our findings using numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Sample-Efficient Regret-Minimizing Double Oracle in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extensive-Form Game (EFG) represents a fundamental model for analyzing sequential interactions among multiple agents and the primary challenge to solve it lies in mitigating sample complexity. Existing research indicated that Double Oracle (DO) can reduce the sample complexity dependence on the information set number $|S|$ to the final restricted game size $X$ in solving EFG. This is attributed to the early convergence of full-game Nash Equilibrium (NE) through iteratively solving restricted games. However, we prove that the state-of-the-art Extensive-Form Double Oracle (XDO) exhibits \textit{exponential} sample complexity of $X$, due to its exponentially increasing restricted game expansion frequency. Here we introduce Adaptive Double Oracle (AdaDO) to significantly alleviate sample complexity to \textit{polynomial} by deploying the optimal expansion frequency. Furthermore, to comprehensively study the principles and influencing factors underlying sample complexity, we introduce a novel theoretical framework Regret-Minimizing Double Oracle (RMDO) to provide directions for designing efficient DO algorithms. Empirical results demonstrate that AdaDO attains the more superior approximation of NE with less sample complexity than the strong baselines including Linear CFR, MCCFR and existing DO. Importantly, combining RMDO with warm starting and stochastic regret minimization further improves convergence rate and scalability, thereby paving the way for addressing complex multi-agent tasks.</description>

      <title>Preference-CFR$\:$ Beyond Nash Equilibrium for Better Game Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have leveraged large-scale games as benchmarks to gauge progress, with AI now frequently outperforming human capabilities. Traditionally, this success has largely relied on solving Nash equilibrium (NE) using variations of the counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) method in games with incomplete information. However, the variety of Nash equilibria has been largely overlooked in previous research, limiting the adaptability of AI to meet diverse human preferences. To address this challenge, where AI is powerful but struggles to meet customization needs, we introduce a novel approach: Preference-CFR, which incorporates two new parameters: preference degree and vulnerability degree. These parameters allow for greater flexibility in AI strategy development without compromising convergence. Our method significantly alters the distribution of final strategies, enabling the creation of customized AI models that better align with individual user needs. Using Texas Hold'em as a case study, our experiments demonstrate how Preference CFR can be adjusted to either emphasize customization, prioritizing user preferences, or to enhance performance, striking a balance between the depth of customization and strategic optimality.</description>

      <title>The Fairness of Maximum Nash Social Welfare Under Matroid Constraints and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair allocation of a set of indivisible items among agents with additive valuations, under matroid constraints and two generalizations: $p$-extendible system and independence system constraints. The objective is to find fair and efficient allocations in which the subset of items assigned to every agent satisfies the given constraint. We focus on a common fairness notion of envy-freeness up to one item (EF1) and a well-known efficient (and fair) notion of the maximum Nash social welfare (Max-NSW). By using properties of matroids, we demonstrate that the Max-NSW allocation, implying Pareto optimality (PO), achieves a tight $1/2$-EF1 under matroid constraints. This result resolves an open question proposed in prior literature [26]. In particular, if agents have 2-valued ($\{1, a\}$) valuations, we prove that the Max-NSW allocation admits $\max\{1/a^2, 1/2\}$-EF1 and PO. Under strongly $p$-extendible system constraints, we show that the Max-NSW allocation guarantees $\max\{1/p, 1/4\}$-EF1 and PO for identical binary valuations. Indeed, the approximation of $1/4$ is the ratio for independence system constraints and additive valuations. Additionally, for lexicographic preferences, we study possibly feasible allocations other than Max-NSW admitting exactly EF1 and PO under the above constraints.</description>

      <title>Barriers to Welfare Maximization with No-Regret Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated result in the interface of online learning and game theory guarantees that the repeated interaction of no-regret players leads to a coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) -- a natural game-theoretic solution concept. Despite the rich history of this foundational problem and the tremendous interest it has received in recent years, a basic question still remains open: how many iterations are needed for no-regret players to approximate an equilibrium? In this paper, we establish the first computational lower bounds for that problem in two-player (general-sum) games under the constraint that the CCE reached approximates the optimal social welfare (or some other natural objective). From a technical standpoint, our approach revolves around proving lower bounds for computing a near-optimal $T$-sparse CCE -- a mixture of $T$ product distributions, thereby circumscribing the iteration complexity of no-regret learning even in the centralized model of computation. Our proof proceeds by extending a classical reduction of Gilboa and Zemel [1989] for optimal Nash to sparse (approximate) CCE. In particular, we show that the inapproximability of maximum clique precludes attaining any non-trivial sparsity in polynomial time. Moreover, we strengthen our hardness results to apply in the low-precision regime as well via the planted clique conjecture.</description>

      <title>Computational Lower Bounds for Regret Minimization in Normal-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A celebrated connection in the interface of online learning and game theory establishes that players minimizing swap regret converge to correlated equilibria (CE) -- a seminal game-theoretic solution concept. Despite the long history of this problem and the renewed interest it has received in recent years, a basic question remains open: how many iterations are needed to approximate an equilibrium under the usual normal-form representation? In this paper, we provide evidence that existing learning algorithms, such as multiplicative weights update, are close to optimal. In particular, we prove lower bounds for the problem of computing a CE that can be expressed as a uniform mixture of $T$ product distributions -- namely, a uniform $T$-sparse CE; such lower bounds immediately circumscribe (computationally bounded) regret minimization algorithms in games. Our results are obtained in the algorithmic framework put forward by Kothari and Mehta (STOC 2018) in the context of computing Nash equilibria, which consists of the sum-of-squares (SoS) relaxation in conjunction with oracle access to a verification oracle; the goal in that framework is to lower bound either the degree of the SoS relaxation or the number of queries to the verification oracle. Here, we obtain two such hardness results, precluding computing i) uniform $\text{log }n$-sparse CE when $\epsilon =\text{poly}(1/\text{log }n)$ and ii) uniform $n^{1 - o(1)}$-sparse CE when $\epsilon = \text{poly}(1/n)$.</description>

      <title>A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Fair and Efficient Allocation with a Fixed Number of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly and efficiently allocating indivisible goods among agents with additive valuation functions. Envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) is a well-studied fairness notion for indivisible goods, while Pareto optimality (PO) and its stronger variant, fractional Pareto optimality (fPO), are widely recognized efficiency criteria. Although each property is straightforward to achieve individually, simultaneously ensuring both fairness and efficiency is challenging. Caragiannis et al.~\cite{caragiannis2019unreasonable} established the surprising result that maximizing Nash social welfare yields an allocation that is both EF1 and PO; however, since maximizing Nash social welfare is NP-hard, this approach does not provide an efficient algorithm. To overcome this barrier, Barman, Krishnamurthy, and Vaish~\cite{barman2018finding} designed a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm to compute an EF1 and PO allocation, and showed the existence of EF1 and fPO allocations. Nevertheless, the latter existence proof relies on a non-constructive convergence argument and does not directly yield an efficient algorithm for finding EF1 and fPO allocations. Whether a polynomial-time algorithm exists for finding an EF1 and PO (or fPO) allocation remains an important open problem.
  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an allocation that achieves both EF1 and fPO under additive valuation functions when the number of agents is fixed. Our primary idea is to avoid processing the entire instance at once; instead, we sequentially add agents to the instance and construct an allocation that satisfies EF1 and fPO at each step.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Synchronous Coordination Game and Asynchronous Coordination Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes the equivalence between synchronous and asynchronous coordination mechanisms in dynamic games with strategic complementarities and common interests. Synchronous coordination, characterized by simultaneous commitments, and asynchronous coordination, defined by sequential action timing, are both prevalent in economic contexts such as crowdfunding and fund management. We introduce Monotone Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium, MSPNE, to analyze least favorable equilibrium outcomes. We provide a recursive characterization for synchronous coordination and a graph-theoretic representation for asynchronous coordination, demonstrating their equivalence in terms of the greatest implementable outcome. Our results show that the structure of commitment, whether simultaneous or sequential, does not affect the achievable welfare outcome under certain conditions. Additionally, we discuss computational aspects, highlighting the general NP-Hardness of the problem but identifying a significant class of games that are computationally tractable. These findings offer valuable insights for the optimal design of coordination mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Vehicles, Pedestrians, and E-bikes: a Three-party Game at Right-turn-on-red Crossroads Revealing the Dual and Irrational Role of E-bikes that Risks Traffic Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread use of e-bikes has facilitated short-distance travel yet led to confusion and safety problems in road traffic. This study focuses on the dual characteristics of e-bikes in traffic conflicts: they resemble pedestrians when interacting with motor vehicles and behave like motor vehicles when in conflict with pedestrians, which raises the right of way concerns when potential conflicts are at stake. Using the Quantal Response Equilibrium model, this research analyzes the behavioral choice differences of three groups of road users (vehicle-pedestrian, vehicle-e-bike, e-bike-pedestrian) at right-turn-on-red crossroads in right-turning lines and straight-going lines conflict scenarios. The results show that the behavior of e-bikes is more similar to that of motor vehicles than pedestrians overall, and their interactions with either pedestrians or motor vehicles do not establish a reasonable order, increasing the likelihood of confusion and conflict. In contrast, a mutual understanding has developed between motor vehicles and pedestrians, where motor vehicles tend to yield, and pedestrians tend to cross. By clarifying the game theoretical model and introducing the rationality parameter, this study precisely locates the role of e-bikes among road users, which provides a reliable theoretical basis for optimizing traffic regulations.</description>

      <title>Nash Equilibria via Stochastic Eigendecomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a novel set of techniques for approximating a Nash equilibrium in a finite, normal-form game. It achieves this by constructing a new reformulation as solving a parameterized system of multivariate polynomials with tunable complexity. In doing so, it forges an itinerant loop from game theory to machine learning and back. We show a Nash equilibrium can be approximated with purely calls to stochastic, iterative variants of singular value decomposition and power iteration, with implications for biological plausibility. We provide pseudocode and experiments demonstrating solving for all equilibria of a general-sum game using only these readily available linear algebra tools.</description>

      <title>Two-Sided Learning in Decentralized Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-sided matching markets, environments in which two disjoint groups of agents seek to partner with one another, arise in many practical applications. In settings where the agents can assess the quality of their possible partners a priori, well-known centralized algorithms can be used to find desirable matchings between the two groups. However, when they do not know their own preferences, such algorithms are no longer applicable and agents must instead learn their preferences through repeated interactions with one another. In this work, we design completely uncoupled and uncoordinated policies that use an agent's limited historical observations to guide their behavior towards desirable matchings when they do not know their preferences. In our first main contribution, we demonstrate that when every agent follows a simple policy which we call trial-and-error learning, they will converge to a stable matching, the standard equilibrium configuration in matching markets. Then, we evaluate the strategyproofness of this policy and ask whether one group of agents can improve their performance by following a different policy. We constructively answer this question in the affirmative, demonstrating that if one group follows simple trial-and-error learning while the second group follows a more advanced policy, then they will converge to the most preferable stable matching for the second group. To the best of the authors' knowledge, these are the first completely uncoupled and uncoordinated policies that demonstrate any notion of convergence to stability in decentralized markets with two-sided uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prophet secretary problem is a combination of the prophet inequality and the secretary problem, where elements are drawn from known independent distributions and arrive in uniformly random order. In this work, we design 1) a $0.688$-competitive algorithm, that breaks the $0.675$ barrier of blind strategies (Correa, Saona, Ziliotto, 2021), and 2) a $0.641$-competitive algorithm for the prophet secretary matching problem, that breaks the $1-1/e\approx 0.632$ barrier for the first time. Our second result also applies to the query-commit model of weighted stochastic matching and improves the state-of-the-art ratio (Derakhshan and Farhadi, 2023).</description>

      <title>Leveraging Microservices Architecture for Dynamic Pricing in the Travel Industry: Algorithms, Scalability, and Impact on Revenue and Customer Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the implementation of a real-time, microservices-oriented dynamic pricing system for the travel sector. The system is designed to address factors such as demand, competitor pricing, and other external circumstances in real-time. Both controlled simulation and real-life application showed a respectable gain of 22% in revenue generation and a 17% improvement in pricing response time which concern the issues of scaling and flexibility of classical pricing mechanisms. Demand forecasting, competitor pricing strategies, and event-based pricing were implemented as separate microservices to enhance their scalability and reduce resource consumption by 30% during peak loads. Customers were also more content as depicted by a 15% increase in satisfaction score post-implementation given the appreciation of more appropriate pricing. This research enhances the existing literature with practical illustrations of the possible application of microservices technology in developing dynamic pricing solutions in a complex and data-driven context. There exist however areas for improvement for instance inter-service latency and the need for extensive real-time data pipelines. The present research goes on to suggest combining these with direct data capture from customer behavior at the same time as machine learning capacity developments in pricing algorithms to assist in more accurate real time pricing. It is determined that the use of microservices is a reasonable and efficient model for dynamic pricing, allowing the tourism sector to employ evidence-based and customer centric pricing techniques, which ensures that their profits are not jeopardized because of the need for customers.</description>

      <title>Nash equilibria in four-strategy quantum game extensions of the Prisoner's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates Nash equilibria in pure strategies for quantum approach to the Prisoner's Dilemma. The quantization process involves extending the classical game by introducing two additional unitary strategies. We consider five classes of such quantum games, which remain invariant under isomorphic transformations of the classical game. For each class, we identify and analyse all possible Nash equilibria. Our results reveal the complexity and diversity of strategic behaviour in the quantum setting, providing new insights into the dynamics of classical decision-making dilemmas. In the case of the standard Prisoner's Dilemma, the resulting Nash equilibria of quantum extensions are found to be closer to Pareto optimal solutions than those of the classical equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Game-Theoretic Control in Socio-Technical Networks: Emerging Design Frameworks and Contemporary Applications</title>

Abstract: Socio-technical networks represent emerging cyber-physical infrastructures that are tightly interwoven with human networks. The coupling between human and technical networks presents significant challenges in managing, controlling, and securing these complex, interdependent systems. This paper investigates game-theoretic frameworks for the design and control of socio-technical networks, with a focus on critical applications such as misinformation management, infrastructure optimization, and resilience in socio-cyber-physical systems (SCPS). Core methodologies, including Stackelberg games, mechanism design, and dynamic game theory, are examined as powerful tools for modeling interactions in hierarchical, multi-agent environments. Key challenges addressed include mitigating human-driven vulnerabilities, managing large-scale system dynamics, and countering adversarial threats. By bridging individual agent behaviors with overarching system goals, this work illustrates how the integration of game theory and control theory can lead to robust, resilient, and adaptive socio-technical networks. This paper highlights the potential of these frameworks to dynamically align decentralized agent actions with system-wide objectives of stability, security, and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Proportionality and Strategyproofness in Multiwinner Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.08594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiwinner voting rules can be used to select a fixed-size committee from a larger set of candidates. We consider approval-based committee rules, which allow voters to approve or disapprove candidates. In this setting, several voting rules such as Proportional Approval Voting (PAV) and Phragm\'en's rules have been shown to produce committees that are proportional, in the sense that they proportionally represent voters' preferences; all of these rules are strategically manipulable by voters. On the other hand, a generalisation of Approval Voting gives a non-proportional but strategyproof voting rule. We show that there is a fundamental tradeoff between these two properties: we prove that no multiwinner voting rule can simultaneously satisfy a weak form of proportionality (a weakening of justified representation) and a weak form of strategyproofness. Our impossibility is obtained using a formulation of the problem in propositional logic and applying SAT solvers; a human-readable version of the computer-generated proof is obtained by extracting a minimal unsatisfiable set (MUS). We also discuss several related axiomatic questions in the domain of committee elections.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Clinching Auctions with a Single Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address auctions in two-sided markets with budget constraints on buyers, a fundamental setting also crucial for applications such as display advertising. Our goal is to design efficient mechanisms that satisfy dominant strategy incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and budget balance. To overcome the limitations of impossibility theorems, we assume prior knowledge of sellers' valuations and focus on liquid welfare, an efficiency objective that takes budgets into account. Our contributions are twofold: First, we improve the efficiency guarantees of the polyhedral clinching auction by Hirai and Sato (2022). Second, using the reduction method of D"{u}tting et al. (2021), we extend the mechanism to an efficient single-sample mechanism for budget-constrained auctions, providing the budget extension of their results. Notably, our results hold even under polymatroid constraints and apply to both divisible and indivisible goods.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral Clinching Auctions for Indivisible Goods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00231v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the polyhedral clinching auction for indivisible goods, which has so far been studied for divisible goods. As in the divisible setting by Goel et al. (2015), our mechanism enjoys incentive compatibility, individual rationality, and Pareto optimality, and works with polymatroidal environments. A notable feature for the indivisible setting is that the whole procedure can be conducted in time polynomial of the number of buyers and goods. Moreover, we show additional efficiency guarantees, recently established by Sato for the divisible setting: The liquid welfare (LW) of our mechanism achieves more than 1/2 of the optimal LW, and that the social welfare is more than the optimal LW.</description>

      <title>Designing High-Occupancy Toll Lanes: A Game-Theoretic Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the optimal design of High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes. The traffic authority determines the road capacity allocation between HOT lanes and ordinary lanes, as well as the toll price charged for travelers using HOT lanes who do not meet the high-occupancy eligibility criteria. We develop a game-theoretic model to analyze the decisions of travelers with heterogeneous preference parameters in values of time and carpool disutilities. These travelers choose between paying or forming carpools to use the HOT lanes, or taking the ordinary lanes. Travelers' welfare depends on the congestion cost of the lane they use, the toll payment, and the carpool disutilities. For highways with a single entrance and exit node, we provide a complete characterization of equilibrium strategies and a comparative statics analysis of how the equilibrium vehicle flow and travel time change with HOT capacity and toll price. We then extend the single segment model to highways with multiple entrance and exit nodes. We extend the equilibrium concept and propose various design objectives considering traffic congestion, toll revenue, and social welfare. Using the data collected from the HOT lane of the California Interstate Highway 880 (I-880), we formulate a convex program to estimate the travel demand and approximate the distribution of travelers' preference parameters. We then compute the optimal toll design of five segments for I-880 for achieve each one of the four objectives, and compare the optimal solution with the current toll pricing.</description>

      <title>Proportionally Representative Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge in effort to formalize notions of fairness in machine learning. We focus on centroid clustering--one of the fundamental tasks in unsupervised machine learning. We propose a new axiom ``proportionally representative fairness'' (PRF) that is designed for clustering problems where the selection of centroids reflects the distribution of data points and how tightly they are clustered together. Our fairness concept is not satisfied by existing fair clustering algorithms. We design efficient algorithms to achieve PRF both for unconstrained and discrete clustering problems. Our algorithm for the unconstrained setting is also the first known polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the well-studied Proportional Fairness (PF) axiom. Our algorithm for the discrete setting also matches the best known approximation factor for PF.</description>

      <title>DU-Shapley: A Shapley Value Proxy for Efficient Dataset Valuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02071v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dataset valuation problem, that is, the problem of quantifying the incremental gain, to some relevant pre-defined utility of a machine learning task, of aggregating an individual dataset to others. The Shapley value is a natural tool to perform dataset valuation due to its formal axiomatic justification, which can be combined with Monte Carlo integration to overcome the computational tractability challenges. Such generic approximation methods, however, remain expensive in some cases. In this paper, we exploit the knowledge about the structure of the dataset valuation problem to devise more efficient Shapley value estimators. We propose a novel approximation, referred to as discrete uniform Shapley, which is expressed as an expectation under a discrete uniform distribution with support of reasonable size. We justify the relevancy of the proposed framework via asymptotic and non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees and illustrate its benefits via an extensive set of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium for Crowd Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01537v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robots navigating in crowded areas should negotiate free space with humans rather than fully controlling collision avoidance, as this can lead to freezing behavior. Game theory provides a framework for the robot to reason about potential cooperation from humans for collision avoidance during path planning. In particular, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium captures the negotiation behavior under uncertainty, making it well suited for crowd navigation. However, computing the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is often prohibitively expensive for real-time decision-making. In this paper, we propose an iterative Bayesian update scheme over probability distributions of trajectories. The algorithm simultaneously generates a stochastic plan for the robot and probabilistic predictions of other pedestrians' paths. We prove that the proposed algorithm is equivalent to solving a mixed strategy game for crowd navigation, and the algorithm guarantees the recovery of the global Nash equilibrium of the game. We name our algorithm Bayesian Recursive Nash Equilibrium (BRNE) and develop a real-time model prediction crowd navigation framework. Since BRNE is not solving a general-purpose mixed strategy Nash equilibrium but a tailored formula specifically for crowd navigation, it can compute the solution in real-time on a low-power embedded computer. We evaluate BRNE in both simulated environments and real-world pedestrian datasets. BRNE consistently outperforms non-learning and learning-based methods regarding safety and navigation efficiency. It also reaches human-level crowd navigation performance in the pedestrian dataset benchmark. Lastly, we demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm with real humans on an untethered quadruped robot with fully onboard perception and computation.</description>

      <title>Learning to Price Homogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a data pricing problem, where a seller has access to $N$ homogeneous data points (e.g. drawn i.i.d. from some distribution). There are $m$ types of buyers in the market, where buyers of the same type $i$ have the same valuation curve $v_i:[N]\rightarrow [0,1]$, where $v_i(n)$ is the value for having $n$ data points. A priori, the seller is unaware of the distribution of buyers, but can repeat the market for $T$ rounds so as to learn the revenue-optimal pricing curve $p:[N] \rightarrow [0, 1]$. To solve this online learning problem, we first develop novel discretization schemes to approximate any pricing curve. When compared to prior work, the size of our discretization schemes scales gracefully with the approximation parameter, which translates to better regret in online learning. Under assumptions like smoothness and diminishing returns which are satisfied by data, the discretization size can be reduced further. We then turn to the online learning problem, both in the stochastic and adversarial settings. On each round, the seller chooses an anonymous pricing curve $p_t$. A new buyer appears and may choose to purchase some amount of data. She then reveals her type only if she makes a purchase. Our online algorithms build on classical algorithms such as UCB and FTPL, but require novel ideas to account for the asymmetric nature of this feedback and to deal with the vastness of the space of pricing curves. Using the improved discretization schemes previously developed, we are able to achieve $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{T})$ regret in the stochastic setting and $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret in the adversarial setting.</description>

      <title>Nash CoT: Multi-Path Inference with Preference Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) is a reasoning framework that can enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex inference tasks. In particular, among various studies related to CoT, multi-path inference stands out as a simple yet effective improvement. However, there is no optimal setting for the number of inference paths. Therefore, we have to increase the number of inference paths to obtain better results, which in turn increases the inference cost. To address this limitation, we can utilize question-related role templates to guide LLMs into relevant roles, thereby increasing the possibility of correct inferences for each path and further reducing dependence on the number of inference paths while improving reasoning accuracy. However, placing LLMs into specific roles may reduce their reasoning diversity and performance on a few tasks where role dependence is low. To alleviate the excessive immersion of the LLM into a specific role, we propose Nash CoT by constructing a competitive system on each path that balances the generation from role-specific LLMs' and the general LLMs' generation, thereby ensuring both effective role adoption and diversity in LLM generation further maintaining the performance of multi-path inference while reducing the requirement of the number of inference paths. We evaluate Nash CoT across various inference tasks, including Arabic Reasoning, Commonsense Question Answering, and Symbolic Inference, achieving results that are comparable to or better than those of multi-path CoT with the equal number of inference paths.</description>

      <title>Performative Prediction on Games and Mechanism Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents often have individual goals which depend on a group's actions. If agents trust a forecast of collective action and adapt strategically, such prediction can influence outcomes non-trivially, resulting in a form of performative prediction. This effect is ubiquitous in scenarios ranging from pandemic predictions to election polls, but existing work has ignored interdependencies among predicted agents. As a first step in this direction, we study a collective risk dilemma where agents dynamically decide whether to trust predictions based on past accuracy. As predictions shape collective outcomes, social welfare arises naturally as a metric of concern. We explore the resulting interplay between accuracy and welfare, and demonstrate that searching for stable accurate predictions can minimize social welfare with high probability in our setting. By assuming knowledge of a Bayesian agent behavior model, we then show how to achieve better trade-offs and use them for mechanism design.</description>
