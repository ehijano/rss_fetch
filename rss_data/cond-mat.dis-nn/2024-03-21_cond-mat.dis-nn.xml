      <title>Meta-plasticity and memory in multi-level recurrent feed-forward networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network systems can exhibit memory effects in which the interactions between different pairs of nodes adapt in time, leading to the emergence of preferred connections, patterns, and sub-networks. To a first approximation, this memory can be modelled through a ``plastic'' Hebbian or homophily mechanism, in which edges get reinforced proportionally to the amount of information flowing through them. However, recent studies on glia-neuron networks have highlighted how memory can evolve due to more complex dynamics, including multi-level network structures and ``meta-plastic'' effects that modulate reinforcement. Inspired by those systems, here we develop a simple and general model for the dynamics of an adaptive network with an additional meta-plastic mechanism that varies the rate of Hebbian strengthening of its edge connections. Specifically, we consider a biased random walk on a cyclic feed-forward network. The random walk chooses its steps according to the weights of the network edges. The weights evolve through a Hebbian mechanism modulated by a meta-plastic reinforcement, biasing the walker to prefer edges that have been already explored. We study the dynamical emergence (memorization) of preferred paths and their retrieval and identify three regimes: one dominated by the Hebbian term, one in which the meta-reinforcement drives memory formation, and a balanced one. We show that, in the latter two regimes, meta-reinforcement allows for the retrieval of a previously stored path even after weights have been reset to zero to erase Hebbian memory.</description>

      <title>Quantum-activated neural reservoirs on-chip open up large hardware security models for resilient authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum artificial intelligence is a frontier of artificial intelligence research, pioneering quantum AI-powered circuits to address problems beyond the reach of deep learning with classical architectures. This work implements a large-scale quantum-activated recurrent neural network possessing more than 3 trillion hardware nodes/cm$^2$, originating from repeatable atomic-scale nucleation dynamics in an amorphous material integrated on-chip, controlled with 0.07 nW electric power per readout channel. Compared to the best-performing reservoirs currently reported, this implementation increases the scale of the network by two orders of magnitude and reduces the power consumption by six, reaching power efficiencies in the range of the human brain, dissipating 0.2 nW/neuron. When interrogated by a classical input, the chip implements a large-scale hardware security model, enabling dictionary-free authentication secure against statistical inference attacks, including AI's present and future development, even for an adversary with a copy of all the classical components available. Experimental tests report 99.6% reliability, 100% user authentication accuracy, and an ideal 50% key uniqueness. Due to its quantum nature, the chip supports a bit density per feature size area three times higher than the best technology available, with the capacity to store more than $2^{1104}$ keys in a footprint of 1 cm$^2$. Such a quantum-powered platform could help counteract the emerging form of warfare led by the cybercrime industry in breaching authentication to target small to large-scale facilities, from private users to intelligent energy grids.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Quantum Magnetism on Complex Networks: What Sets the Total Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider equal antiferromagnetic Heisenberg interactions between qubits sitting at the nodes of a complex, nonbipartite network. We ask the question: How does the network topology determine the net magnetization of the ground state and to what extent is it tunable? By examining various network families with tunable properties, we demonstrate that (i) graph heterogeneity, i.e., spread in the number of neighbors, is essential for a nonzero total spin, and (ii) other than the average number of neighbors, the key structure governing the total spin is the presence of (disassortative) hubs, as opposed to the level of frustration. We also show how to construct simple networks where the magnetization can be tuned over its entire range across both abrupt and continuous transitions, which may be realizable on existing platforms. Our findings pose a number of fundamental questions and strongly motivate wider exploration of quantum many-body phenomena beyond regular lattices.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Analysis of Quasi-periodic Patterning of Transmon Quantum Computers: Enhancement of Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that transmon qubit architectures experience a transition between a many-body localized and a quantum chaotic phase. While it is crucial for quantum computation that the system remains in the localized regime, the most common way to achieve this has relied on disorder in Josephson junction parameters. Here we propose a quasi-periodic patterning of parameters as a substitute for random disorder. We demonstrate, using the Walsh-Hadamard diagnostic, that quasiperiodicity is more effective than disorder for achieving localization. In order to study the localizing properties of our new Hamiltonian for large, experimentally relevant system sizes, we use two complementary perturbation-theory schemes, one with respect to the many-body interactions and one with respect to hopping parameter of the free Hamiltonian.</description>
