      <title>PARCO: Learning Parallel Autoregressive Policies for Efficient Multi-Agent Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent combinatorial optimization problems such as routing and scheduling have great practical relevance but present challenges due to their NP-hard combinatorial nature, hard constraints on the number of possible agents, and hard-to-optimize objective functions. This paper introduces PARCO (Parallel AutoRegressive Combinatorial Optimization), a novel approach that learns fast surrogate solvers for multi-agent combinatorial problems with reinforcement learning by employing parallel autoregressive decoding. We propose a model with a Multiple Pointer Mechanism to efficiently decode multiple decisions simultaneously by different agents, enhanced by a Priority-based Conflict Handling scheme. Moreover, we design specialized Communication Layers that enable effective agent collaboration, thus enriching decision-making. We evaluate PARCO in representative multi-agent combinatorial problems in routing and scheduling and demonstrate that our learned solvers offer competitive results against both classical and neural baselines in terms of both solution quality and speed. We make our code openly available at https://github.com/ai4co/parco.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Path Finding for Mixed Autonomy Traffic Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of urban mobility, the prospective integration of Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) with Human-Driven Vehicles (HDVs) presents a complex array of challenges and opportunities for autonomous driving systems. While recent advancements in robotics have yielded Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms tailored for agent coordination task characterized by simplified kinematics and complete control over agent behaviors, these solutions are inapplicable in mixed-traffic environments where uncontrollable HDVs must coexist and interact with CAVs. Addressing this gap, we propose the Behavior Prediction Kinematic Priority Based Search (BK-PBS), which leverages an offline-trained conditional prediction model to forecast HDV responses to CAV maneuvers, integrating these insights into a Priority Based Search (PBS) where the A* search proceeds over motion primitives to accommodate kinematic constraints. We compare BK-PBS with CAV planning algorithms derived by rule-based car-following models, and reinforcement learning. Through comprehensive simulation on a highway merging scenario across diverse scenarios of CAV penetration rate and traffic density, BK-PBS outperforms these baselines in reducing collision rates and enhancing system-level travel delay. Our work is directly applicable to many scenarios of multi-human multi-robot coordination.</description>

      <title>SPACE: A Python-based Simulator for Evaluating Decentralized Multi-Robot Task Allocation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swarm robotics explores the coordination of multiple robots to achieve collective goals, with collective decision-making being a central focus. This process involves decentralized robots autonomously making local decisions and communicating them, which influences the overall emergent behavior. Testing such decentralized algorithms in real-world scenarios with hundreds or more robots is often impractical, underscoring the need for effective simulation tools. We propose SPACE (Swarm Planning and Control Evaluation), a Python-based simulator designed to support the research, evaluation, and comparison of decentralized Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) algorithms. SPACE streamlines core algorithmic development by allowing users to implement decision-making algorithms as Python plug-ins, easily construct agent behavior trees via an intuitive GUI, and leverage built-in support for inter-agent communication and local task awareness. To demonstrate its practical utility, we implement and evaluate CBBA and GRAPE within the simulator, comparing their performance across different metrics, particularly in scenarios with dynamically introduced tasks. This evaluation shows the usefulness of SPACE in conducting rigorous and standardized comparisons of MRTA algorithms, helping to support future research in the field.</description>
