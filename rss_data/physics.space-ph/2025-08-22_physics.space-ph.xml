      <title>Simulation of Space Platform Charging in Very Low Earth Orbit Using Stochastic Particle Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The residual atmospheric drag on satellites in Very Low Earth Orbit (VLEO) has been recognized as a limiting factor for satellite lifetimes. This work focuses on one component of the drag, i.e., the ionospheric drag from charged particles, which was observed to influence the overall aerodynamics of satellites. Space platform charging processes are modeled using a stochastic particle method, Particle-in-Cell, with with the possibility to treat the electrons as a Boltzmann fluid, thus reducing the computational time while preserving the accuracy of the physics of charging. Part of the study involves examining non-equilibrium distribution functions, specifically the Kappa distribution, commonly used to describe space plasmas. It has been shown that such distributions can noticeably affect overall space platform charging, thereby enhancing ionospheric drag on satellites using the proposed hybrid models. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that ionospheric drag might constitute only a fraction of the total drag caused by neutral atmospheric gas.</description>

      <title>Optimized scintillation configuration for IMPISH hard x-ray detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a solar X-ray spectrometer that features large-area scintillators, fast readout electronics, and good energy resolution in the hard X-ray band. IMPISH is a low-cost spectrometer designed to measure subsecond variation in hard X-ray time profiles from solar flares, with the goal of constraining particle acceleration timescales. To meet these requirements, we carried out a systematic optimization of the scintillation design, focusing on maximizing photon collection, reducing noise level, and improving energy resolution. We tested two high-yield scintillating crystals (LYSO, lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate, and GAGG, gadolinium aluminum gallium garnet), two reflector types (specular and lambertian), two kinds of surface finishes (all sides polished and readout face only polished), different optical coupling materials and thicknesses, multiple geometries, and readout face angles. Our studies show that light collection improves with increasing the crystal's effective area, breaking its symmetry, and reducing the photon's travel length. These minimize photon loss due to self-absorption and total internal reflection. Through combined simulation and laboratory tests, we achieved an optimal energy resolution with the LYSO trapezoid-shaped crystal coupled to a Broadcom NUV-MT SiPM with an approximately 0.25 mm thin Sylgard 184 optical pad.</description>
