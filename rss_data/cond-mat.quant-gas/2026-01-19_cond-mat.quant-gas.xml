      <title>The fate of a single impurity in the Bose-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We map out the global phase diagram of a single mobile impurity in the two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model, spanning the bath evolution from a compressible superfluid (SF) to an incompressible Mott insulator (MI) and the full range of impurity-bath coupling. Using sign-problem-free worm-algorithm quantum Monte Carlo method, we identify two sharply distinct localization mechanisms that organize the entire diagram. In the compressible SF, increasing impurity-bath coupling $|U_{\mathrm{ib}}|$ drives an \emph{interaction-driven winding-collapse crossover}: a light, extended polaron with finite winding evolves continuously into a heavy polaron and ultimately a self-trapped state -- a repulsive \emph{saturated bubble} or an attractive \emph{bound cluster} -- even while the bath remains globally superfluid, establishing localization without any bath phase transition. By contrast, upon tuning the bath across the SF-MI transition at fixed impurity-bath coupling $U_{\mathrm{ib}}$, localization becomes \emph{compressibility controlled}: the vanishing bath compressibility quenches polaronic dressing and collapses the impurity-centered density response, converting the polaron into an almost free defect and, deep in the MI, into a fully localized vacancy or particle defect. In the incompressible regime, localization proceeds via \emph{quantized defect formation}, manifested by discrete changes in the total bath occupation. Together, our results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity localization in correlated lattice bosons, governed by winding collapse in the SF and compressibility-driven localization across the SF-MI transition.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a Single Impurity Across the Superfluid-Mott insulator Transition in the Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the coherence and spatial dressing of a single impurity evolve in the two-dimensional Bose--Hubbard model when the impurity couples attractively to the bath. Using large-scale, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations based on the worm algorithm, we track the impurity winding number, the bath superfluid density and compressibility, and impurity--bath density correlations. First, by fixing the bath interaction at $U_{\mathrm{b}}/t=13.3$ in the superfluid regime and tuning the attractive impurity-bath coupling from $U_{\mathrm{ib}}/t=-1.0$ to $-40.0$, we uncover an interaction-driven winding-collapse localization: the impurity evolves from a mobile light polaron with finite winding to a heavy polaron and, finally, to a bound cluster with vanishing winding, while the bath remains globally superfluid. Second, we analyze impurity in Mott-insulating baths for both attractive and repulsive impurity--bath couplings, contrasting the resulting deformation clouds and localization patterns. Third, for a moderate attractive impurity-bath coupling $U_{\mathrm{ib}}/t=-8.0$, we tune the bath interaction $U_{\mathrm{b}}/t$ across the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition and find a compressibility-controlled localization crossover of coherent impurity motion. Finally, together with our companion Letter [\emph{The Fate of a Single Impurity in the Bose--Hubbard Model}], which focused on repulsive impurity-bath couplings, these results provide a unified microscopic picture of impurity localization in the Bose--Hubbard model, connecting interaction-driven and compressibility-controlled mechanisms across both attractive and repulsive regimes.</description>

      <title>Pathway to Kondo physics in ytterbium atom chains with repulsive spin impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo effect is a paradigmatic model of strongly-correlated physics, where a magnetic impurity forms a many-body singlet with a fermionic environment. Cold gases of ytterbium (Yb) atoms have been proposed to be an ideal platform to study the Kondo effect since different internal states of the atom can be used to create both the impurity and the fermionic environment. In Yb gases, however, the atomic impurity interacts with the fermionic environment both through magnetic and potential scattering. These two scattering mechanisms counteract one another, raising the question of how robust Kondo screening remains. Here, we show that potential scattering can quench the Kondo screening in one-dimensional Yb gases; yet, strikingly, Kondo physics survives this quench in well-defined regimes. Combining analytical renormalization-group theory for a Luttinger liquid with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we identify a transition from a strongly- to a weakly-entangled impurity as potential scattering is increased. The two approaches show excellent agreement concerning the stability of Kondo physics throughout the different parameter regimes considered. Our results provide a quantitative criterion for the emergence of Kondo screening in one-dimensional Yb gases and delineate experimentally accessible regimes for its realization in cold-atom platforms.</description>

      <title>From three-body resonances to bound states in a continuum: pole trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of three-body bound states in the continuum by tracing pole trajectories in the complex energy plane under variation of system parameters. Using a one-dimensional model of two identical bosons and a distinguishable particle interacting via Gaussian potentials, we systematically vary the interaction strength, interaction range, and mass ratio. Our results confirm the parametric nature of few-body bound states in a continuum (BIC) and extend this characterization to a broader set of system parameters. Specifically, we find that variations of both interaction parameters and the mass ratio can lead to the formation of at least one three-body BIC. However, the exact shape of trajectories differs, and for the mass ratio variation we find a more regular pattern with multiple BIC locations. These results suggest that the mechanism of few-body BIC formation is more sensitive to the kinematic structure of the problem than to the specific details of the two-body interaction.</description>

      <title>Traveling supersolid stripe patterns in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a traveling supersolid stripe pattern in a spin-orbit-coupled Bose gas. This configuration is associated with an unequal population of the two single-particle energy minima, giving rise to a chemical potential difference that sets the fringe velocity. Unlike stationary stripes, the moving pattern is spin-polarized, with decreasing contrast as the population imbalance increases, eventually leading to stripe melting and transition to the uniform plane-wave phase. The Bogoliubov spectrum of the moving stripes exhibits asymmetry under inversion of the excitation quasimomentum. At high population imbalance, we identify energetic and dynamical instabilities in the spin-phonon mode which transforms to the roton mode of the plane-wave phase as the stripe structure vanishes.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory for the superfluid vortex lattice from coset construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Guided by symmetry principles, we construct an effective field theory that captures the long-wavelength dynamics of two-dimensional vortex crystals observed in rotating Bose-Einstein condensates trapped in a harmonic potential. By embedding the system into Newton--Cartan spacetime and analyzing its isometries, we identify the appropriate spacetime symmetry group for trapped condensates at finite angular momentum. After introducing a coarse-grained description of the vortex lattice we consider a homogeneous equilibrium configuration and discuss the associated symmetry breaking pattern. We apply the coset construction method to identify covariant structures that enter the effective action and discuss the physical interpretation of the inverse Higgs constraints. We verify that Kohn's theorem is satisfied within our construction and subsequently focus on the gapless sector of the theory. In this regime, the effective theory accommodates a single gapless excitation--the Tkachenko mode--for which we construct both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order actions, the latter including cubic interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Lectures on insulating and conducting quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two of the iconic phases of the hole-doped cuprate materials are the intermediate temperature pseudogap metal and the lower temperature $d$-wave superconductor. Following the prescient suggestion of P. W. Anderson, there were numerous early theories of these phases as doped quantum spin liquids. However, these theories have had difficulties with two prominent observations:
  (i) angle-dependent magnetoresistance measurements (ADMR) in the pseudogap metal, including observation of the Yamaji effect, present convincing evidence of small hole pockets which can tunnel coherently between square lattice layers (Fang et al., Nature Physics 18, 558 (2022); Chan et al., Nature Physics 21, 1753 (2025)) and
  (ii) the velocities of the nodal Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the $d$-wave superconductor are highly anisotropic, with $v_F \gg v_\Delta$ (Chiao et al., Phys. Rev. B 62, 3554 (2000)).
  These lecture notes review how the fractionalized Fermi Liquid (FL*) state, which dopes quantum spin liquids with gauge-neutral electron-like quasiparticles, resolves both difficulties. Theories of insulating quantum spin liquids employing fractionalization of the electron spin into bosonic or fermionic partons are discussed. Doping the bosonic parton theory leads to a holon metal theory: while not appropriate for the cuprate pseudogap, this theory is argued to apply to the Lieb lattice. Doping the fermionic parton theory leads to a $d$-wave superconductor with nearly isotropic quasiparticle velocities. The construction of the FL* state in a single band Hubbard-type model is described using a quantum dimer model, followed by a more realistic description using the Ancilla Layer Model (ALM), which is then used to obtain the theory of the pseudogap and the $d$-wave superconductor.</description>
