      <title>Characterizing the Experiment for Calibration with Uranium (Excalibur) Neutron Source for Use in Warhead Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron sources can play a variety of roles in warhead verification. For transmission radiography, a source of directed high energy neutrons is required, while for applications to detect fissile isotopes, sub-MeV neutrons are preferred. The Excalibur (Experiment for Calibration with Uranium) neutron source has been built and used in a variety of verification-related experiments. Excalibur is based on a commercial deuterium-tritium neutron generator specified and measured to be capable of producing 14 MeV neutrons at rates of up to 8.2$\times$10$^8$ neutrons/s. The generator is enclosed in a carbon-steel 32$^{\prime\prime}$ diameter, 23.62$^{\prime\prime}$ high carbon-steel cylinder that moderates the mean neutron energy to under 500 keV. This, in turn, is encased in 5\%-borated polyethylene such that the entire assembly is a 48$^{\prime\prime}$$\times$48$^{\prime\prime}$ box that is 30$^{\prime\prime}$ tall. For radiographic applications, a narrow, tapered channel in the steel and polyethylene allows 14 MeV neutrons to stream directly from the generator to a test object. Its collimating capability is demonstrated by measuring the neutron flux profile. In the moderated mode of operation, the generator is fully enclosed in the steel, but a large section of the polyethylene is removed, providing a flux of sub-MeV neutrons from a wide range of angles. Neutron angular and spectral measurements using both a nested neutron spectrometer and a commercial liquid scintillator coupled with a $^3$He detector show the expected softer neutron spectrum in moderated mode in good agreement with MCNP6 calculations. The gamma-ray spectrum from Excalibur is also in good agreement with MCNP modeling. Based on these findings, the future application of Excalibur in its two configurations is discussed.</description>

      <title>Fast Maximum Likelihood Positioning for a Staggered Layer Scintillation PET Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a fast implementation of a Maximum Likelihood Positioning (MLP) algorithm to estimate the energy and identify the active scintillator pixel in staggered layer scintillation detectors for PET. The staggered layer design with pixelated scintillators enables the determination of the gamma's depth of interaction and facilitates an iteration-free formulation of the MLP algorithm. The efficacy of the algorithm optimization was tested on a scintillation detector block designed for an ultra-high field BrainPET 7T, comprising three scintillator pixel layers. The three layers contain 24 x 24, 24 x 23 and 23 x 22 scintillator pixels, respectively, with a pixel pitch of 2 mm in both directions and layer thicknesses of 9, 8 and 7 mm. Calibration measurements, in combination with an automated calibration script, were used to obtain the expected counts of scintillation photons required in the MLP algorithm. Using Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data parallelization, multi-threading and optimized cache lines, a maximum processing speed of approximately 22.5 million singles per second was achieved on a platform with four Intel Xeon Platinum 8168 CPUs and 60 threads, encompassing all required processing steps. The automatic calibration failed for 1 to 15 individual scintillator pixels in approximately 10 per cent of the 120 scintillation detector blocks, necessitating manual correction. After applying the energy correction to the positioned single events, an energy resolution of of 12 +/- 2 per cent FWHM was obtained for the entire scintillation block. This value is very close to the energy resolutions measured for the individual scintillator pixels, proving that the MLP accurately identifies the scintillating pixel and that the energy correction method effectively compensates for the light collection variations of the SiPM array.</description>

      <title>Flexible BiSel/NiO-based X-ray synapses bridging the functions of detection and memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.</description>

      <title>Optimization of geomagnetic shielding based on detection efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the progressive increase in size of the latest Cherenkov-type detectors, it is becoming increasingly important to design a suitable compensation system based on coils of the Earth's magnetic field to ensure the correct operation of the photomultipliers (PMTs). Until now, most studies have assessed the correct functioning of such a system by the proportion of PMTs experiencing more than 100 mG of magnetic field perpendicular to their axis. In the present study, we discuss whether this evaluation parameter is the most appropriate and propose the average residual perpendicular magnetic field $&lt;B_{perp}&gt;$ as an alternative that more closely reflects the loss of detection efficiency of PMTs. A compensation system design is also proposed that offers good results as well as being economical to optimise this parameter.</description>

      <title>Metal Foil Detectors assembly for the beam and background monitoring in the LHCb experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After an upgrade in 2019--2021, the LHCb experiment is taking data in Run 3 (2022--2026) with an instantaneous luminosity of proton-proton collisions of $2\!\times\!10^{33}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. This article presents the Radiation Monitoring System (RMS-R3) for controlling the beam and background conditions at LHCb. It runs continuously during the detector's operation, and independently of the main LHCb data acquisition. Its design is based on robust and radiation-hard Metal Foil Detector technology. The RMS-R3 monitors the instantaneous luminosity and its evolution. The analysis of the RMS-R3 Run 3 data demonstrates its linear response with a high reproducibility in a five-decade dynamic range of luminosity over a long period of operation.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Beam Profiles in Accelerator Neutrino Experiments through Off-Axis Neutrino Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach that utilizes neutrino events from the off-axis near detector to investigate the beam profile in long-baseline neutrino experiments. Understanding the dynamics of the neutrino beam is crucial for improving the precision of neutrino oscillation measurements. We demonstrate that certain observables related to the azimuthal angle of the neutrino direction are useful for determining the average neutrino production point from experimental data, providing a valuable cross-check against Monte Carlo simulations. Additionally, these observables can help identify potential alignment issues between the detector and the decay volume. In future neutrino experiments with significantly higher statistics, these observables will become essential to ensure the accuracy and stability of the beam profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient and cost-effective way to train operators of complex systems with limited accessibility, such as sub-detectors of big experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our coaching station was developed to train on-call shifters for the ALICE Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT). This coaching station significantly reduces the training period and enhances the trainee's confidence in their actions. We hope this work will inspire the construction of comparable training systems for other sub-detectors.</description>

      <title>Calorimeter commissioning of the SuperNEMO Demonstrator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SuperNEMO experiment is searching for neutrinoless double beta decay of \textsuperscript{82}Se, with the unique combination of a tracking detector and a segmented calorimeter. This feature allows to detect the two electrons emitted in the decay and measure their individual energy and angular distribution. The SuperNEMO calorimeter consists of 712 plastic scintillator blocks readout by large PMTs. After the construction of the demonstrator calorimeter underground, we have performed its first commissioning using $\gamma$-particles from calibration sources or from the ambient radioactive background. This article presents the quality assurance tests of the SuperNEMO demonstrator calorimeter and its first time and energy calibrations, with the associated methods.</description>
