      <title>Guarded Fragments Meet Dynamic Logic: The Story of Regular Guards (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Guarded Fragment with Regular Guards (RGF), which combines the expressive power of the Guarded Fragment (GF) with Propositional Dynamic Logic with Intersection and Converse (ICPDL). Our logic generalizes, in a uniform way, many previously-studied extensions of GF, including (conjunctions of) transitive or equivalence guards, transitive or equivalence closure and more. We prove 2EXPTIME-completeness of the satisfiability problem for RGF, showing that RGF is not harder than ICPDL or GF. Shifting to the query entailment problem, we provide undecidability results that significantly strengthen and solidify earlier results along those lines. We conclude by identifying, in a natural sense, the maximal EXPSPACE-complete fragment of RGF.</description>

      <title>Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Offline Reinforcement Learning for Medicaid Care Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Feasibility-Guided Fair Adaptive Reinforcement Learning (FG-FARL), an offline RL procedure that calibrates per-group safety thresholds to reduce harm while equalizing a chosen fairness target (coverage or harm) across protected subgroups. Using de-identified longitudinal trajectories from a Medicaid population health management program, we evaluate FG-FARL against behavior cloning (BC) and HACO (Hybrid Adaptive Conformal Offline RL; a global conformal safety baseline). We report off-policy value estimates with bootstrap 95% confidence intervals and subgroup disparity analyses with p-values. FG-FARL achieves comparable value to baselines while improving fairness metrics, demonstrating a practical path to safer and more equitable decision support.</description>

      <title>Uniformity within Parameterized Circuit Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study uniformity conditions for parameterized Boolean circuit families. Uniformity conditions require that the infinitely many circuits in a circuit family are in some sense easy to construct from one shared description. For shallow circuit families, logtime-uniformity is often desired but quite technical to prove. Despite that, proving it is often left as an exercise for the reader -- even for recently introduced classes in parameterized circuit complexity, where uniformity conditions have not yet been explicitly studied. We formally define parameterized versions of linear-uniformity, logtime-uniformity, and FO-uniformity, and prove that these result in equivalent complexity classes when imposed on $\text{para-}\textsf{AC}^0$ and $\text{para-}\textsf{AC}^{0\uparrow}$. Overall, we provide a convenient way to verify uniformity for shallow parameterized circuit classes, and thereby substantiate claims of uniformity in the literature.</description>

      <title>Double Glueing over Free Exponential: with Measure Theoretic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07726v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a compact method to lift the free exponential construction of Mellies-Tabareau-Tasson over the Hyland-Schalk double glueing for orthogonality categories. A condition ``reciprocity of orthogonality'' is presented simply enough to lift the free exponential over the double glueing in terms of the orthogonality. Our general method applies to the monoidal category TsK of the s-finite transition kernels with countable biproducts. We show (i) TsK^op has the free exponential, which is shown to be describable in terms of measure theory. (ii) The s-finite transition kernels have an orthogonality between measures and measurable functions in terms of Lebesgue integrals. The orthogonality is reciprocal, hence the free exponential of (i) lifts to the orthogonality category O_I(TsK^op), which subsumes Ehrhard et al's probabilistic coherent spaces as a full subcategory of countable measurable spaces. To lift the free exponential, the measure-theoretic uniform convergence theorem commuting Lebesgue integral and limit plays a crucial role as well as Fubini-Tonelli theorem for double integral in s-finiteness. Our measure-theoretic orthogonality is considered as a continuous version of the orthogonality of the probabilistic coherent spaces for linear logic, and in particular provides a two layered decomposition of Crubille et al's direct free exponential for these spaces.</description>

      <title>A minimal coalition logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coalition Logic is an important logic in logical studies of strategic reasoning, whose models are concurrent game models. In this paper, first, we systematically discuss three assumptions of concurrent game models and argue that they are too strong. The first is seriality; that is, every coalition always has an available joint action. The second is the independence of agents; that is, the merge of two available joint actions of two disjoint coalitions is always an available joint action of the union of the two coalitions. The third is determinism; that is, all available joint actions of the grand coalition always have a unique outcome. Second, we present a coalition logic based on general concurrent game models which do not have the three assumptions and show its completeness. This logic seems minimal for reasoning about coalitional powers.</description>

      <title>Non-wellfounded parsimonious proofs and non-uniform complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the complexity-theoretical aspects of cyclic and non-wellfounded proofs in the context of parsimonious logic, a variant of linear logic where the exponential modality ! is interpreted as a constructor for streams over finite data. We present non-wellfounded parsimonious proof systems capturing the classes $\mathbf{FP}$ and $\mathbf{FP}/\mathsf{poly}$. Soundness is established via a polynomial modulus of continuity for continuous cut-elimination. Completeness relies on an encoding of polynomial Turing machines with advice within a type assignment system based on parsimonious logic. As a byproduct of our proof methods, we establish a series of characterisation results for various finitary proof systems.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Generalized HyperLTL with Stuttering and Contexts (full version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We settle the complexity of satisfiability and model-checking for generalized HyperLTL with stuttering and contexts, an expressive logic for the specification of asynchronous hyperproperties. Such properties cannot be specified in HyperLTL, as it is restricted to synchronous hyperproperties. Nevertheless, we prove that satisfiability is $\Sigma_1^1$-complete and thus not harder than for HyperLTL. On the other hand, we prove that model-checking is equivalent to truth in second-order arithmetic, and thus much harder than the decidable HyperLTL model-checking problem. The lower bounds for the model-checking problem hold even when only allowing stuttering or only allowing contexts.</description>

      <title>Inconsistency Handling in Prioritized Databases with Universal Constraints: Complexity Analysis and Links with Active Integrity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the problem of repairing and querying inconsistent databases equipped with universal constraints. We adopt symmetric difference repairs, in which both deletions and additions of facts can be used to restore consistency, and suppose that preferred repair actions are specified via a binary priority relation over (negated) facts. Our first contribution is to show how existing notions of optimal repairs, defined for simpler denial constraints and repairs solely based on fact deletion, can be suitably extended to our richer setting. We next study the computational properties of the resulting repair notions, in particular, the data complexity of repair checking and inconsistency-tolerant query answering. Finally, we clarify the relationship between optimal repairs of prioritized databases and repair notions introduced in the framework of active integrity constraints. In particular, we show that Pareto-optimal repairs in our setting correspond to founded, grounded and justified repairs w.r.t. the active integrity constraints obtained by translating the prioritized database. Our study also yields useful insights into the behavior of active integrity constraints.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability of commutative vs. non-commutative CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11709v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mermin-Peres magic square is a celebrated example of a system of Boolean linear equations that is not (classically) satisfiable but is satisfiable via linear operators on a Hilbert space of dimension four. A natural question is then, for what kind of problems such a phenomenon occurs? Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini answered this question for all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): For 0-Valid-SAT, 1-Valid-SAT, 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, and Dual Horn-SAT, classical satisfiability and operator satisfiability is the same and thus there is no gap; for all other Boolean CSPs, these notions differ as there are gaps, i.e., there are unsatisfiable instances that are satisfiable via operators on Hilbert spaces.
  We generalize their result to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains and give an almost complete classification: First, we show that NP-hard CSPs admit a separation between classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Second, we show that tractable CSPs of bounded width have no satisfiability gaps of any kind. Finally, we show that tractable CSPs of unbounded width can simulate, in a satisfiability-gap-preserving fashion, linear equations over an Abelian group of prime order $p$; for such CSPs, we obtain a separation of classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, if $p=2$, such CSPs also have gaps separating classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>
