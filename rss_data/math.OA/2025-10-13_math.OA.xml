      <title>Minimality and effectiveness of the groupoid associated to a self-similar ultragraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of a self-similar ultragraph $(G,\mathcal{U},\varphi)$ and its $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal{O}_{G,\mathcal{U}}$ were introduced in our recent work, where we proposed inverse semigroup and groupoid models for such $C^*$-algebras as well. In this paper, we investigate minimality and effectiveness of the groupoid of a self-similar ultragraph $(G,\mathcal{U},\varphi)$. In particular, we obtain a result for simplicity of the $C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{O}_{G,\mathcal{U}}$ in a certain case.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Nilpotent Matrix Orderings: Comparison and Applications in Dynamic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our earlier work, we proposed the \emph{Spectral and Nilpotent Ordering} (SNO) as a new framework that extends matrix comparison beyond the Hermitian setting by incorporating both spectral and nilpotent structures. Building on that foundation, the present paper develops concrete certificates and applications of SNO. First, we employ generalized Gershgorin theorems to design certificates for spectral ordering that avoid direct eigenvalue computation and analyze their robustness under perturbations. Second, we introduce rank-based criteria that provide certificates for ordering the nilpotent parts of matrices without requiring a full Jordan decomposition. Finally, we apply the SNO framework to linear dynamical systems, where we construct a hierarchy of stability orderings that capture both asymptotic and transient behaviors. These contributions advance the theoretical underpinnings of SNO and demonstrate its potential as a versatile tool for operator analysis, computational methods, and stability studies in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Every conformal net has an associated unitary VOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and conformal nets are the two most prominent mathematical axiomatizations of two-dimensional unitary chiral conformal field theories. They are conjectured to be equivalent, but a rigorous comparison has proven challenging. We resolve one direction of the conjecture by showing that every conformal net has an associated unitary VOA. We also show that every representation of a conformal net in which the generator of rotation acts with discrete spectrum and finite-dimensional eigenspaces yields a unitary module of the corresponding VOA. A talk describing our results is available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_LhNSeiiaE .</description>

      <title>Proximality and selflessness for group C*-algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07938v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the reduced group C*-algebras of infinite countable discrete groups having topologically-free extreme boundaries, or more generally groups that satisfy certain combinatorial property including all acylindrically hyperbolic groups with no nontrivial finite normal subgroups, are selfless in the sense of L. Robert. This generalizes the recent result of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell. We also prove that selflessness is stable under tensor product among exact C*-algebras and that a C*-probability space is selfless provided that it is either simple and purely infinite or simple, exact, Z-stable, and uniquely tracial.</description>

      <title>Bilinear maps having Jordan product property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09052v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study symmetric continuous bilinear maps $V$ on a C$^*$-algebra $A$ that have the Jordan product property at a fixed element $z\in A$. We show that, whenever $A$ is a finite direct sum or a $c_0$-sum of infinite simple von Neumann algebras, such a map $V$ has the square-zero property. Then, it is proved that $V(a,b)=T(a\circ b)$ for some bounded linear map $T$ on $A$. As a consequence, Jordan homomorphisms and derivations at $z\in A$ are characterized.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative geometry on the Berkovich projective line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct several $C^*$-algebras and spectral triples associated to the Berkovich projective line $\mathbb{P}^1_{\mathrm{Berk}}({\mathbb{C}_p})$. In the commutative setting, we construct a spectral triple as a direct limit over finite $\mathbb{R}$-trees. More general $C^*$-algebras generated by partial isometries are also presented. We use their representations to associate a Perron-Frobenius operator and a family of projection valued measures. Finally, we show that invariant measures, such as the Patterson-Sullivan measure, can be obtained as KMS-states of the crossed product algebra with a Schottky subgroup of $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathbb{C}_p)$.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the fixed point operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries on a tensor product quasi-local algebra if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an ``on-site" action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove two anomaly enforced gaplessness theorems, one for internal categorical symmetries and one for anomalous duality channels. Using the first, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exist gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain.</description>
