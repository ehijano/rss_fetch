      <title>Well-Quasi-Orderings on Word Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of finite words over a well-quasi-ordered set is itself well-quasi-ordered. This seminal result by Higman is a cornerstone of the theory of well-quasi-orderings and has found numerous applications in computer science. However, this result is based on a specific choice of ordering on words, the (scattered) subword ordering. In this paper, we describe to what extent other natural orderings (prefix, suffix, and infix) on words can be used to derive Higman-like theorems. More specifically, we are interested in characterizing languages of words that are well-quasi-ordered under these orderings. We show that a simple characterization is possible for the prefix and suffix orderings, and that under extra regularity assumptions, this also extends to the infix ordering. We furthermore provide decision procedures for a large class of languages, that contains regular and context-free languages.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic arithmetic progressions in the Fibonacci word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the lengths and starting positions of the longest monochromatic arithmetic progressions for a fixed difference in the Fibonacci word. We provide a complete classification for their lengths in terms of a simple formula. Our strongest results are proved using methods from dynamical systems, especially the dynamics of circle rotations. We also employ computer-based methods in the form of the automatic theorem-proving software Walnut. This allows us to extend recent results concerning similar questions for the Thue-Morse sequence and the Rudin-Shapiro sequence. This also allows us to obtain some results for the Fibonacci word that do not seem to be amenable to dynamical methods.</description>

      <title>Refuting Equivalence in Probabilistic Programs with Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of refuting equivalence of probabilistic programs, i.e., the problem of proving that two probabilistic programs induce different output distributions. We study this problem in the context of programs with conditioning (i.e., with observe and score statements), where the output distribution is conditioned by the event that all the observe statements along a run evaluate to true, and where the probability densities of different runs may be updated via the score statements. Building on a recent work on programs without conditioning, we present a new equivalence refutation method for programs with conditioning. Our method is based on weighted restarting, a novel transformation of probabilistic programs with conditioning to the output equivalent probabilistic programs without conditioning that we introduce in this work. Our method is the first to be both a) fully automated, and b) providing provably correct answers. We demonstrate the applicability of our method on a set of programs from the probabilistic inference literature.</description>

      <title>Discounted-Sum Automata with Multiple Discount Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discounting the influence of future events is a key paradigm in economics and it is widely used in computer-science models, such as games, Markov decision processes (MDPs), reinforcement learning, and automata. While a single game or MDP may allow for several different discount factors, discounted-sum automata (NDAs) were only studied with respect to a single discount factor. It is known that every class of NDAs with an integer as the discount factor has good computational properties: It is closed under determinization and under the algebraic operations min, max, addition, and subtraction, and there are algorithms for its basic decision problems, such as automata equivalence and containment. Extending the integer discount factor to an arbitrary rational number, loses most of these good properties.
  We define and analyze nondeterministic discounted-sum automata in which each transition can have a different integral discount factor (integral NMDAs). We show that integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors are not closed under determinization and under algebraic operations and that their containment problem is undecidable. We then define and analyze a restricted class of integral NMDAs, which we call tidy NMDAs, in which the choice of discount factors depends on the prefix of the word read so far. Among their special cases are NMDAs that correlate discount factors to actions (alphabet letters) or to the elapsed time. We show that for every function $\theta$ that defines the choice of discount factors, the class of $\theta$-NMDAs enjoys all of the above good properties of NDAs with a single integral discount factor, as well as the same complexity of the required decision problems. Tidy NMDAs are also as expressive as deterministic integral NMDAs with an arbitrary choice of discount factors.</description>
