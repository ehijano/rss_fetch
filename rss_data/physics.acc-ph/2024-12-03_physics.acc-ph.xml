      <title>Beam-cavity interactions in the rapid cycling synchrotron chain of the future muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The International Muon Collider Collaboration (IMCC) is engaged in a design study for a future facility intended to collide muons. Subsequent to the initial linear acceleration, the counter-rotating muons and anti-muons are accelerated in a chain of rapid cycling synchrotrons (RCS) up to the multi-TeV collision energy. To maximise the number of muons available in the collider, it is essential to exploit the time dilation of the muon lifetime by employing a large accelerating gradient.
  The 1.3 GHz TESLA cavity serves as the baseline for the RCS chain. Considering the high bunch population and the small aperture of the cavity, the resulting beam-induced voltage per bunch passage is considerable, resulting in a substantial perturbation of the cavity voltage for subsequent bunch passages. In this contribution, the effects of beam loading during the acceleration cycle on the muons are calculated with the objective of determining the optimum parameters for minimising the cavity voltage transients. The interaction of the induced voltages, considering the counter-rotating beams, is studied.</description>

      <title>Extracting millimeter-wavelength radio emission from a relativistic magnetron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Results of research are presented concerning operative modes of a high-voltage (relativistic) pulsed magnetron for the 8 mm wavelength range. Technical solutions are proposed for improving the output system of the device, such as to increase the efficiency of power extraction from the field-particle interaction space. The stability of the magnetron operation has been increased, enhanced quantitative indices of the output power to 381 kW in each of the two linear polarizations. And a stabilized frequency spectrum from 35.7 to 40 GHz of the EHF radiation generated.</description>

      <title>Source of powerful x-ray radiation based on a high current pulsed electron accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancement of the bremsstrahlung X-ray radiation (BSXR) power generated by the high-current relativistic electron beam (REB) of a pulsed direct-action accelerator TEMP-B is being curried out to use in particular for studying the radiation resistance of walls material of radioactive waste containers. For this the magnetic field in which REB is transported in the drift chamber is taken higher at some distance before the converter to provide REB diameter on the converter the same as in the drift chamber. Scheme of power supply and creation of the required magnetic field for the REB current transportation through the whole distance from the diode to the converter is developed. Higher BSXR dose per REB current pulse at the same energy resource is obtained.</description>

      <title>Excitation of quasi-monochromotic waves by a high-voltage pulse in a ferrite coaxial line with the periodic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental data and results of numerical simulations are presented, concerning excitation of narrowband gigahertz-range wave trains in coaxial guiding structures that are partially filled with ferromagnetic material and may involve periodically arranged metal inserts. The experiments performed confirm the possibility of exciting weakly damped electromagnetic waves by feeding high voltage, unilateral electromagnetic pulses of short duration into the line. The coax line was of outer diameter 50.5 mm, filled with an isotropic dielectric (relative dielectric constant {\epsilon} = 2.25) and a set of ferrite rings with {\epsilon}=16 and saturated-state {\mu} about 4 to 5. With a peak voltage of the primary pulse close to 160 kV and a magnetizing field of 17.5 kA/m, the parameters of the waves excited reached magnitudes as: frequency 1.89 GHz to 2.1 GHz; bandwidth 16%; VHF power at the output about 20 MW.</description>

      <title>Integrated simulation of cavity design and radiation transport codes (ACE3P + Geant4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simulation workflow has been developed to study dark current (DC) radiation effects using ACE3P and Geant4. The integrated workflow interfaces particle data transfer and geometry between the electromagnetic (EM) cavity simulation code ACE3P and the radiation code Geant4, targeting large-scale problems using high-performance computing. The process begins by calculating the operating mode in the vacuum region of an accelerator structure and tracking field-emitted electrons influenced by the EM fields of the mode calculated by ACE3P. It then transfers particle data at the vacuum-wall interface for subsequent radiation calculations within the wall enclosure materials through Geant4 calculation. The whole integrated simulation workflow will be demonstrated through large-scale dark current radiation calculations for the KEK 56-cell traveling-wave structure, and the efficiency of performing these simulations on the NERSC supercomputer Perlmutter will be presented.</description>
