      <title>Learning and Equilibrium under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter develops a unified framework for studying misspecified learning situations in which agents optimize and update beliefs within an incorrect model of their environment. We review the statistical foundations of learning from misspecified models and extend these insights to environments with endogenous, action-dependent data, including both single agent and strategic settings.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sender Disclosure with Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study voluntary disclosure with multiple biased senders who may bear costs for disclosing or concealing their private information. Under relevant assumptions, disclosures are strategic substitutes under a disclosure cost but complements under a concealment cost. Additional senders thus impede any sender's disclosure under a disclosure cost but promote it under a concealment cost. In the former case, a decision maker can be harmed by additional senders, even when senders have opposing interests. The effects under both kinds of message costs turn on how a sender, when concealing his information, expects others' messages to systematically sway the decision maker's belief.</description>

      <title>The incompatibility of the Condorcet winner and loser criteria with positive involvement and resolvability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there is no preferential voting method satisfying the Condorcet winner and loser criteria, positive involvement (if a candidate $x$ wins in an initial preference profile, then adding a voter who ranks $x$ uniquely first cannot cause $x$ to lose), and resolvability (if $x$ initially ties for winning, then $x$ can be made the unique winner by adding a single voter). In a previous note, we proved an analogous result assuming an additional axiom of ordinal margin invariance, which we now show is unnecessary for an impossibility theorem, at least if the desired voting method is defined for five-candidate elections.</description>

      <title>Risk and Monotone Comparative Statics without Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend well-known comparative results under expected utility to models of non-expected utility by providing novel conditions on local utility functions. We illustrate how our results parallel, and are distinct from, existing results for monotone comparative statics under expected utility, as well as risk preferences for non-expected utility. Our conditions generalize existing results for specific preferences (including expected utility) and allow us to verify monotone comparative statics for novel environments and preferences. We apply our results to portfolio choice problems where preferences or wealth might change, as well as precautionary savings.</description>

      <title>Entropic Approach to Critical Materials Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most methodologies for materials criticality assessment score supply risk and societal importance. Market-based criteria offer quantitative measures for assessment. Here we develop a statistical approach based on a geologic entropy function in which flexible constraints, such as economic, national security related, or regulatory, can be applied. As an example, the formulation describes the relation between elemental price and crustal abundance for selected elements, both important to supply risk. The method may be applicable to parameters resulting from collective decisions exhibiting a highly peaked probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Motivating Effort with Information about Future Rewards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05643v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal mechanism to motivate effort in a dynamic principal-agent model without transfers. An agent is engaged in a task with uncertain future rewards and can quit at any time. The principal knows the reward and provides information over time to motivate effort. We provide a unified framework and derive the optimal information policy in closed form across stationary and nonstationary environments. Within this framework, we identify two precise conditions, each of which guarantees that dynamic disclosure is strictly valuable. First, if the principal is impatient compared to the agent, she prefers the front-loaded effort schedule induced by dynamic disclosure; in a stationary environment, dynamic disclosure is beneficial if and only if the principal is less patient. Second, in an environment where the agent would become pessimistic over time absent any disclosure, dynamic information provision can counteract this downward trend and encourage longer effort. Notably, patience remains a crucial determinant of the structure of the optimal policy.</description>

      <title>Classification in Equilibrium: Structure of Optimal Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes optimal classification when individuals adjust their behavior in response to the classification rule. We model the interaction between a designer and a population as a Stackelberg game: the designer selects a classification rule anticipating how individuals will comply, cheat, or abstain in order to obtain a favorable classification. Under standard monotone likelihood ratio assumptions, and for a general set of classification objectives, optimal rules belong to a small and interpretable family--single-threshold and two-cut rules--that encompass both conventional and counterintuitive designs. Our results depart sharply from prior findings that optimal classifiers reward higher signals. In equilibrium, global accuracy can be maximized by rewarding those with lower likelihood ratios or by concentrating rewards or penalties in a middle band to improve informational quality. We further characterize classification objectives that rule out socially harmful equilibria that disincentivize compliance for some populations.</description>
