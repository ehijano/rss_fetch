      <title>Disordered Dynamics in High Dimensions: Connections to Random Matrices and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of high dimensional dynamical systems driven by random matrices, focusing on applications to simple models of learning and generalization in machine learning theory. Using both cavity method arguments and path integrals, we review how the behavior of a coupled infinite dimensional system can be characterized as a stochastic process for each single site of the system. We provide a pedagogical treatment of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), a framework that can be flexibly applied to these settings. The DMFT single site stochastic process is fully characterized by a set of (two-time) correlation and response functions. For linear time-invariant systems, we illustrate connections between random matrix resolvents and the DMFT response. We demonstrate applications of these ideas to machine learning models such as gradient flow, stochastic gradient descent on random feature models and deep linear networks in the feature learning regime trained on random data. We demonstrate how bias and variance decompositions (analysis of ensembling/bagging etc) can be computed by averaging over subsets of the DMFT noise variables. From our formalism we also investigate how linear systems driven with random non-Hermitian matrices (such as random feature models) can exhibit non-monotonic loss curves with training time, while Hermitian matrices with the matching spectra do not, highlighting a different mechanism for non-monotonicity than small eigenvalues causing instability to label noise. Lastly, we provide asymptotic descriptions of the training and test loss dynamics for randomly initialized deep linear neural networks trained in the feature learning regime with high-dimensional random data. In this case, the time translation invariance structure is lost and the hidden layer weights are characterized as spiked random matrices.</description>

      <title>Hopping transport regimes and dimensionality transition: a unified Monte Carlo Random Resistor Network approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopping transport, characterized by carrier tunneling between localized states, is a key mechanism in disordered materials such as organic semiconductors, perovskites, nitride alloys, and 2D material-based inks. Two main regimes are typically observed: Variable Range Hopping and Nearest Neighbor Hopping, with a transition between them upon temperature variation. Despite numerous experimental observations, the modeling of this transition remain insufficiently explored and not fully understood. In this work, we present an in-house Monte Carlo Random Resistor Network-based simulator capable of capturing both hopping transport regimes. We demonstrate how material properties that define the network, such as localization length and the spatial and energetic distribution of sites, determine the dominant transport regime. The simulator has been successfully validated against experimental data, showing excellent agreement, reproducing the transition from one regime to the other and accurately capturing 1D, 2D and 3D variable range hopping behavior, providing both a theoretical framework for interpreting experiments and a powerful tool for studying transport mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Simulating diffusion and disorder-induced localization in random walks and transmission lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two complementary simulations that lead to an exploration of Anderson localization, a phenomenon in which wave diffusion is suppressed in disordered media by interference from multiple scattering. To build intuition, the first models the random walk of classical, non-interacting point-like particles, providing a clear analogy to the way disorder can limit transport. The second examines the propagation of an electromagnetic pulse through a one-dimensional, lossless transmission line with randomly varying propagation constant and characteristic impedance along its length, a system that captures the interference effects essential for true Anderson localization. We evaluate quantitative measures that reveal the transition from normal diffusion to localization of particles in one case, and the exponential confinement of wave energy in the other. Together, these simulations offer a pair of accessible tools for investigating localization phenomena in an instructional setting.</description>

      <title>Exact Mobility Edges in a Disorder-Free Dimerized Stark Lattice with Effective Unbounded Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02259v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a disorder-free one-dimensional single-particle Hamiltonian hosting an exact mobility edge (ME), placing the system outside the assumptions of no-go theorems regarding unbounded potentials. By applying a linear Stark potential selectively to one sublattice of a dimerized chain, we generate an effective Hamiltonian with unbounded, staggered hopping amplitudes. The unbounded nature of the hopping places the model outside the scope of the Simon-Spencer theorem, while the staggered scaling allows it to evade broader constraints on Jacobi matrices. We analytically derive the bulk spectrum in reciprocal space, identifying a sharp ME where the energy magnitude equals the inter-cell hopping strength. This edge separates a continuum of extended states from two distinct localized branches: a standard unbounded Wannier-Stark ladder and an anomalous bounded branch accumulating at the ME. The existence of extended states is supported by finite-size scaling of the inverse participation ratio up to system sizes $L \sim 10^9$. Furthermore, we propose an experimental realization using photonic frequency synthetic dimensions. Our numerical results indicate that the ME is robust against potential experimental imperfections, including frequency detuning errors and photon loss, establishing a practical path for observing MEs in disorder-free systems.</description>

      <title>Selective Imperfection as a Generative Framework for Analysis, Creativity and Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce materiomusic as a generative framework linking the hierarchical structures of matter with the compositional logic of music. Across proteins, spider webs and flame dynamics, vibrational and architectural principles recur as tonal hierarchies, harmonic progressions, and long-range musical form. Using reversible mappings, from molecular spectra to musical tones and from three-dimensional networks to playable instruments, we show how sound functions as a scientific probe, an epistemic inversion where listening becomes a mode of seeing and musical composition becomes a blueprint for matter. These mappings excavate deep time: patterns originating in femtosecond molecular vibrations or billion-year evolutionary histories become audible. We posit that novelty in science and art emerges when constraints cannot be satisfied within existing degrees of freedom, forcing expansion of the space of viable configurations. Selective imperfection provides the mechanism restoring balance between coherence and adaptability. Quantitative support comes from exhaustive enumeration of all 2^12 musical scales, revealing that culturally significant systems cluster in a mid-entropy, mid-defect corridor, directly paralleling the Hall-Petch optimum where intermediate defect densities maximize material strength. Iterating these mappings creates productive collisions between human creativity and physics, generating new information as musical structures encounter evolutionary constraints. We show how swarm-based AI models compose music exhibiting human-like structural signatures such as small-world connectivity, modular integration, long-range coherence, suggesting a route beyond interpolation toward invention. We show that science and art are generative acts of world-building under constraint, with vibration as a shared grammar organizing structure across scales.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Ohm's Law by Disorders in Low-Dimensional Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ohm's law provides a fundamental framework for understanding charge transport in conductors and underpins the concept of electrical scaling that has enabled the continuous advancement of modern CMOS technologies. As transistors are scaled to even smaller dimensions, device channels inevitably enter low-dimensional regimes to achieve higher performance. Low-dimensional materials such as atomically thin oxide semiconductors, 2D van der Waals semiconductors, and 1D carbon nanotubes, have thus emerged as key candidates for extending Moore's law. Here, we reveal the fundamental distinction between three-dimensional and low-dimensional conductors arising from disorder-induced electron localization, which leads to the breakdown of Ohm's law and lateral linear scaling. We develop a quantitative model that captures the role of the disordered region, a unique characteristic intrinsically to low-dimensional transistors. Furthermore, the disorder-induced localization framework consistently explains experimental observations in atomically thin In2O3 field-effect transistors across variations in channel length, temperature, thickness, and post-annealing conditions. This work establishes a unified physical picture for understanding and optimizing disorder-driven electronic transport in low-dimensional transistors.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a two-dimensional quantum glass state at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder in quantum many-body systems can drive transitions between ergodic and non-ergodic phases, yet the nature--and even the existence--of these transitions remains intensely debated. Using a two-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, we study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered landscape, tracking dynamics both in real space and in Hilbert space. Over a broad disorder range, we observe an intermediate non-ergodic regime with glass-like characteristics: physical observables become broadly distributed and some, but not all, degrees of freedom are effectively frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with finite-temperature quantum glassiness. In the same regime, we detect the onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion. By contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport persists with a nonzero diffusion coefficient. Our results show that there is a transition out of the ergodic phase in two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Bond Additivity and Persistent Geometric Imprints of Entanglement in Quantum Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the intricate structure of entanglement in quantum many-body systems remains a central challenge, as standard measures often obscure underlying geometric details. In this Letter, we introduce a powerful framework, termed multi-bipartition entanglement tomography, which probes the fine structure of entanglement across an exhaustive ensemble of distinct bipartitions. Our cornerstone is the discovery of a ``bond-additive law'', which reveals that the entanglement entropy can be precisely decomposed into a bulk volume-law baseline plus a geometric correction formed by a sum of local contributions from crossed bonds of varying ranges. This law distills complex entanglement landscapes into a concise set of entanglement bond tensions $\{\omega_j\}$, serving as a quantitative fingerprint of interaction locality. By applying this tomography to Hamiltonian dynamics, random quantum circuits, and Floquet dynamics, we resolve a fundamental distinction between thermalization mechanisms: Hamiltonian thermalized states retain a persistent geometric imprint characterized by a significantly non-zero $\omega_1$, while this structure is completely erased in random quantum circuit and Floquet dynamics. Our work establishes multi-bipartition entanglement tomography as a versatile toolbox for the geometric structure of quantum information in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Charge Hopping Dynamics along a Disordered Chain in Quantum Environments: Comparative Study of Different Rate Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a computational study of charge hopping dynamics along a one dimensional chain with Gaussian site energy disorder and linearly coupled quantum bath. Time dependent square displacements are calculated directly from numerical solutions of Pauli master equations, for five different rate kernels: exact Fermi golden rule (FGR) rate expression, stationary phase interpolation (SPI) approximation, semiclassical (SC) approximation, classical Marcus rate expression, and Miller-Abrahams expression. All results demonstrate diffusive behavior in the steady state limit. The results based on the FGR rate expression show that the charge transport in quantum bath can be much more sensitive to the disorder than the prediction from the classical Marcus expression. While the SPI approximation captures this general trend reasonably well, the SC approximation tends to be unreliable at both quantitative and qualitative levels, and becomes even worse than the classical Marcus expression under certain conditions. These results offer useful guidance in the choice of approximate rate kernels for larger scale simulations, and also demonstrate significant but fragile positive effects of quantum environments on the charge hopping dynamics.</description>

      <title>AI-enhanced tuning of quantum dot Hamiltonians toward Majorana modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a neural network-based model capable of learning the broad landscape of working regimes in quantum dot simulators, and using this knowledge to autotune these devices - based on transport measurements - toward obtaining Majorana modes in the structure. The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on synthetic data in the form of conductance maps, using a physics-informed loss that incorporates key properties of Majorana zero modes. We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Learning Hydro-Phoretic Interactions in Active Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quest to understand large-scale collective behavior in active matter, the complexity of hydrodynamic and phoretic interactions remains a fundamental challenge. To date, most works either focus on minimal models that do not (fully) account for these interactions, or explore relatively small systems. The present work develops a generic method that combines high-fidelity simulations with symmetry-preserving descriptors and neural networks to predict hydro-phoretic interactions directly from particle coordinates (effective interactions). This method enables, for the first time, self-contained particle-only simulations and theories with full hydro-phoretic pair interactions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous replica-symmetry breaking for vector spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider mean-field vector spin glasses with possibly non-convex interactions. Up to a small perturbation of the parameters defining the model, the asymptotic behavior of the Gibbs measure is described in terms of a critical point of an explicit functional. In this paper, we study some properties of these critical points. Under modest assumptions ensuring that different types of spins interact, we show that the replica-symmetry-breaking structures of the different types of spins are in one-to-one correspondence with one another. For instance, if some type of spins displays one level of replica-symmetry breaking, then so do all the other types of spins. This extends the recent results of [Electronic Journal of Probability, 27:1-75, 2022] and [Comm. Math. Phys., 394(3):1101-1152, 2022] that were obtained in the case of multi-species spherical spin glasses with convex interactions.</description>

      <title>Statistics of the Random Matrix Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21386</link>

Abstract: The spectral form factor of random matrix theory plays a key role in the description of disordered and chaotic quantum systems. While its moments are known to be approximately Gaussian, corrections subleading in the matrix dimension, $D$, have recently come to attention, with conflicting results in the literature. In this work, we investigate these departures from Gaussianity for both circular and Gaussian ensembles. Using two independent approaches -- sine-kernel techniques and supersymmetric field theory -- we identify the form factor statistics to next leading order in a $D^{-1}$ expansion. Our sine-kernel analysis highlights inconsistencies with previous studies, while the supersymmetric approach backs these findings and suggests an understanding of the statistics from a complementary perspective. Our findings fully agree with numerics. They are presented in a pedagogical way, highlighting new pathways (and pitfalls) in the study of statistical signatures at next leading order, which are increasingly becoming important in applications.</description>

      <title>Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11411v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.</description>

      <title>Probing phase transitions of finite directed polymers near a corrugated wall via two-replica analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15332v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pinning transition in a (1+1)-dimensional lattice model of a fluctuating interface interacting with a corrugated impenetrable wall. The interface is modeled as an $N$-step directed one-dimensional random walk on the half-line $x \ge 0$. Its interaction with the wall is described by a quenched, site-dependent, short-ranged random potential $u_j$ ($j = 1,\ldots,N$), distributed according to $Q(u_j)$ and localized at $x = 0$. By computing the first two disorder--averaged moments of the partition function, $\langle G_N \rangle$ and $\langle G_N^2 \rangle$, and by analyzing the analytic structure of the resulting expressions, we derive an explicit criterion for the coincidence or distinction of the pinning transitions in annealed and quenched systems. We show that, although the transition points of the annealed and quenched systems are always different in the thermodynamic limit, for finite systems there exists a "gray zone" in which this difference is hardly detectable. Our results may help reconcile conflicting views on whether quenched disorder is marginally relevant.</description>

      <title>Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description>

      <title>DeFecT-FF: Accelerated Modeling of Defects in Cd-Zn--Te-Se-S Compounds Combining High-Throughput DFT and Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We developed DeFecT-FF, a framework for predicting the energies and ground-state configurations of native point defects, extrinsic dopants, impurities, and defect complexes in zincblende-phase Cd/Zn-Te/Se/S compounds relevant to CdTe-based solar cells. The framework combines high-throughput DFT data with crystal graph-based machine learning force fields (MLFFs) trained to reproduce DFT energies and forces. Alloying at Cd or Te sites offers a route to tune the electronic and defect properties of CdTe absorbers for improved solar efficiency. Given the vast number of possible defect types, charge states, and symmetry-breaking configurations, traditional DFT approaches are computationally prohibitive. Our dataset includes GGA-PBE and HSE06-optimized structures for bulk, alloyed, interface, and grain-boundary systems. Using active learning, we expanded the dataset and trained MLFFs to accurately predict energies across charge states. The model enabled rapid screening and discovery of new low-energy defect configurations, validated through HSE06 calculations with spin-orbit coupling. The DeFecT-FF framework is publicly available as a nanoHUB tool, allowing users to upload crystallographic files, automatically generate defects, and compute defect formation energies versus Fermi level and chemical potentials, greatly reducing the need for expensive DFT simulations.</description>
