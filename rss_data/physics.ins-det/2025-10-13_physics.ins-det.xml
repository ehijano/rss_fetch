      <title>Development of 3D Pixel Sensors via an 8-inch CMOS-Compatible Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the construction of High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and Future Circular Collider (FCC) experiments, 3D pixel sensors have become indispensable components due to their superior radiation hardness, fast response, and low power consumption. However, there are still significant challenges in the process of 3D sensors manufacturing. In this work, single devices and arrays of 3D sensors based on 30 $\mu$m epitaxial silicon wafer have been designed, simulated, fabricated, and tested. This process was developed on the 8-inch CMOS process platform of the Institute of Microelectronics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMECAS). The key processes include Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) with the Bosch process, in-situ doping, and an innovative back-etching. After testing the 3D pixel sensors, we have summarized the leakage current and capacitance of devices with different sizes with respect to bias voltages. We also found that the fabricated devices were almost all successfully produced, which laid a strong foundation for subsequent large-scale mass production.</description>

      <title>The effect of magnetic fields on vertex reconstructed muon-spin spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of a Si pixel-based particle tracking scheme in muSR will, among others, allow measurements using a ten-fold increased stopped muons rate and samples ten times smaller than currently possible. Here we present simulation results to assess the effects of magnetic fields on two spectrometer configurations using a two-layered tracking scheme for the incoming and outgoing particles. At a low magnetic field of up to ~50 mT, the tracking and reconstruction accuracy is only minimally influenced. Beyond a magnetic field of ~80 mT the tracking capabilities diminish significantly. Operating a two-layered scheme using small magnetic fields hence does not require adaptations. Only at large magnetic fields, a tracking scheme that makes use of an accurate field map or the use of at least three layers must be employed to achieve reliable particle tracking.</description>

      <title>Performance of heavy-flavour jet identification in Lorentz-boosted topologies in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements in the highly Lorentz-boosted regime provoke increased interest in probing the Higgs boson properties and in searching for particles beyond the standard model at the LHC. In the CMS Collaboration, various boosted-object tagging algorithms, designed to identify hadronic jets originating from a massive particle decaying to $\mathrm{b\overline{b}}$ or $\mathrm{c\overline{c}}$, have been developed and deployed across a range of physics analyses. This paper highlights their performance on simulated events, and summarizes novel calibration techniques using proton-proton collision data collected at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV during the 2016$-$2018 LHC data-taking period. Three dedicated methods are used for the calibration in multijet events, leveraging either machine learning techniques, the presence of muons within energetic boosted jets, or the reconstruction of hadronically decaying high-energy Z bosons. The calibration results, obtained through a combination of these approaches, are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Unlocking New Frontiers: The Versatile Potential of the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multipurpose nature of nuclear research reactors has been investigated. This class of reactors has gained momentum within the international community, given the multiple benefits of nuclear technology in medicine, agriculture, industry, and the development of new materials, being characterized by the simultaneous use of several applications. In this context, Brazil has recently joined the group of countries with multipurpose reactor projects. The Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB) will be Brazil's new neutron source, with a thermal power of $30$ $MW$, with a core flux on the order of $\phi=4\times 10^{14}$ $n/cm^{2}s$ and a power density of $312.5$ $W/cm^3$, ensuring the production of radioisotopes, material and fuel irradiation testing, and neutron beam applications. In this work, the demand for neutron fluxes in different irradiation targets is investigated by Monte Carlo simulations under a perturbation caused by a highly neutron-absorbing material, the Gadolinium-157 (Gd-157) isotope. The results show that Molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) production is not affected by the Gd-157 target, and the minimum proposed thermal neutron flux for the reactor's activity ($\phi_{min}=5.1\times 10^{12}$ $n/cm^{2}s$) is guaranteed even at maximum operational capacity. The potential production of Terbium (Tb) isotopes for nuclear medicine applications in the RMB is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Improved Pixel-wise Calibration for Charge-Integrating Hybrid Pixel Detectors with Performance Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The M\"ONCH hybrid pixel detector, with a 25 \textmu m pixel pitch and fast charge-integrating readout, has demonstrated subpixel resolution capabilities for X-ray imaging and deep learning-based electron localization in electron microscopy. Fully exploiting this potential requires extensive calibration to ensure both linearity and uniformity of the pixel response, which is challenging for detectors with a large dynamic range. To overcome the limitations of conventional calibration methods, we developed an accurate and efficient correction method to achieve pixel-wise gain and nonlinearity calibration based on the backside pulsing technique. A three-dimensional lookup table was generated for all pixels across the full dynamic range, mapping the pixel response to a calibrated linear energy scale. Compared with conventional linear calibration, the proposed method yields negligible deviations between the calibrated and nominal energies for photons and electrons. The improvement in energy resolution ranges from 4% to 22% for 15-25 keV photons and from 16% to 23% for 60-200 keV electrons. Deep learning-based electron localization demonstrates a 4% improvement in spatial resolution when using the proposed calibration method. This approach further enables rapid diagnosis of the cause of bad pixels and estimation of bump-bonding yield.</description>

      <title>IPbus extension for the ALFRED framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a development of the ALFRED framework that includes support for the IPbus protocol, created for the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT) detector in the ALICE experiment at CERN. This modification resolves the incompatibility between the current GBT-based slow-control protocols and the FIT electronics, which is based on the IPbus. A compatibility layer, named ALF IPbus, was created in C++ and integrated with DIM services, allowing for the transparent conversion of SWT frames into IPbus transactions. Benchmark tests indicated median execution times of less than 4.2 $\mu$s per frame for sequences above 512 words, comfortably meeting the ALICE Detector Control System requirements. Long-term stability tests conducted in the FV0 detector achieved an uptime close to 100\% from the moment of implementation on the FIT-FV0 detector. This solution enables FIT operation without firmware changes, ensures smooth integration with SCADA systems, and provides a scalable pathway for future migration to GBT-based control. The approach is general and can be applied to other ALICE subdetectors and high-energy physics experiments requiring protocol bridging.</description>

      <title>In-situ Radiation Damage Study of Silicon Carbide Detectors Subjected to Clinical Proton Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon carbide (SiC) planar PiN diodes from two different manufacturers were irradiated with 252.7 MeV protons from a medical synchrotron. Over the course of two 8h irradiation shifts, the samples were exposed to increasing fluences ranging from 1.4e+11 to 3.5e+13 p+/cm^2. Electrical characterizations, including IV and CV measurements, were performed both before and after irradiation using probe stations, and for selected samples even in-situ between fluence steps directly at the irradiation facility. The results show a gradual compensation of the effective epitaxial doping concentration with each incremental fluence step, observed as a reduction in capacitance before full depletion and confirmed by the extracted effective doping concentration. From these measurements, linear donor removal rates are determined for all sample groups, with values ranging from 4.2/cm to 6.4/cm. These findings provide a quantitative basis for understanding radiation-induced charge carrier removal in 4H-SiC devices and are relevant for predicting the performance and lifetime of future radiation-hard detector technologies, including 4H-SiC LGADs.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the first wafer-scale prototype for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade: the monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the characterisation and testing of the first wafer-scale monolithic stitched sensor (MOSS) prototype developed for the ALICE ITS3 upgrade that is to be installed during the LHC Long Shutdown 3 (2026-2030). The MOSS chip design is driven by the truly cylindrical detector geometry that imposes that each layer is built out of two wafer-sized, bent silicon chips. The stitching technique is employed to fabricate sensors with dimensions of 1.4 $\times$ 25.9 cm, thinned to 50 $\mu$m. The chip architecture, in-pixel front-end, laboratory and in-beam characterisation, susceptibility to single-event effects, and series testing are discussed. The testing campaign validates the design of a wafer-scale stitched sensor and the performance of the pixel matrix to be within the ITS3 requirements. The MOSS chip demonstrates the feasibility of the ITS3 detector concept and provides insights for further optimisation and development.</description>

      <title>Optimised neural networks for online processing of ATLAS calorimeter data on FPGAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A study of neural network architectures for the reconstruction of the energy deposited in the cells of the ATLAS liquid-argon calorimeters under high pile-up conditions expected at the HL-LHC is presented. These networks are designed to run on the FPGA-based readout hardware of the calorimeters under strict size and latency constraints. Several architectures, including Dense, Recurrent (RNN), and Convolutional (CNN) neural networks, are optimised using a Bayesian procedure that balances energy resolution against network size. The optimised Dense, CNN, and combined Dense+RNN architectures achieve a transverse energy resolution of approximately 80 MeV, outperforming both the optimal filtering (OF) method currently in use and RNNs of similar complexity. A detailed comparison across the full dynamic range shows that Dense, CNN, and Dense+RNN accurately reproduce the energy scale, while OF and RNNs underestimate the energy. Deep Evidential Regression is implemented within the Dense architecture to address the need for reliable per-event energy uncertainties. This approach provides predictive uncertainty estimates with minimal increase in network size. The predicted uncertainty is found to be consistent, on average, with the difference between the true deposited energy and the predicted energy.</description>

      <title>Towards polarization-enhanced PET: Study of random background in polarization-correlated Compton events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality that utilizes positron-emitting isotopes, such as Ga-68 and F-18, for many diagnostic purposes. The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\pm$90$^{\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\sim$200 MBq to $\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements. We find that the signal-to-random background ratios (SBRs) obtained from the polarization-correlated events for Compton scattering angles $\theta_{1,2}\in[72^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$ and azimuthal angle difference $\Delta\phi=90^{\circ}\pm20^{\circ}$ are consistently higher than those from single-pixel events, with the ratio of their SBR values of 1.23. The SBR of the selected events also increases with the polarimetric modulation factor $\mu$, gaining $\sim$50\% in value during the experiment.</description>

      <title>Advancing Time-Resolved Spectroscopies with Custom Scanning Units and Event-Based Electron Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct electron detection is revolutionizing electron microscopy by offering lower noise, reduced point-spread function, and increased quantum efficiency. Among these advancements, the Timepix3 hybrid-pixel direct electron detector stands out for its unique ability to output temporal information about individual hits within its pixel array. Its event-based architecture enables data-driven detection, where individual events are immediately read out from the chip. While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of event-based detectors in various applications in the context of continuous-gun scanning transmission electron microscopes (STEM), the use of such detectors with standard scanning units remains underdeveloped. In this work, we present a custom-designed, Timepix3-compatible scanning unit specifically developed to leverage the advantages of event-based detection. We explore its performance in enabling spatially and temporally resolved experiments, as well as its seamless interfacing with other time-resolved instruments, such as pulsed lasers and electron beam blankers. Additionally, we examine the prospects for achieving enhanced temporal resolution in time-resolved experiments using continuous-gun electron microscopes, identifying key challenges and proposing solutions to improve performance. This combination of custom hardware with advanced detection technology promises to expand the capabilities of electron microscopy in both fundamental research and practical applications.</description>

Abstract: Polarized ion beams at the Electron Ion Collider are essential to address some of the most important open questions at the twenty-first century frontiers of understanding of the fundamental structure of matter. Here, we summarize the science case and identify polarized $^2$H, $^3$He, $^6$Li and $^7$Li ion beams as critical technology that will enable experiments which address the most important science. Further, we discuss the required ion polarimetry and spin manipulation in EIC. The current EIC accelerator design is presented. We identify a significant R\&amp;D effort involving both national laboratories and universities that is required over about a decade to realize the polarized ion beams and estimate (based on previous experience) that it will require about 20 FTE over 10 years (or a total of about 200 FTE-years) of personnel, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, technicians and engineers. Attracting, educating and training a new generation of physicists in experimental spin techniques will be essential for successful realization. AI/ML is seen as having significant potential for both acceleration of R\&amp;D and amplification of discovery in optimal realization of this unique quantum technology on a cutting-edge collider. The R\&amp;D effort is synergistic with research in atomic physics and fusion energy science.</description>

      <title>Studies of Hadronic Showers in SND@LHC</title>

Abstract: The SND@LHC experiment was built for observing neutrinos arising from LHC pp collisions. The detector consists of two sections: a target instrumented with SciFi modules and a hadronic calorimeter/muon detector. Energetic $\nu$N collisions in the target produce hadronic showers. Reconstruction of the shower total energy requires an estimate of the fractions deposited in both the target and the calorimeter. In order to calibrate the SND@LHC response, a replica of the detector was exposed to hadron beams with 100 to 300 GeV in the CERN SPS H8 test beam line in Summer 2023. This report describes the methods developed to tag the presence of a shower, to locate the shower origin in the target, and to combine the target SciFi and the calorimeter signals so to measure the shower total energy.</description>

      <title>Further Characterisation of Digital Pixel Test Structures Implemented in a 65 nm CMOS Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of MAPS for future tracking detectors will have to meet stringent requirements placed on them. One such detector is the ALICE ITS3 that aims to be very light at 0.07% X/X$_{0}$ per layer and have a low power consumption in the active area of 40 mW/cm$^{2}$ by implementing wafer-scale MAPS bent into cylindrical half layers. To address these challenging requirements, the ALICE ITS3 project, in conjunction with the CERN EP R&amp;D on monolithic pixel sensors, proposed the Tower Partners Semiconductor Co. 65 nm CMOS process as the starting point for the sensor. After the initial results confirmed the detection efficiency and radiation hardness, the choice of the technology was solidified by demonstrating the feasibility of operating MAPS in low-power consumption regimes, &lt; 50 mW/cm$^{2}$, while maintaining high-quality performance. This was shown through a detailed characterisation of the Digital Pixel Test Structure (DPTS) prototype exposed to X-rays and ionising beams, and the results are presented in this article. Additionally, the sensor was further investigated through studies of the fake-hit rate, the linearity of the front-end in the range 1.7-28 keV, the performance after ionising irradiation, and the detection efficiency of inclined tracks in the range 0-45$^\circ$.</description>

      <title>Probing arbitrary polarized photon pairs undergoing double Compton scatterings by a dedicated MC simulator validated with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the polarization degrees of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\Delta\hat\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample -- based on a total of $3 \times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\Delta\hat\Phi$. The simulated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental correlation spectra and behave as predicted by theory.</description>

      <title>Intensified optical camera with Timepix4 readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.27 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.55 to 1.4 ns in the single-photon regime with intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, pixel count, and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and time-walk, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.</description>

      <title>Design and assembly of a cavity microscope with high numerical aperture for quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of \SI{19.786}{\milli\meter}, a finesse of \SI{2.35}{\times 10^4} and operates \SI{214}{\micro\meter} away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Developing a Cost-Effective Spectrometer: A Practical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06703v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper demonstrates the design and execution of a low-cost optical spectrometer that employs a webcam, diffraction grating &amp; Python (a free, open-source programming language). The device's design prioritized economy and usability, with a black box casing to reduce stray light and increase measurement accuracy. A diffraction grating made from a DVD was used to split light into its constituent wavelengths, which were then collected by the camera. The calibration procedure used a RED TIDE USB650 Fiber Optic Spectrometer to set calibration values for various wavelength ranges, which ensured that the spectrometer's results closely matched those derived from the former, a high-cost industry-standard model. Spectrums of several light sources, such as red, green, blue, yellow, white, magenta, orange, and UV LEDs, as well as a green laser, were studied and compared. The results showed a high level of precision, with minimal divergence from industry-standard spectrometer measurements. This comparison was carried out utilizing Origin software, which allowed for extensive analysis and display of the spectrum data. In addition, the spectrometer captured data in real time, allowing users to watch live spectrum changes and ensure instant accessibility of results. Despite its simplicity and low cost, the spectrometer provides significant value for instructional and practical applications, making it a valuable tool in cost-constrained situations.</description>
