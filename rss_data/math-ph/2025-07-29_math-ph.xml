      <title>On Andr\'eka's Conjecture that special relativity is the only possible conceptual reduct of classical kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a pure mathematical result which has important implications for the history and philosophy of classical physics and the conceptual origins of relativity theory. In formal terms, we show that, up to definitional equivalence, there is no intermediate model of spacetime lying strictly between special relativity and late classical kinematics. Informally, this means that there was essentially no other option but to switch to special relativity to resolve the conflict between late classical kinematics and the null result of the Michelson--Morley experiment.</description>

      <title>Green's function estimates for long-range quasi-periodic operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish quantitative Green's function estimates for a class of quasi-periodic (QP) operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with certain slowly decaying long-range hopping and analytic cosine type potentials. As applications, we prove the arithmetic spectral localization, and obtain upper bounds on quantum dynamics for all phase parameters. To deal with quantum dynamics estimates, we develop an approach employing separation property (rather than the sublinear bound) of resonant blocks in the regime of Green's function estimates.</description>

      <title>Anomalies of global symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 't Hooft anomalies of global symmetries play a fundamental role in quantum many-body systems and quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we make a systematic analysis of lattice anomalies - the analog of 't Hooft anomalies in lattice systems - for which we give a precise definition. Crucially, a lattice anomaly is not a feature of a specific Hamiltonian, but rather is a topological invariant of the symmetry action. The controlled setting of lattice systems allows for a systematic and rigorous treatment of lattice anomalies, shorn of the technical challenges of QFT. We find that lattice anomalies reproduce the expected properties of QFT anomalies in many ways, but also have crucial differences. In particular, lattice anomalies and QFT anomalies are not, contrary to a common expectation, in one-to-one correspondence, and there can be non-trivial anomalies on the lattice that are infrared (IR) trivial: they admit symmetric trivial gapped ground states, and map to trivial QFT anomalies at low energies. Nevertheless, we show that lattice anomalies (including IR-trivial ones) have a number of interesting consequences in their own right, including connections to commuting projector models, phases of many-body localized (MBL) systems, and quantum cellular automata (QCA). We make substantial progress on the classification of lattice anomalies and develop several theoretical tools to characterize their consequences on symmetric Hamiltonians. Our work places symmetries of quantum many-body lattice systems into a unified theoretical framework and may also suggest new perspectives on symmetries in QFT.</description>

      <title>GSO Defects: IIA/IIB Walls and the Surprisingly Stable $\mathrm{R}7$-Brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently proposed Swampland Cobordism Conjecture predicts the existence of new non-supersymmetric objects which supplement the spectrum of low-energy gravitational effective field theories. In this paper, we study a subset of these defects related to the GSO projection on the string worldsheet. These include the predicted domain wall between Type IIA and IIB superstring theories and the newly-discovered $\mathrm{R}7$-brane. We study these defects in two different ways: via long-string probes and target-space effective field theory. We find that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane can be identified with a collapsed cylindrical configuration of the IIA/IIB wall, and further, that the $\mathrm{R}7$-brane is stable, in contrast to previous expectations. Moreover, we argue that BPS D-branes pulled across the IIA/IIB wall become non-BPS D-branes, which we identify with fluxbrane configurations. We show that the non-BPS D-branes of either Type II theory are charged under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ remnant of the Ramond-Ramond potentials of the other, which we identify with the mod 2 reduction of the Ramond-Ramond fluxes. Similar considerations provide a complementary perspective on the Heterotic ${\mathfrak{so}(32)}$ S-duals of known non-BPS 7- and 8-branes in Type I string theory.</description>

      <title>Elastic rigid rod in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the motion of a rigid elastic rod, initially set in its relaxed state along a spacelike geodesic, in an expanding Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. This leads to an initial boundary value problem (IBVP) for a nonlinear wave equation whose nonlinearity depends on a parameter $\kappa \geq 0$, related to the ratio between the rod's length and the cosmological scale. We show that if $\kappa$ is small enough then the solution to the IBVP is global in time and bounded, meaning that the rod's length oscillates around its initial value. For greater values of $\kappa$, however, the solution to the IBVP blows up in finite coordinate time, indicating that the rod is infinitely stretched by the cosmological expansion. This supports the widely held belief that sufficiently small bound systems do not follow the Hubble flow, whereas larger systems may do so. Similar conclusions apply to the tethered galaxy version of this problem, where the rod is used to connect two point masses (which results in nonlinear boundary conditions for the IBVP).</description>

      <title>Classification of $\Lambda \neq 0$-vacuum algebraically special spacetimes with conformally flat $\mathscr I$ from Weyl tensor expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general algebraic decomposition of Riemann-like and Weyl-like tensors with respect to a non-null vector $u$. We derive Gauss, Codazzi and Ricci-type identities for the Weyl tensor, that allow to relate the components of the spacetime Weyl tensor with intrinsic quantities of the hypersurfaces orthogonal to $u$.
  Restricting to the case of $\Lambda$-vacuum spacetimes (with $\Lambda \neq 0$ and any dimension) admiting a conformal compactification, we then study the behaviour of the Weyl tensor near $\mathscr I$ by means of an asymptotic expansion {\it \`a la} Fefferman-Graham, where the first terms are explicitly computed. We use these tools to characterize four dimensional algebraically special spacetimes with locally conformally flat $\mathscr{I}$, showing they match exactly the so-called {\it Kerr-de Sitter-like class with conformally flat $\scri$}, thus providing a geometric characterization of this class of spacetimes.</description>

Abstract: We compute the zero-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas invariants of the quotient stack $[\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_r]$, confirming a conjecture of Cao-Kool-Monavari. Our main theorem is established through an orbifold analogue of Cao-Zhao-Zhou's degeneration formula combined with the zero-dimensional Donaldson-Thomas invariants for $\mathcal{A}_{r-1}\times\mathbb{C}^2$ and an explicit determination of orientations of Hilbert schemes of points on $[\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_r]$.</description>

      <title>Parabolic Stabilization and Cutting for Reduction Superalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diagonal reduction algebra of a reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is a localization of the Mickelsson algebra associated to the symmetric pair $(\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g},\, \mathfrak{g})$. In 2010, Khoroshkin and Ogievetsky introduced the methods of stabilization and cutting, which relate the commutation relations in the diagonal reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_m\oplus\mathfrak{gl}_n$ with those in the diagonal reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_{m+n}$. We extend this method to a wide range of reduction algebras, including all diagonal and differential reduction algebras for basic classical Lie superalgebras. We show how the method can be used for computing relations in the diagonal reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{so}_8$ and differential reduction algebra of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Relational Quantum Field Theory I: Scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop foundations for a relational approach to quantum field theory (RQFT) based on the operational quantum reference frames (QRFs) framework considered in a relativistic setting. Unlike other efforts in combining QFT with QRFs, we use the latter to provide novel mathematical and conceptual foundations for the former. We focus on scalar fields in Minkowski spacetime and discuss the emergence of relational local (bounded) observables and (pointwise) fields from the consideration of Poincar\'e-covariant (quantum) frame observables defined over the space of (classical) inertial reference frames. We recover a relational notion of Poincar\'e covariance, with transformations on the system directly linked to the state preparations of the QRF. We introduce and analyse various causality conditions and how they can arise as a consequence of the properties of the frame itself. The theory makes direct contact with established foundational approaches to QFT: we demonstrate that the vacuum expectation values derived within our framework reproduce many of the essential properties of Wightman functions, carry out a detailed comparison of the proposed formalism with Wightman QFT with the frame smearing functions describing the QRF's localisation uncertainty playing the role of the Wightmanian test functions, and show how the algebras generated by relational local observables satisfy all of the core axioms of Algebraic QFT. We finish with an extensive outlook describing a number of further research directions. This work is an early step in revisiting the mathematical foundations of QFT from a relational and operational perspective.</description>

      <title>Constructive Quantum Field Theory on Curved Surfaces and Related Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the Ph.D. thesis of the author. In this thesis, we construct the $ P(\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that it satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this construction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the interaction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). We provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation regularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how Segal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which offers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this interpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field Theory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity corresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We then show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This allows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese (arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the asymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus tends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586). We provide a geometric proof--independent of Segal's axioms--of the corresponding result using heat kernels, in addition to another proof based on Segal's axioms. Both proofs are presented in the thesis.</description>

      <title>Darboux transformations and related non-Abelian integrable differential-difference systems of the derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct linear and quadratic Darboux matrices compatible with the reduction group of the Lax operator for each of the seven known non-Abelian derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations that admit Lax representations. The differential-difference systems derived from these Darboux transformations generalise established non-Abelian integrable models by incorporating non-commutative constants. Specifically, we demonstrate that linear Darboux transformations generate non-Abelian Volterra-type equations, while quadratic transformations yield two-component systems, including non-Abelian versions of the Ablowitz-Ladik, Merola-Ragnisco-Tu, and relativistic Toda equations. Using quasideterminants, we establish necessary conditions for factorising a higher-degree polynomial Darboux matrix with a specific linear Darboux matrix as a factor. This result enables the factorisation of quadratic Darboux matrices into pairs of linear Darboux matrices.</description>

      <title>Vibronic spectra at nonzero temperatures from Herman-Kluk coherence thermofield dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the semiclassical Herman--Kluk approximation with the coherence thermofield dynamics in order to evaluate vibrationally resolved electronic spectra at nonzero temperatures. In coherence thermofield dynamics, the dipole time correlation function is rewritten exactly as a wavepacket autocorrelation function, and the corresponding wavepacket is a solution to a zero-temperature time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation on an augmented configuration space of doubled dimension. We derive the Herman--Kluk representation for the thermofield wavepacket autocorrelation function and demonstrate how it can be computed from individual trajectories. To analyze this method, we compare spectra of Morse potentials of increasing anharmonicity evaluated at various temperatures with a numerically exact approach, with the Herman--Kluk coherence thermofield dynamics, and with the single-trajectory thawed Gaussian coherence thermofield dynamics. At low anharmonicity, both approximate methods yield accurate spectra. However, in a Morse potential with higher anharmonicity, the thawed Gaussian thermofield dynamics, based on the local harmonic approximation, fails to capture emerging hot bands, whereas the Herman--Kluk thermofield approach successfully reproduces them.</description>

      <title>Refined approach to cellularization: going from Heller's thawed Gaussian approximation to the Herman--Kluk propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a refined cellularization (Filinov filtering) scheme for the semiclassical Herman--Kluk propagator, which employs the inverse Weierstrass transform and optimal scaling of the cell's size with the number of cells, and was previously used only in the context of the dephasing representation. In the new methodology, the sampling density for the cell centers correlates with the cell size, allowing for an effective sampling of the phase space covered by the initial state of the system. The main advantage of the presented approach is that, unlike the standard cellularization, it converges to the original Herman--Kluk result in the limit of an infinite number of trajectories and to the thawed Gaussian approximation when a single trajectory is used. We illustrate the performance of the refined cellularization scheme by calculating autocorrelation functions and spectra of both integrable and chaotic model systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a homomorphism of associative superalgebras from the enveloping algebra of the orthosymplectic Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ to the Weyl-Clifford superalgebra $W(2n|n)$ with $2n$ even Weyl algebra generators and $n$ odd Clifford algebra generators. Under this homomorphism, the positive odd root vector $x\in\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ is sent to the Dirac operator $\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu\in W(2n|n)$ and generates a left ideal $I$. The corresponding reduction (super)algebra, denoted $Z_n$, is the normalizer of $I$ in $W(2n|n)$ modulo $I$. By construction, $Z_n$ acts on the space of all Clifford algebra-valued polynomial solutions to the (massless) Dirac equation. In this paper, we find a complete presentation of (a localization of) this so-termed Dirac reduction algebra. Furthermore, we use the Dirac reduction algebra to generate all polynomial solutions to the Dirac equation in $n$-dimensional flat spacetime.</description>

Abstract: Spectral methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) and stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) often use Fourier or polynomial spectral expansions on either uniform and non-uniform grids. However, while very widely used, especially for slowly-varying solutions, non-uniform spatial grids can give larger spatial discretization errors if the solutions change rapidly in space. Here, we implement a Fourier method that employs fast trigonometric expansions on a uniform grid with non-periodic boundaries using fast discrete sine transforms (DST) or/and discrete cosine transforms (DCT) to solve parabolic PDEs. We implement this method in two ways: either using a Fourier spectral derivative or a Fourier interaction picture approach. These methods can treat vector fields with a combination of Dirichlet and/or Neumann boundary conditions in one or more space dimensions. We use them to solve a variety of PDEs with analytical solutions, including the Peregrine solitary wave solution. For the 1D heat equation problem, our method with an interaction picture is accurate up to the machine precision. A soluble example of an SPDE with non-periodic boundaries is also treated. We compare the results obtained from these algorithms with those from publicly available solvers that use either polynomial spectral or finite element methods. For problems with solutions that vary rapidly in space, our method outperforms the other methods by recording lower spatial discretization errors, as well being faster in many cases, due to the efficiency improvements given by fast transforms.</description>

      <title>Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles III: The Hodge Star and Hodge--de Rham Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$) offer a novel perspective on intrinsic Carrollian geometry using the powerful tools of principal bundles. Given a choice of principal connection, a canonical Lorentzian metric exists on the total space. This metric enables the development of Hodge theory on a Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundle; specifically, the Hodge star operator and Hodge--de Rham Laplacian are constructed. These constructions are obstructed on a Carrollian manifold due to the degenerate metric. The framework of Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles bridges the gap between Carrollian geometry and (pseudo)-Riemannian geometry. As an example, the question of the Hodge--de Rham Laplacian on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is addressed. A Carrollian version of electromagnetism is also proposed.</description>

      <title>Fast multipole method for the Laplace equation in half plane with Robin boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a fast multipole method (FMM) for solving the two-dimensional Laplace equation in a half-plane with Robin boundary conditions. The method is based on a novel expansion theory for the reaction component of the Green's function. By applying the Fourier transform, the reaction field component is obtained in a Sommerfeld-type integral form. We derive far-field approximations and corresponding shifting and translation operators from the Fourier integral representation. The FMM for the reaction component is then developed by using the new far-field approximations incorporated into the classic FMM framework in which the tree structure is constructed from the original and image charges. Combining this with the standard FMM for the free-space components, we develop a fast algorithm to compute the interaction of the half plane Laplace Green's function. We prove that the method exhibits exponential convergence, similar to the free-space FMM. Finally, numerical examples are presented to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate that the FMM achieves $O(N)$ computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Free-fermion approach to the partition function zeros : Special boundary conditions and product form of solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partition function zeros are powerful tools in understanding critical behavior. In this paper we present new results of the Fisher zeros of two-dimensional Ising models, in the framework of free-fermion eight-vertex model. First we succeed in finding special boundary conditions for the free-fermion model, under which the partition function of a finite lattice can be expressed in a double product form. Using appropriate mappings, these boundary conditions are transformed into the corresponding versions of the square, triangular and honeycomb lattice Ising models. Each Ising model is studied in the cases of a zero field and of an imaginary field $i(\pi/2)k_BT$. For the square lattice model we rediscover the famous Brascamp-Kunz (B-K) boundary conditions. For the triangular and honeycomb lattice models we obtain the B-K type boundary conditions, and the Fisher zeros are conveniently solved from the product form of partition function. The advantage of B-K type boundary conditions is that the Fisher zeros of any finite lattice exactly lie on certain loci, and the accumulation points of zeros can be easily determined in the thermodynamic limit. Our finding and method would be very helpful in studying the partition function zeros of vertex and Ising models.</description>

      <title>Random Lozenge Waterfall: Dimensional Collapse of Gibbs Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the q-Racah probability measure on lozenge tilings of a hexagon whose side lengths scale linearly with a large parameter $L$, while the parameters $q\in(0,1)$ and $\kappa\in \mathbf{i}\mathbb{R}$ remain fixed. This regime differs fundamentally from the traditional case $q\sim e^{-c/L}\to1$, in which random tilings are locally governed by two-dimensional translation-invariant ergodic Gibbs measures. In the fixed-q regime we uncover a new macroscopic phase, the waterfall (previously only observed experimentally), where the two-dimensional Gibbs structure collapses into a one-dimensional random stepped interface that we call a barcode.
  We prove a law of large numbers and exponential concentration, showing that the random tilings converge to a deterministic waterfall profile. We further conjecture an explicit correlation kernel of the one-dimensional barcode process arising in the limit. Remarkably, the limit is invariant under shifts by $2\mathbb{Z}$ but not by $\mathbb{Z}$, exhibiting an emergent period-two structure absent from the original weights. Our conjectures are supported by extensive numerical evidence and perfect sampling simulations. The kernel is built from a family of functions orthogonal in both spaces $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z})$ and $\ell^{2}(\mathbb{Z}+\frac12)$, that may be of independent interest.
  Our proofs adapt the spectral projection method of Borodin-Gorin-Rains (https://arxiv.org/abs/0905.0679) to the regime with fixed~q. The resulting asymptotic analysis is substantially more involved, and leads to non-self-adjoint operators. We overcome these challenges in the exponential concentration result by a separate argument based on sharp bounds for the ratios of probabilities under the q-Racah orthogonal polynomial ensemble.</description>

      <title>Sharp moment and upper tail asymptotics for the critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While $1+1$ dimensional growth models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class have witnessed an explosion of activity, higher dimensional models remain much less explored. The special case of $2+1$ dimensions is particularly interesting as it is, in physics parlance, neither ultraviolet nor infrared super-renormalizable. Canonical examples include the stochastic heat equation (SHE) with multiplicative noise and directed polymers. The models exhibit a weak to strong disorder transition as the inverse temperature, up to a logarithmic (in the system size) scaling, crosses a critical value. While the sub-critical picture has been established in detail, very recently [CSZ '23] constructed a scaling limit of the critical $2+1$ dimensional directed polymer partition function, termed as the critical $2d$ Stochastic Heat Flow (SHF), a random measure on $\mathbb{R}^2.$ The SHF is expected to exhibit a rich intermittent behavior and consequently a rapid growth of its moments. The $h^{th}$ moment was known to grow at least as $\exp(\Omega(h^{2}))$ (a consequence of the Gaussian correlation inequality) and at most as $\exp(\exp (O(h^2)))$. The true growth rate, however, was predicted to be $\exp(\exp (\Theta(h)))$ in the late nineties [R '99]. In this paper we prove a lower bound of the $h^{th}$ moment which matches the predicted value, thereby exponentially improving the previous lower bound. We also obtain rather sharp bounds on its upper tail. The key ingredient in the proof involves establishing a new connection of the SHF and moments thereof to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF) on related Feynman diagrams. This connection opens the door to the rich algebraic structure of the GFF to study the SHF. Along the way we also prove a new monotonicity property of the correlation kernel for the SHF as a consequence of the domain Markov property of the GFF.</description>

      <title>The open XYZ spin 1/2 chain: Separation of Variables and scalar products for boundary fields related by a constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04112v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the open XYZ spin chain with boundary fields. We solve the model by the new Separation of Variables approach introduced in arXiv:1904.00852. In this framework, the transfer matrix eigenstates are obtained as a particular sub-class of the class of so-called separate states. We consider the problem of computing scalar products of such separate states. As usual, they can be represented as determinants with rows labelled by the inhomogeneity parameters of the model. We notably focus on the special case in which the boundary parameters parametrising the two boundary fields satisfy one constraint, hence enabling for the description of part of the transfer matrix spectrum and eigenstates in terms of some elliptic polynomial Q-solution of a usual TQ-equation. In this case, we show how to transform the aforementioned determinant for the scalar product into some more convenient form for the consideration of the homogeneous and thermodynamic limits: as in the open XXX or XXZ cases, our result can be expressed as some generalisation of the so-called Slavnov determinant.</description>

      <title>Exact Schwinger functions for a class of bounded interactions in $d\geq 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a scalar Euclidean QFT with interaction given by a bounded, measurable function $V$ such that $V^{\pm}:=\lim_{w\to \pm\infty}V(w)$ exist. We find a field renormalization such that all the $n$-point connected Schwinger functions for $n\neq 2$ exist non-perturbatively in the UV limit. They coincide with the tree-level one-particle irreducible Schwinger functions of the $\mathrm{erf}(\phi/\sqrt{2})$ interaction with a coupling constant $\frac{1}{2} (V^+ - V^-)$. By a slight modification of our construction we can change this coupling constant to $\frac{1}{2} (V_+ - V_-)$, where $V_{\pm}:= \lim_{w\to 0^{\pm}} V(w)$. Thereby non-Gaussianity of these latter theories is governed by a discontinuity of $V$ at zero. The open problem of controlling also the two-point function of these QFTs is discussed.</description>

      <title>On Universal Deformations of Compressible Cauchy Elastic Solids Reinforced by Inextensible Fibers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Universal deformations are those that can be maintained in the absence of body forces and with boundary tractions alone, for all materials within a given constitutive class. We study the universal deformations of compressible isotropic Cauchy elastic solids reinforced by a single family of inextensible fibers. We consider straight fibers parallel to the Cartesian Z-axis in the reference configuration and derive the associated universality constraints, which depend explicitly on the geometry of the deformed fibers. We study universal deformations in two cases: (i) deformed fibers are straight lines, and (ii) deformed fibers have non-vanishing curvature. For case (i), we provide a complete classification. The universality constraints reduce to geometric restrictions on the orthogonal surfaces, which must be planes, circular cylinders, or spheres. This gives one inhomogeneous universal deformation family: the non-isochoric Family Z1 of combined bending and stretching deformations. In addition, Family 0Z consists of homogeneous deformations that respect the inextensibility constraint. We further show that if all principal invariants are constant and deformed fibers remain straight, then only homogeneous universal deformations are possible. For case (ii), when deformed fibers have non-vanishing curvature, the universality constraints become significantly more complex. The existence of universal deformations in this case remains an open problem. In particular, we demonstrate that Family 5 universal deformations of incompressible elasticity, when restricted to satisfy the inextensibility constraint, are no longer universal in fiber-reinforced solids. Finally, we prove that the universal deformations of Cauchy and hyperelastic solids with the same fiber reinforcement coincide.</description>

      <title>Second Quantization for the Kepler Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kepler problem concerns a point particle in an attractive inverse square force. After a brief review of the classical and quantum versions of this problem, focused on their hidden $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$ symmetry, we discuss the quantum Kepler problem for a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. We show that the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ of bound states for this problem is unitarily equivalent, as a representation of $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$, to the Hilbert space of solutions of the Weyl equation on the spacetime $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$. This equation describes a massless left-handed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle. We then form the fermionic Fock space on $\mathcal{H}$ and show this is unitarily equivalent to the Hilbert space of a massless left-handed spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ free quantum field on $\mathbb{R} \times S^3$, again as representations of $\text{SU}(2) \times \text{SU}(2)$. By modifying the Hamiltonian of this free field theory, we obtain the well-known "Madelung rules". These give a reasonable approximation to the observed filling of subshells as we consider elements with more and more electrons, and match the rough overall structure of the periodic table.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part I: Classical reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In this Part I we focus on the classical reduction process, and the description of the reduced phase space, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. The system is defined as the domain of dependence of a spacelike topological disk with fixed boundary metric. By solving the constraints in a constant-mean-curvature time gauge and removing all the spatial gauge redundancy, we find that the phase space is the cotangent bundle of Diff^+(S^1)/PSL(2,R), i.e., the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle modulo the projective special linear subgroup. Classically, the states correspond to causal diamonds embedded in AdS_3 (or Mink_3 if $\Lambda = 0$), with fixed corner length, and whose Cauchy surfaces have the topology of a disc.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part II: Group-theoretic quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In Part I we described the classical reduction process and the reduced phase space, $\widetilde{\mathcal P} = T^*(\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)/\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb R))$, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. Because the phase space does not have a natural linear structure, a generalization of the standard canonical (coordinate) quantization is required. In particular, as the configuration space is a homogeneous space for the $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)$ group, we apply Isham's group-theoretic quantization scheme. We propose a quantization based on (projective) unitary irreducible representations of the $\text{BMS}_3$ group, which is obtained from a natural prescription for extending $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)$ into a transitive group of symplectic symmetries of the phase space. We find a class of suitable quantum theories labelled by a choice of a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group and an irreducible unitary representation of the corresponding little group. The most natural choice, justified by a Casimir matching principle, corresponds to a Hilbert space realized by wavefunctions on $\text{Diff}^+\!(S^1)/\text{PSL}(2, \mathbb R)$ valued in some unitary irreducible representation of $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb R)$. A surprising result is that the twist of the diamond corner loop is quantized in terms of the ratio of the Planck length to the corner perimeter.</description>

      <title>Sub-ballistic operator growth in spin chains with heavy-tailed random fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that in nearly arbitrary quantum spin chains with power-law-distributed random fields, namely such that the probability of a field exceeding $h$ scales as $h^{-\alpha}$, it is impossible for any operator evolving in the Heisenberg picture to spread with dynamical exponent less than $1/\alpha$. In particular, ballistic growth is impossible for $\alpha &lt; 1$, diffusive growth is impossible for $\alpha &lt; 1/2$, and any finite dynamical exponent becomes impossible for sufficiently small $\alpha$. This result thus establishes a wide family of models in which the disorder provably prevents conventional transport. We express the result as a tightening of Lieb-Robinson bounds due to random fields -- the proof modifies the standard derivation such that strong fields appear as effective weak interactions, and then makes use of analogous recent results for random-bond spin chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between K\"ahler metrics in a given conformal class and parallel sections of a certain vector bundle with conformally invariant connection, where the parallel sections satisfy a set of non--linear algebraic constraints that we describe. The vector bundle captures 2-form prolongations and is isomorphic to $\Lambda^3(\cT)$, where ${\cT}$ is the tractor bundle of conformal geometry, but the resulting connection differs from the normal tractor connection by curvature terms.
  Our analysis leads to a set of obstructions for a Riemannian metric to be conformal to a K\"ahler metric. In particular we find an explicit algebraic condition for a Weyl tensor which must hold if there exists a conformal Killing-Yano tensor, which is a necessary condition for a metric to be conformal to K\"ahler. This gives an invariant characterisation of algebraically special Riemannian metrics of type $D$ in dimensions higher than four.</description>

      <title>Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05400v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative Einstein-Maxwell equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfeld twist and solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the noncommutative parameter $a$. The equation of motion, the NC Einstein-Maxwell equation, turns out to be effectively a problem in nonlinear electrodynamics where the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ obtains correction terms with three Faraday tensors $F_{\mu\nu}$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole modified with nonzero $g_{t\theta}, g_{r\varphi}, g_{tr}$ and $g_{\varphi\theta}$ components proportional to $a$, while the electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr-Newman potential which introduces a nonzero $A_{\theta}$ term proportional to $a$.</description>

      <title>Stability of thermal equilibrium in long-range quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experimental realizations of spin models are irremediably prone to errors, which can propagate through the system corrupting experimental signals. We study how such errors affect the measurement of local observables in systems with long-range interactions, where perturbations can spread more rapidly. Specifically, we focus on the stability of thermal equilibrium and investigate its relation to the correlation structure of the system, both analytically and numerically. As a main result, we prove that the stability of local expectation values follows from the decay of correlations on the Gibbs state and the Lieb-Robinson bound. We also provide numerical evidence that this stability extends to an even larger regime of interacting long-range systems. Our results support the robustness of analogue simulation platforms for long-range models, and provide further evidence that computing physical quantities of interest can be significantly easier than performing arbitrary quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Tailed Mixed p-Spin Spherical Model: Breakdown of Ultrametricity and Failure of the Parisi Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the two cornerstones of mean-field spin glass theory -- the Parisi variational formula and the ultrametric organization of pure states -- break down under heavy-tailed disorder. For the mixed spherical $p$-spin model whose couplings have tail exponent $\alpha&lt;2$, we attach to each $p$ an explicit threshold $H_p^{*}$. If any coupling exceeds its threshold, a single dominant monomial governs both the limiting free energy and the entire Gibbs measure; the resulting energy landscape is intrinsically probabilistic, with a sharp failure of ultrametricity for $p\ge4$ and persistence of only a degenerate 1-RSB structure for $p\le3$. When all couplings remain below their thresholds, the free energy is $O(n^{-1})$ and the overlap is near zero, resulting in a trivial Gibbs geometry. For $\alpha&lt;1$ we further obtain exact fluctuations of order $n^{1-p}$. Our proof introduces Non-Intersecting Monomial Reduction (NIMR), an algebraic-combinatorial technique that blends convexity analysis, extremal combinatorics and concentration on the sphere, providing the first rigorous description of both regimes for heavy-tailed spin glasses with $p\ge3$.</description>

      <title>Every conformal net has an associated unitary VOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitary vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and conformal nets are the two most prominent mathematical axiomatizations of two-dimensional unitary chiral conformal field theories. They are conjectured to be equivalent, but a rigorous comparison has proven challenging. We resolve one direction of the conjecture by showing that every conformal net has an associated unitary VOA.</description>
