      <title>TransST: Transfer Learning Embedded Spatial Factor Modeling of Spatial Transcriptomics Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Spatial transcriptomics have emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research because of its ability to capture both the spatial contexts and abundance of the complete RNA transcript profile in organs of interest. However, limitations of the technology such as the relatively low resolution and comparatively insufficient sequencing depth make it difficult to reliably extract real biological signals from these data. To alleviate this challenge, we propose a novel transfer learning framework, referred to as TransST, to adaptively leverage the cell-labeled information from external sources in inferring cell-level heterogeneity of a target spatial transcriptomics data.
  Results: Applications in several real studies as well as a number of simulation settings show that our approach significantly improves existing techniques. For example, in the breast cancer study, TransST successfully identifies five biologically meaningful cell clusters, including the two subgroups of cancer in situ and invasive cancer; in addition, only TransST is able to separate the adipose tissues from the connective issues among all the studied methods.
  Conclusions: In summary, the proposed method TransST is both effective and robust in identifying cell subclusters and detecting corresponding driving biomarkers in spatial transcriptomics data.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal single-cell foundation models via dynamic token adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in applying deep learning in genomics include DNA-language and single-cell foundation models. However, these models take only one data type as input. We introduce dynamic token adaptation and demonstrate how it combines these models to predict gene regulation at the single-cell level in different genetic contexts. Although the method is generalisable, we focus on an illustrative example by training an adapter from DNA-sequence embeddings to a single-cell foundation model's token embedding space. As a qualitative evaluation, we assess the impact of DNA sequence changes on the model's learned gene regulatory networks by mutating the transcriptional start site of the transcription factor GATA4 in silico, observing predicted expression changes in its target genes in fetal cardiomyocytes.</description>
