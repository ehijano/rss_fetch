      <title>Scalable optimal control for inequality-constrained discretizations of scalar conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization-based (OB) alternatives to traditional flux limiters couch preservation of properties such as local bounds and maximum principles into optimization problems, which impose these properties through inequality constraints. In this paper, we propose a new potential-target OB approach that enforces these properties using an optimal control formulation, in which the control is the source term expressed through flux potentials. The resulting OB formulation combines superb accuracy with excellent local conservation properties, but complicates the development of scalable iterative solvers, which is greatly influenced by the choice of semi-norms for the objective function. We use this fact to design scalable iterative solvers based on matrix-free trust-region Newton methods with projections onto convex sets. These solvers leverage inexpensive multigrid V-cycles while satisfying all constraints to machine precision. Numerical experiments reveal that the convergence behavior of the solvers can be greatly improved by a simple scaling of the inequality constraints. We demonstrate excellent performance in applications to linear test problems, such as $L^2$ projection and solid body rotation, and to the Cahn-Hilliard equation.</description>

      <title>Entropic adapted Wasserstein distance on Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adapted Wasserstein distance is a metric for quantifying distributional uncertainty and assessing the sensitivity of stochastic optimization problems on time series data. A computationally efficient alternative to it, is provided by the entropically regularized adapted Wasserstein distance. Suffering from similar shortcomings as classical optimal transport, there are only few explicitly known solutions to those distances.
  Recently, Gunasingam--Wong provided a closed-form representation of the adapted Wasserstein distance between real-valued stochastic processes with Gaussian laws. In this paper, we extend their work in two directions, by considering multidimensional ($\mathbb{R}^d$-valued) stochastic processes with Gaussian laws and including the entropic regularization. In both settings, we provide closed-form solutions.</description>

      <title>Linear-quadratic Stochastic Stackelberg Differential Games with Affine Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the non-zero-sum linear-quadratic stochastic Stackelberg differential games with affine constraints, which depend on both the follower's response and the leader's strategy. With the help of the stochastic Riccati equations and the Lagrangian duality theory, the feedback expressions of optimal strategies of the follower and the leader are obtained and the dual problem of the leader's problem is established. Under the Slater condition, the equivalence is proved between the solutions to the dual problem and the leader's problem, and the KKT condition is also provided for solving the dual problem. Then, the feedback Stackelberg equilibrium is provided for the linear-quadratic stochastic Stackelberg differential games with affine constraints, and a new positive definite condition is proposed for ensuring the uniqueness of solutions to the dual problem. Finally, two non-degenerate examples with indefinite coefficients are provided to illustrate and to support our main results.</description>

      <title>Data-driven $H_{\infty}$ predictive control for constrained systems: a Lagrange duality approcah</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a data-driven $H_{\infty}$ control scheme for time-domain constrained systems based on model predictive control formulation. The scheme combines $H_{\infty}$ control and minimax model predictive control, enabling more effective handling of external disturbances and time-domain constraints. First, by leveraging input-output-disturbance data, the scheme ensures $H_{\infty}$ performance of the closed-loop system. Then, a minimax optimization problem is converted to a more manageable minimization problem employing Lagrange duality, which reduces conservatism typically associated with ellipsoidal evaluations of time-domain constraints. The study examines key closed-loop properties, including stability, disturbance attenuation, and constraint satisfaction, achieved by the proposed data-driven moving horizon predictive control algorithm. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method are demonstrated through numerical simulations involving a batch reactor system, confirming its robustness and feasibility under noisy conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the identifiability of a spatial mathematical model of the spread of fast-moving epidemics based on the law of acting masses and diffusion processes. The research algorithm is based on global methods of Sobol sensitivity analysis and Bayesian approach, which together allowed to reduce the variation boundaries of unknown parameters for further solving the problem of parameter identification by measurements of the number of detected cases, critical and dead. It is shown that for identification of diffusion coefficients responsible for the rate of movement of individuals in space, it is necessary to use additional information about the process.</description>

      <title>Alternating Gradient-Type Algorithm for Bilevel Optimization with Inexact Lower-Level Solutions via Moreau Envelope-based Reformulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problem is a convex composite optimization model, which arises in various applications, including bilevel hyperparameter selection for regularized regression models. To solve these problems, we propose an Alternating Gradient-type algorithm with Inexact Lower-level Solutions (AGILS) based on a Moreau envelope-based reformulation of the bilevel optimization problem. The proposed algorithm does not require exact solutions of the lower-level problem at each iteration, improving computational efficiency. We prove the convergence of AGILS to stationary points and, under the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) property, establish its sequential convergence. Numerical experiments, including a toy example and a bilevel hyperparameter selection problem for the sparse group Lasso model, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed AGILS.</description>

      <title>Switching Event-Triggered Control of Nonlinear Parabolic PDE Systems via Galerkin/Neural-Network-Based Modeling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on switching event-triggered output feedback control for a class of parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) systems subject to unknown nonlinearities and external bounded disturbance. Initially, the PDE systems is properly separated into a finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation (ODE) slow system and an infinite-dimensional ODE fast system based on Galerkin technique, especially the slow system can characterize the dominated dynamics. Then, a three-layer neural network is employed to approximate the unknown nonlinearities, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm is adopted to get a relative accurate slow system. Subsequentaly, a switching event-triggered control scheme is developed, and a waiting time subject to the triggered condition is implemented to avoid the Zeno behavior and convert the slow system into a switching system. In the following, the stability and $\textbf{\textit{H}}_\infty$ performance issues of the closed-loop system are discussed, and the controllers are displayed in terms of bilinear matrix inequalities (BMIs). Novel algorithms are proposed to convert the BMIs into linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Additionally, a sub-optimal switching event-triggered controller is obtained using an iterative optimization approach based on LMIs. Finally, simulation on the catalytic rod reaction model and traffic flow model demonstrate the effectiveness of switching event-triggered control strategy.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for a class of linear transport-dominated systems via the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving optimal control problems for transport-dominated partial differential equations (PDEs) can become computationally expensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional systems. To overcome this challenge, we focus on developing and deriving reduced-order models that can replace the full PDE system in solving the optimal control problem. Specifically, we explore the use of the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as a reduced-order model, which is particularly effective for capturing high-fidelity, low-dimensional representations of transport-dominated phenomena. Furthermore, we propose two distinct frameworks for addressing these problems: one where the reduced-order model is constructed first, followed by optimization of the reduced system, and another where the original PDE system is optimized first, with the reduced-order model subsequently applied to the optimality system. We consider a 1D linear advection equation problem and compare the computational performance of the shifted POD method against the conventional methods like the standard POD when the reduced-order models are used as surrogates within a backtracking line search.</description>

      <title>CuClarabel: GPU Acceleration for a Conic Optimization Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the GPU implementation of the general-purpose interior-point solver Clarabel for convex optimization problems with conic constraints. We introduce a mixed parallel computing strategy that processes linear constraints first, then handles other conic constraints in parallel. This mixed parallel computing strategy currently supports linear, second-order cone, exponential cone, and power cone constraints. We demonstrate that integrating a mixed parallel computing strategy with GPU-based direct linear system solvers enhances the performance of GPU-based conic solvers, surpassing their CPU-based counterparts across a wide range of conic optimization problems. We also show that employing mixed-precision linear system solvers can potentially achieve additional acceleration without compromising solution accuracy.</description>

      <title>A New Adaptive Control Scheme for Unstable Heat Equation with Unknown Control Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel and simple adaptive control scheme for a one-dimensional unstable heat equation with unknown control coefficient. A new state observer is designed to estimate the system state, while a new update law is devised to estimate the reciprocal of the control coefficient. In contrast with the conventional state observer which is usually available for all controllers, the newly designed state observer depends on a special controller factorization. Very importantly, both the unknown control coefficient and its corresponding estimate do not appear in the state observer anymore. Consequently, the stabilization of the control plant comes down to the stabilization of the state observer. In this way, the obstacles caused by the unknown control coefficient can be overcome thoroughly. As an application, the performance output tracking is also considered by the newly developed approach. When the reference signal is persistently exciting, the reciprocal of the control coefficient can be estimated effectively by the designed update law. All the aforementioned results are proved mathematically, although the resulting closed-loop system may be nonlinear. Some of them are validated visually by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies for insurers with random risk aversion under Heston's SV model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper adopts expected certainty equivalents to consider the reinsurance and investment problem for an insurer who maximizes the expected utility but faces the random risk aversion. The insurer's surplus process is approximated by a Brownian motion with drift, and the financial market is comprised of a risk-free asset and a risky asset whose price is described by Heston's stochastic volatility (SV) model. Under a game theoretic framework, a rigorous verification theorem is provided for characterizing the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies and the corresponding value function. Moreover, by solving the pseudo Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system, semi-analytic expressions for the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies and the corresponding value function are derived under the exponential utility. In addition, some numerical experiments are given to illustrate the behavior of the equilibrium reinsurance and investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Regularized neural network for general variational inequalities involving monotone couples of operators in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the Tikhonov regularization technique, we study a monotone general variational inequality (GVI) by considering an associated strongly monotone GVI, depending on a regularization parameter $\alpha,$ such that the latter admits a unique solution $x_\alpha$ which tends to some solution of the initial GVI, as $\alpha \to 0.$ However, instead of solving the regularized GVI for each $\alpha$, which may be very expensive, we consider a neural network (also known as a dynamical system) associated with the regularized GVI and establish the existence and the uniqueness of the strong global solution to the corresponding Cauchy problem. An explicit discretization of this neural network leads to strongly convergent iterative regularization algorithms for monotone general variational inequality. Numerical tests are performed to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
  This work extends our recent results in [Anh, Hai, Optim. Eng. 25 (2024) 2295-2313] to more general setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a boundary control scheme for prescribed-time (PT) stable of flexible string systems via backstepping method, and the dynamics of such systems modeled by Hamilton's principle is described as hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE). Initially, to construct a boundary controller with PT stabilization capacity, a PT stable hyperbolic PDE system with time-varying coefficient is chosen as the target system, and a corresponding Volterra integral transform with time-varying kernel function is considered. Meanwhile, the kernel equation and controller is determined by taking derivative. Then, to identify the boundary controller, the well-posedness of kernel equation is derived by means of successive approximation and mathematical induction, and the upper bound of kernel function is estimated. Furthermore, the inverse transform is proved with the help of a similar process for kernel function. Subsequently, the PT stability of closed-loop system is proved by PT stability of target system and reversible integral transform. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.</description>

      <title>Social Optima in Linear Quadratic Graphon Field Control: Analysis via Infinite Dimensional Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with linear quadratic graphon field social control problem where the noises of individual agents are correlated. Compared with the well-studied mean field system, the graphon field system consists of a large number of agents coupled weakly via a weighted undirected graph where each node represents an individual agent. Another notable feature of this paper is that the dynamics of states of agents are driven by Brownian motions with a correlation matrix. The infinite dimensional approach is adopted to design the centralized and decentralized controls for our large population system. By graphon theory, we prove that the linear quadratic (LQ) social optimum control problem under the centralized information pattern is equivalent to an LQ optimal control problem concerned with a stochastic evolution equation, and the feedback-type optimal centralized control is obtained. Then, by designing an auxiliary infinite dimensional optimal control problem through agent number $N\rightarrow\infty$, a set of decentralized strategies are constructed, which are further shown to be asymptotically social optimal.</description>

      <title>Constrained stochastic linear quadratic control under regime switching with controlled jump size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a stochastic linear-quadratic control problem characterized by regime switching and Poisson jumps. All the coefficients in the problem are random processes adapted to the filtration generated by Brownian motion and the Poisson random measure for each given regime. The model incorporates two distinct types of controls: the first is a conventional control that appears in the continuous diffusion component, while the second is an unconventional control, dependent on the variable $z$, which influences the jump size in the jump diffusion component. Both controls are constrained within general closed cones. By employing the Meyer-It\^o formula in conjunction with a generalized squares completion technique, we rigorously and explicitly derive the optimal value and optimal feedback control. These depend on solutions to certain multi-dimensional fully coupled stochastic Riccati equations, which are essentially backward stochastic differential equations with jumps (BSDEJs). We establish the existence of a unique nonnegative solution to the BSDEJs. One of the major tools used in the proof is the newly established comparison theorems for multidimensional BSDEJs.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary de-homogenization using a generative model for optimizing solid-porous infill structures considering the stress concentration issue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of porous infill structures presents significant challenges due to their complex geometric configurations, such as the accurate representation of geometric boundaries and the control of localized maximum stress. In current mainstream design methods, such as topology optimization, the analysis is often performed using pixel or voxel-based element approximations. These approximations, constrained by the optimization framework, result in substantial geometric discrepancies between the analysis model and the final physical model. Such discrepancies can severely impact structural performance, particularly for localized properties like stress response, where accurate geometry is critical to mitigating stress concentration. To address these challenges, we propose evolutionary de-homogenization, which is a design framework based on the integration of de-homogenization and data-driven multifidelity optimization. This framework facilitates the hybrid solid-porous infill design by bridging the gap between low-fidelity analysis and high-fidelity physical realizations, ensuring both geometric accuracy and enhanced structural performance. The low-fidelity level utilizes commonly used density control variables, while the high-fidelity level involves stress analysis based on structures with precise geometric representations. By employing a de-homogenization-based mapping method, a side-by-side correspondence between low-fidelity and high-fidelity results is established. The low-fidelity control variables are iteratively adjusted to optimize the high-fidelity results by integrating deep generative model with multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A fixed-point approach to history-dependent sweeping processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness of state-dependent and state-independent sweeping processes driven by prox-regular sets and perturbed by a history-dependent operator. Our approach, based on an enhanced version of Gronwall's lemma and fixed-point arguments, provides an efficient framework for analyzing sweeping processes. In particular, our findings recover all existing results for the class of Volterra sweeping processes and provide new insights into history-dependent sweeping processes. Finally, we apply our theoretical results to establish the well-posedness of a viscoelastic model with long memory.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of fictitious play algorithm in repeated games via the geometrical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19216v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the earliest and one of the most fundamental learning dynamics for computing NE, fictitious play (FP) has being receiving incessant research attention and finding games where FP would converge (games with FPP) is one central question in related fields. In this paper, we identify a new class of games with FPP, i.e., $3\times3$ games without IIP, based on the geometrical approach by leveraging the location of NE and the partition of best response region. During the process, we devise a new projection mapping to reduce a high-dimensional dynamical system to a planar system. And to overcome the non-smoothness of the systems, we redefine the concepts of saddle and sink NE, which are proven to exist and help prove the convergence of CFP by separating the projected space into two parts. Furthermore, we show that our projection mapping can be extended to higher-dimensional and degenerate games.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Data-driven Multistage Stochastic Programming under Markovian Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is motivated by the challenges of applying the sample average approximation (SAA) method to multistage stochastic programming with an unknown continuous-state Markov process. While SAA is widely used in static and two-stage stochastic optimization, it becomes computationally intractable in general multistage settings as the time horizon $T$ increases. Indeed, the number of samples required to obtain a reasonably accurate solution grows exponentially$\text{ -- }$a phenomenon known as the curse of dimensionality with respect to the time horizon. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel data-driven approach, the Markov Recombining Scenario Tree (MRST) method, which constructs an approximate problem using only two independent trajectories of historical data. Our analysis demonstrates that the MRST method achieves polynomial sample complexity in $T$, providing a more efficient alternative to SAA. Numerical experiments on the Linear Quadratic Gaussian problem show that MRST outperforms SAA, addressing the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an approximate controllability problem for the continuity equation and its application to constructing transport maps with normalizing flows. Specifically, we construct time-dependent controls $\theta=(w, a, b)$ in the vector field $w(a^\top x + b)_+$ to approximately transport a known base density $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$ to a target density $\rho_*$. The approximation error is measured in relative entropy, and $\theta$ are constructed piecewise constant, with bounds on the number of switches being provided. Our main result relies on an assumption on the relative tail decay of $\rho_*$ and $\rho_{\mathrm{B}}$, and provides hints on characterizing the reachable space of the continuity equation in relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Two-echelon Electric Vehicle Routing Problem in Parcel Delivery: A Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-echelon parcel delivery systems using electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for managing urban logistics complexity and promoting sustainability. In multi-echelon systems, particularly within two-stage systems, larger vehicles transport parcels from a central depot to satellite hubs, where smaller EVs pick up the parcels and carry out last-mile deliveries. This system could increase efficiency, reduce emissions, and improve service reliability. The two-echelon electric vehicle routing problem (2E-EVRP), an extension of the traditional two-echelon vehicle routing problem (2E-VRP), addresses EV-specific challenges such as battery constraints and recharging stations to tackle environmental impacts, urban congestion, and e-commerce demands. While effectively reducing costs, energy use, and emissions, the 2E-EVRP faces modeling challenges due to multi-echelon structures, EV limitations, and recharging station selection. This paper systematically reviews 2E-EVRP literature, analyzing key studies. It proposes a classification scheme to categorize the papers based on the problem variants, objectives, constraints, and solution methods. It identifies gaps such as delivery tardiness, environmental trade-offs, multi-objective optimization, multiple depots, split deliveries, and time-dependent travel conditions. Future research directions include aligning models with urban policies, integrating parcel lockers, enabling same-day delivery, and incorporating advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles. Methodological advancements suggest using machine learning, reinforcement learning, and simulation-based approaches to enhance dynamic routing and real-time decision-making. These directions aim to expand the 2E-EVRP applicability, addressing theoretical and practical challenges in sustainable urban logistics for future works.</description>

      <title>Riemannian conditional gradient methods for composite optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Riemannian conditional gradient methods for minimizing composite functions, i.e., those that can be expressed as the sum of a smooth function and a geodesically convex one. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithms, utilizing three types of step-size strategies: adaptive, diminishing, and those based on the Armijo condition. We establish the convergence rate of \(\mathcal{O}(1/k)\) for the adaptive and diminishing step sizes, where \(k\) denotes the number of iterations. Additionally, we derive an iteration complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^2)\) for the Armijo step-size strategy to achieve \(\epsilon\)-optimality, where \(\epsilon\) is the optimality tolerance. Finally, the effectiveness of our algorithms is validated through some numerical experiments performed on the sphere and Stiefel manifolds.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises: Optimal Convergence without Gradient Clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered only to have a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation of the Non-convex Quasi-norm Ball Projection with Iterative Reweighted Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on computing the projection onto the $\ell_p$ quasi-norm ball, which is challenging due to the non-convex and non-Lipschitz nature inherent in the $\ell_p$ quasi-norm with $0&lt;p&lt;1$. We propose a novel localized approximation method that yields a Lipschitz continuous concave surrogate function for the $\ell_p$ quasi-norm with improved approximation quality. Building on this approximation, we enhance the state-of-the-art iterative reweighted algorithm proposed by Yang et al. (J Mach Learn Res 23:1-31, 2022) by constructing tighter subproblems. This improved algorithm solves the $\ell_p$ quasinorm ball projection problem through a series of tractable projections onto the weighted $\ell_1$ norm balls. Convergence analyses and numerical studies demonstrate the global convergence and superior computational efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on optimality conditions for $C^{1,1}$-smooth optimization problems subject to inequality and equality constraints. By employing the concept of limiting (Mordukhovich) second-order subdifferentials to the Lagrangian function associated with the problem, we derive new second-order optimality conditions for the considered problem. Applications for multiobjective optimization problems are studied as well. These results extend and refine existing results in the literature.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of maximizing multiple linear functions over the probability simplex. A classification of feasible points is indicated. A necessary and sufficient condition for a member of each class to be an efficient solution is stated. This characterization yields a computational procedure for ascertaining whether a feasible point is efficient. The procedure does not require that candidates for efficiency be extreme points.

      <title>Topology optimization for particle flow problems using Eulerian-Eulerian model with a finite difference method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle flow processing is widely employed across various industrial applications and technologies. Due to the complex interactions between particles and fluids, designing effective devices for particle flow processing is challenging. In this study, we propose a topology optimization method to design flow fields that effectively enhance the resistance encountered by particles. Particle flow is simulated using an Eulerian-Eulerian model based on a finite difference method. Automatic differentiation is implemented to compute sensitivities using a checkpointing algorithm. We formulate the optimization problem as maximizing the variation of drag force on particles while reducing fluid power dissipation. Initially, we validate the finite difference flow solver through numerical examples of particle flow problems and confirm that the corresponding topology optimization produces a result comparable to the benchmark problem. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of Reynolds and Stokes numbers on the optimized flow field. The numerical results indicate that serpentine flow fields can effectively enhance the variation in particle drag force.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control theory often takes the mathematical model of the to-be-control-led system for granted. In contrast, port-Hamiltonian systems theory bridges the gap between modelling and control for physical systems. It provides a unified framework for the modelling of complex multiphysics systems. At the same time it offers powerful tools for analysis and control by identifying the underlying physical structure, as reflected in, e.g., energy balance and other conserved quantities. This leads to control schemes that \emph{exploit} the physical structure, instead of compensating for it. As a result, the derived control laws tend to be simple, physically interpretable, and robust with respect to physical parameter variations.
  In this paper, after introducing port-Hamiltonian systems, the focus is on 'control by interconnection' for set-point stabilization of nonlinear physical systems. Most of this theory is well-established, but novel developments using 'energy ports' instead of 'power ports' are also included.</description>

We prove an optimal uniqueness result for the integral Riccati equation in a wide and natural class, filling a gap existing in the autonomous case, too. In addition, we give a regularity result for the optimal state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension of a recently introduced multistage stochastic integer model designed for optimizing the deployment of charging stations under uncertainty. A key contribution of this work is incorporating additional constraints accounting for congestion management at charging stations. The solution approach combines a greedy heuristic with a branch-and-price algorithm, enabling the efficient handling of medium instances. In the branch-and-price algorithm, when the solution to the restricted master problem is not integer, a greedy heuristic and a local search procedure are conducted to obtain feasible solutions. Computational experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity of the Semidefinite Programs for Direct Data-Driven LQR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the noise sensitivity of the semidefinite program (SDP) proposed for direct data-driven infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem for discrete-time linear time-invariant systems. While this SDP is shown to find the true LQR controller in the noise-free setting, we show that it leads to a trivial solution with zero gain matrices when data is corrupted by noise, even when the noise is arbitrarily small. We then study a variant of the SDP that includes a robustness promoting regularization term and prove that regularization does not fully eliminate the sensitivity issue. In particular, the solution of the regularized SDP converges in probability also to a trivial solution.</description>

      <title>On the numerical solution of Lasserre relaxations of unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to solve linear semidefinite programs arising from higher-order Lasserre relaxations of unconstrained binary quadratic optimization problems. For this we use an interior point method with a preconditioned conjugate gradient method solving the linear systems. The preconditioner utilizes the low-rank structure of the solution of the relaxations. In order to fully exploit this, we need to re-write the moment relaxations. To treat the arising linear equality constraints we use an $\ell_1$-penalty approach within the interior-point solver. The efficiency of this approach is demonstrated by numerical experiments with the MAXCUT and other randomly generated problems and a comparison with a state-of-the-art semidefinite solver and the ADMM method. We further propose a hybrid ADMM-interior-point method that proves to be efficient for certain problem classes. As a by-product, we observe that the second-order relaxation is often high enough to deliver a globally optimal solution of the original problem.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the extended set difference, a generalization of the Hukuhara and generalized Hukuhara differences, defined for compact convex sets in $R^d$. The proposed difference guarantees the existence and uniqueness for any pair of such sets, offering a broader framework for set arithmetic.

      <title>The System of BSDEs with Singular Terminal Values Arising in Optimal Liquidation with Regime Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic control problem with regime switching arising in an optimal liquidation problem with dark pools and multiple regimes. The new feature of this model is that it introduces a system of BSDEs with jumps and with singular terminal values, which appears in literature for the first time. The existence result for this system is obtained. As a result, we solve the stochastic control problem with regime switching. More importantly, the uniqueness result of this system is also obtained, in contrast to merely minimal solutions established in most related literature.</description>

      <title>FFCG: Effective and Fast Family Column Generation for Solving Large-Scale Linear Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Column Generation (CG) is an effective and iterative algorithm to solve large-scale linear programs (LP). During each CG iteration, new columns are added to improve the solution of the LP. Typically, CG greedily selects one column with the most negative reduced cost, which can be improved by adding more columns at once. However, selecting all columns with negative reduced costs would lead to the addition of redundant columns that do not improve the objective value. Therefore, selecting the appropriate columns to add is still an open problem and previous machine-learning-based approaches for CG only add a constant quantity of columns per iteration due to the state-space explosion problem. To address this, we propose Fast Family Column Generation (FFCG) -- a novel reinforcement-learning-based CG that selects a variable number of columns as needed in an iteration. Specifically, we formulate the column selection problem in CG as an MDP and design a reward metric that balances both the convergence speed and the number of redundant columns. In our experiments, FFCG converges faster on the common benchmarks and reduces the number of CG iterations by 77.1% for Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) and 84.8% for Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), and a 71.4% reduction in computing time for CSP and 84.0% for VRPTW on average compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Localized exploration in contextual dynamic pricing achieves dimension-free regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of contextual dynamic pricing with a linear demand model. We propose a novel localized exploration-then-commit (LetC) algorithm which starts with a pure exploration stage, followed by a refinement stage that explores near the learned optimal pricing policy, and finally enters a pure exploitation stage. The algorithm is shown to achieve a minimax optimal, dimension-free regret bound when the time horizon exceeds a polynomial of the covariate dimension. Furthermore, we provide a general theoretical framework that encompasses the entire time spectrum, demonstrating how to balance exploration and exploitation when the horizon is limited. The analysis is powered by a novel critical inequality that depicts the exploration-exploitation trade-off in dynamic pricing, mirroring its existing counterpart for the bias-variance trade-off in regularized regression. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for vector-valued composite functionals with smoothing and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19367v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on vector-valued composite functionals, which may be nonlinear in probability. Our primary goal is to establish central limit theorems for these functionals when mixed estimators are employed. Our study is relevant to the evaluation and comparison of risk in decision-making contexts and extends to functionals that arise in machine learning methods. A generalized family of composite risk functionals is presented, which encompasses most of the known coherent risk measures including systemic measures of risk. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we analyze vector-valued functionals, providing a framework for evaluating high-dimensional risks. This framework facilitates the comparison of multiple risk measures, as well as the estimation and asymptotic analysis of systemic risk and its optimal value in decision-making problems. Second, we derive novel central limit theorems for optimized composite functionals when mixed types of estimators: empirical and smoothed estimators are used. We provide verifiable sufficient conditions for the central limit formulae and show their applicability to several popular measures of risk.</description>

      <title>Comparing Few to Rank Many: Active Human Preference Learning using Randomized Frank-Wolfe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study learning of human preferences from a limited comparison feedback. This task is ubiquitous in machine learning. Its applications such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, have been transformational. We formulate this problem as learning a Plackett-Luce model over a universe of $N$ choices from $K$-way comparison feedback, where typically $K \ll N$. Our solution is the D-optimal design for the Plackett-Luce objective. The design defines a data logging policy that elicits comparison feedback for a small collection of optimally chosen points from all ${N \choose K}$ feasible subsets. The main algorithmic challenge in this work is that even fast methods for solving D-optimal designs would have $O({N \choose K})$ time complexity. To address this issue, we propose a randomized Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm that solves the linear maximization sub-problems in the FW method on randomly chosen variables. We analyze the algorithm, and evaluate it empirically on synthetic and open-source NLP datasets.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and shared autonomous vehicle (SAV) fleet size optimization, a problem variant of the transit network frequency setting problem (TNFSP) that explicitly considers mode choice behavior and route selection. To address the non-linear non-convex optimization problem, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines metaheuristics (particle swarm optimization, PSO) with local nonlinear programming (NLP) improvement, incorporating approximation models for SAV waiting time, multimodal route choice, and mode choice. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area, our method achieves a 33.3% increase in transit ridership.</description>

      <title>Towards Simple and Provable Parameter-Free Adaptive Gradient Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms such as AdaGrad and Adam have significantly advanced the training of deep models by dynamically adjusting the learning rate during the optimization process. However, adhoc tuning of learning rates poses a challenge, leading to inefficiencies in practice. To address this issue, recent research has focused on developing "learning-rate-free" or "parameter-free" algorithms that operate effectively without the need for learning rate tuning. Despite these efforts, existing parameter-free variants of AdaGrad and Adam tend to be overly complex and/or lack formal convergence guarantees. In this paper, we present AdaGrad++ and Adam++, novel and simple parameter-free variants of AdaGrad and Adam with convergence guarantees. We prove that AdaGrad++ achieves comparable convergence rates to AdaGrad in convex optimization without predefined learning rate assumptions. Similarly, Adam++ matches the convergence rate of Adam without relying on any conditions on the learning rates. Experimental results across various deep learning tasks validate the competitive performance of AdaGrad++ and Adam++.</description>

      <title>Characterization of decay rates for discrete operator semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a power-bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space $X$, and let $S$ be a bounded linear operator from another Hilbert space $Y$ to $X$. We investigate the non-exponential rate of decay of $\|T^nS\|$ as $n \to \infty$. First, when $X = Y$ and $S$ commutes with $T$, we characterize the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ by the growth rate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$ as $|\lambda| \downarrow 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Next, we provide another characterization by means of an integral estimate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$. The second characterization is then applied to asymptotic estimates for perturbed discrete operator semigroups. Finally, we present some results on the relation between the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ and the boundedness of the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\|T^nSy\|^p$ for all $y \in Y$ in the Banach space setting, where $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to(0,\infty)$ and $p \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Trading Off Energy Storage and Payload -- An Analytical Model for Freight Train Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To support planning of alternative fuel technology (e.g., battery-electric locomotives) deployment for decarbonizing non-electrified freight rail, we develop a convex optimization formulation with a closed-form solution to determine the optimal number of energy storage tender cars in a train. The formulation shares a similar structure to an Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model. For given market characteristics, cost forecasts, and technology parameters, our model captures the trade-offs between inventory carrying costs associated with trip times (including delays due to charging/refueling) and ordering costs associated with train dispatch and operation (energy, amortized equipment, and labor costs). To illustrate the framework, we find the optimal number of battery-electric energy tender cars in 22,501 freight markets (origin-destination pairs and commodities) for U.S. Class I railroads. The results display heterogeneity in optimal configurations with lighter, yet more time-sensitive shipments (e.g., intermodal) utilizing more battery tender cars. For heavier commodities (e.g., coal) with lower holding costs, single battery tender car configurations are generally optimal. The results also show that the optimal train configurations are sensitive to delays associated with recharging or swapping tender cars.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Douglas-Rachford splitting method for weakly convex optimization problems, by the token of the Douglas-Rachford envelope, a merit function akin to the Moreau envelope. First, we use epi-convergence techniques to show that this artifact approximates the original objective function via epigraphs. Secondly, we present how global convergence and local linear convergence rates for Douglas-Rachford splitting can be obtained using such envelope, under mild regularity assumptions. The keystone of the convergence analysis is the fact that the Douglas-Rachford envelope satisfies a sufficient descent inequality alongside the generated sequence, a feature that allows us to use arguments usually employed for descent methods. We report numerical experiments that use weakly convex penalty functions, which are comparable with the known behavior of the method in the convex case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10810v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of designing distributed optimization algorithms that are resilient to Byzantine adversaries has received significant attention. For the Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization problem, the goal is to (approximately) minimize the average of the local cost functions held by the regular (non adversarial) agents in the network. In this paper, we provide a general algorithmic framework for Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization which includes some state-of-the-art algorithms as special cases. We analyze the convergence of algorithms within the framework, and derive a geometric rate of convergence of all regular agents to a ball around the optimal solution (whose size we characterize). Furthermore, we show that approximate consensus can be achieved geometrically fast under some minimal conditions. Our analysis provides insights into the relationship among the convergence region, distance between regular agents' values, step-size, and properties of the agents' functions for Byzantine-resilient distributed optimization.</description>

Abstract: This paper considers consumption and portfolio optimization problems with recursive preferences in both infinite and finite time regions. Specially, the financial market consists of a risk-free asset and a risky asset that follows a general stochastic volatility process. By using Bellman's dynamic programming principle, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived for characterizing the optimal consumption-investment strategy and the corresponding value function. Based on the conjecture of the exponential-polynomial form of the value function, we prove that, when the order of the polynomial $n\leq2$, the HJB equation has an analytical solution if the investor with unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) and an approximate solution otherwise.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Computational Protein Design Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the computational protein design (CPD) problem, which is usually modeled as a 0/1 programming and is extremely challenging due to its combinatorial properties. We propose an efficient algorithm for solving it. Specifically, we study the quadratic semi-assignment problem formulation (QSAP) of the CPD problem, and show that it is equivalent to its continuous relaxation problem (RQSAP), in terms of sharing the same optimal objective value. Then, we propose an efficient penalty method to solve the QSAP based on the proposed formulations, which is guaranteed to converge to a global solution of the QSAP under certain conditions. Compared with existing branch-and-bound approaches that suffer from high computational complexity, the proposed algorithm is based on a continuous problem and enjoys a low per-iteration complexity, which makes it particularly suitable for solving large-scale CPD problems. Numerical results on benchmark instances verify the superior performance of our approach over the state-of-the-art branch-and-cut solvers. In particular, the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art solvers by three order of magnitude in CPU time in most cases, while it still returns high-quality solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a finite dimensional version of backstepping controller design for stabilizing solutions of PDEs from boundary. Our controller uses only a finite number of Fourier modes of the state of solution, as opposed to the classical backstepping controller which uses all (infinitely many) modes. We apply our method to the reaction-diffusion equation, which serves only as a canonical example but the method is applicable also to other PDEs whose solutions can be decomposed into a slow finite-dimensional part and a fast tail, where the former dominates the evolution in large time. One of the main goals is to estimate the sufficient number of modes needed to stabilize the plant at a prescribed rate. In addition, we find the minimal number of modes that guarantee the stabilization at a certain (unprescribed) decay rate. Theoretical findings are supported with numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>Maximum Entropy Density Control of Discrete-Time Linear Systems with Quadratic Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of steering the distribution of the state of a discrete-time linear system to a given target distribution while minimizing an entropy-regularized cost functional. This problem is called a maximum entropy density control problem. Specifically, the running cost is given by quadratic forms of the state and the control input, and the initial and target distributions are Gaussian. We first reveal that our problem boils down to solving two Riccati difference equations coupled through their boundary values. Based on them, we give the closed-form expression of the unique optimal policy. Next, we show that the optimal density control of a backward system can be obtained simultaneously with the forward-time optimal policy. The backward solution gives another expression of the forward solution. Finally, by considering the limit where the entropy regularization vanishes, we derive the unregularized density control in closed form.</description>

      <title>Binomial-tree approximation for time-inconsistent stopping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For time-inconsistent stopping in a one-dimensional diffusion setup, we investigate how to use discrete-time models to approximate the original problem. In particular, we consider the value function $V(\cdot)$ induced by all mild equilibria in the continuous-time problem, as well as the value $V^h(\cdot)$ associated with the equilibria in a binomial-tree setting with time step size $h$. We show that $\lim_{h\rightarrow 0+} V^h \leq V$. We provide an example showing that the exact convergence may fail. Then we relax the set of equilibria and consider the value $V^h_{\varepsilon}(\cdot)$ induced by $\varepsilon$-equilibria in the binomial-tree model. We prove that $\lim_{\varepsilon \rightarrow 0+}\lim_{h \rightarrow 0+}V^h_{\varepsilon} = V$.</description>

      <title>Acceleration Exists! Optimization Problems When Oracle Can Only Compare Objective Function Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequently, the burgeoning field of black-box optimization encounters challenges due to a limited understanding of the mechanisms of the objective function. To address such problems, in this work we focus on the deterministic concept of Order Oracle, which only utilizes order access between function values (possibly with some bounded noise), but without assuming access to their values. As theoretical results, we propose a new approach to create non-accelerated optimization algorithms (obtained by integrating Order Oracle into existing optimization "tools") in non-convex, convex, and strongly convex settings that are as good as both SOTA coordinate algorithms with first-order oracle and SOTA algorithms with Order Oracle up to logarithm factor. Moreover, using the proposed approach, we provide the first accelerated optimization algorithm using the Order Oracle. And also, using an already different approach we provide the asymptotic convergence of the first algorithm with the stochastic Order Oracle concept. Finally, our theoretical results demonstrate effectiveness of proposed algorithms through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Convergence of SGD with momentum in the nonconvex case: A time window-based analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic gradient descent method with momentum (SGDM) is a common approach for solving large-scale and stochastic optimization problems. Despite its popularity, the convergence behavior of SGDM remains less understood in nonconvex scenarios. This is primarily due to the absence of a sufficient descent property and challenges in simultaneously controlling the momentum and stochastic errors in an almost sure sense. To address these challenges, we investigate the behavior of SGDM over specific time windows, rather than examining the descent of consecutive iterates as in traditional studies. This time window-based approach simplifies the convergence analysis and enables us to establish the iterate convergence result for SGDM under the {\L}ojasiewicz property. We further provide local convergence rates which depend on the underlying {\L}ojasiewicz exponent and the utilized step size schemes.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the complexity of matrix Putinar's Positivstellens{\"a}tz on the semialgebraic set that is given by the polynomial matrix inequality. \rev{When the quadratic module generated by the constrained polynomial matrix is Archimedean}, we prove a polynomial bound on the degrees of terms appearing in the representation of matrix Putinar's Positivstellens{\"a}tz. Estimates on the exponent and constant are given. As a byproduct, a polynomial bound on the convergence rate of matrix sum-of-squares relaxations is obtained, which resolves an open question raised by Dinh and Pham. When the constraining set is unbounded, we also prove a similar bound for the matrix version of Putinar--Vasilescu's Positivstellens{\"a}tz by exploiting homogenization techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convex risk measures play a foundational role in the area of stochastic optimization. However, in contrast to risk neutral models, their applications are still limited due to the lack of efficient solution methods. In particular, the mean $L_p$ semi-deviation is a classic risk minimization model, but its solution is highly challenging due to the composition of concave-convex functions and the lack of uniform Lipschitz continuity. In this paper, we discuss some progresses on the design of efficient algorithms for $L_p$ risk minimization, including a novel lifting reformulation to handle the concave-convex composition, and a new stochastic approximation method to handle the non-Lipschitz continuity. We establish an upper bound on the sample complexity associated with this approach and show that this bound is not improvable for $L_p$ risk minimization in general through the construction of a nearly matching lower complexity bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article examines an infinite-dimensional linear control system that describes population models structured by age, size, and spatial position. The control is localized with respect to space, age and size; an estimate of the time required to bring the system to zero is provided. We demonstrate the null controllability of the model using a technique that avoids the explicit use of parabolic Carleman estimates. Instead, this method combines the observability estimates of the final state with the use of characteristics and estimates of the associated semigroup. Furthermore, we extend this work by highlighting the difference in controllability time for two models with different birth kernels.</description>

      <title>Methods for Convex $(L_0,L_1)$-Smooth Optimization: Clipping, Acceleration, and Adaptivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the non-smoothness of optimization problems in Machine Learning, generalized smoothness assumptions have been gaining a lot of attention in recent years. One of the most popular assumptions of this type is $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness (Zhang et al., 2020). In this paper, we focus on the class of (strongly) convex $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth functions and derive new convergence guarantees for several existing methods. In particular, we derive improved convergence rates for Gradient Descent with (Smoothed) Gradient Clipping and for Gradient Descent with Polyak Stepsizes. In contrast to the existing results, our rates do not rely on the standard smoothness assumption and do not suffer from the exponential dependency from the initial distance to the solution. We also extend these results to the stochastic case under the over-parameterization assumption, propose a new accelerated method for convex $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization, and derive new convergence rates for Adaptive Gradient Descent (Malitsky and Mishchenko, 2020).</description>

      <title>Mitigating optimistic bias in entropic risk estimation and optimization with an application to insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropic risk measure is widely used in high-stakes decision making to account for tail risks associated with an uncertain loss. With limited data, the empirical entropic risk estimator, i.e. replacing the expectation in the entropic risk measure with a sample average, underestimates the true risk. To mitigate the bias in the empirical entropic risk estimator, we propose a strongly asymptotically consistent bootstrapping procedure. The first step of the procedure involves fitting a distribution to the data, whereas the second step estimates the bias of the empirical entropic risk estimator using bootstrapping, and corrects for it. Two methods are proposed to fit a Gaussian Mixture Model to the data, a computationally intensive one that fits the distribution of empirical entropic risk, and a simpler one with a component that fits the tail of the empirical distribution. As an application of our approach, we study distributionally robust entropic risk minimization problems with type-$\infty$ Wasserstein ambiguity set and apply our bias correction to debias validation performance. Furthermore, we propose a distributionally robust optimization model for an insurance contract design problem that takes into account the correlations of losses across households. We show that choosing regularization parameters based on the cross validation methods can result in significantly higher out-of-sample risk for the insurer if the bias in validation performance is not corrected for. This improvement in performance can be explained from the observation that our methods suggest a higher (and more accurate) premium to homeowners.</description>

      <title>Optimizing $(L_0, L_1)$-Smooth Functions by Gradient Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study gradient methods for solving an optimization problem with an $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth objective function. This problem class generalizes that of Lipschitz-smooth problems and has gained interest recently, as it captures a broader range of machine learning applications. We provide novel insights on the properties of this function class and develop a general framework for analyzing optimization methods for $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth function in a principled manner. While our convergence rate estimates recover existing results for minimizing the gradient norm for nonconvex problems, our approach allows us to significantly improve the current state-of-the-art complexity results in the case of convex problems. We show that both the gradient method with Polyak stepsizes and the normalized gradient method, without any knowledge of the parameters $L_0$ and $L_1$, achieve the same complexity bounds as the method with the knowledge of these constants. In addition to that, we show that a carefully chosen accelerated gradient method can be applied to $(L_0, L_1)$-smooth functions, further improving previously known results. In all cases, the efficiency bounds we establish do not have an exponential dependency on $L_0$ or $L_1$, and do not depend on the initial gradient norm.</description>

      <title>Distributed Normal Map-based Stochastic Proximal Gradient Methods over Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider $n$ agents connected over a network collaborate to minimize the average of their local cost functions combined with a common nonsmooth function. This paper introduces a unified algorithmic framework for solving such a problem through distributed stochastic proximal gradient methods, leveraging the normal map update scheme. Within this framework, we propose two new algorithms, termed Normal Map-based Distributed Stochastic Gradient Tracking (norM-DSGT) and Normal Map-based Exact Diffusion (norM-ED), to solve the distributed composite optimization problem over a connected network. We demonstrate that both methods can asymptotically achieve comparable convergence rates to the centralized stochastic proximal gradient descent method under a general variance condition on the stochastic gradients. Additionally, the number of iterations required for norM-ED to achieve such a rate (i.e., the transient time) behaves as $\mathcal{O}(n^{3}/(1-\lambda)^2)$ for minimizing composite objective functions, matching the performance of the non-proximal ED algorithm. Here $1-\lambda$ denotes the spectral gap of the mixing matrix related to the underlying network topology. To our knowledge, such a convergence result is state-of-the-art for the considered composite problem. Under the same condition, norM-DSGT enjoys a transient time of $\mathcal{O}(\max\{n^3/(1-\lambda)^2, n/(1-\lambda)^4\})$ and behaves more stable than norM-ED under decaying stepsizes for solving the tested problems.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Data-Driven Control of Positive Systems with Application to Learning in SSP Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An adaptive data-driven controller is proposed and analysed for the class of infinite-horizon optimal control of positive linear system problems presented in [1]. This controller is synthesized from the solution of a "data-driven algebraic equation" constructed from the model-free Bellman equation used in Q-learning. This algebraic equation is driven by data correlation matrices that does not scale in the number of data points, making for an efficient online implementation. As a result, a sufficient condition that ensures stability and robustness against unmodeled dynamics in the plant is extracted. The derived results also allows for a quantitative characterization of the interplay between explorations and robustness to unmodeled dynamics. The class of optimal control problems considered here bears equivalence to Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problems, allowing for a performance comparison between the proposed adaptive policy and model-free algorithms for learning the stochastic shortest path, as presented in the numerical experiment.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Appointment Scheduling in the Presence of Patient Unpunctuality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the optimal appointment scheduling problem that incorporates patients' unpunctual behavior, where the unpunctuality is assumed to be time dependent, but additive. Our goal is to develop an optimal scheduling method for a large patient system to maximize expected net revenue. Methods for deriving optimal appointment schedules for large-scale systems often run into computational bottlenecks due to mixed-integer programming or robust optimization formulations and computationally complex search methods. In this work, we model the system as a single-server queueing system, where patients arrive unpunctually and follow the FIFO service discipline to see the doctor (i.e., get into service). Using the heavy traffic fluid approximation, we develop a deterministic control problem, referred to as the fluid control problem (FCP), which serves as an asymptotic upper bound for the original queueing control problem (QCP). Using the optimal solution of the FCP, we establish an asymptotically optimal scheduling policy on a fluid scale. We further investigate the convergence rate of the QCP under the proposed policy. The FCP, due to the incorporation of unpunctuality, is difficult to solve analytically. We thus propose a time-discretized numerical scheme to approximately solve the FCP. The discretized FCP takes the form of a quadratic program with linear constraints. We examine the behavior of these schedules under different unpunctuality assumptions and test the performance of the schedules on real data in a simulation study. Interestingly, the optimal schedules can involve block booking of patients, even if the unpunctuality distributions are continuous.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Sparse Linear Regression via Gradient-Tracking: Linear Convergence and Statistical Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.08507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study sparse linear regression over a network of agents, modeled as an undirected graph and no server node. The estimation of the $s$-sparse parameter is formulated as a constrained LASSO problem wherein each agent owns a subset of the $N$ total observations. We analyze the convergence rate and statistical guarantees of a distributed projected gradient tracking-based algorithm under high-dimensional scaling, allowing the ambient dimension $d$ to grow with (and possibly exceed) the sample size $N$. Our theory shows that, under standard notions of restricted strong convexity and smoothness of the loss functions, suitable conditions on the network connectivity and algorithm tuning, the distributed algorithm converges globally at a {\it linear} rate to an estimate that is within the centralized {\it statistical precision} of the model, $O(s\log d/N)$. When $s\log d/N=o(1)$, a condition necessary for statistical consistency, an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution is attained after $\mathcal{O}(\kappa \log (1/\varepsilon))$ gradient computations and $O (\kappa/(1-\rho) \log (1/\varepsilon))$ communication rounds, where $\kappa$ is the restricted condition number of the loss function and $\rho$ measures the network connectivity. The computation cost matches that of the centralized projected gradient algorithm despite having data distributed; whereas the communication rounds reduce as the network connectivity improves. Overall, our study reveals interesting connections between statistical efficiency, network connectivity \&amp; topology, and convergence rate in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>From Contextual Data to Newsvendor Decisions: On the Actual Performance of Data-Driven Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.08424v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a framework for contextual decision-making to study how the relevance and quantity of past data affects the performance of a data-driven policy. We analyze a contextual Newsvendor problem in which a decision-maker needs to trade-off between an underage and an overage cost in the face of uncertain demand. We consider a setting in which past demands observed under ``close by'' contexts come from close by distributions and analyze the performance of data-driven algorithms through a notion of context-dependent worst-case expected regret. We analyze the broad class of Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization (WERM) policies which weigh past data according to their similarity in the contextual space. This class includes classical policies such as ERM, k-Nearest Neighbors and kernel-based policies. Our main methodological contribution is to characterize exactly the worst-case regret of any WERM policy on any given configuration of contexts. To the best of our knowledge, this provides the first understanding of tight performance guarantees in any contextual decision-making problem, with past literature focusing on upper bounds via concentration inequalities. We instead take an optimization approach, and isolate a structure in the Newsvendor loss function that allows to reduce the infinite-dimensional optimization problem over worst-case distributions to a simple line search.
  This in turn allows us to unveil fundamental insights that were obfuscated by previous general-purpose bounds. We characterize actual guaranteed performance as a function of the contexts, as well as granular insights on the learning curve of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Achieving Margin Maximization Exponentially Fast via Progressive Norm Rescaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14387v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the margin-maximization bias exhibited by gradient-based algorithms in classifying linearly separable data. We present an in-depth analysis of the specific properties of the velocity field associated with (normalized) gradients, focusing on their role in margin maximization. Inspired by this analysis, we propose a novel algorithm called Progressive Rescaling Gradient Descent (PRGD) and show that PRGD can maximize the margin at an {\em exponential rate}. This stands in stark contrast to all existing algorithms, which maximize the margin at a slow {\em polynomial rate}. Specifically, we identify mild conditions on data distribution under which existing algorithms such as gradient descent (GD) and normalized gradient descent (NGD) {\em provably fail} in maximizing the margin efficiently. To validate our theoretical findings, we present both synthetic and real-world experiments. Notably, PRGD also shows promise in enhancing the generalization performance when applied to linearly non-separable datasets and deep neural networks.</description>

      <title>Projected Forward Gradient-Guided Frank-Wolfe Algorithm via Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to enhance the use of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for training deep neural networks. Similar to any gradient-based optimization algorithm, FW suffers from high computational and memory costs when computing gradients for DNNs. This paper introduces the application of the recently proposed projected forward gradient (Projected-FG) method to the FW framework, offering reduced computational cost similar to backpropagation and low memory utilization akin to forward propagation. Our results show that trivial application of the Projected-FG introduces non-vanishing convergence error due to the stochastic noise that the Projected-FG method introduces in the process. This noise results in an non-vanishing variance in the Projected-FG estimated gradient. To address this, we propose a variance reduction approach by aggregating historical Projected-FG directions. We demonstrate rigorously that this approach ensures convergence to the optimal solution for convex functions and to a stationary point for non-convex functions. These convergence properties are validated through a numerical example, showcasing the approach's effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Regularized Adaptive Momentum Dual Averaging with an Efficient Inexact Subproblem Solver for Training Structured Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Regularized Adaptive Momentum Dual Averaging (RAMDA) algorithm for training structured neural networks. Similar to existing regularized adaptive methods, the subproblem for computing the update direction of RAMDA involves a nonsmooth regularizer and a diagonal preconditioner, and therefore does not possess a closed-form solution in general. We thus also carefully devise an implementable inexactness condition that retains convergence guarantees similar to the exact versions, and propose a companion efficient solver for the subproblems of both RAMDA and existing methods to make them practically feasible. We leverage the theory of manifold identification in variational analysis to show that, even in the presence of such inexactness, the iterates of RAMDA attain the ideal structure induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence. This structure is locally optimal near the point of convergence, so RAMDA is guaranteed to obtain the best structure possible among all methods converging to the same point, making it the first regularized adaptive method outputting models that possess outstanding predictive performance while being (locally) optimally structured. Extensive numerical experiments in large-scale modern computer vision, language modeling, and speech tasks show that the proposed RAMDA is efficient and consistently outperforms state of the art for training structured neural network. Implementation of our algorithm is available at https://www.github.com/ismoptgroup/RAMDA/.</description>

      <title>LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freezes most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while achieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Decentralized Actor-Critic Algorithm in General-sum Markov Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04613v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov games provide a powerful framework for modeling strategic multi-agent interactions in dynamic environments. Traditionally, convergence properties of decentralized learning algorithms in these settings have been established only for special cases, such as Markov zero-sum and potential games, which do not fully capture real-world interactions. In this paper, we address this gap by studying the asymptotic properties of learning algorithms in general-sum Markov games. In particular, we focus on a decentralized algorithm where each agent adopts an actor-critic learning dynamic with asynchronous step sizes. This decentralized approach enables agents to operate independently, without requiring knowledge of others' strategies or payoffs. We introduce the concept of a Markov Near-Potential Function (MNPF) and demonstrate that it serves as an approximate Lyapunov function for the policy updates in the decentralized learning dynamics, which allows us to characterize the convergent set of strategies. We further strengthen our result under specific regularity conditions and with finite Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Pattern, Headway, and Fleet Size of Multiple Urban Transit Lines with Perceived Headway Consideration and Passenger Flow Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the urban transit pattern design problem, optimizing stop sequences, headways, and fleet sizes across multiple routes and periods simultaneously to minimize user costs (composed of riding, waiting, and transfer times) under operational constraints (e.g., vehicle capacity and fleet size). A destination-labeled multi-commodity network flow (MCNF) formulation is developed to solve the problem at a large scale more efficiently compared to the previous literature. The model allows for flexible pattern options without relying on pre-defined candidate sets and simultaneously considers multiple operational strategies such as express/local services, short-turning, and deadheading. It evaluates perceived headways of joint patterns for passengers, assigns passenger flows to each pattern accordingly, and allows transfers across patterns in different directions. The mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is demonstrated with a city-sized network of metro lines in Chicago, USA, achieving near-optimal solutions in hours. The total weighted journey times are reduced by 0.61% and 5.76% under single-route and multi-period multi-route scenarios respectively. The model provides transit agencies with an efficient tool for comprehensive service design and resource allocation, improving service quality and resource utilization without additional operational costs.</description>

      <title>Regional Control Strategies for a Spatiotemporal SQEIAR Epidemic Model: Application to COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a spatial SEIAR-type epidemic model considering a quarantined population (denoted as Q), which we call the SQEIAR model. The dynamics of the SQEIAR model are described by six Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) that represent the changes in the susceptible, quarantined, exposed, asymptomatic, infected, and recovered populations. Our goal is to reduce the number of susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, and infected individuals while accounting for the environment, which plays a critical role in the spread of epidemics. We then propose a novel strategy for epidemic control, incorporating two key control measures: regional quarantine for the susceptible population and treatment for the infected. This approach serves as an alternative to widespread quarantine, minimizing the economic, social, and other potential impacts. Additionally, we consider the possibility of reinfection among recovered individuals, a common occurrence in many diseases. To demonstrate the practical utility of our results, a numerical example centered on COVID-19 is presented.</description>

      <title>A Natural Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient Method for Adversarial Neural Network Training on Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable preconditioned primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). We multiply the PDE with a dual test function to obtain an inf-sup problem whose loss functional involves lower-order differential operators. The Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm is then leveraged for this saddle point problem. By introducing suitable precondition operators to the proximal steps in the PDHG algorithm, we obtain an alternative natural gradient ascent-descent optimization scheme for updating the neural network parameters. We apply the Krylov subspace method (MINRES) to evaluate the natural gradients efficiently. Such treatment readily handles the inversion of precondition matrices via matrix-vector multiplication. A posterior convergence analysis is established for the time-continuous version of the proposed method. The algorithm is tested on various types of PDEs with dimensions ranging from $1$ to $50$, including linear and nonlinear elliptic equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and Monge-Amp\`ere equations stemming from the $L^2$ optimal transport problems. We compare the performance of the proposed method with several commonly used deep learning algorithms such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), the DeepRitz method, weak adversarial networks (WANs), etc, for solving PDEs using the Adam and L-BFGS optimizers. The numerical results suggest that the proposed method performs efficiently and robustly and converges more stably.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of wide shallow neural operators within the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural operators are aiming at approximating operators mapping between Banach spaces of functions, achieving much success in the field of scientific computing. Compared to certain deep learning-based solvers, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), Deep Ritz Method (DRM), neural operators can solve a class of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Although much work has been done to analyze the approximation and generalization error of neural operators, there is still a lack of analysis on their training error. In this work, we conduct the convergence analysis of gradient descent for the wide shallow neural operators within the framework of Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). The core idea lies on the fact that over-parameterization and random initialization together ensure that each weight vector remains near its initialization throughout all iterations, yielding the linear convergence of gradient descent. In this work, we demonstrate that under the setting of over-parametrization, gradient descent can find the global minimum regardless of whether it is in continuous time or discrete time. Finally, we briefly discuss the case of physics-informed shallow neural operators.</description>
