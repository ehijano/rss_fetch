      <title>Evolutionary games on the lattice: multitype contact process with density-dependent birth rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems of interest in evolutionary game theory introduced in the probability literature consist of variants of the voter model in which each site is occupied by one player. The goal of this paper is to initiate the study of evolutionary games based more realistically on the multitype contact process in which each site is either empty or occupied by a player following one of two possible competing strategies. Like in the symmetric multitype contact process, players have natural death rate one and natural birth rate $\lambda$. Following the traditional modeling approach of evolutionary game theory, the process also depends on a payoff matrix $A = (a_{ij})$ where $a_{ij}$ represents the payoff a type $i$ player receives from each of its type $j$ neighbors, and the actual birth rate is an increasing function of the payoff. Using various couplings and block constructions, we first prove the existence of a phase transition in the direction of the intra payoff $a_{11}$ or $a_{22}$ while the other three payoffs are fixed. We also look at the behavior near the critical point where all four payoffs are equal to zero, in which case the system reduces to the symmetric multitype contact process. The effects of the intra payoffs $a_{11}$ and $a_{22}$ are studied using various couplings and duality techniques, while the effects of the inter payoffs $a_{12}$ and $a_{21}$ are studied in one dimension using a coupling with the contact process to control the interface between the 1s and the 2s.</description>

      <title>Caputo fractional stochastic differential equations: Lipschitz continuity in the fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of the Caputo fractional stochastic differential equations of fractional order $\alpha \in (\frac{1}{2},1]$. Our aim is to provide a complete analysis of the continuous dependence of solutions on the fractional order $\alpha.$ We first provide optimal estimates for the strong and weak distances between two solutions with different fractional orders. We then describe the exact asymptotic behavior of these distances.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic distribution of the $k$-Robinson-Foulds dissimilarity measure on labelled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in medical bioinformatics, Khayatian et al. (2024) introduced a family of metrics on Cayley trees (the $k$-RF distance, for $k=0, \ldots, n-2$) and explored their distribution on pairs of random Cayley trees via simulations. In this paper, we investigate this distribution mathematically, and derive exact asymptotic descriptions of the distribution of the $k$-RF metric for the extreme values $k=0$ and $k=n-2$, as $n$ becomes large. We show that a linear transform of the $0$-RF metric converges to a Poisson distribution (with mean 2) whereas a similar transform for the $(n-2)$-RF metric leads to a normal distribution (with mean $\sim ne^{-2}$). These results (together with the case $k=1$ which behaves quite differently, and $k=n-3$) shed light on the earlier simulation results, and the predictions made concerning them.</description>

      <title>Random unconditional convergence of Rademacher chaos in $L_\infty$ and sharp estimates for discrepancy of weighted graphs and hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that both multiple Rademacher system and Rademacher chaos possess the property of random unconditional convergence in the space $L_\infty$. This fact combined with some intimate connections between $L_\infty$-norms of linear combinations of elements of these systems and some special norms of matrices of their coefficients allows us to establish sharp two-sided estimates for the discrepancy of edge-weighted graphs and hypergraphs. Some of these results extend the classical theorem proved by Erd\"os and Spencer for the unweighted case.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and approximation of reflected McKean-Vlasov SDEs with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish well-posedness of reflected McKean-Vlasov SDEs and their particle approximations in smooth non-convex domains. We prove convergence of the interacting particle system to the corresponding mean-field limit with the optimal rate of convergence. We motivate this study with applications to sampling and optimization in constrained domains by considering reflected mean-field Langevin SDEs and two reflected consensus-based optimization (CBO) models, respectively. We utilize reflection coupling to study long-time behaviour of reflected mean-field SDEs and also investigate convergence of the reflected CBO models to the global minimum of a constrained optimization problem. We numerically test reflected CBO models on benchmark constrained optimization problems and an inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Ramanujan Property and Edge Universality of Random Regular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the normalized adjacency matrix of a random $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with any fixed degree $d\geq 3$ and denote its eigenvalues as $\lambda_1=d/\sqrt{d-1}\geq \lambda_2\geq\lambda_3\cdots\geq \lambda_N$. We establish the following two results as $N\rightarrow \infty$. (i) With high probability, all eigenvalues are optimally rigid, up to an additional $N^{{\rm o}(1)}$ factor. Specifically, the fluctuations of bulk eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-1+{\rm o}(1)}$, and the fluctuations of edge eigenvalues are bounded by $N^{-2/3+{\rm o}(1)}$. (ii) Edge universality holds for random $d$-regular graphs. That is, the distributions of $\lambda_2$ and $-\lambda_N$ converge to the Tracy-Widom$_1$ distribution associated with the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. As a consequence, for sufficiently large $N$, approximately $69\%$ of $d$-regular graphs on $N$ vertices are Ramanujan, meaning $\max\{\lambda_2,|\lambda_N|\}\leq 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P_n$ be a random Bernoulli excursion of length $2n$. We show that the area under $P_n$ and the number of peaks of $P_n$ are asymptotically independent. We also show that these statistics have the correlation coefficient asymptotic to $c /\sqrt{n}$ for large $n$, where $c &lt; 0$, and explicitly compute the coefficient $c$.</description>

      <title>Free infinite divisibility, fractional convolution powers, and Appell polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Initiated by an observation of Steinerberger [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 147(11):4733--4744, 2019], there has been a recent growing body of literature connecting repeated differentiation of real rooted polynomials to free additive convolution semigroups in free probability. Roughly, this connection states that in the large degree limit the empirical measure of the roots after many derivatives is, up to a rescaling, the original empirical measure of the roots raised to a free additive convolution power. If the original roots satisfy some bounds and the number of derivatives is such that the remaining degree is fixed, then these high derivatives converge to the Hermite polynomials. In the context of convolution semigroups and finite free probability these results have a natural interpretation as a central limit theorem for repeated differentiation. We consider the case when these root bounds are removed and identify the potential limits of repeated differentiation as the real rooted Appell sequences. We prove that a sequence of polynomials is in the domain of attraction of an Appell sequence exactly when the empirical measures of the roots are, up to a rescaling, in the domain of attraction of a free infinitely divisible distribution naturally associated to the Appell sequence. We additionally extend these notions of infinite divisibility and fractional convolution semigroups to rectangular finite free probability. Our approach is based on the finite free R-transform of the polynomials, providing a step towards an analytic theory of finite free probability. These transforms provide a clear connection between Appell polynomials and free infinitely divisible distributions, where the finite free R-transform of a real rooted Appell polynomial is a truncated version of the R-transform of an infinitely divisible distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we improve some concentration inequalities for martingales with bounded increments. These results recover the missing factor in Freedman-style inequalities and are near optimal. We also provide minor refinements of concentration inequalities for functions of independent random variables. These proofs use techniques from the works of Bentkus and Pinelis.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck equations for conditional McKean-Vlasov systems driven by Brownian sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate conditional McKean-Vlasov equations driven by time-space white noise, motivated by the propagation of chaos in an N-particle system with space-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics. The framework builds on the stochastic calculus of time-space white noise, utilizing tools such as the two-parameter Ito formula, Malliavin calculus, and orthogonal decompositions to analyze convergence and stochastic properties. Existence and uniqueness of solutions for the associated stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are rigorously established. Additionally, an integral stochastic Fokker-Planck equation is derived for the conditional law, employing Fourier transform methods and stochastic analysis in the plane. The framework is further applied to a partial observation control problem, showcasing its potential for analyzing stochastic systems with conditional dynamics.</description>

We first establish the existence and pathwise uniqueness of the weak solutions, and then show their convergence to the solutions of the deterministic 3D globally modified (hyperviscous) Navier-Stokes equations in an appropriate scaling limit. Furthermore, we prove a large deviation principle for the stochastic globally modified hyperviscous system.</description>

      <title>Strict inequality between the time constants of first-passage percolation and directed first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the models of first-passage percolation and directed first-passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we consider a family of i.i.d. random variables indexed by the set of edges of the graph, called passage times. For every vertex $x \in \mathbb{Z}^d$ with nonnegative coordinates, we denote by $t(0,x)$ the shortest passage time to go from $0$ to $x$ and by $\vec t(0,x)$ the shortest passage time to go from $0$ to $x$ following a directed path. Under some assumptions, it is known that for every $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$ with nonnegative coordinates, $t(0,\lfloor nx \rfloor)/n$ converges to a constant $\mu(x)$ and that $\vec t(0,\lfloor nx \rfloor)/n$ converges to a constant $\vec\mu(x)$. With these definitions, we immediately get that $\mu(x) \le \vec\mu(x)$. The first result of this short paper is the strict inequality $\mu(x) &lt; \vec\mu(x)$. To get this result, we use a lower bound on the number of edges of geodesics in first-passage percolation (where geodesics are paths with minimal passage time), which is the second result of this paper.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The k-neighbor graph is a directed percolation model on the hypercubic lattice Z d in which each vertex independently picks exactly k of its 2d nearest neighbors at random, and we open directed edges towards those. We prove that the 2-neighbor graph percolates on Z 2 , i.e., that the origin is connected to infinity with positive probability. The proof rests on duality, an exploration algorithm, a comparison to i.i.d. bond percolation under constraints as well as enhancement arguments. As a byproduct, we show that i.i.d. bond percolation with forbidden local patterns has a strictly larger percolation threshold than 1/2. Additionally, our main result provides further evidence that, in low dimensions, less variability is beneficial for percolation.</description>

Abstract: We consider a recent model of random walk that recursively grows the network on which it evolves, namely the Tree Builder Random Walk (TBRW). We introduce a bias $\rho \in (0,\infty)$ towards the root, and exhibit a phase transition for transience/recurrence at a critical threshold $\rho_c =1+2\overline{\nu}$, where $\overline{\nu}$ is the (possibly infinite) expected number of new leaves attached to the walker's position at each step. This generalizes previously known results, which focused on the unbiased case $\rho=1$. The proofs rely on a recursive analysis of the local times of the walk at each vertex of the tree, after a given number of returns to the root. We moreover characterize the strength of the transience (law of large numbers and central limit theorem with positive speed) via standard arguments, establish recurrence at $\rho_c$, and show a condensation phenomenon in the non-critical recurrent case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For rescaled additive functionals of the sine-process, upper bounds are obtained for their speed of convergence to the Gaussian distribution with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric. Under scaling with coefficient $R$ the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is bounded from above by $c/\log R$ for a smooth function and by $c/R$ for a function holomorphic in a horizontal strip.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of stochastic differential equations, diffusion processes have been adopted in numerous applications, as more relevant and flexible models. This paper studies diffusion processes in a different setting, where for a given stationary distribution and average variance, it seeks the diffusion process with optimal convergence rate. It is shown that the optimal drift function is a linear function and the convergence rate of the stochastic process is bounded by the ratio of the average variance to the variance of the stationary distribution. Furthermore, the concavity of the optimal relaxation time as a function of the stationary distribution has been proven, and it is shown that all Pearson diffusion processes of the Hypergeometric type with polynomial functions of at most degree two as the variance functions are optimal.</description>

Abstract: We prove a Bernstein inequality for vector-valued self-normalized martingales. We first give an alternative perspective of the corresponding sub-Gaussian bound due to \cite{abbasi2011improved} via a PAC-Bayesian argument with Gaussian priors. By instantiating this argument to priors drawn uniformly over well-chosen ellipsoids, we obtain a Bernstein bound.</description>

      <title>Random Fibonacci Words via Clone Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate positivity and probabilistic properties arising from the Young-Fibonacci lattice $\mathbb{YF}$, a 1-differential poset on binary words composed of 1's and 2's (known as Fibonacci words). Building on Okada's theory of clone Schur functions (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 346 (1994), 549-568), we introduce clone coherent measures on $\mathbb{YF}$ which give rise to random Fibonacci words of increasing length. Unlike coherent systems associated to classical Schur functions on the Young lattice of integer partitions, clone coherent measures are generally not extremal on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  Our first main result is a complete characterization of Fibonacci positive specializations - parameter sequences which yield positive clone Schur functions on $\mathbb{YF}$. We connect Fibonacci positivity with total positivity of tridiagonal matrices, Stieltjes moment sequences, and orthogonal polynomials in one variable from the ($q$-)Askey scheme.
  Our second family of results concerns the asymptotic behavior of random Fibonacci words derived from various Fibonacci positive specializations. We analyze several limiting regimes for specific examples, revealing stick-breaking-like processes (connected to GEM distributions), dependent stick-breaking processes of a new type, or discrete limits tied to the Martin boundary of the Young-Fibonacci lattice. Our stick-breaking-like scaling limits significantly extend the result of Gnedin-Kerov (Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 129 (2000), no. 3, 433-446) on asymptotics of the Plancherel measure on $\mathbb{YF}$.
  We also establish Cauchy-like identities for clone Schur functions (with the right-hand side given by a quadridiagonal determinant), and construct and analyze models of random permutations and involutions based on Fibonacci positive specializations and a version of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence for $\mathbb{YF}$.</description>

      <title>Optimal bound for survival time of the SIRS process on star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) process, a continuous-time Markov chain frequently employed in epidemiology to model the spread of infections on networks. In this framework, infections spread as infected vertices recover at rate 1, infect susceptible neighbors independently at rate $\lambda$, and recovered vertices become susceptible again at rate $\alpha$. This model presents a significantly greater analytical challenge compared to the SIS model, which has consequently inspired a much more extensive and rich body of mathematical literature for the latter. Understanding the survival time, the duration before the infection dies out completely, is a fundamental question in this context. On general graphs, survival time heavily depends on the infection's persistence around high-degree vertices (known as hubs or stars), as long persistence enables transmission between hubs and prolongs the process. In contrast, short persistence leads to rapid extinction, making the dynamics on star graphs, which serve as key representatives of hubs, particularly important to study.
  In the 2016 paper by Ferreira, Sander, and Pastor-Satorras, published in {\it Physical Review E}, it was conjectured, based on intuitive arguments, that the survival time for SIRS on a star graph with $n$ leaves is bounded above by $(\lambda^2 n)^\alpha$ for large $n$. Later, in the seemingly first mathematically rigorous result for SIRS (\cite{friedrich2022analysis}) provided an upper bound of $n^\alpha \log n$, with contains an additional $\log n$ and no dependence on $\lambda$.
  We resolve this conjecture by proving that the survival time is indeed of order $(\lambda^2 n)^\alpha$, with matching upper and lower bounds. Additionally, we show that this holds even in the case where only the root undergoes immunization, while the leaves revert to susceptibility immediately after recovery.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of quadratic RBSDEs and BSDEs with one-sided growth restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence, uniqueness and comparison theorem for the bounded solutions and unbounded solutions of reflected backward stochastic differential equations (RBSDEs) and backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), whose generators have a one-sided growth restriction on $y$ and have a general quadratic growth in $z$, and whose solutions $Y_t$ (and obstacles) take values in $(a,\infty)$ with $a\geq-\infty$. We provide a method for the uniqueness of solutions of such RBSDEs and BSDEs, whose generators satisfy a $\theta$-domination condition. This condition contains the generators which are convex in $(y,z)$ or are (locally) Lipschitz in $y$ and convex in $z$, and the generators which are locally Lipschitz in $(y,z)$. Our method relies on the $\theta$-difference technique and a comparison argument based on RBSDEs. We also provide a method to study the comparison theorem for such RBSDEs and BSDEs.</description>

Abstract: We consider the fixed points of the multivariate smoothing transform on $\mathbb{R}^d$, namely the solutions $Z$ to the distributional equation $Z = \sum_{i=1}^N A_i Z_i$, where $N \geq 0$ is a random integer, $(A_i)_{i \geq 1}$ are $d \times d$ random matrices and $(Z_i)_{i \geq 1}$ are independent copies of $Z$, independent of $(N, A_1, A_2, \cdots)$. We focus on the case where $A_i$ and $Z$ are nonnegative, and we investigate properties of the distribution of $Z$, including its support, absolute continuity, and the existence of harmonic moments.</description>

      <title>Tractable size-structured fish growth models in natural environment with an application to an inland fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling fish growth is an important research topic in ecological and fishery sciences because body weight statistics directly affect the total biomass of fish in a habitat, which in turn affects their population dynamics. Many models of fish growth assume that the fish population in a habitat is homogenous, meaning that there is no physiological spectrum and, therefore, no size spectrum. Moreover, models that account for the size spectrum are not always analytically tractable. We present novel mathematical models of fish growth in which the body weight of each fish is assumed to follow a von Bertalanffy-type model whose proportionality coefficient, representing the maximum body weight, may differ among individual fish. This probabilistic description introduces the size spectrum into the model, owing to which the time-dependent probability density of this model is obtained explicitly. We also consider a misspecified version and a stochastic version of the model as advanced cases. We apply the first model to the real growth data of Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis as a keystone fish species in Japan. The model successfully reproduces the skewed size spectrum of this fish species over multiple years. We further use the stochastic model to investigate how fish growth dynamics are affected by environmental fluctuations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Potts spin glass with additional ferromagnetic interaction parametrized by $t$. It has long been observed that the Potts color symmetry breaking for the spin glass order parameter is closely related to the ferromagnetic phase transition. To clarify this, we identify a single critical value $t_\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of both color symmetry breaking and the transition to ferromagnetism.</description>

Abstract: In 1976, Knuth and Yao presented an algorithm for sampling from a finite distribution using flips of a fair coin that on average used the optimal number of flips. Here we show how to easily run their algorithm for the special case of rolling a fair die that uses memory linear in the input. Analysis of this algorithm yields a bound on the average number of coin flips needed that is slightly better than the original Knuth-Yao bound. This can then be extended to discrete distributions in a near optimal number of flips again using memory linear in the input.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Distributionally Robust Optimization: Intuitive Understanding and Algorithm Development from the Primal Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem from the primal perspective. Unlike existing approaches, this perspective allows us to build a deeper and more intuitive understanding on DRO, to leverage classical and well-established solution methods and to develop a general and fast decomposition algorithm (and its variants), and to address a couple of unsolved issues that are critical for modeling and computation. Theoretical analyses regarding the strength, convergence, and iteration complexity of the developed algorithm are also presented. A numerical study on different types of instances of the distributionally robust facility location problem demonstrates that the proposed solution algorithm (and its variants) significantly outperforms existing methods. It solves instances up to several orders of magnitude faster, and successfully addresses new types of practical instances that previously could not be handled. We believe these results will significantly enhance the accessibility of DRO, break down barriers, and unleash its potential to solve real world challenges.</description>

      <title>A randomisation method for mean-field control problems with common noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study mean-field control (MFC) problems with common noise using the control randomisation framework, where we substitute the control process with an independent Poisson point process, controlling its intensity instead. To address the challenges posed by the mean-field interactions in this randomisation approach, we reformulate the admissible control as L 0 -valued processes adapted only to the common noise. We then construct the randomised control problem from this reformulated control process, and show its equivalence to the original MFC problem. Thanks to this equivalence, we can represent the value function as the minimal solution to a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE) with constrained jumps. Finally, using this probabilistic representation, we derive a randomised dynamic programming principle (DPP) for the value function, expressed as a supremum over equivalent probability measures.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of free denoising. For free selfadjoint random variables $a,b$, where we interpret $a$ as a signal and $b$ as noise, we find $E(a|a+b)$. To that end, we study a probability measure $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ on $\mathbb{R}^2$ which we call the overlap measure. We show that $\mu^{( \mathrm{ov} )}_{a,a+b}$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the product measure $\mu_a\times \mu_{a+b}$. The Radon-Nikodym derivative gives direct access to $E(a|a+b)$. We show that analogous results hold in the case of multiplicative noise when $a,b$ are positive and the aim is to find $E(a|a^{1/2}ba^{1/2})$. In a parallel development we show that, for a general selfadjoint expression $P(a,b)$ made with $a$ and $b$, finding $E(a|P(a,b))$ is equivalent to finding the distribution of $P(a,b)$ in a certain two-state probability space $(\mathcal{A},\varphi,\chi)$, where $a,b$ are c-free with respect to $(\varphi,\chi)$ in the sense of Bo\.zejko-Leinert-Speicher.</description>

      <title>Low coordinate degree algorithms II: Categorical signals and generalized stochastic block models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study when low coordinate degree functions (LCDF) -- linear combinations of functions depending on small subsets of entries of a vector -- can test for the presence of categorical structure, including community structure and generalizations thereof, in high-dimensional data. This complements the first paper of this series, which studied the power of LCDF in testing for continuous structure like real-valued signals perturbed by additive noise. We apply the tools developed there to a general form of stochastic block model (SBM), where a population is assigned random labels and every $p$-tuple of the population generates an observation according to an arbitrary probability measure associated to the $p$ labels of its members. We show that the performance of LCDF admits a unified analysis for this class of models. As applications, we prove tight lower bounds against LCDF (and therefore also against low degree polynomials) for nearly arbitrary graph and regular hypergraph SBMs, always matching suitable generalizations of the Kesten-Stigum threshold. We also prove tight lower bounds for group synchronization and abelian group sumset problems under the "truth-or-Haar" noise model, and use our technical results to give an improved analysis of Gaussian multi-frequency group synchronization. In most of these models, for some parameter settings our lower bounds give new evidence for conjectural statistical-to-computational gaps. Finally, interpreting some of our findings, we propose a precise analogy between categorical and continuous signals: a general SBM as above behaves, in terms of the tradeoff between subexponential runtime cost of testing algorithms and the signal strength needed for a testing algorithm to succeed, like a spiked $p_*$-tensor model of a certain order $p_*$ that may be computed from the parameters of the SBM.</description>

      <title>Rough differential equations for volatility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a canonical way of performing the joint lift of a Brownian motion $W$ and a low-regularity adapted stochastic rough path $\mathbf{X}$, extending [Diehl, Oberhauser and Riedel (2015). A L\'evy area between Brownian motion and rough paths with applications to robust nonlinear filtering and rough partial differential equations]. Applying this construction to the case where $\mathbf{X}$ is the canonical lift of a one-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (possibly correlated with $W$) completes the partial rough path of [Fukasawa and Takano (2024). A partial rough path space for rough volatility]. We use this to model rough volatility with the versatile toolkit of rough differential equations (RDEs), namely by taking the price and volatility processes to be the solution to a single RDE. We argue that our framework is already interesting when $W$ and $X$ are independent, as correlation between the price and volatility can be introduced in the dynamics. The lead-lag scheme of [Flint, Hambly, and Lyons (2016). Discretely sampled signals and the rough Hoff process] is extended to our fractional setting as an approximation theory for the rough path in the correlated case. Continuity of the solution map transforms this into a numerical scheme for RDEs. We numerically test this framework and use it to calibrate a simple new rough volatility model to market data.</description>

      <title>On the clique number of random Cayley graphs and related topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that a random Cayley graph on a group of order $N$ has clique number $O(\log N \log \log N)$ with high probability. This bound is best possible up to the constant factor for certain groups, including~$\mathbb{F}_2^n$, and improves the longstanding upper bound of $O(\log^2 N)$ due to Alon. Our proof does not make use of the underlying group structure and is purely combinatorial, with the key result being an essentially best possible upper bound for the number of subsets of given order that contain at most a given number of colors in a properly edge-colored complete graph. As a further application of this result, we study a conjecture of Alon stating that every group of order $N$ has a Cayley graph whose clique number and independence number are both $O(\log N)$, proving the conjecture for all abelian groups of order $N$ for almost all $N$. For finite vector spaces of order $N$ with characteristic congruent to $1 \pmod 4$, we prove the existence of a self-complementary Cayley graph on the vector space whose clique number and independence number are both at most $(2+o(1))\log N$. This matches the lower bound for Ramsey numbers coming from random graphs and solves, in a strong form, a problem of Alon and Orlitsky motivated by information theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.13201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior of the fluctuations for the empirical measures of interacting particle systems with singular kernels. We prove that the sequence of fluctuation processes converges in distribution to a generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our result considerably extends classical results to singular kernels, including the Biot-Savart law. The result applies to the point vortex model approximating the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equation and the 2D Euler equation. We also obtain Gaussianity and optimal regularity of the limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The method relies on the martingale approach and the Donsker-Varadhan variational formula, which transfers the uniform estimate to some exponential integrals. Estimation of those exponential integrals follows by cancellations and combinatorics techniques and is of the type of large deviation principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.05533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The backward heat flow on the real line started from the initial condition $z^n$ results in the classical $n$-th Hermite polynomial whose zeroes are distributed according to the Wigner semicircle law in the large $n$ limit. Similarly, the backward heat flow with the periodic initial condition $(\sin \frac \theta 2)^n$ leads to trigonometric or unitary analogues of the Hermite polynomials. These polynomials are closely related to the partition function of the Curie--Weiss model and appeared in the work of Mirabelli on finite free probability. We relate the $n$-th unitary Hermite polynomial to the expected characteristic polynomial of a unitary random matrix obtained by running a Brownian motion on the unitary group $U(n)$. We identify the global distribution of zeroes of the unitary Hermite polynomials as the free unitary normal distribution. We also compute the asymptotics of these polynomials or, equivalently, the free energy of the Curie--Weiss model in a complex external field. We identify the global distribution of the Lee--Yang zeroes of this model. Finally, we show that the backward heat flow applied to a high-degree real-rooted polynomial (respectively, trigonometric polynomial) induces, on the level of the asymptotic distribution of its roots, a free Brownian motion (respectively, free unitary Brownian motion).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the contact process on random graphs with low infection rate $\lambda$. For random $d$-regular graphs, it is known that the survival time is $O(\log n)$ below the critical $\lambda_c$. By contrast, on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs $\mathcal G(n,d/n)$, rare high-degree vertices result in much longer survival times. We show that the survival time is governed by high-density local configurations. In particular, we show that there is a long string of high-degree vertices on which the infection lasts for time $n^{\lambda^{2+o(1)}}$. To establish a matching upper bound, we introduce a modified version of the contact process which ignores infections that do not lead to further infections and allows for a shaper recursive analysis on branching process trees, the local-weak limit of the graph. Our methods, moreover, generalize to random graphs with given degree distributions that have exponential moments.</description>

      <title>On local maxima of smooth Gaussian nonstationary processes and stationary planar fields with trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present exact formulas for both the expected number and the height distribution of local maxima (peaks) in two distinct categories of smooth, non-centered Gaussian fields: (i) nonstationary Gaussian processes and (ii) stationary planar Gaussian fields. For case (i), we introduce a novel parameter related to conditional correlation that significantly simplifies the computation of these formulas. Notably, the peak height distribution is solely dependent on this single parameter. In case (ii), traditional methods involving GOE random matrices are ineffective for non-isotropic fields with mean functions. To address this, we apply specific transformations that enable the derivation of formulas using generalized chi-squared density functions. These derived results provide essential tools for calculating p-values and power in applications of signal and change point detection within environments characterized by non-isotropic Gaussian noise.</description>

      <title>Functional Limit Theorems for Hawkes Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the long-run behavior of Hawkes processes is fully determined by the average number and the dispersion of child events. For subcritical processes we provide FLLNs and FCLTs under minimal conditions on the kernel of the process with the precise form of the limit theorems depending strongly on the dispersion of child events. For a critical Hawkes process with weakly dispersed child events, functional central limit theorems do not hold. Instead, we prove that the rescaled intensity processes and rescaled Hawkes processes behave like CIR-processes without mean-reversion, respectively integrated CIR-processes. We provide the rate of convergence by establishing an upper bound on the Wasserstein distance between the distributions of rescaled Hawkes process and the corresponding limit process. By contrast, critical Hawkes process with heavily dispersed child events share many properties of subcritical ones. In particular, functional limit theorems hold. However, unlike subcritical processes critical ones with heavily dispersed child events display long-range dependencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores an optimal stopping problem for branching diffusion processes. It consists in looking for optimal stopping lines, a type of stopping time that maintains the branching structure of the processes under analysis. By using a dynamic programming approach, we characterize the value function for a multiplicative cost, which may depend on the particle's label. We reduce the problem's dimensionality by setting a branching property and defining the problem in a finite-dimensional context. Within this framework, we focus on the value function, establishing uniform continuity and boundedness properties, together with an innovative dynamic programming principle. This outcome leads to an analytical characterization with the help of a nonlinear elliptic PDE. We conclude by showing that the value function serves as the unique viscosity solution for this PDE, generalizing the comparison principle to this setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Quickselect algorithm (also called FIND) is a fundamental algorithm for selecting ranks or quantiles within a set of data. Gr\"ubel and R\"osler showed that the number of key comparisons required by Quickselect considered as a process of the quantiles $\alpha\in[0,1]$ converges within a natural probabilistic model after normalization in distribution within the c\`adl\`ag space $D[0,1]$ endowed with the Skorokhod metric. We show that the residual process in the latter convergence after normalization converges in distribution towards a mixture of Gaussian processes in $D[0,1]$. A similar result holds for the related algorithm QuickVal. Our method is applicable to other cost measures such as the number of swaps (key exchanges) required by Quickselect, or cost measures being based on key comparisons taking additionally into account that the cost of a comparison between two keys may depend on their values, an example being the number of bit comparisons needed to compare keys given by their bit expansions. For all the arising mixtures of Gaussian limit processes, we also discuss the H\"older continuity of their paths.</description>

Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide sample-path estimates for the solution of slowly time-dependent SPDEs perturbed by a cylindrical fractional Brownian motion. Our strategy is similar to the approach by Berglund and Nader for space-time white noise. However, the setting of fractional Brownian motion does not allow us to use any martingale methods. Using instead optimal estimates for the probability that the supremum of a Gaussian process exceeds a certain level, we derive concentration estimates for the solution of the SPDE, provided that the Hurst index $H$ of the fractional Brownian motion satisfies $H&gt;\frac14$. As a by-product, we also obtain concentration estimates for one-dimensional fractional SDEs valid for any $H\in(0,1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\epsilon_{1},\ldots,\epsilon_{n}$ be a sequence of independent Rademacher random variables. We prove that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that for any unit vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbb{R}^2$,
  $$\Pr\left[||\epsilon_1 v_1+\ldots+\epsilon_n v_n||_2 \leq \sqrt{2}\right]\geq \frac{c}{n}.$$
  This resolves the only remaining conjecture from the seminal paper of Erd\H{o}s on the Littlewood--Offord problem, and it is sharp both in the sense that the constant $\sqrt{2}$ cannot be reduced and that the magnitude $n^{-1}$ is best possible. We also prove polynomial bounds for the analogous problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Normality and Concentration Inequalities of Statistics of Core Partitions with Bounded Perimeters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Core partitions have attracted much attention since Anderson's work (2002) on the number of $(s,t)$-core partitions for coprime $s,t$. Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying the limiting distributions of the sizes of random simultaneous core partitions. In this paper, we prove the asymptotic normality of certain statistics of uniform random core partitions with bounded perimeters in the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein $W_1$ distances, including the length and size of a random (strict) $n$-core partition, the length of the Durfee square and the size of a random self-conjugate $n$-core partition. Accordingly, we prove that these statistics are subgaussian. This contrasts with the asymptotic behavior of the size of a random $(s, t)$-core partition for coprime $s,t$ studied by Even-Zohar (2022), which converges in law to Watson's $U^2$ distribution. Our results show that the distribution of the size of a random strict $(n, dn+1)$-core partition is asymptotically normal when $d \ge 3$ is fixed and $n$ tends to infinity, which is an analog of Zaleski's conjecture (2017) and covers Koml\'{o}s, Sergel, and Tusn\'{a}dy's result (2020) as a special case. Our proof integrates a variety of combinatorial and probabilistic tools, including Stein's method based on Hoeffding decomposition, Hoeffding's combinatorial central limit theorem, the Efron-Stein inequalities on product spaces and slices, and asymptotics of P\'{o}lya frequency sequences. Furthermore, our approach is potentially applicable to the study of the asymptotic normality of functionals of random variables with certain global dependence structures that can be decomposed into appropriate mixture forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two random variables taking values in a bounded interval, we study whether one dominates the other in higher-order stochastic dominance depends on the reference interval in the model setting. We obtain two results. First, the stochastic dominance relations get strictly stronger when the reference interval shrinks if and only if the order of stochastic dominance is larger than three. Second, for mean-preserving stochastic dominance relations, the reference interval is irrelevant if and only if the difference between the degree of the stochastic dominance and the number of moments is no larger than three. These results highlight complications arising from using higher-order stochastic dominance in economic applications.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity for locally monotone stochastic evolution equations with L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish general conditions for stochastic evolution equations with locally monotone drift and degenerate additive L\'evy noise in variational formulation resulting in the existence of a unique invariant probability measure for the associated ergodic Markovian Feller semigroup. We prove improved moment estimates for the solutions and the $e$-property of the semigroup. Examples include the stochastic incompressible 2D Navier-Stokes equations, shear thickening stochastic power-law fluid equations, the stochastic heat equation, as well as, stochastic semilinear equations such as the 1D stochastic Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Deep Kalman Filters Can Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Kalman filters (DKFs) are a class of neural network models that generate Gaussian probability measures from sequential data. Though DKFs are inspired by the Kalman filter, they lack concrete theoretical ties to the stochastic filtering problem, thus limiting their applicability to areas where traditional model-based filters have been used, e.g.\ model calibration for bond and option prices in mathematical finance. We address this issue in the mathematical foundations of deep learning by exhibiting a class of continuous-time DKFs which can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-times measurements. Our approximation results hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of paths, where the approximation error is quantified by the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance computed uniformly over the given compact set of paths.</description>

      <title>Why the Metric Backbone Preserves Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metric backbone of a weighted graph is the union of all-pairs shortest paths. It is obtained by removing all edges $(u,v)$ that are not the shortest path between $u$ and $v$. In networks with well-separated communities, the metric backbone tends to preserve many inter-community edges, because these edges serve as bridges connecting two communities, but tends to delete many intra-community edges because the communities are dense. This suggests that the metric backbone would dilute or destroy the community structure of the network. However, this is not borne out by prior empirical work, which instead showed that the metric backbone of real networks preserves the community structure of the original network well. In this work, we analyze the metric backbone of a broad class of weighted random graphs with communities, and we formally prove the robustness of the community structure with respect to the deletion of all the edges that are not in the metric backbone. An empirical comparison of several graph sparsification techniques confirms our theoretical finding and shows that the metric backbone is an efficient sparsifier in the presence of communities.</description>

      <title>Hyper-bishops, Hyper-rooks, and Hyper-queens: Percentage of Safe Squares on Higher Dimensional Chess Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $n$ queens problem considers the maximum number of safe squares on an $n \times n$ chess board when placing $n$ queens; the answer is only known for small $n$. Miller, Sheng and Turek considered instead $n$ randomly placed rooks, proving the proportion of safe squares converges to $1/e^2$. We generalize and solve when randomly placing $n$ hyper-rooks and $n^{k-1}$ line-rooks on a $k$-dimensional board, using combinatorial and probabilistic methods, with the proportion of safe squares converging to $1/e^k$. We prove that the proportion of safe squares on an $n \times n$ board with bishops in 2 dimensions converges to $2/e^2$. This problem is significantly more interesting and difficult; while a rook attacks the same number of squares wherever it's placed, this is not so for bishops. We expand to the $k$-dimensional chessboard, defining line-bishops to attack along $2$-dimensional diagonals and hyper-bishops to attack in the $k-1$ dimensional subspace defined by its diagonals in the $k-2$ dimensional subspace. We then combine the movement of rooks and bishops to consider the movement of queens in 2 dimensions, as well as line-queens and hyper-queens in $k$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Multifold Convolutions, Generating Functions and 1d Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider multifold convolutions of a combinatorial sequence $(a_n)_{n=0}^{\infty}$: namely, for each $k \in \N$ the $k$-fold convolution is $\mathcal{M}^{(k)}_n(\boldsymbol{a}) = \sum_{j_1+\dots+j_k=n} a_{j_1} \cdots a_{j_k}$. Let $C_n$ be the Catalan numbers, and let $B_n$ be the central binomial coefficients. Then for random Dyck paths or simple random walk bridges, the multifold convolutions give moments of returns to the origin, using the stars-and-bars problem. There are well-known explicit formulas for the multifold convolutions of $C_n$ and $B_n$. But even for combinatorial sequences $B_n^2$ and $B_n^3$, one may determine asymptotics of multifold convolutions for large $n$. We also discuss large deviations: In a second part of the paper we consider an elementary version of the circle method for calculating asymptotics using complex analysis.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions on 1d Long-Range Ising Models with Decaying Fields: A Direct Proof via Contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following seminal work by J. Fr\"ohlich and T. Spencer on the critical exponent $\alpha=2$, we give a proof via contours of phase transition in the one-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic Ising model in the entire region of decay, where phase transition is known to occur, i.e., polynomial decay $\alpha \in (1,2]$. No assumptions that the nearest-neighbor interaction $J(1)$ is large are made. The robustness of the method also yields a proof of phase transition in the presence of a nonsummable external field that decays sufficiently fast.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for vector-valued composite functionals with smoothing and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on vector-valued composite functionals, which may be nonlinear in probability. Our primary goal is to establish central limit theorems for these functionals when mixed estimators are employed. Our study is relevant to the evaluation and comparison of risk in decision-making contexts and extends to functionals that arise in machine learning methods. A generalized family of composite risk functionals is presented, which encompasses most of the known coherent risk measures including systemic measures of risk. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we analyze vector-valued functionals, providing a framework for evaluating high-dimensional risks. This framework facilitates the comparison of multiple risk measures, as well as the estimation and asymptotic analysis of systemic risk and its optimal value in decision-making problems. Second, we derive novel central limit theorems for optimized composite functionals when mixed types of estimators: empirical and smoothed estimators are used. We provide verifiable sufficient conditions for the central limit formulae and show their applicability to several popular measures of risk.</description>
