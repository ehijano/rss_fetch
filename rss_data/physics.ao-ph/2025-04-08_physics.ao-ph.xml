      <title>Is ENSO a damped or a self-sustained oscillation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recharge oscillator (RO) model has been successfully used to understand different aspects of the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Fitting the RO to observations and climate model simulations consistently suggests that ENSO is a damped oscillator whose variability is sustained and made irregular by external weather noise. We investigate the methods that have been used to estimate the growth rate of ENSO by applying them to simulations of both damped and self-sustained RO regimes. We find that fitting a linear RO leads to parameters that imply a damped oscillator even when the fitted data were produced by a model that is self-sustained. Fitting a nonlinear RO also leads to a significant bias toward a damped regime. As such, it seems challenging to conclude whether ENSO is a damped or a self-sustained oscillation by fitting such models to observations, and the possibility that ENSO is self-sustained cannot be ruled out.</description>

      <title>CAMulator: Fast Emulation of the Community Atmosphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce CAMulator version 1, an auto-regressive machine-learned (ML) emulator of the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (CAM6) that simulates the next atmospheric state given the prescribed sea surface temperatures and incoming solar radiation. CAMulator explicitly conserves global dry air mass, moisture, and total atmospheric energy while remaining numerically stable over indefinite climate integrations. It successfully reproduces the annual CAM6 climatology and key modes of climate variability, including the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, and the Pacific-North American pattern, with slightly muted variability. When forced with sea surface temperature (SST) outside the training distribution, CAMulator exhibits a systematic cold bias in high-latitude regions, particularly in boreal winter, likely due to the absence of interactive land and sea ice. Nonetheless, CAMulator achieves these results with a 350 times speedup over CAM6, making it an efficient alternative for generating large ensembles.</description>

      <title>Radiatively-Cooled Moist Convection under an Idealised Climate Change Scenario: Linear Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to explore the effects of climate change on atmospheric convection and the water cycle, we develop and analyse an extension of the Rainy-B\'enard model, which is itself a moist version of the Rayleigh-B\'enard model of dry convection. Including moisture changes the character of the convection, with condensation providing a source of buoyancy via latent heating. The climate change model is set up by imposing a variable radiative cooling rate, prescribing surface temperature and relative humidity, and imposing a moist-pseudoadiabatic profile at the top boundary (a flux boundary condition). The model is analysed across the climate parameter space by examining diagnostics of the model's basic state, and its stability, with Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) calculations and a linear stability analysis. We use the linear stability results to identify new parameters relevant for this moist convective system, and to understand how the linear instability responds to the climate parameters. In particular, we define the "Rainy number" as a scaled ratio of positive-area CAPE and diffusion parameters. An alternative radiative-based Rainy number also is shown to describe the parameter space, especially for problems relating to changes in flux conditions. The analysis provides a novel theoretical understanding of how the dynamics and scales of moist convection and hence precipitation will change under climate change.</description>

      <title>Machine learning emulation of precipitation from km-scale regional climate simulations using a diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution climate simulations are valuable for understanding climate change impacts. This has motivated use of regional convection-permitting climate models (CPMs), but these are very computationally expensive. We present a convection-permitting model generative emulator (CPMGEM), to skilfully emulate precipitation simulations by a 2.2km-resolution regional CPM at much lower cost. This utilises a generative machine learning approach, a diffusion model. It takes inputs at the 60km resolution of the driving global climate model and downscales these to 8.8km, with daily-mean time resolution, capturing the effect of convective processes represented in the CPM at these scales. The emulator is trained on simulations over England and Wales from the United Kingdom Climate Projections Local product, covering years between 1980 and 2080 following a high emissions scenario. The output precipitation has a similarly realistic spatial structure and intensity distribution to the CPM simulations. The emulator is stochastic, which improves the realism of samples. We show evidence that the emulator has skill for extreme events with ~100 year return times. It captures the main features of the simulated 21st century climate change, but exhibits some error in the magnitude. We demonstrate successful transfer from a "perfect model" training setting to application using GCM variable inputs. We also show that the method can be useful in situations with limited amounts of high-resolution data. Potential applications include producing high-resolution precipitation predictions for large-ensemble climate simulations and producing output based on different GCMs and climate change scenarios to better sample uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Ball Lightning as a profound manifestation of the Dark Matter physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ball lighting (BL) has been observed for centuries. There are large number of books, review articles, and original scientific papers devoted to different aspects of BL phenomenon. Yet, the basic features of this phenomenon have never been explained by known physics. The main problem is the source which could power the dynamics of the BL. We advocate an idea that the dark matter (DM) in form of the axion quark nuggets (AQN) made of standard model quarks and gluons (similar to the old idea of the Witten's strangelets) could internally generate the required power. The AQN model was invented long ago without any relation to the BL physics. It was invented with a single motivation to explain the observed similarity $\Omega_{\rm DM}\sim \Omega_{\rm visible}$ between visible and DM components. This relation represents a very generic feature of this framework, not sensitive to any parameters of the construction. However, with the same set of parameters being fixed long ago this model is capable to address the key elements of the BL phenomenology, including the source of the energy powering the BL events.
  In particular, we argue that the visible size of BL, its typical life time, the frequency of appearance, etc are all consistent with suggested proposal when BL represents a profound manifestation of the DM physics represented by the AQN objects. We also argue that some of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) might be closely related to BL events, and therefore also represent profound manifestations of the DM physics within AQN framework. We also formulate a number of specific possible tests which can refute or unambiguously substantiate this unorthodox proposal on nature of BL and UAP.</description>
