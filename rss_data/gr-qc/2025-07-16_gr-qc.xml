      <title>Large scale structure constraints and matter power spectrum in $f (Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we take into account the dynamical system analysis to investigate the matter power spectrum within the framework of the $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ gravitational theory. After obtaining autonomous dynamical system variables for two different particular pedagogical choices of $f(Q,\mathcal{L}_{m})$ models (A and B), we derive the full system of perturbation equations using the $1+3$ covariant formalism to study the matter fluctuations. We present and solve the energy density perturbation equations to obtain the energy density contrast, which decays with redshift for both models for a particular choice of model parameters. After obtaining the numerical results of the density contrast, we computed the matter spectra for each model and conducted a comparative analysis with the $\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, by employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis,the model parameters were constrained using a combination of different observational data sets to improve the robustness and accuracy of the parameter estimation. Our results indicate that only model A can be compatible with the considered observational data sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted in the late inspiral of binary neutron stars are affected by their tidal deformation. We study the tidal dynamics in full general relativity through matched-asymptotic expansions and prove that the dynamical tidal response can be expanded in a complete set of modes. We further prove that the mode amplitudes satisfy an effective, forced harmonic oscillator equation, which generalizes the overlap-integral formulation of Newtonian gravity. Our relativistic treatment of dynamical tides will avoid systematic biases in future gravitational-wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Twisting inflation to sub-Planckian axion decay constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study pseudoscalar inflation in the Einstein-Cartan-Palatini (first-order) formulation of gravity while allowing for torsion. We introduce two non-minimal interactions in the gravitational sector: pseudoscalar couplings to the Pontryagin density (Chern-Simons term) and the Nieh-Yan topological invariant. In the presence of these terms, the rolling pseudoscalar sources non-trivial torsional fields during inflation. We show that pathological gradient and ghost instabilities limit the strength of the coupling to the Pontryagin density during inflation. Furthermore, we show that the interaction with the Nieh-Yan term induces a new contribution to the pseudoscalar kinetic term, which parametrically increases its decay constant and allows for inflation on steep potentials. The torsion field generated by the background is parity violating, which is manifest in the resulting chiral gravitational wave spectrum. We find that the scalar sector is largely unaffected beyond the remapping of the axion decay constant to a larger value. Consequently, we show that while natural inflation with a cosine potential remains inconsistent with observations, the squared quartic hilltop potential can be made consistent with Planck 2018 data even for sub-Planckian decay constants by coupling to the Nieh-Yan term.</description>

      <title>Causal structure and topology change in (2+1)-dimensional simplicial gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for analyzing the causal structure at vertices in (2+1)-dimensional Lorentzian simplicial gravity. By examining the intersection patterns of lightcones emanating from a vertex with its simplicial neighbourhood, we identify 13 distinct causal types of Lorentzian tetrahedra-excluding configurations with null faces. This forms the basis for a topological classification of the local causal structure in terms of the number of connected spacelike and timelike regions on the triangulated 2-sphere surrounding the vertex. These local causal data allow us to identify regular causal structures and new types of causal irregular configurations, generalizing well-known (1+1)-dimensional topologies, such as `Trousers' and `Yarmulkes', to higher dimensions.
  We further investigate the dynamical implications of vertex causality by analyzing the behaviour of deficit angles and the Regge action in explicit configurations. Transitions in vertex causal structure coincide with singularities in the curvature and action, suggesting discrete topology change. Causally irregular hinges correspond to discrete conical singularities, while vertex causal irregularities manifest as point-like singularities. Interestingly, we find that vertex and hinge causality are generally independent. These results have direct implications for discrete quantum gravity approaches where the emergence of semiclassical spacetime depends on how causal structures are encoded within the triangulation.</description>

      <title>Geodesics, Scalar Fields, and GUP-Corrected Thermodynamics of Charged BTZ-like Black Holes in Bopp-Podolsky Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Ref. [1], the spacetime geometry generated by compact objects in $(2+1)$-dimensional Bopp-Podolsky electrodynamics is derived. Using a perturbative approach, the authors derived a charged BTZ-like black hole solution and computed corrections up to second order in a perturbative expansion valid far from the horizon. In this work, we investigate the same circularly symmetric three-dimensional charged BH solution pierced by disclinations. We begin by analyzing the motion of photons within this spacetime, focusing on how the geometric parameters influence the effective potential governing null geodesic motion. The corresponding equations of motion are derived, and the resulting orbital dynamics are explored through graphical methods to show the influence of key parameters including the BH mass $M$, electric charge $Q$, cosmological constant $\Lambda$, and BP coupling parameter $b^2$. Extending our analysis to wave dynamics, we examine the propagation of massless scalar fields in the BH solution by solving the Klein-Gordon equation. Through suitable coordinate transformations, we derive a Schr\"odinger-like equation with an effective potential that encodes the influence of the topological defect and electromagnetic corrections. Additionally, we investigate quantum gravitational effects by applying the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) to derive a GUP-corrected Hawking temperature, revealing systematic suppression of thermal radiation that could lead to stable BH remnants. Finally, we compute Keplerian frequencies for circular orbits, demonstrating how the interplay between charge, nonlinear electrodynamics, and disclination parameters creates distinctive observational signatures that could potentially test modified gravity theories in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion in the post-Newtonian approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mixture of light-gas particles and Brownian heavy particles is analyzed within the framework of a post-Newtonian Boltzmann equation to determine the Fokker-Planck equation for the Brownian motion. For each species, the equilibrium distribution function refers to the corresponding post-Newtonian Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution function. The expressions for the friction viscous coefficient in the first and second post-Newtonian approximations are determined, and we show their dependence on the corresponding gravitational potentials. A linear stability analysis in the Newtonian and post-Newtonian Fokker-Planck equations for the Brownian motion is developed, where the perturbations are assumed to be plane harmonic waves of small amplitudes. From a dispersion relation it follows that: (i) for perturbation wavelengths smaller than the Jeans wavelength two propagating modes -- corresponding to harmonic waves in opposite directions -- and one mode that does not propagate show up; (ii) for perturbation wavelengths bigger than the Jeans wavelength the time evolution of the perturbation corresponds to a growth or a decay and the one which grows refers to the instability.</description>

      <title>Thermal scalar field stress tensor on a two dimensional black hole and its near horizon properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the thermal renormalized energy-momentum tensor components of a massless scalar field, leading to trace anomaly, on a $(1+1)$ dimensional static black hole spacetime. Using these, the energy density and flux, seen by both static and freely-falling observers, are evaluated. Interestingly for both these observers the aforementioned quantities in Unruh and Boulware vacua are finite at the horizon when the scalar field is in thermal equilibrium with the horizon temperature (given by the Hawking expression). Whereas in Hartle-Hawking vacuum both the observers see finite energy-density and flux at the horizon, irrespective of the value of field temperature. Particularly in the case of Schwarzschild spacetime, a freely falling observer finds its initial critical position $r^c_i = (3/2)r_H$, where $r_H$ is the horizon radius for which energy-density vanishes.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</description>

      <title>The fault in our sirens: Hierarchical diagnosis of waveform systematics in Hubble-Lema\^itre constant measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11278v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological inference using a population of binary black-hole mergers, combined with a galaxy catalog, presents an exciting opportunity for precision cosmology with the possibility of resolving the Hubble tension. However, the accuracy of these measurements heavily relies on the quality of the model used to infer the binary parameters, including the model of the gravitational-wave signal. We use state-of-the-art waveform models to explore the impact of inaccurate modeling in measuring the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant for the upcoming and future ground-based gravitational-wave observatories. We diagnose the presence of inaccuracies within a hierarchical population-analysis framework, without a priori knowing the true value of the parameter, by assessing the consistency of the distribution of individual posteriors in relation to their measurement errors. Our findings indicate that even a small high-mass, spin-precessing subpopulation -- comprising as little as 5\% of the population generating the events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration so far -- can result in an unreliable measurement of the Hubble-Lema\^itre constant in the upcoming observing runs of these detectors, with even more pronounced effects expected in future facilities on the ground.</description>

      <title>Quantum modified inertia: an application to galaxy rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the field of modified inertia through a novel model involving maximal and minimal acceleration bounds. A principle of dynamics is developed within special relativity and has direct implications in astrophysics, especially for galaxy rotation curves. The presence of a minimal acceleration significantly reduces the amount of dark matter required to account for these curves. The model presented here is however conceptually different from fiduciary Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). The modified inertia with the minimal acceleration bound closely matches with many observed galaxy rotation curves and the radial acceleration relation, showing a better agreement than MOND in the $10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$ regime. Additionally, the minimal acceleration is predicted to evolve with redshift.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave propagation in bigravity in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a detailed analytical investigation of the propagation of gravitational waves in bimetric gravity in a late-time de Sitter epoch. In this regime, the dynamical equations for the massless and massive graviton modes can be decoupled and solved exactly. We provide uniform approximations for the modes in terms of elementary functions, which are valid on all scales and for all viable mass windows. We identify different dynamical regimes for the system, depending on the propagation properties of the massive graviton, and whether the massless and massive components of the signal can be temporally resolved or not. In each regime, we compute the gravitational-wave luminosity distance as a function of redshift and study the propagation of wave packets. Further, by an explicit computation, we show that the massless and massive components of the signal retain their coherence also in the regime where they can be temporally resolved, even when couplings to incoherent matter degrees of freedom are included.</description>

      <title>The Baby Universe is Fine and the CFT Knows It: On Holography for Closed Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big bang/big crunch closed universes can be realized in AdS/CFT, even though they lack asymptotically AdS boundaries. With enough bulk entanglement, the bulk Hilbert space of a closed universe can be holographically encoded in the CFT. We clarify the relation of this encoding to observer-clone proposals and refute recent arguments about the breakdown of semiclassical physics in such spaces. In the limit of no bulk entanglement, the holographic encoding breaks down. The oft-cited one-dimensional nature of the closed universe Hilbert space represents the limitation of the external (CFT) Hilbert space to access the quantum information in the closed universe, similar to the limitations imposed on observers outside a perfectly isolated quantum lab. We advocate that the CFT nevertheless continues to determine the physical properties of the closed universe in this regime, showing how to interpret this relationship in terms of a final state projection in the closed universe. We provide a dictionary between the final state wavefunction and CFT data. We propose a model of the emergence of an arrow of time in the universe with a given initial or final state projection. Finally, we show that the conventional EFT in the closed universe, without any projection, can be recovered as a maximally ignorant description of the final state. This conventional EFT is encoded in CFT data, and it can be probed by computing coarse-grained observables. We provide an example of one such observable. Taken together, these results amount to a clean bill of health for baby universes born of AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole Airy Tail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity, which is dual to a random matrix ensemble, the annealed entropy differs from the quenched entropy at low temperatures and goes negative. However, computing the quenched entropy in JT gravity requires a replica limit that is poorly understood. To circumvent this, we define an intermediate quantity called the semi-quenched entropy, which has the positivity properties of the quenched entropy, while requiring a much simpler replica trick. We compute this in JT gravity in different regimes using i) a bulk calculation involving wormholes corresponding to the Airy limit of the dual matrix integral and ii) a boundary calculation involving one-eigenvalue instantons, demonstrating consistency between these two calculations in their common regime of validity. We also clarify why a recent attempt to compute the quenched entropy using one-eigenvalue instantons is unreliable due to a breakdown of the saddle-point approximation for the one-eigenvalue instanton in the replica limit.</description>

      <title>Orbit method for Quantum Corner Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classification of the unitary irreducible representations of symmetry groups is a cornerstone of modern quantum physics, as it provides the fundamental building blocks for constructing the Hilbert spaces of theories admitting these symmetries. In the context of gravitational theories, several arguments point towards the existence of a universal symmetry group associated with corners, whose structure is the same for every diffeomorphism-invariant theory in any dimension.
  Recently, the representations of the maximal central extension of this group in the two-dimensional case have been classified using purely algebraic techniques. In this work, we present a complementary and independent derivation based on Kirillov's orbit method.
  We study the coadjoint orbits of the group $\widetilde{\mathrm{SL}}(2,\mathbb{R})\ltimes\mathbb{H}_3$, where $\mathbb{H}_3$ is the Heisenberg group of a quantum particle in one dimension. Our main result is that, despite the non-abelian nature of the normal subgroup in the semidirect product, these orbits admit a simple description. In a coordinate system associated with modified Lie algebra generators, the orbits factorize into a product of coadjoint orbits of $\mathrm{SL}\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$ and $\mathbb{H}_3$. The subsequent geometric quantization of these factorized orbits successfully reproduces the known representations.</description>

      <title>Vanishing Metric Commutation Relation and Higher-derivative De Donder Gauge in Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the equal-time commutation relations (ETCRs) among the time derivatives of the metric tensor identically vanish in the higher-derivative de Donder gauge as well as the conventional de Donder gauge (or harmonic gauge) for general coordinate invariance in the manifestly covariant canonical operator formalism of quadratic gravity. These ETCRs provide us with the vanishing four-dimensional commutation relation, which implies that the metric tensor behaves as if it were not a quantum operator but a classical field. In this case, the micro-causality is valid at least for the metric tensor in an obvious manner. This fact might be a manifestation of renormalizability of quadratic gravity in case of the canonical operator formalism.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Scaling Relations for SQM Stars with a Massive s-Quark in Gravitationally Strong Magnetic Fields under the Spherical Symmetry Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scaling relations with the bag constant parameter are investigated for Strange Quark Matter (SQM) stars in the presence of gravitationally strong magnetic fields minimally coupled with matter, considering both massless and massive strange quark scenarios. Assuming a simple model for such coupling under the approximation of spherical symmetry, a phenomenological scaling formula for the maximum mass of stars is derived as a function of the surface magnetic field and the strange quark mass. This formula is applicable for all formally admissible values of the free parameters, and strict scaling with the bag constant is retained only for a vanishing strange quark mass.
  As a byproduct of this study, the mathematical structure of the equation of state for the relativistic SQM model with a massive strange quark is revisited without approximations. It is observed that the contribution of the electron term to the energy density cannot be neglected in the theoretical limit of large strange quark masses. Consequently, the maximum mass of SQM stars increases with sufficiently large strange quark mass, contrasting with the behavior observed for low strange quark masses.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopoles: Theoretical Insights into the Cosmic Ray Conundrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high energy (UHE) photons above 10^{18} eV serve as valuable probes of fundamental physics. While typically produced in interactions involving charged particles, they could also originate from exotic sources such as annihilations of magnetically charged monopole-antimonopole pairs or decays of highly accelerated monopoles (10^{21} eV). Detecting such photons would impose constraints on monopole properties. Despite strong theoretical motivations and extensive experimental searches, no monopoles have been observed to date. A possible explanation beyond high monopole masses arises from Staruszkiewicz's quantum theory of infrared electromagnetic fields. His argument, rooted in the positivity of the Hilbert space norm, suggests that isolated magnetic monopoles may not be physically realizable. If correct, this would imply that while monopoles remain mathematically well-defined within field theories, only magnetically neutral configurations could exist in nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the numerical observation of a time crystal in a quantum black-hole laser (BHL), where the genuine spontaneous character of the symmetry breaking stems from the self-amplification of spontaneous Hawking radiation. The resulting Hawking time crystal (HTC) is characterized by the periodic dependence of the out-of-time density-density correlation function, while equal-time correlations are time-independent because they embody averages over different realizations with a random oscillation phase. The HTC can be regarded as a nonlinear periodic version of the Andreev-Hawking effect, signaled by anticorrelation bands resulting from the spontaneous, quantum emission of pairs of dispersive waves and solitons into the upstream and downstream regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: HF QPOs are among the most intriguing phenomena observed in LMXBs containing BHs or neutron stars. In this work, we investigate charged particles' dynamics in the nearby of a Schwarzschild-like BH embedded in a uniform magnetic field and surrounded on all sides by CDM. Thereby gaining deeper insight into the influence of magnetic and DM distributions on observable phenomena near compact objects. We first present a modified metric, which incorporates the effects of a CDM ...
  We compute the fundamental oscillation frequencies-radial, latitudinal, Keplerian, and Larmor-and demonstrate how their variation depends on the combined influence of CDM and magnetic field strength. The resulting frequency structure allows us to identify resonance radii associated with HF QPOs, particularly those in 3:2 ratios observed in microquasars. We assess several theoretical models for QPO generation, including the (ER), Relativistic Precession (RP), Tidal Disruption (TD), and Warped Disk (WD) models. A comparative fit of observational data from GRS 1915+105, H1743-322, XTE 1550-564, and GRO 1655-40 demonstrate that the TD and WD models provide the best match for HF QPOs in the presence of moderate magnetic flux ($B' = 0.1$), while the other models except ER fit better in weak-field scenarios.
  Our results highlight the importance of including both magnetic and dark matter (DM) effects in strong-field astrophysics and support the use of HF QPOs as sensitive probes of BH environments. This study opens new perspectives for exploring particle dynamics, accretion disk structure ...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work delves into the dynamical dark energy models of the wCDM parameterisation that are defined by their equation of state by comparing different, well-known parameterisation models, in an attempt to lessen the tensions of {H_0} and {\sigma_8} by using the latest observational data. This research also tested the newer Planck likelihood and BAO data by comparing them to their predecessors. The data that was used were: the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data of Planck 2018 and Planck 2020 data; Cosmic Chronometers (CC), a sample of Supernovae Type Ia; and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). A Bayesian analysis was performed to produce the results needed for the analysis. From the analyses, the best-fit values of the parameters show that almost all models are in favour of a phantom Universe. This study also showed that the new tested data constrained the models better than the previous ones, while also showing that the observation data supports the {\Lambda}CDM model over the dynamical dark energy models</description>

      <title>The Shape of Dark Energy: Constraining Its Evolution with a General Parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general dark energy (DE) model parametrized by its equation-of-state (EoS), featuring three free parameters: $w_0$ (the present-day value of the DE EoS), $w_{\beta}$ (quantifying the dynamical nature of the DE EoS), and $\beta$ (governing various dynamical forms of the DE EoS). The key controlling parameter $\beta$ can recover several existing DE models in the literature, such as the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization ($\beta = 1$), the logarithmic parametrization (in the limit $\beta \rightarrow 0$), and the linear parametrization ($\beta = -1$), alongside generate a class of new DE parametrizations for other values of $\beta$. The resulting DE scenario is constrained using a suite of the latest cosmological probes, including Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropies from three different experiments (Planck 2018 and Atacama Cosmology Telescope combined with WMAP), CMB lensing, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations from DESI Year 2, and PantheonPlus from Type Ia supernovae. Our analyses reveal that stringent constraints on the DE parameters are obtained only when all cosmological probes are combined; otherwise, some parameters remain unconstrained. The present-day value of the DE EoS remains in the quintessence regime according to our results, and no significant evidence for a dynamical DE EoS is found. However, based on the $\Delta\chi^2$ and Bayesian evidence analyses, we observe a mild preference for the present three-parameter DE parametrization over the CPL parametrization when all cosmological probes are taken into account. Nonetheless, the Bayesian evidence difference remains below the threshold for statistical significance according to the revised Jeffreys scale, indicating that both models are effectively equally preferred by the data.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of entropy in the universe is a fundamental aspect of cosmology. This paper investigates the evolution of entropy in a spatially flat $K=0$ universe, focusing on the contributions of matter, radiation, and dark energy components. The study derives the rate of change of entropy with respect to cosmic time, taking into account the scaling relations of energy densities and temperatures for different components. The analysis reveals the dominance of radiation entropy at early times, transitioning to matter dominance as the universe expands. The constant contribution of dark energy entropy throughout cosmic time is also considered. The paper acknowledges the limitations of the simplified model and the omission of entropy generation processes, emphasizing the importance of future research to incorporate these aspects. The results highlight the complex interplay between different components and provide insights into the dynamics of entropy in the expanding universe. This study lays the foundation for further investigations into entropy evolution, urging the consideration of more comprehensive models and numerical techniques to achieve a deeper understanding of the universe's thermodynamic behavior.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the plausibility of an interacting tachyonic scalar, homogeneous in nature, as a promising candidate for dynamic dark energy, offering insights into the observed accelerated expansion of the universe. The parameterization of the interaction between the tachyonic field, matter, and Hubble's parameter is performed linearly. The analysis focuses on fundamental cosmological parameters in a flat universe $(K = 0)$: expansion rate, universe age, energy density evolution for matter and the tachyonic field. The study also examines the coupling strength between the tachyonic field and matter, revealing a maximum value of unity when the interaction depends solely on their energy densities. Combining them also yields an upper limit of unity (precisely 0.7) for the coupling strength.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel unified Lagrangian density that combines the behaviors of tachyon, quintessence, and phantom scalar fields within the realms of theoretical physics and cosmology. The unified Lagrangian is formulated, where \(f(\alpha)\) is a function that accommodates different scenarios and captures the distinct characteristics of these scalar fields. The potential function \(V(\phi)\) is incorporated to account for the specific properties of the scalar fields. The study employs numerical simulations in Python to thoroughly analyze the dynamics of the scalar fields for various \(\alpha\) values, investigating the cosmological behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose utilizing entropy as a diagnostic tool to distinguish between constant and dynamical dark energy models. Entropy, a measure of the system's disorder or information content, captures the complexity and evolution of the universe. By analyzing the entropy measure over cosmic time, we can uncover distinct patterns and trends that differentiate constant and dynamical dark energy scenarios. By analyzing the entropy measure over cosmic time, we reveal distinctive patterns and trends that differentiate constant dark energy, such as the cosmological constant, from dynamical dark energy scenarios. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of entropy as a powerful tool to distinguish between these two classes of dark energy models, providing valuable insights into the nature of cosmic acceleration and advancing our understanding of the fundamental physics driving the universe's evolution. By deriving an entropy measure from the cosmic expansion history, we present a novel approach to distinguish between various dark energy scenarios. We establish the mathematical framework, analyze the behavior of the entropy measure for constant and dynamical dark energy models, and discuss the implications of our findings for deepening our understanding of the nature of dark energy.</description>

These three scalar fields can be described by a common single Lagrangian called generalized scalar field Lagrangian and corresponding scalar field termed as generalized scalar field. We obtain mathematically consistent forms of generalized equations of motion from which individual equations of motion of quintessence, phantom, and tachyon can be recovered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of coupling neutrinos to perturbed Rastall gravity, focusing on its impact on the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the associated tension between early- and late-universe measurements with MCMC and PINN method. Utilizing observational data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Cosmic Chronometers (CC), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernovae, CMB Lensing, we perform a detailed statistical analysis. Our findings demonstrate that the Rastall model provides an improved fit to the data compared to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, as indicated by lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values in both early and late-universe regimes. The model introduces a deviation parameter $\alpha$, which remains consistent with existing literature and differs across epochs, supporting a dynamic gravitational framework. Combining all datasets, the Rastall model yields $H_0 = 70.23 \pm 2.01$ km,s$^{-1}$,Mpc$^{-1}$, significantly reducing the tension with Planck ($1.34\sigma$) and SH0ES ($1.16\sigma$) compared to the $\sim 4\sigma$ discrepancy in $\Lambda$CDM. Additional dataset combinations confirm this alleviation, with Planck tensions consistently below $1.6\sigma$. Overall, our results highlight Rastall gravity with neutrino coupling as a promising alternative to $\Lambda$CDM, capable of addressing current cosmological tensions while aligning with observational data, it can be concluded that the Hubble tension may be resolved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02775v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of bulk viscosity on the accelerating expansion and large-scale structure formation of a Universe in which the underlying gravitational interaction is described by $f(Q)$ gravity. Various paradigmatic choices of the $f(Q)$ gravity theory, including power-law, exponential, and logarithmic models, are considered. To test the cosmological viability of these $f(Q)$ gravity models, we use {the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations ($BAO$) measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Survey, cosmic chronometers ($CC$) from Hubble measurements, the SNIa distance moduli measurements from the PantheonP + SH0ES, growth rate ($f$-data), and redshift-space distortions ($f\sigma_8$) datasets, the latter two once the linear cosmological perturbations, growth rate $f(z)$, and redshift-space distortion $f\sigma_8(z)$ are studied. Thus, we perform the combined analyses for: PantheonP + SH0ES, PantheonP + SH0ES + f, and PantheonP + SH0ES + $f\sigma_8$. We compute the best-fit values $\Omega_m$, $H_0\,\mathrm{(km/s/Mpc)}$, $r_d$, $M_{abs}$, $\gamma$, $\sigma_8$, $n$, $p$ and $\Gamma$ including the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$. Through a detailed statistical analysis, based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian / Schwartz Information Criterion (BIC), a statistical comparison of the $f(Q)$ gravity models with $\Lambda$CDM is made. Among the three $f(Q)$ models, only the non-viscous $f(Q)$ power-law model yields robust parameter estimates and substantial observational support without any outright rejections. In contrast, both exponential and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models (with or without bulk viscosity) are rejected by multiple model selection criteria.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present a set of binary neutron star (BNS) merger simulations including the net muon fraction as an additional degree-of-freedom in the equation of state (EoS) and hydrodynamics evolution using the numerical-relativity code BAM. Neutrino cooling is modeled via a neutrinos leakage scheme, including in-medium corrections to the opacities and emission rates of semi-leptonic charged-current reactions, although within the elastic approximation. We show that, for our particular choice of baseline baryonic EoS, the presence of muons delays the gravitational collapse of the remnant compared to the case where muons are neglected. Furthermore, when muons and muonic weak reactions are considered, no gravitational collapse occurs within our simulation time and muons are confined in the densest portions of the remnant, while the disk is effectively colder, less protonized and de-muonized. Accordingly, ejecta properties are affected, e.g., ejecta masses are systematically smaller for the muonic setups and exhibit a larger fraction of neutron-rich, small velocity material. Overall, our results suggest that the inclusion of muons and muon-flavored neutrino reactions in the context of BNS merger simulations should not be neglected, thus representing an important step towards more realistic modeling of such systems.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in Cotton gravity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: The framework of General Relativity (GR) has recently been expanded through the introduction of Cotton Gravity (CG), a theoretical extension proposed by J. Harada. This modified approach integrates the Cotton tensor into the gravitational field equations, naturally encompassing all conventional GR solutions while allowing the cosmological constant to emerge as an integration constant. In this study, we delve into the implications of CG when coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED), constructing and analyzing three distinct static, spherically symmetric configurations. Our investigation centers on the horizon structure, metric characteristics, and the underlying NLED Lagrangian density of each model. We also confront the theoretical predictions with observational data by comparing the calculated shadow radii of these solutions to constraints imposed by the Event Horizon Telescope's (EHT) measurements of Sgr A$^{*}$. The results reveal an extensive spectrum of spacetime geometries, ranging from multi-horizon structures to naked singularities. Furthermore, the agreement between the predicted shadow sizes and EHT observations reinforces the viability of these models in describing the astrophysical image of Sgr A$^{*}$ within certain parameter bounds.</description>

      <title>Circular orbits and accretion disk around a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the motion of neutral and electrically charged particles in the vicinity of a deformed-Schwarzschild black hole inspired by Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). To examine the motion of an electrically charged test particle, we propose an expression for electromagnetic 4-potential that contains the impacts of loop quantum gravity. This electromagnetic 4-potential satisfies approximately the covariant Maxwell's equations to first order in the loop quantum effects. We explore the effects of the loop quantum correction parameter on the particle geodesics. We investigate the innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) for both neutral and electrically charged particles in detail, demonstrating that the loop quantum parameter significantly influences on the ISCO radius, causing it to shrink. Finally, we explore the accretion disk around the loop quantum black hole. We delve into the electromagnetic radiation flux, temperature, differential luminosity, and the spectral luminosity as radiation properties of the accretion disk in detail. We show that the loop quantum correction parameter shifts the profile of the electromagnetic flux and accretion disk temperature towards the central object, leading to a slight increase in these quantities.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Equilibrium with Steady Flow and Relativistic Local Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A relativistic self-gravitating equilibrium system with steady flow as well as spherical symmetry is discovered. The energy-momentum tensor contains the contribution of a current related to the flow and the metric tensor does an off-diagonal component to balance with the flow momentum. The presence of the off-diagonal component of the metric implies the radial motion of the reference frame, which gives rise to a problem how the relativistic effect is included in thermodynamic observables for such a general relativistic system. This problem is solved by taking an instantaneously rest frame in which geometric thermodynamic observables read as previously and giving them the special relativistic effect emerged from the inverse transformation to the original frame pointwise. The solution of the thermodynamic observables in accord with the laws of thermodynamics and the theory of relativity is presented. Finally the relativistic structure equations for the equilibrium are derived, from which the general relativistic Poisson equation as well as the heat conduction one are developed exactly.</description>

      <title>York's Cavity Formalism and Quantum Modified Thermodynamics of (2+1)D Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the canonical thermodynamics of the non-rotating BTZ black hole within a finite cavity by incorporating quantum corrections using Barrow entropy. We derive analytic expressions for temperature, quasilocal energy, free energy, and specific heat, all evaluated at the cavity boundary by using York's formalism. While the redshifted temperature and energy stay the same despite the entropy changes, the altered entropy affects the thermodynamic landscape. Specifically, we see that the Helmholtz free energy drops faster as the horizon size increases. The specific heat shows clear peaks, and their position and height depend on the Barrow parameter. These features signal enhanced thermal responsiveness and a shift in the onset of black hole dominance. Our results demonstrate that quantum entropy corrections alone, without modifying the geometry, can yield rich thermodynamic behaviour in lower-dimensional gravity and highlight the effectiveness of York's framework in capturing such effects.</description>

      <title>Stability and Criticality Behaviors of Accelerating Charged AdS Black Holes in Rainbow Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the thermodynamical properties of accelerated charged Anti-de Sitter black holes in the context of rainbow gravity. Concretely, we compute the corresponding quantities needed to study the thermal stability and the critical behaviors including the phase transitions. Linking the acceleration parameter $A$ and the horizon radius $r_h$ via a constant parameter $a$, we discuss the $P$-$v$ criticality behaviors by calculating the critical pressure $P_c$, the critical temperature $T_c$ and the critical specific volume $v_c$ in terms of $a$ and the rainbow gravity parameter $\varepsilon$. As results, we reveal that the ratio $ \dfrac{P_{c}v_{c}}{T_{c}}$ is an universal number with respect to the charge. In small limits of the external parameters, we recover the Van der Waals fluid behaviors.</description>

      <title>Overlapping signals in next-generation gravitational wave observatories: A recipe for selecting the best parameter estimation technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Third-generation gravitational wave detectors such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer will have significantly better sensitivities than current detectors, as well as a wider frequency bandwidth. This will increase the number and duration of the observed signals, leading to many signals overlapping in time. If not adequately accounted for, this can lead to biases in parameter estimation. In this work, we combine the joint parameter estimation method with relative binning to handle full parameter inference on overlapping signals from binary black holes, including precession effects and higher-order mode content. As this method is computationally more expensive than traditional single-signal parameter estimation, we test a prior-informed Fisher matrix and a time-frequency overlap method for estimating expected bias to help us decide when joint parameter estimation is necessary over the simpler methods. We improve upon previous Fisher matrix implementations by including the prior information and performing an optimization routine to better locate the maximum likelihood point point, but we still find the method unreliable. The time-frequency method is accurate in 86% of close binary black hole mergers. We end by developing our own method of estimating bias due overlaps, where we reweight the single signal parameter estimation posterior to quantify how much the overlapping signals affect it. We show it has 99% accuracy for zero noise injections (98% in Gaussian noise), at the cost of one additional standard sampling run when joint parameter estimation proves to be necessary.</description>

      <title>Looking for Black Hole Morsels in Astrophysical Mergers via Hawking Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observation has provided numerous insights into the merger of astrophysical black holes. In contrast to other violent events (e.g. supernovae), they are, however, not expected to lead to significant emissions of photons and neutrinos. In this paper we discuss a scenario that would lead to characteristic observable gamma ray bursts, which would provide numerous hints to physics beyond General Relativity. Starting from the hypothesis that micro-black holes (called morsels) are formed during the merger process, we show that it is possible to observe their Hawking radiation, which takes the form of gamma ray bursts of a uniquely characteristic form: with energies in the TeV range, their temporal structure is unlike that stemming from any other astrophysical event. Notably, the time delay from the gravitational wave event is correlated to the mass distribution of the morsels. The integrated mass of the morsels, allowed by the unaccounted merger mass, leads to a Hawking radiation in photons that is above the sensitivity of atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes such as HESS, LHAASO and HAWC, and gamma ray space telescopes, such as Fermi-LAT. This renders the hypothesis of morsel creation experimentally testable, and we provide the first concrete bounds on the total mass of morsels formed in specific events.</description>

      <title>Gas-induced perturbations on the gravitational wave in-spiral of live post-Newtonian LISA massive black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dynamically coupling gas torques with gravitational wave (GW) emission during the orbital evolution of an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB). We perform hydrodynamical simulations of eccentric MBHBs with total mass $M=10^6~{\rm M}_\odot$ embedded in a prograde locally isothermal circumbinary disk (CBD). We evolve the binary from $55$ to $49$ Schwarzschild radii separations using up to 2.5 post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the binary dynamics, which allow us to follow the GW-driven in-spiral. For the first time, we report the measurement of gas torques onto a live binary a few years before the merger, with and without concurrent GW radiation. We also report the gas-induced orbital dephasing $\delta \phi_{\rm orb}\sim-0.007$ rad over $278$ orbital cycles that is likely driven mainly by disc-induced precession and LISA should be able to detect it at redshift $z=1$. Our results show how GWs alone can be used to probe the astrophysical properties of CBDs and have important implications for multi-messenger strategies aimed at studying the environments of MBHBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study stimulated emission and absorption of gravitons in a squeezed vacuum state immersed in a thermal radiation bath. Employing one-loop interaction-picture perturbation theory, we track the time evolution of the graviton number operator and its expectation value in the squeezed vacuum, which characterizes the inflationary graviton state. In a Minkowski background with a thermal bath as a toy example, we demonstrate that the net graviton emission or absorption rate depends sensitively on the initial squeezing parameters. As a thought experiment, we consider LIGO/Virgo-like detectors operating in radiation at temperatures of order 0.1 GeV and find that graviton occupation numbers at frequencies of order 100 Hz can be significantly enhanced, suggesting a novel mechanism for amplifying gravitational-wave signals. Although these conditions exceed current experimental capabilities, they point toward potential future advances in detection. Extending our analysis to an expanding, radiation-dominated universe, we show that subhorizon gravitons undergo stimulated absorption, while superhorizon modes exhibit secular logarithmic growth, indicating the breakdown of perturbative methods and motivating further investigation. These findings open a new direction for exploring graviton coherence effects in realistic cosmological and laboratory settings.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic corrections to near-extremal entropy of charged de Sitter black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the logarithmic temperature corrections to the thermodynamic entropy of four-dimensional near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m de Sitter (dS) black hole by computing a one-loop contribution within the path integral framework in the near-horizon limit. Due to the presence of three horizons, the extremal limit of a charged dS black hole is fundamentally different from its flat and AdS counterparts. In the near-horizon limit, there are three distinct extremal limits known as cold, Nariai, and ultracold configurations. We compute the tensor zero modes of the Lichnerowicz operator acting on linearized metric perturbations for the cold and Nariai extremal limits which are associated with near-horizon AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$ asymptotic symmetries. In particular in the near-Nariai limit we compute the quantum corrections to the Hartle-Hawking wavefunction at late times. Our computation establishes the result that at leading order, the small temperature corrections to the extremal entropy is universal in the cold and Nariai limit, paving the way for similar such computations and tests in higher dimensional dS black hole spacetimes, including rotating dS black holes.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Schwarzian Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we promote the global $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the Schwarzian derivative to a local gauge symmetry. To achieve this, we develop a procedure that potentially can be generalized beyond the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ case: We first construct a composite field from the fundamental field and its derivative such that it transforms linearly under the group action. Then we write down its gauge-covariant extension and apply standard gauging techniques. Applying this to the fractional linear representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, we obtain the gauge-invariant analogue of the Schwarzian derivative as a bilinear invariant of covariant derivatives of the composite field. The framework enables a simple construction of N\"other charges associated with the original global symmetry. The gauge-invariant Schwarzian action introduces $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge potentials, allowing for locally invariant couplings to additional fields, such as fermions. While these potentials can be gauged away on topologically trivial domains, non-trivial topologies (e.g., $S^1$) lead to distinct topological sectors. We mention that in the context of two-dimensional gravity, these sectors could correspond to previously discussed defects in the bulk theory.</description>

      <title>Null Distance and Temporal Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of null distance was introduced by Sormani and Vega as part of a broader program to develop a theory of metric convergence adapted to Lorentzian geometry. Given a time function $\tau$ on a spacetime $(M,g)$, the associated null distance $\hat{d}_\tau$ is constructed from and closely related to the causal structure of $M$. While generally only a semi-metric, $\hat{d}_\tau$ becomes a metric when $\tau$ satisfies the local anti-Lipschitz condition.
  In this work, we focus on temporal functions, that is, differentiable functions whose gradient is everywhere past-directed timelike. Sormani and Vega showed that the class of $C^1$ temporal functions coincides with that of $C^1$ locally anti-Lipschitz time functions. When a temporal function $f$ is smooth, its level sets $M_t = f^{-1}(t)$ are spacelike hypersurfaces and thus Riemannian manifolds endowed with the induced metric $h_t$. Our main result establishes that, on any level set $M_t$ where the gradient $\nabla f$ has constant norm, the null distance $\hat{d}_f$ is bounded above by a constant multiple of the Riemannian distance $d_{h_t}$.
  Applying this result to a smooth regular cosmological time function $\tau_g$ -- as introduced by Andersson, Galloway, and Howard -- we prove a theorem confirming a conjecture of Sakovich and Sormani (arXiv:2410.16800, 2025): if the diameters of the level sets $M_t = \tau_g^{-1}(t)$ shrink to zero as $t \to 0$, then the spacetime exhibits a Big Bang singularity, as defined in their work.</description>
