      <title>Optical and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy of the Outbursting Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared (NIR) observations of the outbursting, Halley-type comet 12P/Pons-Brooks. Three NIR spectra were obtained during two outbursts in October and November 2023, with the 3-meter Infrared Telescope Facility and the Palomar 200-inch Telescope, respectively. The NIR spectra exhibited absorption features at 1.5 and 2.0 $\mu$m, consistent with the diagnostic absorption bands of water ice, superimposed on a red dust-scattering continuum. We find that the absorption bands and the red continuum can be well explained by micrometer-sized crystalline ice at 140--170 K, along with sub-micrometer-sized refractory grains (e.g., amorphous carbon). In addition, an optical spectrum was obtained with the Lijiang 2.4-meter Telescope during the November 2023 outburst, which exhibited the emission bands of gaseous CN, C$_3$, C$_2$ and NH$_2$. The C$_3$/CN and C$_2$/CN ratios suggest that 12P/Pons-Brooks was ''typical'' in C$_3$ abundance but somewhat depleted in C$_2$. The specific kinetic energy of the 2023 November outburst is estimated to be $\sim8\times10^3$ J kg$^{-1}$, suggesting a likely triggering mechanism similar to 332P/Ikeya--Murakami and 17P/Holmes, i.e., the crystallization of amorphous water ice. A refractory-to-ice ratio of $\sim$1.7--3.2 is derived from the total mass loss of dust and gas, aligning with the lower-end estimates for 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and 1P/Halley. This suggests either a less evolved nucleus or an outburst region enriched in icy materials relative to the bulk nucleus.</description>

      <title>Resurgence of CO in a warm bubble around accreting protoplanets and its observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cold outer regions of protoplanetary disks are expected to contain a midplane-centered layer in which gas-phase CO molecules freeze-out and their overall abundance is low. The layer then manifests itself as a void in the channel maps of CO rotational emission lines. We explore whether the frozen-out layer can expose the circumplanetary environment of embedded accreting protoplanets to observations. To this end, we performed 3D radiative gas-dust hydrodynamic simulations, directly linking opacities and optical depths to the redistribution of sub-$\mu$m- and mm-sized dust grains. A Jupiter-mass planet with accretion luminosity $\sim$$10^{-3}\,L_{\odot}$ was considered as the nominal case. The accretion heating sustains a warm bubble around the planet, locally increasing the abundance of gas-phase CO molecules. Radiative transfer predictions of the emergent sky images show that the bubble becomes a conspicuous CO emission source in channel maps, appearing as a low-intensity optically thick spot located in-between the `dragonfly wings' that trace the foreside and backside line-forming surfaces. The emission intensity of the bubble is nearly independent of the tracing isotopologue, suggesting a very rich observable chemistry, as long as its signal can be deblended from the extended disk emission. This can be achieved with isotopologues that are optically thin or weakly thermally stratified across the planet-induced gap, such as C$^{18}$O. For those, the bubble stands out as the brightest residual in synthetic ALMA observations after subtraction of axially-averaged channel maps inferred from the disk kinematics, enabling new automatic detections of forming protoplanets. By contrast, the horseshoe flow steadily depletes large dust grains from the circumplanetary environment which becomes unobservable in the sub-mm continuum, in accordance with the scarcity of ALMA detections.</description>

      <title>Thermochemical models of outer core convection with heterogeneous core-mantle boundary heat flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermochemical convection in Earth's outer core is driven by the crystallisation of the inner core that releases latent heat and light elements. A key question in core dynamics is whether a stable layer exists just below the core-mantle boundary. Recent core convection simulations, accounting for CMB heterogeneities, propose locally stable regions (or regional inversion lenses, RILs) rather than a global layer, allowing both stable and unstable regions to coexist. In this study, we consider a suite of numerical simulations of thermal, chemical, and thermochemical convection models focussed on Ekman number ($E=10^{-5}$) with thermal and chemical flux Rayleigh numbers $\widetilde{Ra}_T=30-4000$ and $\widetilde{Ra}_C=30-100000$, and thermal and chemical Prandtl numbers $Pr_T=1$ and $Pr_\xi=10$. Analysis of purely chemical models reveals light element accumulation (LEA) below the CMB, resulting in either locally stable regions near the poles or global layers, depending on the strength of chemical forcing. These chemically stratified regions persist in our thermochemical models even if the thermal field is fully destabilising. The addition of a heterogeneous CMB heat flux leads to the formation of RILs driven by thermal stratification. Stable regions in these thermochemical models have varying locations, properties, and morphologies depending on whether thermal or chemical convection dominates. In the investigated parameter range, these RILs are O(100 km) thick, and their strength and thickness generally increase with the strength of thermal driving; they are comparatively less sensitive to the strength of chemical driving. Our simulations reveal a diverse range of possible stable regions and/or a global layer at the top of Earth's core, with a seismically plausible range of thickness and strength, which may also have a signature in geomagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>The planetary-mass-limit VLT/SINFONI library: Spectral extraction and atmospheric characterization via forward modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to deepen our understanding of the M-L transition on planetary-mass companions and isolated brown dwarfs, and search for evidence of possible differences between these two populations of objects. To this end, we present a set of 21 VLT/SINFONI K-band observations from five archival programs at a spectral resolution of 4000. We aim to measure atmospheric properties, such as temperature, surface gravity, and metallicity, to understand the similarities and differences between objects ranging from M5 to L5 in spectral type. We extracted the spectra of these targets with the TExTRIS code. Subsequently, we model them using ForMoSA, a Bayesian forward modeling tool for spectral analysis, exploring four families of self-consistent atmospheric models: ATMO, BT-Settl, Exo-REM, and Sonora. Here we present the spectra of our targets and the derived parameters from the atmospheric modeling. We observed a drop in effective temperature of more than 500 K as a function of spectral type at the M/L transition, likely related to limitations in the current atmospheric models. In addition, we report carbon-to-oxygen ratio measurements for three companions (2M 0103 AB b, AB Pic b, and CD-35 2722 b), which contribute to the growing list of exoplanets for which this value has been measured. In conclusion, the VLT/SINFONI Library highlights two key points. First, there is a critical need to further investigate the discrepancies among grids of spectra generated by self-consistent models, as these models yield varying results and do not uniformly explore the parameter space. Second, we do not observe apparent discrepancies in the K-band spectra between companions and isolated brown dwarfs, which potentially suggests that these super-Jupiter objects formed through a similar process; however, this warrants further investigation.</description>

      <title>On Dust Devil Diameters, Occurrence Rates, and Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a phenomenon that occurs on Earth and on Mars, the diameter of a dust devil helps determine the amount of dust the devil injects into the atmosphere for both worlds -- for a given dust flux density (dust lifted per area per time), a wider devil will lift more dust into the air. However, the factors that determine a dust devil's diameter $D$ and how it might relate to ambient conditions have remained unclear. Moreover, estimating the contribution to an atmospheric dust budget from a population of dust devils with a range of diameters requires an accurate assessment of the differential diameter distribution, but considerable work has yet to reveal the best representation or explain its physical basis. In this study, we propose that this distribution follows a power-law $\propto D^{-5/3}$ and provide a simple physical explanation for why the distribution takes this form. By fitting diameter distributions of martian dust devil diameters reported in several studies, we show that the data from several studies support this proposed form. Using a previous model that treats dust devils as thermodynamic heat engines, we also show that the areal density of dust devils (number per unit area) $N_0$ scales with the product of their thermodynamic efficiency $\eta$ and the sensible heat flux $F_{\rm s}$ as $N_0 \propto \eta F_{\rm s}$.</description>

      <title>A minor planet in an outer resonance with Uranus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have located archival observations of the centaur 2015 OU$_{194}$ from 2017 and 2018, which extend its data-arc length from 1.0 to 3.5 years. We show that it is in an outer $3:4$ mean motion resonance with Uranus, henceforth referred to as U$_{3/4}$. The resonance is stable from at least 1000 kyrs in the past till 500 kyrs in the future. We find no mention in the literature of known objects in this resonance, or in any other resonance between the orbits of Uranus and Neptune. Looking for additional candidates, we find that 2013 RG$_{98}$ also stays in U$_{3/4}$ for several hundred kyrs around the present epoch. A third candidate, 2014 NX$_{65}$, is strongly influenced by Neptune.</description>

      <title>Edge-On Disk Study (EODS) II: Thermal Structure of the Flying Saucer Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The dust and gas temperature in proto-planetary disks play critical roles in determining their chemical evolution and influencing planet formation processes. Aims. We attempted an accurate measurement of the dust and CO temperature profile in the edge-on disk of the Flying Saucer. Methods. We used the unique properties of the Flying Saucer, its edge-on geometry and its fortunate position in front of CO clouds with different brightness temperatures to provide independent constraints on the dust temperature. We compared it with the dust temperature derived using the radiative transfer code DiskFit and the CO gas temperature. Results. We find clear evidence for a substantial gas temperature vertical gradient, with a cold (10 K) disk mid-plane and a warmer CO layer where T(r) is 27 K at 100 au, dropping with exponent 0.3. Direct evidence for CO depletion in the mid-plane, below about 1 scale height, is also found. At this height, the gas temperature is 15-20 K, consistent with the expected CO freeze out temperature. The dust disk appears optically thin at 345 GHz, and exhibits moderate settling.</description>

      <title>Evaluating an Embryo Origin for Detached TNOs within Full Kuiper Belt Formation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With perihelia well beyond Neptune, but semimajor axes and eccentricities indicative of substantial perturbation, the origins of detached trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) remain a dynamical puzzle. In particular, detached TNOs with orbital inclinations below ~25 degrees are not easily generated from any known mechanism currently in the modern solar system. One notable hypothesis for the origins of detached TNOs is that a ~Mars- to Earth-mass planetary embryo detached the perihelia of these objects from Neptune during the process of Kuiper belt formation before the embryo itself was ejected. We numerically model this scenario via simulations of Kuiper belt formation from a primordial planetesimal belt that is dispersed through the migration of the giant planets. In addition to ~100,000 Kuiper belt objects, each of our simulations contains a hypothetical population of embryos in the primordial belt. We find that our embryos are unlikely to reach the high-perihelion, large semimajor axis orbit necessary to efficiently detach TNO perihelia from Neptune's influence. Moreover, embryos will typically take at least 100 Myrs to reach these unlikely orbits, at which point most of the primordial belt will have already been ejected by the planets, limiting the available population that can be detached. Finally, the TNOs that our embryos do detach consistently have a semimajor axis distribution that is more biased toward small values than observed detached TNOs have. Thus, we conclude that planetary embryos in the primordial Kuiper belt are not likely to have been the primary mechanism for the origin of detached TNOs.</description>

      <title>Causal Evidence for the Primordiality of Colors in Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origins of the colors of Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) represent a crucial unresolved question, central to understanding the history of our Solar System. Recent observational surveys have revealed correlations between the eccentricity and inclination of TNOs and their colors. This has rekindled the long-standing debate on whether these colors reflect the conditions of TNO formation or their subsequent collisional evolution. In this study, we address this question with 98.7% certainty, using a model-agnostic, data-driven approach based on causal graphs. First, as a sanity check, we demonstrate how our model can replicate the currently accepted paradigms of TNOs' dynamical history, blindly and without any orbital modeling or physics-based assumptions. In fact, our causal model (with no knowledge of the existence of Neptune) predicts the existence of an unknown perturbing body, i.e., Neptune. We then show how this model predicts, with high certainty, that the color of TNOs is the root cause of their inclination distribution, rather than the other way around. This strongly suggests that the colors of TNOs reflect an underlying dynamical property, most likely their formation location. Moreover, our causal model excludes formation scenarios that invoke substantial color modification by subsequent irradiation. We therefore conclude that the colors of TNOs are predominantly primordial.</description>

      <title>Detecting alien living worlds and photosynthetic life using imaging polarimetry with the HWO coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our Earth, being the only living planet that we know, provides us with clues that photosynthetic life-forms may be dominant on other exoplanets for billions of years. Spectropolarimetric signatures of the terrestrial photosynthetic life (PSLife) are well studied in the lab and remotely sensed with space and airborne instrumentation. An astonishing biosignature revealed by these measurements is an extremely strong linear polarization (tens \%) associated with broad absorption bands of biological pigments (biopigments) driving photosynthesis in various organisms. Also, unique circular-polarization signatures are associated with biopigments and other complex macromolecules as a sign of homochirality which is ubiquitous in terrestrial life forms. Thus, low-resolution spectro- or multi-band polarimetry of exoplanets directly imaged at an unprecedented contrast using the HWO coronagraph is a novel opportunity for a robust discovery of life on exoplanets. Here we propose to carry out two surveys and two follow-up observing programs. Survey 1 will identify potentially habitable planets (PHPs) through detection of atmospheres, clouds and liquid surface water (ocean) using linear polarimetry. Survey 2 will identify Living World (LW) candidates among PHPs by searching for strong linear polarization signatures associated with strong and broad absorption bands reminiscent of terrestrial biopigments. Follow-up program 3 will obtain multi-color surface maps of LWs, determine the distribution and abundance of alien photosynthetic organisms with exo-biopigments (exoBPs) and correlate their properties with the atmospheric and surface compositions. Follow-up program 4 will employ circular polarization to verify homochirality of exoBPs. This comprehensive approach aims at providing a quantitative answer to the ultimate question "Are we are alone in the Universe?".</description>

      <title>Ocean Tides on Asynchronously Rotating Planets Orbiting Low-mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets in the liquid-water habitable zone of low-mass stars experience large tidal forces, $10^3$ to $10^4$ times those on Earth, due to the small distance between the habitable zone and the host stars. Therefore, interior solid tides, ocean tides and atmospheric tides on these planets could be much stronger than that on Earth, but rare work has been done to explicitly simulate the ocean tides. Here, for the first time, we perform global ocean tide simulations and show that ocean tides on asynchronously rotating planets with large eccentricities can reach $\mathcal{O}(1000)\,\mathrm{m}$ in height and $\mathcal{O}(10)\,\mathrm{m\,s^{-1}}$ in flow speed. Interactions between tide and bottom topography can induce large energy dissipation, $\sim\mathcal{O}(100)\,\mathrm{W\,m^{-2}}$ in global mean. This tidal energy dissipation can strongly accelerate orbital evolution by 1-2 orders of magnitude. However, for planets with small eccentricities, the ocean tides are much weaker but still comparable to that on modern Earth. Our results suggest that ocean tides on eccentric planets orbiting low-mass stars are orders of magnitude more powerful than those on Earth and can dramatically influence surface geography and orbital evolution.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model for the dynamical evolution of planetary system II: Application to systems formed by a planet formation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard formation model of close-in low-mass planets involves efficient inward migration followed by growth through giant impacts after the protoplanetary gas disk disperses. While detailed N-body simulations have enhanced our understanding, their high computational cost limits statistical comparisons with observations. In our previous work, we introduced a semi-analytical model to track the dynamical evolution of multiple planets through gravitational scattering and giant impacts after the gas disk dispersal. Although this model successfully reproduced N -body simulation results under various initial conditions, our validation was still limited to cases with compact, equally-spaced planetary systems. In this paper, we improve our model to handle more diverse planetary systems characterized by broader variations in planetary masses, semi-major axes, and orbital separations and validate it against recent planet population synthesis results. Our enhanced model accurately reproduces the mass distribution and orbital architectures of the final planetary systems. Thus, we confirm that the model can predict the outcomes of post-gas disk dynamical evolution across a wide range of planetary system architectures, which is crucial for reducing the computational cost of planet formation simulations.</description>

      <title>Was Earth's water acquired locally during the earliest phases of the Solar System formation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the terrestrial water remains debated, as standard Solar System formation models suggest that Earth formed from dry grains, inside the snowline of the Proto-Solar Nebula (PSN). Here, we revisit this issue through the lens of computational chemistry. While the classically used snowline relies on a single condensation temperature, recent work in quantum chemistry shows that the binding energy of water on icy grains has a gaussian distribution, which implies a gradual sublimation of water rather than a sharp transition. We use the computed distribution of binding energies to estimate the radial distribution of adsorbed ice on the dust grains across the PSN protoplanetary disk. Our model reproduces the full range of estimated water abundances on Earth and matches the hydration trends observed in chondrite groups at their predicted formation distances. Thus, we suggest that a significant fraction of Earth's water may have been acquired locally at early stages of the Solar System formation, without requiring delivery from beyond the classical snowline.</description>

      <title>An Aligned Sub-Neptune Revealed with MAROON-X and a Tendency Towards Alignment for Small Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement of the sub-Neptune TOI-1759A b with MAROON-X. A joint analysis with MuSCAT3 photometry and nine additional TESS transits produces a sky-projected obliquity of $|\lambda|$= $4^\circ\pm18^{\circ}$. We also derive a true obliquity of $\psi$=24$\pm12^{\circ}$ making this planet consistent with full alignment albeit to $&lt;1\sigma$. With a period of 18.85 days and an $a/R_{*}$ of 40, TOI-1759A b is the longest period single sub-Neptune to have a measured obliquity. It joins a growing number of smaller planets which have had this measurement made and, along with K2-25 b, is the only single, aligned sub-Neptune known to date. We also provide an overview of the emerging distribution of obliquity measurements for planets with R$&lt;8$ R$_{\oplus}$. We find that these types of planets tend toward alignment, especially the sub-Neptunes and super-Earths implying a dynamically cool formation history. The majority of misaligned planets in this category have 4$&lt;$R$\leq$8 R$_{\oplus}$ and are more likely to be isolated than planets rather than in compact systems. We find this result to be significant at the $3\sigma$ level, consistent with previous studies. In addition, we conduct injection and recovery testing on available archival radial velocity data to put limits on the presence of massive companions in these systems. Current archival data is insufficient for most systems to have detected a giant planet.</description>

      <title>Exploring the habitability and interior composition of exoplanets lying within the extended habitable zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the habitability, internal structure and composition of exoplanets is crucial for understanding their potential to sustain life beyond our solar system. Characterizing planetary structures and atmospheric evolution provides valuable insights into surface conditions and the long-term habitability of these planets. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of exoplanets spanning from super-Earths to mini-Neptunes ($R_{\textrm{p}}$ $\leq$ 4 $R_{\oplus}$ and $M_{\textrm{p}}$ $\leq$ 15 $M_{\oplus}$) located within the extended habitable zone, along with parameterization of their host stars. We find that the planets in our sample orbit M dwarf stars and are tidally locked to them. Using archival photometric data from Gaia, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE, we estimate the atmospheric and physical parameters of the host stars. We also model the interior structure of these planets to infer their possible compositions. Additionally, under the assumption that these exoplanets can accrete a gaseous layer, we model the envelope fraction of the habitable exoplanets. With an Earth-like rocky composition, LHS 1140 b and TOI-1452 b can hold onto negligible amount of their initial gas layer. However, sustaining a sufficient amount of atmosphere over time, the planets LP 791-18 c, LTT 3780 c and K2-18 b are likely to be water worlds. The models suggest a water rich composition for TOI-1266 c without any significant amount of atmosphere. Modeling interior compositions and atmospheric escape scenarios allow us to assess the potential habitability of these planets by evaluating the likelihood of surface liquid water and the retention of stable atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Transfers linking Ballistic Captures to Earth-Moon Periodic Orbit Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of transfers to periodic orbits in the Earth--Moon system has regained prominence with NASA's Artemis and CNSA's Chang'e programs. This work addresses the problem of linking ballistic capture trajectories - exploiting multi-body dynamics for temporary lunar orbit insertion - with bounded periodic motion described in the circular restricted three-body problem (CR3BP). A unified framework is developed for optimizing bi-impulsive transfers to families of periodic orbits via a high-order polynomial expansion of the CR3BP dynamics. That same expansion underlies a continuous 'abacus' parameterization of orbit families, enabling rapid targeting and analytic sensitivity. Transfers to planar periodic-orbit families (Lyapunov L1 and L2, and distant retrograde orbits) are addressed first, followed by extension to spatial families, such as butterfly and halo L1/L2 orbits, with an emphasis towards Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs). Numerical results demonstrate low-cost solutions and validate the method's adaptability for the design of lunar missions. The optimized trajectories can inform an established low-energy transfer database, enriching it with detailed cost profiles that reflect both transfer feasibility and underlying dynamical relationships to specific periodic-orbit families. Finally, the proposed transfers provide reliable initial guesses for rapid refinement, readily adaptable for further optimization across mission-specific needs.</description>

      <title>On the formation of satellites in dense solid-particle disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single massive satellites are of great observational interest, as they can produce prominent and potentially detectable signatures. For terrestrial planets and super-Earths, giant impacts in the late stages of formation may generate dense self-gravitating disks - favourable environments for the formation of such satellites. Motivated by this, we explore satellite formation in dense solid-particle disks through three-dimensional N-body simulations, focusing on the effects of disk mass and the surface density exponent. Our results reveal significant variability in the masses and configurations of satellites formed under identical disk parameters, highlighting the stochastic nature of the process. Higher disk masses and flatter surface density profiles favour the formation of more massive satellites. Disks with masses above 0.03 planetary masses typically yield a single dominant satellite, while those between 0.003 and 0.03 tend to form two-satellite systems. On average, the mass of the largest satellite scales linearly with the initial disk mass, in agreement with analytical predictions. We estimate that a disk with a minimal mass of 0.03 planetary masses around a 1.6 Earth-mass planet orbiting a Sun-like star could form an Earth-Moon-like system detectable by telescopes with a photometric precision of 10 parts per million - a level achievable by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>On the convergence of N-body simulations of the Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most direct N-body integrations of planetary systems use a symplectic integrator with a fixed timestep. A large timestep is desirable because simulations run fast. However, simulations yield unphysical results if the timestep is too large. Surprisingly, no systematic convergence study has been performed on long (Gyr) timescales. In this paper we present numerical experiments to determine the minimum timestep one has to use in long-term integrations of the Solar System in order to recover the system's fundamental secular frequencies and instability rate. We find that timesteps of up to 32 days, i.e. a third of Mercury's orbital period, yield physical results in 5 Gyr integrations. We argue that the chaotic diffusion that drives the Solar System's long-term evolution dominates over numerical diffusion and timestep resonances. Our results bolster confidence that most simulations in the literature are indeed converged and provide guidance on how to run time and energy efficient simulations while making sure results can be trusted.</description>

      <title>A portrait throughout perihelion of the NH$_2$-rich interstellar comet 2I/Borisov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar comet 2I/Borisov is the first interstellar object where compositional characterisation was possible throughout its entire perihelion passage. We report all 16 epochs of a comprehensive optical observation campaign with ESO VLT's integral field spectrograph MUSE, spanning 126 days from 2019 November 14 to 2020 March 19. The spatial dust emission of 2I/Borisov was predominantly smooth, with no seasonal effect. A jet-like feature was consistently visible. The gas production morphology of its coma was also smooth and similar for C$_2$, NH$_2$, and CN: symmetric around the photocentre. The production rates of these species gently declined into and beyond perihelion, until 2I's outburst and splitting event in early 2020 March. C$_2$, NH$_2$, and CN production rates all increased, with NH$_2$ being the most significant; the dust emission also slightly reddened. 2I/Borisov is a carbon-depleted, relatively NH$_2$-rich comet when compared to those comets yet measured in the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Bounding destruction timescales of minor planets orbiting white dwarfs with the sesquinary catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical activity attributed to the destruction of minor planets orbiting white dwarfs has now been photometrically monitored in individual systems for up to one decade, long enough to measure significant cessation and re-emergence of transit features. Further, periodicities which hint at the presence of debris orbiting exterior to the white dwarf Roche radius, along with widely varying estimates for debris disc lifetimes (up to Myrs), complicate theories for the formation and dynamical evolution of these systems. Here, we illustrate that minor planets orbiting white dwarfs with periods of $\approx$5-25 hours and longer while completely or partially avoiding tidal disruption satisfy the conditions for the occurrence of the sesquinary catastrophe, a phenomenon that occurs in the solar system when impacts from returning ejecta from a moon are fast enough to be erosional to the point of destruction. We hence find that the region corresponding to $\approx$1-4 white dwarf rubble-pile Roche radii represents a danger zone where the collisional timescale for the sesquinary catastrophe to occur is $\sim 10^2-10^5$ yr, suggesting that debris discs around white dwarfs are in a state of semi-continuous replenishment.</description>

      <title>An Energy Perspective of Core Erosion in Gas Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Juno and Cassini have shown that Jupiter and Saturn likely contain extended gradients of heavy elements. Yet, how these gradients can survive over billions of years remains an open question. Classical convection theories predict rapid mixing and homogenization, which would erase such gradients on timescales far shorter than the planets' ages. To address this, we estimate the energy required to erode both dense and fuzzy cores, and compare it to what the planet can realistically supply. If the entire cooling budget is available to drive mixing, then even a compact core can, in principle, be destroyed. But if mixing is limited to the thermal energy near the core, which is another plausible scenario, the energy falls short. In that case, Jupiter can erode a fuzzy core by up to approximately $10~\mearth$, but a compact one remains intact. Saturn's core is more robust. Even in the fuzzy case, only about $1~\mearth$ is lost, and if the core is compact, erosion is negligible. The outcome depends sensitively on the assumed initial temperature and entropy profiles. Hotter and more superadiabatic interiors are more prone to mixing. We suggest that 3D simulations of convection driven from above, with realistic stratification and enough depth (i.e., many density scale heights) would be of great interest to further constrain the energy budget for core erosion.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Free-Floating Planetary-Mass Objects and their disks with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-floating planetary-mass objects (FFPMOs) are known to harbor disks at young ages. Here, we present 1-13 $\mu m$ spectra for eight young FFPMOs with masses of 5-10 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ (at ages of 1-5 Myr), using the NIRSpec and MIRI instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope. We derive fundamental properties of these targets, and find spectral types of M9.5 to L4, with effective temperatures of 1600-1900 K. The photospheric spectra of our targets show a clear diversity at similar temperatures, especially in the 3-5 $\mu m$ range, unaccounted for by existing atmospheric models. We find a silicate absorption feature in the photosphere of one of our targets, the first such detection in very young FFPMOs, indicating silicate clouds in their cool atmospheres. Six of our objects show mid-infrared excess emission above the photosphere, as well as silicate emission features, demonstrating the presence of disks. The shape and strength of the latter features constitute strong evidence of grain growth and crystallization, similar to what is seen in more massive brown dwarfs and stars. We also detect emission lines from hydrocarbon molecules in the disks of several targets. These are the lowest mass isolated objects found so far with silicate and hydrocarbon emission features arising in their disks. The presence of disks and their characteristics point to the potential for the formation of rocky companions around free-floating planetary-mass objects.</description>

      <title>Rossby number regime, convection suppression, and dynamo-generated magnetism in inflated hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters (HJs) are commonly thought to host the strongest dynamo-generated magnetic fields among exoplanets, up to one order of magnitude larger than Jupiter. Thus, they have often been regarded as the most promising exoplanets to display magnetic star-planet interaction signals and magnetically-driven coherent radio emission, which unfortunately remains elusive, despite many diversified observational campaigns. In this work, we investigate the evolution of the internal convection and dynamo properties of HJs via one-dimensional models. We explore the dependency on orbital distance, planetary and stellar masses, and types of heat injection. We employ one-dimensional evolutionary models to obtain internal convective structures. Specifically, we obtain the Rossby number $\mathrm{Ro}$ as a function of planetary depth and orbital period, after showing that tidal synchronization is likely valid for all HJs. When the heat is applied uniformly, the convective layers of almost all HJs remain in the fast rotator regime, $\mathrm{Ro} \lesssim 0.1$, except possibly the most massive planets with large orbital distances (but still tidally locked). We recover magnetic field strengths for inflated HJs by applying well-known scaling laws for fast rotators. When strong heat sources are applied mostly in the outer envelope and outside the dynamo region, as realistic Ohmic models predict, convection in the dynamo region often breaks down. Consequently, the heat flux and the derived surface magnetic fields can be greatly reduced to or below Jovian values, contrary to what is commonly assumed, thus negatively affecting estimates for coherent radio emission, and possibly explaining the failure in detecting it so far.</description>

      <title>Initial VLT/MUSE spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object to be discovered. Pre-perihelion measurements provide a unique opportunity to study its activity and composition, which may alter as it is heated in the coming months. We provide an initial baseline from optical spectroscopic observations obtained only two days after discovery, using the MUSE instrument on the VLT on 2025 July 3, while 3I was at 4.47 au from the Sun and 3.46 au from the Earth. These observations confirm the cometary nature of 3I, and reveal a red coma with a spectral slope of $(18\pm4)\%/1000$~\AA, redder than most Solar System comets but similar to the surface colour of some Solar System Trans-Neptunian Objects or Centaurs. We searched for but did not detect gas emission from C$_2$, NH$_2$, CN, and [OI], which is consistent with volatile non-detections for Solar System comets at this heliocentric distance. At present, the coma appears entirely dusty. Future observations of 3I as it comes closer to the Sun will provide an invaluable opportunity to witness the evolution of its activity, study its composition, test predictions of interstellar object population models, and compare 3I to Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS: discovery and physical description</title>

Abstract: We describe the physical characteristics of interstellar comet 3I\ATLAS, discovered on 2025 July 1 by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. The comet has eccentricity, $e$ $\simeq$ 6.08 and velocity at infinity, v$_{\infty}$ $\simeq$ 57 km/s, indicating an interstellar origin. We obtained g, r, i photometry with the Palomar 200-inch Next Generation Palomar Spectrograph on 2025 July 3. We measured colour indices g-r = 0.43$\pm$0.02 mag, r-i = 0.16$\pm$0.02 mag, and g-i = 0.59$\pm$0.03 mag and a spectral slope of 1.3$\pm$0.9 $\%$/100 nm. We calculate the dust cross-section within 10,000 km of the comet to be 230.0$\pm$5.2 km$^2$, assuming an albedo of 0.10. The FWHM of 3I\ATLAS's detection is $\sim$2.2 arcsec as measured in our r-band images and has A(0$^\circ$)f$\rho$ of 287.2$\pm$2.8 cm. Finally, we use the sunward extent of the coma to constrain the dust ejection speed, finding that \textmu m-scale to mm-scale particles have $\sim$0.01-1 m/s, implying the comet's dust mass-loss rate is $\sim$0.1 - 1.0 kg/s.</description>

      <title>White dwarfs as probes of extrasolar planet compositions and fundamental astrophysics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarfs represent the most common end stage of stellar evolution and are important for a range of astrophysical questions. The high-resolution ultraviolet spectroscopic capability of the Habitable World Observatory (HWO) offers a unique capability to characterize white dwarfs. In this documents, we focus on two specific science cases for HWO -- white dwarfs as probes of extrasolar planet compositions, and fundamental astrophysics. HWO will have the sensitivity to measure a suite of heavy elements, such as S, C, O, Fe, and Si, in a large sample of polluted white dwarfs to constrain the water content and the light elements in the cores of extrasolar planets. HWO can also be used to search for any small variation on the fine structure constant in the presence of strong gravity. Both science cases require a minimum resolving power of 60,000, and a ultraviolet coverage down to at least 900 Angstrom.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) offers a unique opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of planetary formation and evolution. The goal of this Science Case Development Document (SCDD) is to investigate the physical and chemical processes that shape the composition and atmospheric mass loss in exoplanets. We review the key observables currently known as diagnostics of mass loss via transit observations, i.e., absorption lines of escaping hydrogen (Lyman-alpha), helium, and metals (Fe, Mg, C, O). We also explore the challenges to infer planetary formation processes based on atmospheric composition characterization. HWO could enable a broad, continuous coverage from far-ultraviolet to near-infrared spectroscopy (~100--1600 nm) at high resolution (R &gt; 60, 000), which is essential to make these measurements, disentangle their planetary origin from stellar activity, and ultimately, contextualize the escape rates by simultaneously characterizing the composition, cloud predominance, and thermal structure of exoplanet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Detecting Surface Liquid Water on Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets with large bodies of water on their surface will have more temperate and stable climates, and such planets are the ideal places for life-as-we-know-it to arise and evolve. A key science case for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to determine which planets host surface liquid water. Aside from its implications for planetary climate and astrobiology, detecting surface water on terrestrial exoplanets would place important constraints on our theories of planet formation and volatile delivery. Rotational variability in the reflectance of an exoplanet may reveal surface features rotating in and out of view, including oceans. Orbital changes in reflectance and polarization, meanwhile, are sensitive to the scattering phase function of the planetary surface, including specular reflection from large bodies of water. Although these techniques are applicable to all temperate terrestrial exoplanets, we focus in this document on the directly-imaged planets that are more likely to drive the HWO coronagraph design. Identification of water oceans relies on detecting a liquid, and using other lines of evidence to narrow that liquid down to being water. Liquids have smoother surfaces than most solids, and hence exhibit specular reflection instead of diffuse reflection. In practice, this makes lakes and oceans look dark from most illumination angles, but mirror-like at glancing angles. HWO is uniquely capable of identifying surface liquid oceans via their optical properties. Given that discovering an ocean on an exoplanet would confirm its status as a habitable world, this science case is literally the raison d'etre of the Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>Building SPARCS, an Ultraviolet Science CubeSat for Exoplanet Habitability Studies, Technology Advancements, and Mission Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Star-Planet Activity Research CubeSat (SPARCS) is a NASA-funded 6U-CubeSat mission designed to monitor ultraviolet (UV) radiation from low-mass stars. These stars' relatively high-frequency and high-energy UV flares significantly affect the atmospheres of orbiting exoplanets, driving atmospheric loss and altering the conditions for habitability. SPARCS aims to capture time-resolved photometric data in the far-UV and near-UV simultaneously to better characterize the flares and detect the strongest and rarest among them. In addition, SPARCS is testing innovative technology, such as delta-doped detectors with near 100% internal quantum efficiency and detector-integrated metaldielectric UV bandpass filters. This mission will increase the technology readiness level of these critical components, positioning them for inclusion in future flagship missions like the Habitable Worlds Observatory. This paper outlines SPARCS' mission goals and provides an update as the spacecraft is completed and awaits its planned late-2025 launch to a sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit. It also highlights the critical role of small missions in providing training and leadership development opportunities for students and researchers, advancing technology for larger observatories, and shares lessons learned from collaborations between academic, government, and industry partners.</description>

      <title>Study of the atmospheric effects of energetic particle precipitations on giant planets with HWO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UV auroral emissions from giant planets are produced by extra-atmospheric energetic particles interacting with an atmosphere. They have been observed on Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus and should be present on Neptune. Even if the mechanisms are similar, each planet is unique due to its specific source of magnetospheric plasma and the structure and dynamics of its magnetosphere. How these precipitations modify atmospheric heating, dynamics and chemical balance at local and global atmospheric scale is still poorly known, especially on Uranus and Neptune, and critical to understanding the global atmosphere-magnetosphere system of giant planets and exoplanets. In this manucript we present how future observations by instruments, aboard \textit{the Habitable World Observatory} (HWO) will provide new information to better understand the origin and the atmospheric effects of these precipitations. A major interest is for the distant magnetospheres of Uranus and Neptune, never explored by an orbital spacecraft whose UV auroral emissions remains at (Uranus) or below (Neptune) the HST sensitivity. \textit{Pollux} is one such UV instrument concept, which will enable unprecedented high spectral resolution at fine spatial scale not previously seen and polarimetric observations of the planetary aurorae while \textit{LUMOS}, another UV instrument will image the full auroral regions with a good spectral resolution.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectra of Brown Dwarf Candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present an analysis of archival spectra of 200 sources toward the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) that were obtained with the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). I have used these data to assess cluster membership and measure spectral types for the targets. Fifty-three sources are classified as likely cluster members, 24 of which have spectral types that are suggestive of brown dwarfs ($&gt;$M6). Seven of the NIRSpec targets were previously identified as "Jupiter-mass binary objects" (JuMBOs), all of which are background sources rather than brown dwarfs based on the NIRSpec data. The spectral classifications of those objects are consistent with the results of my recent study of the JWST photometry in the ONC, which found that only a few JuMBO components have the colors expected for brown dwarfs, none of which form pairs that have uniquely wide separations or low masses relative to known binary brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Metallicities of M Dwarf Planet Host Stars from Kepler, K2, and TESS observed by APOGEE: Trends with Exoplanetary Radii and Orbital Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One important property in studying the exoplanet population is the host star metallicity ([M/H]). In this study, we derived stellar metallicities and oxygen abundances for 45 M dwarf stars (with 65 exoplanets) using the near-infrared high-resolution spectra from the SDSS APOGEE survey and synthetic spectra computed in LTE. We also investigated the exoplanetary radii distribution for a larger sample of 246 exoplanets orbiting 188 M dwarf stars. The [M/H] versus [O/M] distribution obtained indicates that our sample is composed mainly of thin disk stars, which follow the behavior of the low-alpha sequence in the Milky Way thin disk. Small planets with radii smaller than 3R$_{\oplus}$ were found around stars with a range of metallicities (-0.6$&lt;$[M/H]$&lt;$+0.3), while larger planets of the sample orbit only stars with [M/H]$&gt;=0.0$. These results indicate that while small planets can form in different environments, larger planets preferentially form in metal-rich protoplanetary disks. Exoplanets with P$_{\rm orb}&lt;$4.3 days orbit on average more metal-rich stars than planets with longer periods. This threshold is smaller than that found for FGK stars (8--10 days) and might be related to M dwarfs having a smaller dust sublimation radius. The distribution of exoplanets with R$_{\rm p}&gt;$4R$_{\oplus}$ shows a concentration at orbital periods between 2 and 5 days, which may result from inward orbital migration. There is also a different behavior between single-detected exoplanets and planets from multiplanetary systems, with the latter being found on average around more metal-poor stars, and with orbital periods roughly up to 3 days.</description>

      <title>A cometary Fluorescence Model for the $\nu_3$ Vibrational Band of Cyanogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18128v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyanogen ($\mathrm{C_2N_2}$) is suspected for a long time to be present in comets and to contribute to the creation of the CN radical. So far no observations with ground-based facilities have managed to detect this species but the Rosetta mission, thanks to in situ observations with the ROSINA mass spectrometer detected this species in the coma of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. To investigate its presence from infrared spectra in other comets, we developed a fluorescence model for the $\nu_3$ fundamental band. From new laboratory high-resolution infrared spectra of cyanogen, we analyzed the region of the $\nu_3$ band of $\mathrm{C_2N_2}$, centered around 4.63 $\mu m$ (2158 $\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$). In addition to line positions and intensities, molecular parameters for the ground and excited vibrational state were obtained. These parameters allowed us to develop a fluorescence model for cyanogen. Line-by-line excitation rates of the $\nu_3$ band of cyanogen in cometary comae are presented. An upper limit of the abundance of cyanogen in a spectrum of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is discussed.</description>

      <title>Enabling Robust Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals with Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric retrievals are essential tools for interpreting exoplanet transmission and eclipse spectra, enabling quantitative constraints on the chemical composition, aerosol properties, and thermal structure of planetary atmospheres. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers unprecedented spectral precision, resolution, and wavelength coverage, unlocking transformative insights into the formation, evolution, climate, and potential habitability of planetary systems. However, this opportunity is accompanied by challenges: modeling assumptions and unaccounted-for noise or signal sources can bias retrieval outcomes and their interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian Process (GP)-aided atmospheric retrieval framework that flexibly accounts for unmodeled features and correlated noise in exoplanet spectra. We validate this method on synthetic JWST observations and show that GP-aided retrievals reduce bias in inferred abundances and better capture model-data mismatches than traditional approaches. We also introduce the concept of mean squared error to quantify the trade-off between bias and variance, arguing that this metric more accurately reflects retrieval performance than bias alone. We then reanalyze the NIRISS/SOSS JWST transmission spectrum of WASP-96 b, finding that GP-aided retrievals yield broader constraints on CO2 and H2O, possibly alleviating tension between previous retrieval results and equilibrium predictions. Our GP framework provides precise and accurate constraints while highlighting regions where models fail to explain the data. As JWST matures and future facilities come online, a deeper understanding of the limitations of both data and models will be essential, and GP-enabled retrievals like the one presented here offer a principled path forward.</description>

      <title>Grand Design Spiral Arms in the Compact, Embedded Protoplanetary Disk of Haro 6-13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter continuum spiral arms have so far only been detected in a handful of protoplanetary disks, and thus we have a limited understanding of the circumstances in which they can form. In particular, substructures in small disks ($R\lessapprox 50$ au) have not been well-characterized in comparison with large disks. We present ALMA 1.3 mm continuum observations of the disk around the T Tauri star Haro 6-13 at a resolution of $\sim0.04''$ ($\sim5$ au). A pair of low-contrast spiral arms are detected at disk radii from $\sim10-35$ au. They can be approximated as Archimedean spirals with pitch angles ranging from $\sim10-30^\circ$. The low value of the disk-averaged spectral index between 1.3 and 3 mm ($\alpha=2.1$) and the high brightness temperatures suggest that the millimeter continuum is likely optically thick and thus may hide sufficient mass for the disk to become gravitationally unstable and form spiral arms. CO observations have shown that Haro 6-13 is surrounded by an envelope, raising the possibility that infall is facilitating spiral arm formation.</description>

      <title>(Re)-Defining Planets -- the Fundamental Plane of Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 6000+ exoplanets are now detected using various techniques, with estimates of billions of planets existing in our Galaxy alone. They are called super-Earths, hot Earths, mini-Neptunes, hot Neptunes, sub-Neptunes, Saturns, Jupiters, hot Jupiters, gas giants, ice giants, rocky, terran, subterran, superterran, and so on. This prompted the emergence of many recent works on taxonomy, or classification, of exoplanets. However, there is still no basic, fundamental definition of 'What is a planet?'. IAU has forwarded a definition in 2006 which, however, raised more questions than it solved. The first ambitious task here is to establish if there are limits on the size/mass of planets. The lower mass limit may be assumed as of Mimas - approximately minimum mass required to attain a nearly spherical hydrostatic equilibrium shape. The upper mass limit may be easier - there is a natural lower limit to what constitutes a star: ~0.08 SU. But then there are brown dwarfs: IAU has defined brown dwarfs as objects that exceed the deuterium burning limit (~13 JU), and giant exoplanets generally have masses of ~0.3 to ~60 JU. The resolution requires assembling the basic physical parameters that define planets quantitatively. Mass and radius are the two fundamental properties, and we propose to use a third correlated parameter: the moment of inertia. Based on this, we create the fundamental planet plane where the two parameters are correlated with the third, similar to a fundamental galactic plane. The fundamental planetary plane with turn-off point diagrams is constructed for the first time in this work. We define a planet as 'A celestial spherical object, bound to a star or unbound, that lies on the fundamental planetary plane, within a mass range between 0.02 EU to 13 JU'.</description>

Abstract: We report the serendipitous detection of the SO $J_N=6_5-5_4$ (219.949 GHz) rotational transition in archival Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the spiral hosting protoplanetary disks around CQ Tau (with $\approx4.9\sigma$ significance) and MWC 758 (with $\approx3.4\sigma$ significance). In the former, the SO emission comes in the shape of a ring, arises from the edge of the continuum cavity, and is qualitatively consistent, at the currently available spectral resolution, with being in Keplerian rotation. In the latter, instead, while arising primarily from inside the continuum cavity, the SO emission also extends to the continuum ring(s), and its morphology and kinematics are less clear. We put these sources in the context of the other protoplanetary disks where SO detections have been previously reported in the literature and discuss the possible origins of SO in terms of (thermal) desorption or formation in the gas phase. We argue that these processes might be fostered by dynamical perturbations caused by unseen embedded massive companions, shadows, or late-time infall, thus suggesting a possible link between perturbed dynamics and SO emission in (these) protoplanetary disks. If confirmed, our interpretation would imply that chemical evolution timescales could be significantly shorter in these systems than is commonly assumed, indicating that dynamical perturbations might influence the composition of newborn (proto-)planets by altering the volatile makeup of their formation environment.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Volatile Gas in the Giant Impact Disk around the 150-Myr old HD 23514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of CO$_2$ gas emission around HD 23514, an F5V star in the $\sim$150 Myr-old Pleiades cluster, hosting one of the rare giant-impact disks with unique mineralogy dominated by silica dust. We show that the dust feature remains stable over several decades, and that the sub-$\mu$m grains, which give rise to the $\sim$9 $\mu$m feature, are co-spatial with the hot CO$_2$ molecules within the sub-au vicinity of the star. Examining the Spitzer spectrum taken 15 years earlier, we show that the CO$_2$ emission was also present at 4.3 $\sigma$ significance. The existence of tiny silica grains and volatile gas requires special conditions to prevent the rapid loss caused by stellar radiation pressure and photodissociation. We explore several pathways explaining the observed properties and suggest that a past giant impact and/or stripping atmospheric event, involving large bodies with volatile content similar to the carbonaceous chondritic material, can simultaneously explain both the silica and volatile emission. Our discovery provides an important context for the amount of volatiles that a newly formed planet or the largest planetesimals could retain during the giant impact phase in the early solar system evolution.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Preliminary Characterization of a Third Interstellar Object: 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report initial observations aimed at the characterization of a third interstellar object candidate. This object, 3I/ATLAS or C/2025 N1 (ATLAS), was discovered on 2025 July 1 UT and has an orbital eccentricity of $e\sim6.1$, perihelion of $q\sim 1.36$ au, inclination of $\sim175^\circ$, and hyperbolic velocity of $V_\infty\sim 58$ km s$^{-1}$. We report deep stacked images obtained using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Very Large Telescope that resolve a compact coma. Using images obtained from several smaller ground-based telescopes, we find minimal light curve variation for the object over a $\sim4$ day time span. The visible/near-infrared spectral slope of the object is 17.1$\pm$0.2 %/100 nm, comparable to other interstellar objects and primitive solar system small bodies (comets and D-type asteroids), although this result is likely affected by some coma contamination. 3I/ATLAS will be observable through early September 2025, then unobservable by Earth-based observatories near perihelion due to low solar elongation. It will be observable again from the ground in late November 2025. Although this limitation unfortunately prohibits detailed Earth-based observations at perihelion when the activity of 3I/ATLAS is likely to peak, spacecraft at Mars could be used to make valuable observations at this time. Additional photometric, spectroscopic, and polarimetric monitoring of 3I/ATLAS by ground- and space-based telescopes, and possibly spacecraft based at Mars, are highly encouraged for characterizing 3I/ATLAS's rotational light curve, activity evolution, nongravitational acceleration, and compositional indicators of formation conditions.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmark brown dwarfs -- I. A blue M2 + T5 wide binary and a probable young [M4 + M4] + [T7 + T8] hierarchical quadruple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmark brown dwarfs in wide binary systems are crucial for characterizing substellar objects and calibrating atmospheric and evolutionary models. However, brown dwarf benchmarks with subsolar metallicity, very cool temperatures, or suitability for dynamical mass measurements are rare, limiting our understanding across the full range of mass, age, and metallicity. We present the discovery of two new multiple systems containing T dwarf companions, identified through a targeted search using CatWISE2020 and Gaia catalogues. L 122-88 AB is a wide binary comprising a mildly metal-poor M2 dwarf and a T5 dwarf, separated by 215.6 arcsec at a distance of 33.106+/-0.014 pc. Atmospheric model fitting to the near infrared spectrum of L 122-88 A suggests a mildly metal-poor composition ([Fe/H] = -0.2). UPM J1040-3551 AB is a candidate hierarchical quadruple system at 25.283+/-0.013 pc, consisting of a likely astrometric binary of two M4 dwarfs and a probable unresolved spectral binary of T7 and T8 dwarfs, separated by 65.48 arcsec from the primary. The H-alpha emission detected in UPM J1040-3551 A indicates an age range of 0.3-2.0 Gyr. This age estimate suggests that the T8 component has a mass between 9 and 28 Jupiter masses, potentially classifying it as a planetary-mass object. These systems augment the sample of benchmark brown dwarfs, particularly in the underexplored regime of cool temperature, providing valuable opportunities for refining our understanding of substellar objects.</description>
