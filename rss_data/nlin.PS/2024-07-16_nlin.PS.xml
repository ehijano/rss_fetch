      <title>The Lugiato-Lefever equation driven by a double tightly focused pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model of an optical cavity based on the one-dimensional Lugiato-Lefever (LL) equation, which includes the pump represented by a symmetric pair of tightly localized "hot spots" (HSs) with phase shift $\chi $ between them, and self-focusing or defocusing cubic nonlinearity. Families of bound states, pinned to the double HS, are found in the system's parameter space. They feature the effect of the symmetry breaking (SB) between peaks pinned to individual HSs, provided that the phase shift takes values $0&lt;\chi &lt;\pi $, and the LL equation includes the loss term. The SB, which is explained analytically, takes place in the full LL model and its linearized version alike. The same phenomenology is also explored in the framework of the LL equation with the double HS and quintic self-focusing. In that case, there are stable symmetric and asymmetric bound states, in spite of the presence of the background instability driven by the critical collapse.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal breather dynamics in microcomb soliton crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons, the distinct balance between nonlinearity and dispersion, provide a route toward ultrafast electromagnetic pulse shaping, high-harmonic generation, real-time image processing, and RF photonic communications. Here we newly explore and observe the spatio-temporal breather dynamics of optical soliton crystals in frequency microcombs, examining spatial breathers, chaos transitions, and dynamical deterministic switching in nonlinear measurements and theory. To understand the breather solitons, we describe their dynamical routes and two example transitional maps of the ensemble spatial breathers, with and without chaos initiation. We elucidate the physical mechanisms of the breather dynamics in the soliton crystal microcombs, in the interaction plane limit cycles and in the domain-wall understanding with parity symmetry breaking from third order dispersion. We present maps of the accessible nonlinear regions, the breather frequency dependences on third order dispersion and avoided mode crossing strengths, and the transition between the collective breather spatiotemporal states. Our range of measurements matches well with our first-principles theory and nonlinear modeling. To image these soliton ensembles and their breathers, we further constructed panoramic temporal imaging for simultaneous fast and slow axis two dimensional mapping of the breathers. In the phase differential sampling, we present two dimensional evolution maps of soliton crystal breathers, including with defects, in both stable breathers and breathers with drift. Our fundamental studies contribute to the understanding of nonlinear dynamics in soliton crystal complexes, their spatiotemporal dependences, and their stability-existence zones.</description>

      <title>Stability and dynamics of massive vortices in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of structures involving vortices in one component and bright solitary waves in another has a time-honored history in two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. In the present work, we revisit this topic extending considerations well-past the near-integrable regime of nearly equal scattering lengths. Instead, we focus on stationary states and spectral stability of such structures for large values of the inter-component interaction coefficient. We find that the state can manifest dynamical instabilities for suitable parameter values. We also explore a phenomenological, yet quantitatively accurate upon suitable tuning, particle model which, in line also with earlier works, offers the potential of accurately following the associated stability and dynamical features. Finally, we probe the dynamics of the unstable vortex-bright structure, observing an unprecedented, to our knowledge, instability scenario in which the oscillatory instability leads to a patch of vorticity that harbors and eventually ejects multiple vortex-bright structures.</description>

      <title>Stability of Breathers for a Periodic Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of breather type solutions, i.e., periodic in time, exponentially localized in space solutions, is a very unusual feature for continuum, nonlinear wave type equations. Following an earlier work [Comm. Math. Phys. {\bf 302}, 815-841 (2011)], establishing a theorem for the existence of such structures, we bring to bear a combination of analysis-inspired numerical tools that permit the construction of such wave forms to a desired numerical accuracy. In addition, this enables us to explore their numerical stability. Our computations show that for the spatially heterogeneous form of the $\phi^4$ model considered herein, the breather solutions are generically found to be unstable. Their instability seems to generically favor the motion of the relevant structures. We expect that these results may inspire further studies towards the identification of stable continuous breathers in spatially-heterogeneous, continuum nonlinear wave equation models.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study establishes a non-Bloch band theory for time-modulated discrete mechanical systems. We consider simple mass-spring chains whose stiffness is periodically modulated in time. Using the temporal Floquet theory, the system is characterized by linear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier coefficients. This allows us to employ a standard linear eigenvalue analysis. Unlike non-modulated linear systems, the time modulation makes the coefficient matrix non-Hermitian, which gives rise to, for example, parametric resonance, non-reciprocal wave transmission, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In particular, we study finite-length chains consisting of spatially periodic mass-spring units and show that the standard Bloch band theory is not valid for estimating their eigenvalue distribution. To remedy this, we propose a non-Bloch band theory based on a generalized Brillouin zone. The proposed theory is verified by some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Floquet valley Hall edge solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce traveling Floquet valley Hall edge solitons in a genuinely continuous system consisting of a waveguide array with a dynamically varying domain wall between two honeycomb structures exhibiting broken inversion symmetry. Inversion symmetry in our system is broken due to periodic and out-of-phase longitudinal modulation of the refractive index applied to the constituent sublattices of the honeycomb structure. By combining two honeycomb arrays with different initial phases of refractive index modulation we create a dynamically changing domain wall that supports localized linear Floquet edge states despite the fact that on average two sublattices in each honeycomb structure forming the domain wall have the same refractive index. In the presence of focusing nonlinearity, bright or dark Floquet edge solitons may bifurcate from such linear Floquet edge states. We numerically identified a family of these solitons and compared them with the results obtained from the analytical approach, which involved averaging over one longitudinal period in the evolution coordinate. These solitons exhibit localization in both spatial directions - along the interface due to nonlinear self-action and across the interface as the edge states - that allows them to travel along the domain wall over long distances without noticeable shape variations.</description>

      <title>Structural Dynamics of Contractile Injection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of many macromolecular machines is characterized by chemically-mediated structural changes that achieve large scale functional deployment through local rearrangements of constitutive protein sub-units. Motivated by recent high resolution structural microscopy of a particular class of such machines, contractile injection systems (CIS), we construct a coarse grained semi-analytical model that recapitulates the geometry and bistable mechanics of CIS in terms of a minimal set of measurable physical parameters. We use this model to predict the size, shape and speed of a dynamical actuation front that underlies contraction. Scaling laws for the velocity and physical extension of the contraction front are consistent with our numerical simulations, and may be generally applicable to related systems.</description>

      <title>Solitons with Self-induced Topological Nonreciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Schrodinger equation supports solitons -- self-interacting, localized states that behave as nearly independent objects. We exhibit solitons with self-induced nonreciprocal dynamics in a discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation. This nonreciprocal behavior, dependent on soliton power, arises from the interplay between linear and nonlinear terms in the equations of motion. Initially stable at high power, solitons exhibit nonreciprocal instabilities as power decreases, leading to unidirectional acceleration and amplification. This behavior is topologically protected by winding numbers on the solitons' mean-field Hamiltonian and their stability matrix, linking nonlinear dynamics and point gap topology in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>
