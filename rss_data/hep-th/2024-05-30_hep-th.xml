      <title>Magnetic Braneworlds: Cosmology and Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct 4D flat Big Bang-Big Crunch cosmologies and Anti-de Sitter (AdS) planar eternally traversable wormholes using braneworlds embedded in asymptotically AdS${}_5$ spacetimes. The background geometries are the AdS${}_5$ magnetic black brane and the magnetically charged AdS${}_5$ soliton, respectively. The two setups arise from different analytic continuations of the same saddle of the gravitational Euclidean path integral, in which the braneworld takes the form of a Maldacena-Maoz Euclidean wormhole. We show the existence of a holographic dual description of this setup in terms of a microscopic Euclidean boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) on a strip. By analyzing the BCFT Euclidean path integral, we show that the braneworld cosmology is encoded in a pure excited state of a CFT dual to a black brane microstate, whereas the braneworld wormhole is encoded in the ground state of the BCFT. The latter confines in the IR, and we study its confining properties using holography. We also comment on the properties of bulk reconstruction in the two Lorentzian pictures and their relationship via double analytic continuation. This work can be interpreted as an explicit, doubly-holographic realization of the relationship between cosmology, traversable wormholes, and confinement in holography, first proposed in arXiv:2102.05057, arXiv:2203.11220.</description>

      <title>On the deep superstring spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a covariant method of constructing entire trajectories of physical states in superstring theory in the critical dimension. It is inspired by a recently developed covariant technology of excavating bosonic string trajectories, that is facilitated by the observation that the Virasoro constraints can be written as linear combinations of lowering operators of a bigger algebra, namely a symplectic algebra, which is Howe dual to the spacetime Lorentz algebra. For superstrings, it is the orthosymplectic algebra that appears instead, with its lowest weight states forming the simplest class of physical trajectories in the NS sector. To construct the simplest class in the R sector, the lowest weight states need to be supplemented with other states, which we determine. Deeper trajectories are then constructed by acting with suitable combinations of the raising operators of the orthosymplectic algebra, which we illustrate with several examples.</description>

      <title>Emergent Time in Hamiltonian General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a definition of time that emerges in terms of the geometry of the configuration space of a dynamical system. We illustrate this, using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, in various examples: particle mechanics on a fixed energy surface; non-Abelian gauge theories for compact semi-simple Lie groups where the Gauss law presents new features; and General Relativity in $d+1$ dimensions with $d$ the dimension of space. The discussion in General Relativity is like the non-abelian gauge theory case except for the indefiniteness of the de Witt metric in the Einstein-Hamilton-Jacobi equation, which we discuss in some detail. We illustrate the general formula for the emergent time in various examples including de Sitter spacetime and asymptotically AdS spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Higher gauge theory and integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of integrable systems from a gauge theoretic perspective. This development originated with the introduction of $4$d Chern-Simons theory with defects, which provided a systematic framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach to studying higher-dimensional integrable models employing techniques from higher category theory. Starting with higher Chern-Simons theory on the $4$-manifold $\mathbb{R}\times Y$, we complexify and compactify the real line to $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and introduce the disorder defect $\omega=z^{-1}\mathrm{d} z $. This procedure defines a holomorphic five-dimensional variant of higher Chern-Simons theory, which, when endowed with suitable boundary conditions, allows for the localisation to a three-dimensional theory on $Y$. The equations of motion of the resulting model are equivalent to the flatness of a $2$-connection $(L,H)$, that we then use to construct the corresponding higher holonomies. We prove that these are invariants of homotopies relative boundary, which enables the construction of conserved quantities. The latter are labelled by both the categorical characters of a Lie crossed-module and the infinite number of homotopy classes of surfaces relative boundary in $Y$. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the $3$d theory has left and right acting symmetries whose current algebra is given by an infinite dimensional centrally extended affine Lie 2-algebra. Both of these conditions are direct higher homotopy analogues of the properties satisfied by the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten CFT, which we therefore interpret as facets of integrable structures.</description>

      <title>Dark energy due to quantum corrections to effective potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we calculate quantum corrections to the effective potential in different models of inflationary cosmology. We show that quantum corrections lead to a modification of the initial potential uplifting its value at the minimum, which can be interpreted as a cosmological constant/dark energy. We concentrate on the models of $\alpha$-attractors and show that one can naturally get small values of the cosmological constant. In the model of quintessence, the same mechanism modifies the value of dark energy at the present time.</description>

      <title>Quantum gravity signatures in gravitational wave detectors placed inside a harmonic trap potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general gravitational wave detector of gravitational wave interacting with an incoming gravitational wave carrying plus polarization only placed inside a harmonic trap. This model can be well acquainted with the description of a resonant detector of gravitational wave as well. The well known detector-gravitational wave interaction scenario uses the method of a semi classical approach where the detector is treated quantum mechanically but the gravitational wave is considered at a classical level. In our analysis, we use a discrete mode decomposition of the gravitational wave perturbation which results in a Hamiltonian involving the position and momentum operators corresponding to the gravitational wave and the harmonic oscillator. We have then calculated the transition probability for the harmonic oscillator-gravitational wave tensor product state for going from an initial state to some unknown final state. Using the energy flux relation of the gravitational waves, we observe that if we consider the total energy as a combination of the number of gravitons in the initial state of the detector then the transition probability for the resonant absorption case scenario takes the analytical form which is exactly similar to the semi-classical absorption case. In case of the emission scenario, we observe a spontaneous emission of a single graviton which was completely absent in the semi-classical analouge of this model. This therefore gives a direct signature of linearized quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>BRST Covariant Phase Space and Holographic Ward Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an enlarged BRST framework to treat the large gauge transformations of a given quantum field theory. It determines the associated infinitely many Noether charges stemming from a gauge fixed and BRST invariant Lagrangian, a result that cannot be obtained from Noether's second theorem. The geometrical significance of this result is highlighted by the construction of a trigraded BRST covariant phase space, allowing a BRST invariant gauge fixing procedure. This provides an appropriate framework for determining the conserved BRST Noether current of the global BRST symmetry and the associated global Noether charges. The latter are found to be equivalent with the usual classical corner charges of large gauge transformations. It allows one to prove the gauge independence of their physical effects at the perturbative quantum level. In particular, the underlying BRST fundamental canonical relation provides the same graded symplectic brackets as in the classical covariant phase space. A unified Lagrangian Ward identity for small and large gauge transformations is built. It consistently decouples into a bulk part for small gauge transformations, which is the standard BRST--BV quantum master equation, and a boundary part for large gauge transformations. The boundary part provides a perturbation theory origin for the invariance of the Hamiltonian physical $\mathcal{S}$-matrix under asymptotic symmetries. Holographic anomalies for the boundary Ward identity are studied and found to be solutions of a codimension one Wess--Zumino consistency condition. Such solutions are studied in the context of extended BMS symmetry. Their existence clarifies the status of the $1$-loop correction to the subleading soft graviton theorem.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Condensates on the Coulomb Branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study correlation functions on the Coulomb branch of planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ super-Yang- Mills theory (SYM), and their relationship with integrability, the operator product expansion (OPE), the sum rule, the large charge expansion, and holography. First, we compute one-point functions of arbitrary scalar operators at weak coupling and derive a compact spin-chain representation. We next study the two-point functions of chiral primaries at one loop and find that the radius of convergence of OPE in position space is infinite. We estimate the asymptotic growth of the OPE data based on this finding. Finally, we propose a concrete nonperturbative formula that connects the correlation functions on the Coulomb branch with the correlation functions with large charge insertions at the conformal point and provide a holographic interpretation based on a large D3-brane in AdS. The formula extends the known connection between the large charge sector and the Coulomb branch for rank-1 theories to the large $N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Representations of Higher-Dimensional Topological Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 3D spacetime, topologically ordered phases of matter feature emergent particles called anyons, whose properties like fusion rules and braiding statistics are schematically represented by diagrams. Important consistency conditions, such as pentagon and hexagon relations, are encoded in diagrams. In 4D and higher spacetimes, topological orders support not only point-like particles but also spatially extended excitations, such as loops and membranes, allowing for diverse topological data about braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes. Recently, these topological data have been explored through the path-integral formalism of topological quantum field theory. Analogous to the counterpart in 3D, in this work, we construct diagrammatic representations of higher-dimensional (4D and 5D) topological orders. We introduce basic fusion and shrinking diagrams and treat them as vectors in corresponding spaces, then build complex diagrams by stacking these basic diagrams. Within the same vector spaces, we use $F$-, $\Delta$-, and $\Delta^2$-symbols to transform between different bases. From these transformations, we derive consistency conditions like \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations}, which describe the consistent coexistence of fusion and shrinking data. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions, with violations indicating a quantum anomaly. This work opens several promising avenues for future research such as the exploration of diagrammatic representations of braiding processes in higher dimensions as well as implications for noninvertible symmetries and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT).</description>

      <title>Hilbert Series of Bipartite Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the algebraic structure of the mesonic moduli spaces of bipartite field theories by computing the Hilbert series. Bipartite field theories form a large family of 4d N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories that are defined by bipartite graphs on Riemann surfaces with boundaries. By calculating the Hilbert series, we are able to identify the generators and defining generator relations of the mesonic moduli spaces of these theories. Moreover, we show that certain bipartite field theories exhibit enhanced global symmetries which can be identified through the computation of the corresponding refined Hilbert series. As part of our study, we introduce two one-parameter families of bipartite field theories defined on cylinders whose mesonic moduli spaces are all complete intersection toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds.</description>

      <title>The $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ duality and the non-invertible $U(1)$ symmetry of Maxwell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent proposals for the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) of Maxwell theory admit a 0-form symmetry compatible with the classical $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$ duality of electromagnetism. We describe how to realize these automorphisms of the SymTFT in terms of its operators and we detail their effects on the dynamical theory and its global variants. In the process, we show that the classical $U(1)$ symmetry, corresponding to the stabilizer of $SL_2(\mathbb{R})$, can be restored as a non-invertible one, by means of an infinite series of discrete gauging. This provides an example of the reemergence of a classical symmetry in the quantum regime, which was not broken by anomalies, but rather by the quantization of electromagnetic fluxes. However, this procedure comes at the price of introducing "continuous" condensates that trivialize all line operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the microscopic behavior of spacetime is critical for developing a theory of quantum gravity and perhaps solving the cosmological constant problem. In this context, it has been proposed that the quantity of interest is the quantum uncertainty in the Ricci scalar and here we investigate this for a discrete baby quantum gravity model based a single square cell. We find that the averaged Ricci scalar vanishes to leading order but has UV-divergent fluctuations. While this behavior is stable under renormalization, it appears not to be under the introduction of a small cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose symbolic regression as a powerful tool for studying Beyond the Standard Model physics. As a benchmark model, we consider the so-called Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which has a four-dimensional parameter space defined at the GUT scale. We provide a set of analytical expressions that reproduce three low-energy observables of interest in terms of the parameters of the theory: the Higgs mass, the contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and the cold dark matter relic density. To demonstrate the power of the approach, we employ the symbolic expressions in a global fits analysis to derive the posterior probability densities of the parameters, which are obtained extremely rapidly in comparison with conventional methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Catalysis is a known proposal for inducing dynamical axionic gapped phases by means of external magnetic fields from a Weyl or Dirac semimetal phase. At finite Fermi level, the phase transition is of first order type and the magnetic field needs to reach a critical value for the transition to take place. Using the theory of bubble nucleation, we predict the order parameter features a hysteretic behavior as a function of the external magnetic field. We also analyze the experimental consequences of this hysteretic behavior in several observables like magneto-conductivity, magnetic susceptibility and nonlinear optical coefficients. This hysteretic behavior might serve as a fingerprint of Magnetic Catalysis in Condensed Matter systems.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star mergers in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of black hole-neutron star binaries, particularly those where the black hole has a lower mass compared to other observed systems, have the potential to place strong constraints on modifications to general relativity that arise at small curvature length scales. Here we study the dynamics of black hole-neutron star mergers in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, a representative example of such a theory, by numerically evolving the full equations of motion. We consider quasi-circular binaries with different mass-ratios that are consistent with recent gravitational wave observations, including cases with and without tidal disruption of the star, and quantify the impact of varying the coupling controlling deviations from general relativity on the gravitational wave signal and scalar radiation. We find that the main effect on the late inspiral is the accelerated frequency evolution compared to general relativity, and that--even considering Gauss-Bonnet coupling values approaching those where the theory breaks down--the impact on the merger gravitational wave signal is mild, predominately manifesting as a small change in the amplitude of the ringdown. We compare our results to current post-Newtonian calculations and find consistency throughout the inspiral.</description>

      <title>Exploring waveforms with non-GR deviations for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental process of detecting and examining the polarization modes of gravitational waves plays a pivotal role in enhancing our grasp on the precise mechanisms behind their generation. A thorough investigation is essential for delving deeper into the essence of gravitational waves and rigorously evaluating and validating the range of modified gravity theories. In this line of interest, a general description of black holes in theories beyond general relativity can serve a meaningful purpose where distinct deviation parameters can be mapped to solutions representing distinct theories. Employing a refined version of the deformed Kerr geometry, which is free from pathological behaviours such as unphysical divergences in the metric, we explore an extreme mass-ratio inspiral system, wherein a stellar-mass object perturbs a supermassive black hole. We compute the effects of deformation parameters on gravitational wave fluxes, orbital evolution and phase dynamics with leading order post-Newtonian corrections. With the waveform analysis, we assess the plausibility of detecting deviations from general relativity through observations facilitated by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), simultaneously constraining the extent of these deviations. Therefore, this analysis provides an understanding while highlighting the essential role of observations in advancing gravitational phenomena beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Anomalous and linear holographic hard wall models for light unflavored mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider anomalous and linear holographic hard wall (HW) models for light unflavored mesons inspired by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The anomalous dimensions depend on the logarithm of the spin $S$ of the meson state and come from a semiclassical analysis of gauge/string duality. The anomalous HW model produces very good masses and good Regge trajectories for mesons compared with PDG data. Inspired by this anomalous HW model we also propose a phenomenological modification of the dimension of the boundary operators such that the model produces asymptotic linear Regge trajectories.</description>

      <title>Monopoles and Fermions in the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider all magnetic monopoles that could have settled in the Standard Model after descending from a generic microscopic theory. These monopoles have Standard Model quantum numbers, are stable, and we also require that their magnetic fluxes are consistent with the electroweak symmetry breaking. Scattering processes involving quarks, leptons and protons on these monopoles are studied using partial waves decomposition. These processes in the lowest partial wave are known to be unsuppressed by the monopole mass and are relevant for monopole catalysis of proton decay. We provide estimates for scattering cross-sections and investigate and confirm the applicability of the twisted sector approach to scattering processes on these Standard Model monopoles.</description>

      <title>Locating Quark-Antiquark String Breaking in QCD through Chiral Symmetry Restoration and Hawking-Unruh Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between QCD and the string model offers a valuable perspective for exploring the interaction potential between quarks. In this study, we investigate the restoration of chiral symmetry in connection with the Unruh effect experienced by accelerating observers. Utilizing the Schwinger model, we analyze the critical point at which the string or chromoelectric flux tube between quark-antiquarks breaks with increasing separation between quarks. In this study, the critical distance for quark-antiquark chromoelectric flux tube or string breaking is determined to be $r_c=1.294\pm0.040$ fm. The acceleration and Unruh temperature corresponding to this critical point signify the transition of the system's chiral symmetry from a broken to a restored state. Our estimates for the critical acceleration ($a_c=1.14\times 10^{34}$ cm/s$^{2}$) and Unruh temperature ($T_c=0.038$ GeV) align with previous studies. This analysis illuminates the interplay between chiral symmetry restoration, the Unruh effect, and the breaking of the string or chromoelectric flux tube within the context of quark interactions.</description>

      <title>DESI Constraints on Exponential Quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The DESI collaboration have recently analyzed their first year of data, finding a preference for thawing dark energy scenarios when using parameterized equations of state for dark energy. We investigate whether this preference persists when the data is analyzed within the context of a well-studied field theory model of thawing dark energy, exponential quintessence. No preference for this model over $\Lambda$CDM is found, and both models are poorer fits to the data than the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder $w_0$--$w_a$ parameterization. We demonstrate that the worse fit is due to a lack of sharp features in the potential that results in a slowly-evolving dark energy equation of state that does not have enough freedom to simultaneously fit the combination of the supernovae, DESI, and cosmic microwave background data. Our analysis provides guidance for constructing dynamical dark energy models that are able to better accommodate the data.</description>

      <title>Effective Potential and Topological Photon Spheres: A Novel Approach to Black Hole Parameter Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we anchor our analysis on the premise that the presence of a photon sphere is an intrinsic characteristic of any ultra-compact gravitational structure with spherical symmetry. Utilizing the concept of a topological photon sphere, we categorize the behaviors of diverse gravitational models based on the structure of their photon spheres. This innovative approach enables us to define boundaries for black hole parameters, which subsequently allows us to classify the model as either a black hole or a naked singularity. Indeed, we will demonstrate that the existence of this reciprocal relationship between the gravitational structure and the presence of a photon sphere offers a unique advantage that can be directly and inversely harnessed. Furthermore, we present a precise correlation between the behavior of the defined effective potential and the total topological charge for each model. Through an independent examination of the effective potential, we show that a gravitational model typically exhibits naked singularity behavior when at least one effective potential minimum (a stable photon sphere) protrudes beyond the event horizon. Finally, we will compare the effect of adding perfect fluid dark matter to the models under study and observe the impact of this quantity on the behavior of the photon sphere and the extent of their dominance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the realization of spontaneous CP violation through moduli stabilization. In modular flavor models, the source of CP violation is the vacuum expectation values of the complex structure moduli of toroidal compact space. We demonstrate that the combined effects of Type IIB flux compactifications with modular invariant couplings between the moduli and matter fields can induce spontaneous CP violation without or with supersymmetry breaking. Furthermore, some general properties of CP and modular invariant scalar potentials are presented. It is found that certain modifications or partial breakings of modular symmetry are useful in generating spontaneous CP violation.</description>

      <title>Exact results, transient generalized Gibbs ensembles, and analytic approximations for spacetime propagators of massive, real scalar fields in one spatial dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The massive, real scalar field described by the Klein-Gordon equation in one spatial dimension is the most elementary example of a bosonic quantum field theory, and has been investigated for many decades either as a simple academic theory or as a realistic emergent many-body theory in low-dimensional systems. Despite this, the space and time behavior of its propagators have rarely been in the foreground, and although exact results are known, there remain gaps in the description and a lack of an in-depth physical analysis. The aim of this paper is to address the deficits by providing a comprehensive discussion of the results, and to show that this old theory still allows for several new results and insights. To start, known results are rederived in full detail, with an added discussion on how exactly space and time variables need to be extended to complex values to ensure analyticity throughout spacetime. This procedure shows also how singularities on the lightcone need to be regularized to remain compatible with the analyticity and the physical limit of a vanishing mass. An extension to nonzero temperatures is provided by considering the contact of the field to a nonrelativistic thermal reservoir, such as is necessary for emerging field theories in condensed matter systems. Subsequently, it is shown that the transient, short spacetime propagation can be understood in the context of the modern development of a generalized Gibbs ensemble, which describes a massless theory with an effective temperature that is set by the Klein-Gordon mass and the physical temperature. Finally, an approximation scheme is presented that captures the non-trivial mass dependence of the propagators throughout all spacetime but involves only elementary functions.</description>

It is written for a cosmology audience predisposed to be at best sceptical, and at worst contemptuous, of the notion that either quantum gravity or string theory has any relevance for their discipline.

      <title>Apparent horizon tracking in supercritical solutions of the Einstein-scalar field equations in spherical symmetry in affine-null coordinates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Choptuik's critical phenomena in general relativity is revisited in the affine-null metric formulation of Einstein's equations for a massless scalar field in spherical symmetry. Numerical solutions are obtained by evolution of initial data using pseudo-spectral methods. The underlying system consists of differential equations along the outgoing null rays which can be solved in sequential form. A new two-parameter family of initial data is presented for which these equations can be integrated analytically. Specific choices of the initial data parameters correspond to either an asymptotically flat null cone, a black hole event horizon or the singular interior of a black hole. Our main focus is on the interior features of a black hole, for which the affine-null system is especially well adapted. We present both analytic and numerical results describing the geometric properties of the apparent horizon and final singularity. Using a re-gridding technique for the affine parameter, numerical evolution of initially asymptotically flat supercritical data can be continued inside the event horizon and track the apparent horizon up to the formation of the final singularity.</description>

      <title>Post-Minkowskian Theory Meets the Spinning Effective-One-Body Approach for Bound-Orbit Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by advances in scattering amplitudes and worldline-based methods, recent years have seen significant progress in our ability to calculate gravitational two-body scattering observables. These observables effectively encapsulate the gravitational two-body problem in the weak-field and high-velocity regime (post-Minkowskian, PM), with applications to the bound two-body problem and gravitational-wave modeling. We leverage PM data to construct a complete inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model for non-precessing spinning black holes within the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism: SEOBNR-PM. This model is closely based on the highly successful SEOBNRv5 model, used by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, with its key new feature being an EOB Hamiltonian derived by matching the two-body scattering angle in a perturbative PM expansion. The model performs remarkably well, showing a median mismatch against 441 numerical-relativity (NR) simulations that is somewhat lower than a similarly calibrated version of SEOBNRv5. Comparisons of the binding energy with NR also demonstrate better agreement than SEOBNRv5, despite the latter containing additional calibration to NR simulations.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

Abstract: In the works of A. Ach\'ucarro and P. K. Townsend and also by E. Witten, a duality between three-dimensional Chern-Simons gauge theories and gravity was established. In all cases, the results made use of the field equations. In a previous work, we were capable to generalize Witten's work to the off-shell cases, as well as to four dimensional Yang-Mills theory with de Sitter gauge symmetry. The price we paid is that curvature and torsion must obey some constraints under the action of the interior derivative. These constraints implied on the partial breaking of diffeomorphism invariance. In the present work, we, first, formalize our early results in terms of fiber bundle theory by establishing the formal aspects of the map between a principal bundle (gauge theory) and a coframe bundle (gravity) with partial breaking of diffeomorphism invariance. Then, we study the effect of the constraints on the homology defined by the interior derivative. The main result is the emergence of a nontrivial homology in Riemann-Cartan manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We study the variance in the measurement of observables during scattering events, as computed using amplitudes. The classical regime, characterised by negligible uncertainty, emerges as a consequence of an infinite set of relationships among multileg, multiloop amplitudes in a momentum-transfer expansion. We discuss two non-trivial examples in detail: the six-point tree and the five-point one-loop amplitudes in scalar QED. We interpret these relationships in terms or a coherent exponentiation of radiative effects in the classical limit which generalises the eikonal formula, and show how to recover the impulse, including radiation reaction, from this generalised eikonal. Finally, we incorporate the physics of spin into our framework.</description>

      <title>Anyonic Topological Order in Twisted Equivariant Differential (TED) K-Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While the classification of non-interacting crystalline topological insulator phases by equivariant K-theory has become widely accepted, its generalization to anyonic interacting phases -- hence to phases with topologically ordered ground states supporting topological braid quantum gates -- has remained wide open. On the contrary, the success of K-theory with classifying non-interacting phases seems to have tacitly been perceived as precluding a K-theoretic classification of interacting topological order; and instead a mix of other proposals has been explored. However, only K-theory connects closely to the actual physics of valence electrons; and self-consistency demands that any other proposal must connect to K-theory.
  Here we provide a detailed argument for the classification of symmetry protected/enhanced su(2)-anyonic topological order, specifically in interacting 2d semi-metals, by the twisted equivariant differential (TED) K-theory of configuration spaces of points in the complement of nodal points inside the crystal's Brillouin torus orbi-orientifold.
  We argue, in particular, that: (1) topological 2d semi-metal phases modulo global mass terms are classified by the flat differential twisted equivariant K-theory of the complement of the nodal points; (2) n-electron interacting phases are classified by the K-theory of configuration spaces of n points in the Brillouin torus; (3) the somewhat neglected twisting of equivariant K-theory by "inner local systems" reflects the effective "fictitious" gauge interaction of Chen, Wilczeck, Witten &amp; Halperin (1989), which turns fermions into anyonic quanta; (4) the induced su(2)-anyonic topological order is reflected in the twisted Chern classes of the interacting valence bundle over configuration space, constituting the hypergeometric integral construction of monodromy braid representations.</description>

Abstract: By extending the method developed by Arav, Gauntlett, Roberts and Rosen, we construct supersymmetric $AdS_2\times{\Sigma}$ solutions of gauged $\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity which are asymptotic to the $SU(3)\times{U}(1)$-invariant Warner fixed point, where ${\Sigma}$ is a spindle. The Warner fixed point is dual to the mass-deformed ABJM theory. The solutions are in the anti-twist class. We numerically calculate the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the presumed black holes with the $AdS_2\times{\Sigma}$ horizon.</description>

Abstract: As a generalisation of the correspondence linking 2D integrable systems with 4D Chern-Simons (CS) gauge theory, superspin chains are realized by means of crossing electric and magnetic super line defects in the 4D CS with super gauge symmetry. The oscillator realization of Lax operators solving the RLL relations of integrability is obtained in the gauge theory by extending the notion of Levi decomposition to Lie superalgebras. Based on particular 3-gradings of Lie superalgebras, we obtain graded oscillator Lax matrices for superspin chains with internal symmetries given by $A(m-1\mid n-1)$, $B(m\mid n)$, $C(n)$ and $D(m\mid n)$</description>

      <title>On the Virasoro fusion kernel at $c=25$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find a formula for the Virasoro fusion kernel at $c=25$, in terms of the connection coefficients of the Painlev\'e VI differential equation. Our formula agrees numerically with previously known integral representations of the kernel. The derivation of our formula relies on a duality $c\to 26-c$ that is obeyed by the shift equations for the fusion and modular kernels. We conjecture that for $c&lt;1$ the fusion and modular kernels are not smooth functions, but distributions.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Floquet Dynamics for Conformal Field Theories in Dimensions Greater than Two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find classes of driven conformal field theories (CFT) in d + 1 dimensions with d &gt; 1, whose quench and Floquet dynamics can be computed exactly. The setup is suitable for studying periodic drives, consisting of square pulse protocols for which Hamiltonian evolution takes place with different deformations of the original CFT Hamiltonian in successive time intervals. These deformations are realized by specific combinations of conformal generators with a deformation parameter $\beta$; the $\beta &lt; 1$ ($\beta &gt; 1$) Hamiltonians can be unitarily related to the standard (Luscher-Mack) CFT Hamiltonian. The resulting time evolution can be then calculated by conformal transformations. For $d\leq 3$ we show that the transformations can be obtained in a quaternion formalism. Evolution with such a single Hamiltonian yields qualitatively different time dependences of observables depending on the value of $\beta$, ranging from exponential decays characteristic of heating to oscillations and power law decays. This manifests in the behavior of the fidelity, unequal-time correlator, and the energy density at the end of a single cycle of a square pulse protocol with different hamiltonians in successive time intervals. When the Hamiltonians in a cycle involve generators of a single SU(1, 1) subalgebra we calculate the Floquet Hamiltonian. We show that one can get dynamical phase transitions by varying the time period of a cycle, where the system can go from a non-heating phase which is oscillatory as a function of the time period to a heating phase with an exponentially damped behavior. Our methods can be generalized to other discrete and continuous protocols. We also point out that our results are expected to hold for a broader class of QFTs that possesses an SL(2, C) symmetry with fields that transform as quasi-primaries under this. As an example, we briefly comment on celestial CFTs in this context.</description>

      <title>A Holographic Entanglement Entropy at Spi</title>

Abstract: Defining finite entanglement entropy for a subregion in quantum field theory requires the introduction of two logically independent scales: an IR scale that controls the size of the subregion, and a UV cut-off. In AdS/CFT, the IR scale is the AdS lengthscale, the UV cut-off is the bulk radial cut-off, and the subregion is specified by dimensionless angles. This is the data that determines Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces and their areas in AdS/CFT. We argue that in asymptotically flat space there exists the notion of a ``spi-subregion" that one can associate to spatial infinity (spi). Even though geometrically quite different from an AdS subregion, this angle data has the crucial feature that it allows an interpretation as a bi-partitioning of spi. Therefore, the area of the RT surface associated to the spi-subregion can be interpreted as the entanglement entropy of the reduced density matrix of the bulk state under this bi-partition, as in AdS/CFT. For symmetric spi-subregions, these RT surfaces are the waists of Asymptotic Causal Diamonds. In empty flat space they reduce to Rindler horizons, and are analogues of the AdS-Rindler horizons of Casini, Huerta \&amp; Myers. We connect these results to previous work on minimal surfaces anchored to screens in empty space, but also generalize the discussion to the case where there are black holes in the bulk. The phases of black hole RT surfaces as the spi-subregion is varied, naturally connect with those of black holes (small and large) in AdS. A key observation is that the radial cut-off is associated to an IR scale in flat space -- and in fact there are no UV divergences. We argue that this is consistent with previous suggestions that in sub-AdS scales the holographic duality is an IR/IR correspondence and that the degrees of freedom are {\em not} those of a local QFT, but those of long strings. Strings are of course, famously UV finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the impact of an additional dimension, as proposed in Kaluza-Klein's theory, on the Casimir effect within the context of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which is represented by the ``aether field''. We demonstrate that the Casimir energy is directly influenced by the presence of the fifth dimension, as well as by the aether parameter. Consequently, the force between the plates is also subject to variations of these parameters. Furthermore, we examine constraints on both the size of the extra dimension and the aether field parameter based on experimental data. The LIV parameter can provide insights into addressing the size-related challenges in Kaluza-Klein's theory and offers a mean to establish an upper limit on the size of the extra dimension. This helps to rationalize the difficulties associated with its detection in current experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of the effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10011v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the known effective field theory of the Calogero-Sutherland model in the thermodynamic limit of large number of particles, obtained from the standard procedure in conformal field theory: the Hilbert space is constructed a priori in terms of irreducible representations of the symmetry algebra, and not by diagonalization of the hamiltonian, which is given in terms of fields that carry representations of the W-infinity algebra (representing the incompressibility of the Fermi sea). Nevertheless, the role of the effective hamiltonian of the theory is to establish a specific dynamics, which deserves further consideration. We show that the time evolution of the (chiral or antichiral) density field is given by the quantum Benjamin-Ono equation, in agreement with previous results obtained from the alternative description of the continuous limit of the model, based on quantum hydrodynamics. In this study, all calculations are performed at the quantum operator level, without making any assumption on the semiclassical limit of the fields and their equations of motion. This result may be considered as a reliable indication of the equivalence between the quantum field theoretic and quantum hydrodynamical formulations of the effective theories of the model. A one-dimensional quantum compressible fluid that includes both chiralities is the physical picture that emerges for the continuous limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model.</description>

      <title>2d Ising Critical Couplings from Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an exact holographic duality formula between the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model and 3d quantum gravity, we provide a formula for "real" zeroes of the 2d Ising partition function on finite trivalent graphs in terms of the geometry of a 2d triangulation embedded in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex phase of those zeroes is given by the dihedral angles of the triangulation, which reflect its extrinsic curvature within the ambient 3d space, while the modulus is given by the angles within the 2d triangles, thus encoding the intrinsic geometry of the triangulation. Our formula can not cover the whole set of Ising zeroes, but we conjecture that a suitable complexification of these "real" zeroes would provide a more thorough formula. Nevertheless, in the thermodynamic limit, in the case of flat planar 2d triangulations, our Ising zeros' formula gives the critical couplings for isoradial graphs, confirming its generality. Finally, the formula naturally extends to graphs with arbitrary valence in terms of geometry of circle patterns embedded in 3d space. This approach shows an intricate, but precise, new relation between statistical mechanics and quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>On the $N_c$-insensitivity of QCD$_{2A}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of two-dimensional adjoint QCD is surprisingly insensitive to the number of colors $N_c$ of its gauge group. It is argued that the cancellation of finite $N_c$ terms is rather natural and a consequence of the singularity structure of the theory. In short, there are no finite $N_c$ contraction terms, hence there cannot be any finite $N_c$ singular terms, since the former are necessary to guarantee well-behaved principal value integrals. We evaluate and categorize the matrix elements of the theory's light-cone Hamiltonian to show how terms emerging from finite $N_c$ contributions to the anti-commutator cancel against contributions from the purely finite $N_c$ term of the Hamiltonian. The cancellation is not complete; finite terms survive and modify the spectrum, as is known from numerical work. Additionally we show that several parton-number changing finite $N_c$ matrix elements vanish. In particular, there is only one trace-diagonal finite $N_c$ correction. It seems therefore that considering matrix elements rather than individual contributions can provide substantial simplifications when computing the spectrum of a theory with a large symmetry group.</description>

Abstract: We resolve black hole information paradox within semiclassical gravity, in a manner that does not depend on details of unknown quantum gravity. Our crucial insight is that outgoing Hawking particles are physical only far from the black hole horizon, so they are created far from the horizon and entangled with degrees of freedom closer to the horizon. The latter degrees of freedom can be understood as quasi-classical coherent states, implying that Hawking radiation is accompanied with additional radiation similar to classical radiation by which the black hole loses hair during the classical gravitational collapse. The two kinds of radiation are entangled, which resolves black hole information paradox.</description>

Abstract: The perturbative LARGE volume scenario (LVS) is a promising moduli stabilisation scheme in which the overall volume modulus of the compactifying Calabi-Yau (CY) threefold is dynamically stabilised to exponentially large values via using only perturbative corrections. In this article, using an orientifold of a K3-fibred CY threefold, we present the global embedding of an inflationary model proposed in the framework of perturbative LVS, in which the overall volume modulus acts as the inflaton field rolling on a nearly flat potential induced by a combination of the ${\alpha^\prime}^3$-corrections and the so-called {\it log-loop} effects. Given that having a concrete global construction facilitates explicit expressions for a set of sub-leading corrections, as a next step, we present a detailed analysis investigating the robustness of the single-field inflationary model against such corrections, in particular those arising from the winding-type string loop corrections and the higher derivative F$^4$-corrections.</description>

Abstract: Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) terms are typically neglected when performing dimensional reductions of gravitational theories. We consider the reduction of such terms for both two-derivative and four-derivative theories in general dimensions. We demonstrate a robust consistency wherein the GHY term in the original, higher-dimensional theory translates directly to the appropriate GHY term in the dimensionally reduced theory. In particular, this gives a novel way of generating such terms for higher-derivative corrections. We carry out this procedure for Gauss-Bonnet, Chern-Simons modified, and $f(R)$ gravities to derive novel boundary terms.</description>

Abstract: We show that turning on the interaction of relativistic spinless particles with the vacuum of relativistic quantum mechanics (RQM) leads to the replacement of the Klein-Gordon equation with the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation. In this case, coordinate time becomes an operator and free relativistic particles go into a virtual state. We discuss geometry associated with classical and quantum Klein-Gordon oscillators, and its relation to the geometry underlying the description of free particles.</description>

Abstract: We present a new picture of the early universe in finite nonlocal quantum gravity, which is conformally invariant at the classical and quantum levels. The high-energy regime of the theory consists of two phases, a conformally invariant trans-Planckian phase and a post-Planckian or Higgs phase described by an action quadratic in the Ricci tensor and where the cosmos evolves according to the standard radiation-dominated model. In the first phase, all the issues of the hot big bang such as the singularity, flatness, and horizon problems find a universal and simple non-inflationary solution by means of Weyl (or scale, or conformal) invariance, regardless of the microscopic details of the theory. In the second phase, once conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken, primordial perturbations are generated around a background that asymptotically evolves as a radiation-dominated flat Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker universe.</description>

Abstract: We propose a testable alternative to inflation directly built in a very general class of ultraviolet complete theories of quantum gravity enjoying Weyl conformal invariance. After the latter is spontaneously broken, logarithmic quantum corrections to the action make both the primordial tensor spectrum (from graviton fluctuations) and the scalar spectrum (from thermal fluctuations) quasi scale invariant. We predict a scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ which only depends on two parameters and is consistent with observations, a tensor index $n_{\rm t} =1-n_{\rm s}&gt;0$, a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}\approx 0.01$ detectable by BICEP Array and LiteBIRD in the immediate or near future, respectively, and a blue-tilted stochastic gravitational-wave background observable by DECIGO in the further future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12404v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conserved-charge densities are very special observables in quantum many-body systems as, by construction, they encode information about the dynamics. Therefore, their evolution is expected to be of much simpler interpretation than that of generic observables and to return universal information on the state of the system at any given time. Here we study the dynamics of the fluctuations of conserved U(1) charges in systems that are prepared in charge-asymmetric initial states. We characterise the charge fluctuations in a given subsystem using the full-counting statistics of the truncated charge and the quantum entanglement between the subsystem and the rest resolved to the symmetry sectors of the charge. We show that, even though the initial states considered are homogeneous in space, the charge fluctuations generate an effective inhomogeneity due to the charge-asymmetric nature of the initial states. We use this observation to map the problem into that of charge fluctuations on inhomogeneous, charge-symmetric states and treat it using a recently developed space-time duality approach. Specialising the treatment to interacting integrable systems we combine the space-time duality approach with generalised hydrodynamics to find explicit predictions.</description>

      <title>Noisy Quantum Trees: Infinite Protection Without Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum networks with tree structures, in which information propagates from a root to leaves. At each node in the network, the received qubit unitarily interacts with fresh ancilla qubits, after which each qubit is sent through a noisy channel to a different node in the next level. Therefore, as the tree depth grows, there is a competition between the irreversible effect of noise and the protection against such noise achieved by delocalization of information. In the classical setting, where each node simply copies the input bit into multiple output bits, this model has been studied as the broadcasting or reconstruction problem on trees, which has broad applications. In this work, we study the quantum version of this problem. We consider a Clifford encoder at each node that encodes the input qubit in a stabilizer code, along with a single qubit Pauli noise channel at each edge. Such noisy quantum trees describe a scenario in which one has access to a stream of fresh (low-entropy) ancilla qubits, but cannot perform error correction. Therefore, they provide a different perspective on quantum fault tolerance. Furthermore, they provide a useful model for describing the effect of noise within the encoders of concatenated codes. We prove that above certain noise thresholds, which depend on the properties of the code such as its distance, as well as the properties of the encoder, information decays exponentially with the depth of the tree. On the other hand, by studying certain efficient decoders, we prove that for codes with distance d&gt;=2 and for sufficiently small (but non-zero) noise, classical information and entanglement propagate over a noisy tree with infinite depth. Indeed, we find that this remains true even for binary trees with certain 2-qubit encoders at each node, which encode the received qubit in the binary repetition code with distance d=1.</description>

Abstract: It is well known that the action functional can be used to define classical, quantum, closed, and open dynamics in a generalization of the variational principle and in the path integral formalism in classical and quantum dynamics, respectively. These schemes are based on an unusual feature, a formal redoubling of the degrees of freedom. Several arguments to motivate the redoubling are put forward in classical and quantum mechanics to demonstrate that such a formalism is natural.</description>

      <title>Different versions of soft-photon theorems exemplified at leading and next-to-leading terms for pion-pion and pion-proton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the photon emission in pion-pion and pion-proton scattering in the soft-photon limit where the photon energy $\omega \to 0$. The expansions of the $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0} \gamma$ and the $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p \gamma$ amplitudes, satisfying the energy-momentum relations, to the orders $\omega^{-1}$ and $\omega^{0}$ are derived. We show that these terms can be expressed completely in terms of the on-shell amplitudes for $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0}$ and $\pi^{\pm} p \to \pi^{\pm} p$, respectively, and their partial derivatives with respect to $s$ and $t$. The~structure term which is non singular for $\omega \to 0$ is determined to the order $\omega^{0}$ from the gauge-invariance constraint using the generalized Ward identities for pions and the proton. For the reaction $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0} \gamma$ we discuss in detail the soft-photon theorems in the versions of both F.E. Low and S. Weinberg. We show that these two versions are different and must not be confounded. Weinberg's version gives the pole term of a Laurent expansion in $\omega$ of the amplitude for $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0} \gamma$ around the phase-space point of zero radiation. Low's version gives an approximate expression for the above amplitude at a fixed phase-space point, corresponding to non-zero radiation. Clearly, the leading and next-to-leading terms in theses two approaches must be, and are indeed, different. We show their relation. We also discuss the expansions of differential cross sections for $\pi^{-} \pi^{0} \to \pi^{-} \pi^{0} \gamma$ with respect to $\omega$ for $\omega \to 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Logarithm of the soft function can be organized into sets of Feynman diagrams known as Cwebs. We introduced a new formalism in~\cite{Agarwal:2022wyk}, that allows to determine several of the building blocks of Cweb mixing matrices without explicit computations. In~\cite{Agarwal:2022xec} we used this formalism to obtain the diagonal blocks of four general classes of Cwebs to all orders in perturbation theory which also covered all the four loop Boomerang Cwebs connecting four Wilson lines. In this work we present complete mixing matrices and exponentiated colour factors for Boomerang Cwebs at four loops that connect three and four Wilson lines. Also, we present a more efficient version of the algorithm of generating Cwebs that was presented in~\cite{Agarwal:2020nyc}. This new algorithm has been used to generate the Cwebs in the present work.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry in Non-Hermitian Dirac Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lorentz spacetime symmetry represents a unifying feature of the fundamental forces, typically manifest at sufficiently high energies, while in quantum materials it emerges in the deep low-energy regime. However, its fate in quantum materials coupled to an environment thus far remained unexplored. We here introduce a general framework of constructing symmetry-protected Lorentz invariant non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac semimetals (DSMs), realized by invoking masslike anti-Hermitian Dirac operators to its Hermitian counterpart. Such NH DSMs feature purely real or imaginary isotropic linear band dispersion, yielding a vanishing density of states. Dynamic mass orderings in NH DSMs thus take place for strong Hubbardlike local interactions through a quantum phase transition, hosting a non-Fermi liquid, beyond which the system becomes an insulator. We show that depending on the internal Clifford algebra between the NH Dirac operator and candidate mass order-parameter, the resulting quantum-critical fluid either remains coupled with the environment or recovers full Hermiticity by decoupling from the bath, while always enjoying an emergent Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry in terms of a unique terminal velocity. We showcase the competition between such mass orderings, their hallmarks on quasiparticle spectra in the ordered phases, and the relevance of our findings for correlated designer NH Dirac materials.</description>

      <title>Tidal Forces in Kerr-AdS and Grey Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper [arXiv:2305.08922], it has been proposed that the endpoint of the Kerr-AdS superradiant instability is a Grey Galaxy. The conjectured solutions are supposed to be made up of a black hole with critical angular velocity in the centre of AdS, surrounded by a large flat disk of thermal bulk gas that revolves around the black hole. In the analysis of the proposed solutions so far, gravitational effects due to the black hole on the thermal gas have been neglected. A way to estimate these effects is via computing tidal forces. With this motivation, we study tidal forces on objects moving in the Kerr-AdS spacetime. To do so, we construct a parallel-transported orthonormal frame along an arbitrary timelike or null geodesic. We then specialise to the class of fast rotating geodesics lying in the equatorial plane, and estimate tidal forces on the gas in the Grey Galaxies, modelling it as a collection of particles moving on timelike geodesics. We show that the tidal forces are small (and remain small even in the large mass limit), thereby providing additional support to the idea that the gas is weakly interacting with the black hole.</description>

      <title>Complexity and order in approximate quantum error-correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish rigorous connections between quantum circuit complexity and approximate quantum error correction (AQEC) properties, covering both all-to-all and geometric scenarios including lattice systems. To this end, we introduce a type of code parameter that we call subsystem variance, which is closely related to the optimal AQEC precision. Our key finding is that if the subsystem variance is below an $O(k/n)$ threshold then any state in the code subspace must obey certain circuit complexity lower bounds, which identify nontrivial ``phases'' of codes. Based on our results, we propose $O(k/n)$ as a boundary between subspaces that should and should not count as AQEC codes. This theory of AQEC provides a versatile framework for understanding the quantum complexity and order of many-body quantum systems, offering new insights for wide-ranging physical scenarios, in particular topological order and critical quantum systems which are of outstanding importance in many-body and high energy physics. We observe from various different perspectives that roughly $O(1/n)$ represents a common, physically significant ``scaling threshold'' of subsystem variance for features associated with nontrivial quantum order.</description>

      <title>Entanglement from superradiance and rotating quantum fluids of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16031v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amplification of radiation by superradiance is a universal phenomenon observed in numerous physical systems. We demonstrate that superradiant scattering generates entanglement for different input states, including coherent states, thereby establishing the inherently quantum nature of this phenomenon. To put these concepts to the test, we propose a novel approach to create horizonless ergoregions, which are nonetheless dynamically stable thanks to the dissipative dynamics of a polaritonic fluid of light. We numerically simulate the system to demonstrate the creation of a stable ergoregion. Subsequently, we investigate rotational superradiance within this system, with a primary focus on entanglement generation and the possibilities for its enhancement using current techniques. Our methods permit the investigation of quantum emission by rotational superradiance in state-of-the-art experiments, in which the input state can be controlled at will.</description>

      <title>Revisiting primordial black holes formation from preheating instabilities: the case of Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the formation of primordial black holes (PBH) in the early universe inflationary cosmology has garnered significant attention. One plausible scenario for primordial black hole (PBH) formation arises during the preheating stage following inflation. Notably, this scenario does not necessitate any ad-hoc fine-tuning of the scalar field potential. This paper focuses on the growth of primordial density perturbation and the consequent possibility of PBH formation in the preheating stage of the Starobinsky model for inflation. The typical mechanism for PBH formation during preheating is based on the collapse of primordial fluctuations that become super-horizon during inflation (type I) and re-enter the particle horizon in the different phases of cosmic expansion. In this work, we show that there exists a certain range of modes that remain in the sub-horizon (not exited) during inflation (type II modes) but evolve identically to type I modes if they fall into the instability band, leading to large density perturbation above the threshold and can potentially also contribute to the PBH formation. We detail the conditions determining the possible collapse of type I and/or type II modes whose wavelengths are larger than the Jeans length we derive from the effective sound speed of scalar field fluctuations. Since the preheating stage is an 'inflaton' (approximately) matter-dominated phase, we follow the framework of the critical collapse of fluctuations and compute the mass fraction using the well-known Press-Schechter and the Khlopov-Polnarev formalisms, and compare the two. Finally, we comment on the implications of our study for the investigations concerned with primordial accretion and consequent PBH contribution to the dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement entropy of black holes is expected to follow the Page curve. After an initial linear increase with time the entanglement entropy should reach a maximum at the Page time and then decrease. This paper introduces an exactly solvable model of free fermions that explicitly shows such a Page curve: The entanglement entropy vanishes asymptotically for late times instead of saturating at a volume law. The bending down of the Page curve is accompanied by a breakdown of the semiclassical connection between particle current and entanglement generation, a quantum phase transition in the entanglement Hamiltonian and non-analytic behavior of the $q\rightarrow\infty$ Renyi entropy. These observations are expected to hold for a larger class of systems beyond the exactly solvable model analyzed here.</description>

      <title>Interface Dynamics of Strongly interacting Binary Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interface dynamics in non-equilibrium quantum systems remains a challenge. We study the interface dynamics of strongly coupled immiscible binary superfluids by using holographic duality. The full nonlinear evolution of the binary superfluids with a relative velocity shows rich nonlinear patterns toward quantum turbulence, which is reminiscent of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The wave number of the fast growing modes $k_0$ extracted from the interface pattern yields a non-monotonic dependence of the relative velocity, independent of the temperature and interaction. The value of $k_0$ first increases with the velocity difference and then decreases, which stands in sharp contrast to the results of mean-field theory described by the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and is confirmed by using the linear analyses on top of the stationary configuration. We uncover that the critical velocity associated with the maximum correspond to the case when the mean separation of vortices generated by interface instabilities becomes comparable to the vortex size, which could be a universal physical mechanism at strongly interacting superfluids and is directly testable in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Penrose process with the charged particles in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) background. Let parent particle 0 decay to particles 1 and 2. With the assumption that all three particles move in the equatorial plane, the exact formulas for characteristics of particles 1 and 2 in terms of those of particle 0 are derived. We concentrate on scenarios in which particle 1 and 2 are ejected along the trajectory of particle 0. It is shown that such scenarios correspond to the extrema of energies $E_{1}$ or $E_{2}$ of daughter particles with respect to the angular momentum $L_{1}$ or $L_{2}$. We derive bounds on the values of angular momenta $L_{1}$ and $% L_{2}$. We give classification of these scenarios and discuss their properties including decay in the near-horizon region. We find that the maximum of efficiency is achieved on the horizon for some of these scenarios but not for all of them and with additional constraints on particle parameters. The results are reformulated in terms of velocities of daughter particles in the center of mass frame. The approach is applicable also to collisional Penrose process, in which a combination of particles 1 and 2 is considered as one effective particle. If the mass of particle 0 $% m_{0}\rightarrow \infty $, the situation corresponds to the Ba\~{n}% ados-Silk-West effect, the results agree with the ones known in literature before. In addition, we consider special cases when decay occurs in the turning point for one or all three particles. The formalism developed in this work has a model-independent character and applies not only to the RN metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gertsenshtein effect could in principle be used to detect a single graviton by firing it through a region filled with a constant magnetic field that enables its conversion to a photon, which can be efficiently detected via standard techniques. The quantization of the gravitational field could then be inferred indirectly. We show that for currently available single-photon detector technology, the Gertsenshtein detector is generically inefficient, meaning that the probability of detection is $\ll 1$. The Gertsenshtein detector can become efficient on astrophysical scales for futuristic single-photon detectors sensitive to frequencies in the Hz to kHz range. It is not clear whether such devices are in principle possible.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model. We also introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Causal set theory offers a simple and elegant picture of discrete physics. But the vast majority of causal sets look nothing at all like continuum spacetimes, and must be excluded in some way to obtain a realistic theory. I describe recent results showing that almost all non-manifoldlike causal sets are, in fact, very strongly suppressed in the gravitational path integral. This does not quite demonstrate the emergence of a continuum -- we do not yet understand the remaining unsuppressed causal sets well enough -- but it is a significant step in that direction.</description>
