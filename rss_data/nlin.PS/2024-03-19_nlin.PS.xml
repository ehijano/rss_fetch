      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of Turing pattern dynamics on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern dynamics on curved surfaces are ubiquitous. Although the effect of surface topography on pattern dynamics has gained much interest, there is a limited understanding of the roles of surface geometry and topology in pattern dynamics. Recently, we reported that a static pattern on a flat plane can become a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. By examining reaction-diffusion equations on axisymmetric surfaces, certain conditions for the onset of pattern propagation were determined. However, this analysis was limited by the assumption that the pattern propagates at a constant speed. Here, we investigate the pattern propagation driven by surface curvature using weakly nonlinear analysis, which enables a more comprehensive approach to the aforementioned problem. The analysis reveals consistent conditions of the pattern propagation similar to our previous results, and further predicts that rich dynamics other than pattern propagation, such as periodic and chaotic behaviors, can arise depending on the surface geometry. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between surfaces and pattern dynamics and a basis for controlling pattern dynamics on surfaces.</description>

      <title>One family of dark-bright solitons with striking width differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of previously reported dark-bright solitons admit identical width for the two components in both theoretical and experimental studies. We report dark-bright solitons can admit strikingly different widths, and derive a family of analytical solutions for them by Lagrangian variational method. The existence regimes for these solitons become much more widespread in the space of nonlinear parameters, than the ones for the previously known dark-bright solitons with identical width. Our analysis indicates that the effective quantum wells are quite different in the two components, in sharp contrast to the ones for all previously known vector solitons. Especially, the particle number of bright soliton can be used to control the generation of dark-bright solitons with varied ratios of solitons' widths. Based on the current experimental technologies, we propose an experimental scheme for observing these novel dark-bright solitons. The results suggest that abundant vector solitons with difference widths exist in multi-components coupled systems, and would inspire experiments to observe them in nonlinear optical fibers, Bose-Einstein condensates, and other nonlinear coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Cooperation in a non-Ergodic World on a Network -- Insurance and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooperation between individuals is emergent in all parts of society, yet mechanistic reasons for this emergence is ill understood in the literature. A specific example of this is insurance. Recent work has, though, shown that assuming the risk individuals face is proportional to their wealth and optimising the time average growth rate rather than the ensemble average results in a non-zero-sum game, where both parties benefit from cooperation through insurance contracts. In a recent paper, Peters and Skjold present a simple agent-based model and show how, over time, agents that enter into such cooperatives outperform agents that do not. Here, we extend this work by restricting the possible connections between agents via a lattice network. Under these restrictions, we still find that all agents profit from cooperating through insurance. We, though, further find that clusters of poor and rich agents emerge endogenously on the two-dimensional map and that wealth inequalities persist for a long duration, consistent with the phenomenon known as the poverty trap. By tuning the parameters which control the risk levels, we simulate both highly advantageous and extremely risky gambles and show that despite the qualitative shift in the type of risk, the findings are consistent.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics driven by surface curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Patterns on curved surfaces are ubiquitous, yet the influence of surface geometry on pattern dynamics remains elusive. We recently reported a new mechanism of pattern propagation in which a static pattern on a flat plane becomes a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. Here, we address whether surface curvature can drive more complex pattern dynamics beyond propagation. By employing a combination of weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation, we show that oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics can emerge by controlling the surface shapes. These findings highlight a new role of surface topography in pattern formation and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Thermodynamic Stability in an Entropy-driven Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion that the mathematics of gravity can be reproduced from a statistical requirement of maximal entropy, we study the consequence of introducing an entropic source term in the Einstein-Hilbert action. For a spatially homogeneous cosmological system driven by this entropic source and enveloped by a time evolving apparent horizon, we formulate a modified version of the second law of thermodynamics. An explicit differential equation governing the internal entropy profile is found. Using a Hessian matrix analysis of the internal entropy we check the thermodynamic stability for a {\Lambda}CDM cosmology, a unified cosmic expanson and a non-singular ekpyrotic bounce. We find the mathematical condition for a second order phase transition during these evolutions from the divergence of specific heat at constant volume. The condition is purely kinematic and quadratic in nature, relating the deceleration parameter and the jerk parameter that chalks out an interesting curve on the parameter space. This condition is valid even without the entropic source term and may be a general property of any phase transition.</description>

      <title>Stability restoration by asymmetric nonlinear states in non-Hermitian double-well potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of one-dimensional complex optical potentials that feature a nonlinearity-induced stability restoration, i.e., the existence of stable nonlinear modes propagating in a waveguide whose linear eigenmodes are unstable. The optical potential is an even function of the transverse coordinate, i.e., the system is parity symmetric but not parity-time symmetric. The stability restoration occurs for asymmetric stationary nonlinear modes that do not respect the parity symmetry. Stable nonlinear states exist either for focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. On the qualitative level the stability restoration cab be analyzed using a simple bimodal system. Its solutions enable systematic construction of stable stationary modes and more complex patterns with intensity periodically oscillating along the propagation distance.</description>
