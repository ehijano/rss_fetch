      <title>The Software Landscape for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive criterion and modification of wave-particle decomposition in UGKWP method for high-speed flow simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefitting from the direct modeling of physical laws in a discretized space and the automatic decomposition of hydrodynamic waves and particles, the unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method offers notable advantages in various multiscale physics, such as hypersonic flow, plasma transport and radiation transport. Aiming at achieving a more suitable and efficient wave-particle decomposition in high-speed flow simulation and enhancing the performance in the drastic scale variation region, in this work, the scale adaptive criterion is studied and the flux evolution of UGKWP method is modified. Specifically, besides the perspective of time which is naturally considered in the time-dependent distribution function of UGKWP method, two more criteria from views of space and gradient are utilized to identify the local scale, and to reduce the computational consumption of particles on describing the near-equilibrium microscopic gas distribution function. Moreover, corresponding to the coefficients in the time integration flux of unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), the evolution of hydrodynamic wave is modified to be more consistent with particles, which is essential when the scale changes intensely in different cells. A variety of test cases are conducted to validate the performance of the adaptive UGKWP method, including hypersonic flows around a cylinder at multiple inflow Knudsen numbers, hypersonic flow over a slender cavity, side-jet impingement on hypersonic flow and three-dimensional hypersonic flows over a $70^{\circ}$ blunted cone with a cylindrical sting.</description>

      <title>Analytical coarse grained potential parameterization by Reinforcement Learning for anisotropic cellulose</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellulose nanocrystals(CNC) is a nano form of cellulose with great mechanical performance and other merit attributes. Revealed by preceding researches of experiments and molecular simulations, CNC has an anisotropic structure, in which hydrogen bonds play a pivotal role. Understanding structure and mechanical behavior of CNC in a mesoscopic scale is critical to improve manufacturing process and property of final products, in which experiment observation and atomistic simulation are not appropriate. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been an important power source for many industrial and academic achievements in lots of fields. Nevertheless, the potential of RL has not been fully utilized in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this work, we introduce an analytical coarse grained (CG) potential directly parameterized by RL. We utilize RL and Boltzmann inversion to develop a novel CG model of cellulose with consideration of anisotropy and other properties like polymer stiffness. Resultant CG model is not limited to target properties for training, and it could present mechanical properties under other circumstances without additional training. With a little help of prior physical knowledge, the results show that RL could help us parameterize potentials and help us better understand the interactions among particles. Our model illustrates the capability of RL to construct a CG potential which are physically explainable and powerful.</description>

      <title>Latent Representation Learning of Multi-scale Thermophysics: Application to Dynamics in Shocked Porous Energetic Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling of physics across length and time scales plays an important role in the response of microstructured materials to external loads. In a multi-scale framework, unresolved (subgrid) meso-scale dynamics is upscaled to the homogenized (macro-scale) representation of the heterogeneous material through closure models. Deep learning models trained using meso-scale simulation data are now a popular route to assimilate such closure laws. However, meso-scale simulations are computationally taxing, posing practical challenges in training deep learning-based surrogate models from scratch. In this work, we investigate an alternative meta-learning approach motivated by the idea of tokenization in natural language processing. We show that one can learn a reduced representation of the micro-scale physics to accelerate the meso-scale learning process by tokenizing the meso-scale evolution of the physical fields involved in an archetypal, albeit complex, reactive dynamics problem, \textit{viz.}, shock-induced energy localization in a porous energetic material. A probabilistic latent representation of \textit{micro}-scale dynamics is learned as building blocks for \textit{meso}-scale dynamics. The \textit{meso-}scale latent dynamics model learns the correlation between neighboring building blocks by training over a small dataset of meso-scale simulations. We compare the performance of our model with a physics-aware recurrent convolutional neural network (PARC) trained only on the full meso-scale dataset. We demonstrate that our model can outperform PARC with scarce meso-scale data. The proposed approach accelerates the development of closure models by leveraging inexpensive micro-scale simulations and fast training over a small meso-scale dataset, and can be applied to a range of multi-scale modeling problems.</description>

      <title>Reactions of abiogenic hydrocarbons in Earth's upper mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of hydrocarbon fuels in Earth's interior has traditionally been considered to have biogenic origins; however, growing evidence suggests that some light hydrocarbons may instead originate abiotically. It is widely expected that the Fisher-Tropsch-type (FTT) process, which typically refers to the conversion of inorganic carbon to organic matter in the geologic convention, may also happen in Earth's interior, but the aqueous conditions and absence of industrial catalysts in deep environments suggest that the FTT process can be very different from that in the chemical industry. Here, we performed extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations (&gt; 2.4 ns) to investigate the FTT synthesis in dry mixture and in aqueous solutions at 10-13 GPa and 1000-1400 K. We found that large hydrocarbon-related species containing C, O, and H are abiotically synthesized via the polymerization of CO without any catalyst. Supercritical water, commonly found in deep Earth, does not prevent organic molecule formation but restricts product size and carbon reduction. Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized abiogenic route for hydrocarbon synthesis in mantle geofluids. These carbon-containing fluids could potentially migrate from depth to shallower crustal reservoirs, thereby contributing to the deep carbon cycle, influencing surface carbon budgets, and possibly serving as a new energy source.</description>

      <title>Quantized local reduced-order modeling in time (ql-ROM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatiotemporally chaotic systems, such as the solutions of some nonlinear partial differential equations, are dynamical systems that evolve toward a lower dimensional manifold. This manifold has an intricate geometry with heterogeneous density, which makes the design of a single (global) nonlinear reduced-order model (ROM) challenging. In this paper, we turn this around. Instead of modeling the manifold with one single model, we partition the manifold into clusters within which the dynamics are locally modeled. This results in a quantized local reduced-order model (ql-ROM), which consists of (i) quantizing the manifold via unsupervised clustering; (ii) constructing intrusive ROMs for each cluster; and (iii) seamlessly patch the local models with a change of basis and assignment functions. We test the method on two nonlinear partial differential equations, i.e., the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and 2D Navier-Stokes equations (Kolmogorov flow), across bursting, chaotic, quasiperiodic, and turbulent regimes. The local models are built via Galerkin projection onto the local principal directions, which are centered on the cluster centroids. The dynamics are modeled by switching a local ROM based on the cluster proximity. The proposed ql-ROM framework has three advantages over global ROMs (g-ROMs): (i) numerical stability, (ii) improved short-term prediction accuracy in time, and (iii) accurate prediction of long-term statistics, such as energy spectra and probability distributions. The computational overhead is minimal with respect to g-ROMs. The proposed framework retains the interpretability and simplicity of intrusive projection-based ROMs, whilst overcoming their limitations in modeling complex, high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient vectorized evaluation of Gaussian AO integrals on modern central processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson evaluation scheme for 1- and 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals designed for efficient execution on modern central processing units (CPUs) with Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction sets. Like in our recent MD implementation for graphical processing units (GPUs) [J. Chem. Phys. 160, 244109 (2024)], variable-sized batches of shellsets of integrals are evaluated at a time. By optimizing for the floating point instruction throughput rather than minimizing the number of operations, this approach achieves up to 50% of the theoretical hardware peak FP64 performance for many common SIMD-equipped platforms (AVX2, AVX512, NEON), which translates to speedups of up to 30 over the state-of-the-art one-shellset-at-a-time implementation of Obara-Saika-type schemes in Libint for a variety of primitive and contracted integrals. As with our previous work, we rely on the standard C++ programming language -- such as the std::simd standard library feature to be included in the 2026 ISO C++ standard -- without any explicit code generation to keep the code base small and portable. The implementation is part of the open source LibintX library freely available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/libintx.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely studied, revealing several types of chimeras. Most cases involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction, modeled via networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the non-reciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the one resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the condensation of liquid droplets on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. A stochastic mesoscale model based on the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics and the thermodynamics of a diffuse interface approach shows how direct simulation of the vapour-liquid transition from the nucleation process to droplet hydrodynamics can be achieved. Such simulations explain the role of wettability in filmwise and dropwise condensation regimes and the main limitations of classical nucleation theory.</description>

      <title>Fully Quantum Lattice Gas Automata Building Blocks for Computational Basis State Encodings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice Gas Automata (LGA) is a classical method for simulating physical phenomena, including Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Quantum LGA (QLGA) is the family of methods that implement LGA schemes on quantum computers. In recent years, QLGA has garnered attention from researchers thanks to its potential of efficiently modeling CFD processes by either reducing memory requirements or providing simultaneous representations of exponentially many LGA states. In this work, we introduce novel building blocks for QLGA algorithms that rely on computational basis state encodings. We address every step of the algorithm, from initial conditions to measurement, and provide detailed complexity analyses that account for all discretization choices of the system under simulation. We introduce multiple ways of instantiating initial conditions, efficient boundary condition implementations for novel geometrical patterns, a novel collision operator that models less restricted interactions than previous implementations, and quantum circuits that extract quantities of interest out of the quantum state. For each building block, we provide intuitive examples and open-source implementations of the underlying quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>PDEfuncta: Spectrally-Aware Neural Representation for PDE Solution Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning often involves representing complex solution fields that exhibit high-frequency features such as sharp transitions, fine-scale oscillations, and localized structures. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown promise for continuous function modeling, capturing such high-frequency behavior remains a challenge-especially when modeling multiple solution fields with a shared network. Prior work addressing spectral bias in INRs has primarily focused on single-instance settings, limiting scalability and generalization. In this work, we propose Global Fourier Modulation (GFM), a novel modulation technique that injects high-frequency information at each layer of the INR through Fourier-based reparameterization. This enables compact and accurate representation of multiple solution fields using low-dimensional latent vectors. Building upon GFM, we introduce PDEfuncta, a meta-learning framework designed to learn multi-modal solution fields and support generalization to new tasks. Through empirical studies on diverse scientific problems, we demonstrate that our method not only improves representational quality but also shows potential for forward and inverse inference tasks without the need for retraining.</description>

      <title>An advanced heat transfer model for Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations of industrial gas-solid flow systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete element method (DEM) coupled with computational fluid dynamics (CFD), has been developed to simulate complex solid-fluid flow systems. Today, DEM is regarded as an established approach, with extensive applications in industrial systems. Heat transfer modeling might be essential to the DEM as the industrial applications. However, existing DEM heat transfer models have fundamental limitations. These issues arise from the soft spring model inherent in DEM, where heat conduction is mathematically influenced by the spring constant. Consequently, complex modeling, considering contact state such as contact area and duration, is typically required to estimate heat conduction accurately. Moreover, the current heat transfer models exhibit poor compatibility with scaling laws, such as the coarse-grained DEM, leading to amplified temperature errors relative to motion errors. To address these challenges, we develop a novel heat transfer model based on an Eulerian framework within DEM simulations. In our approach, the Eulerian description is applied to the heat transfer calculation, while particle motion remains treated by the DEM. Notably, the heat conduction in the solid phase is captured through a simple setup by specifying the void fraction, rather than relying on complex contact modeling. The adequacy of the proposed model is demonstrated through validation tests in gas-solid flow systems, showing that the temperature distribution is independent of the particle contact state. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong compatibility with coarse-grained DEM, maintaining accuracy even at reduced computational costs. These results establish the new model's reliability and universality, positioning it as a promising standard for DEM-CFD simulations in industrial applications.</description>

Abstract: The shape of a cell influences and it is influenced by interactions with its neighbouring partners. Here, we introduce a coarse-grained model of non-reciprocal interactions between single-cell organisms to study emergent morphologies during symbiotic association. We show that the cell membrane can be remodelled into branched protrusions, invaginations, transient blebs and other dynamical phases that depend on the number of interacting partners, the asymmetry, and the magnitude of partnership activity. Our model finds a dynamical feedback between the local deformation of the membrane and its driving force, leading to morphologies not accessible to reciprocal systems.</description>

The main goal is to enhance the data assimilation results by mitigating loss of variance due to sampling errors. We also analyze the suitability of several machine learning models and the balance between accuracy and computational cost of the covariance estimations. We introduce two distance-free localization techniques leveraging machine learning methods specifically tailored for tabular data. The methods are integrated into the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation (ES-MDA) framework. The results show that the proposed localizations improve covariance accuracy and enhance data assimilation and uncertainty quantification results. We observe reduced variance loss for the input variables using the proposed methods. Furthermore, we compare several machine learning models, assessing their suitability for the problem in terms of computational cost, and quality of the covariance estimation and data match. The influence of ensemble size is also investigated, providing insights into balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Our findings demonstrate that certain machine learning models are more suitable for this problem. This study introduces two novel methods that mitigate variance loss for model parameters in ensemble-based data assimilation, offering practical solutions that are easy to implement and do not require any additional numerical simulation or hyperparameter tuning.</description>

      <title>Electronic Correlations Control Interlayer Coupling and Magnetic Transition in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/MnBr$_3$ Heterostructure</title>

Abstract: Bulk MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator. However, its low N\'eel temperature of $\sim 25\,\mathrm{K}$ severely restricts its practical applications. Here, we propose a van der Waals heterostructure composed of monolayer MBT (ML-MBT) and monolayer MnBr$_3$, an intrinsic Chern insulator possessing a high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C} \sim 200\,\mathrm{K}$). By employing density functional theory calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that interfacing ML-MBT with MnBr$_3$ significantly enhances the $T_\mathrm{C}$ of ML-MBT by a factor of four to five. Electronic correlations characterized by the Hubbard parameter $U_2$ for Mn-$d$ orbitals in MnBr$_3$ play a crucial role in governing magnetic coupling within the system. At a moderate correlation strength of $U_2 = 3.0\,\mathrm{eV}$, slight structural distortions in MnBr$_3$ break intralayer symmetry, enabling robust interlayer ferromagnetic coupling and yielding a single, unified magnetic transition. Increasing $U_2$ reduces these structural distortions, weakens interlayer coupling, and induces two distinct magnetic transitions, indicating interlayer magnetic decoupling. Thus, the MBT/MnBr$_3$ heterostructure offers a novel approach for controlling magnetic order and enhancing the performance of spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Leveraging active learning-enhanced machine-learned interatomic potential for efficient infrared spectra prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a pivotal analytical tool as it provides real-time molecular insight into material structures and enables the observation of reaction intermediates in situ. However, interpreting IR spectra often requires high-fidelity simulations, such as density functional theory based ab-initio molecular dynamics, which are computationally expensive and therefore limited in the tractable system size and complexity. In this work, we present a novel active learning-based framework, implemented in the open-source software package PALIRS, for efficiently predicting the IR spectra of small catalytically relevant organic molecules. PALIRS leverages active learning to train a machine-learned interatomic potential, which is then used for machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations to calculate IR spectra. PALIRS reproduces IR spectra computed with ab-initio molecular dynamics accurately at a fraction of the computational cost. PALIRS further agrees well with available experimental data not only for IR peak positions but also for their amplitudes. This advancement with PALIRS enables high-throughput prediction of IR spectra, facilitating the exploration of larger and more intricate catalytic systems and aiding the identification of novel reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Numerical approach to second-order canonical perturbation theory in the planetary 3-body problem. Application to exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extrasolar planetary systems commonly exhibit planets on eccentric orbits, with many systems located near or within mean-motion resonances, showcasing a wide diversity of orbital architectures. Such complex systems challenge traditional secular theories, which are limited to first-order approximations in planetary masses or rely on expansions in orbital elements--eccentricities, inclinations, and semi-major axis ratios--that are subject to convergence issues, especially in highly eccentric, inclined, or tightly-packed systems. To overcome these limitations, we develop a numerical approach to second-order perturbation theory based on the Lie transform formalism. Our method avoids the need for expansions in orbital elements, ensuring broader applicability and more robust convergence. We first outline the Hamiltonian framework for the 3-body planetary problem, and apply a canonical transformation to eliminate fast angle dependencies, deriving the secular Hamiltonian up to second order in the mass ratio. We then use the fast Fourier transform algorithm to numerically simulate, in an accurate way, the long-term evolution of planetary systems near or away from mean-motion resonances. Finally, we validate our methods against well-known planetary configurations, such as the Sun-Jupiter-Saturn system, as well as to exoplanetary systems like WASP-148, TIC 279401253 and GJ 876, demonstrating the applicability of our models across a wide range of planetary configurations.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis and Parallel Scaling Study of A Parareal Parallel-in-Time Integration Algorithm for Particle-in-Fourier Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a parareal based time parallelization scheme in the phase-space for the particle-in-Fourier (PIF) discretization of the Vlasov-Poisson system used in kinetic plasma simulations. We use PIF with a coarse tolerance for the nonuniform fast Fourier transforms, or the standard particle-in-cell scheme, combined with temporal coarsening, as coarse propagators. This is different from the typical spatial coarsening of particles and/or Fourier modes for parareal, which are not possible or effective for PIF schemes. We perform an error analysis of the algorithm and verify the results numerically with Landau damping, two-stream instability, and Penning trap test cases in 3D-3V. We also implement the space-time parallelization of the PIF schemes in the open-source, performance-portable library IPPL and conduct scaling studies up to 1536 A100 GPUs on the JUWELS booster supercomputer. The space-time parallelization utilizing the parareal algorithm for the time parallelization provides up to $4-6$ times speedup compared to spatial parallelization alone and achieves a push rate of around 1 billion particles per second for the benchmark plasma mini-apps considered.</description>

      <title>A new generation of effective core potentials: Selected lanthanides and heavy elements II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.</description>

      <title>On the performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22598v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>
