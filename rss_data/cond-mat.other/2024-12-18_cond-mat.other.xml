      <title>A topological route to engineering robust and bright supersymmetric laser arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, several proposals that leverage principles from condensed matter and high-energy physics for engineering laser arrays have been put forward. The most important among these concepts are topology, which enables the construction of robust zero-mode laser devices, and supersymmetry (SUSY), which holds the potential for achieving phase locking in laser arrays. In this work, we show that the relation between supersymmetric coupled bosonic and fermionic oscillators on one side, and bipartite networks (and hence chiral symmetry) on another side can be exploited together with non-Hermitian engineering for building one- and two-dimensional laser arrays with in-phase synchronization. To demonstrate our strategy, we present a concrete design starting from the celebrated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model to arrive at a SUSY laser structure that enjoys two key advantages over those reported in previous works. Firstly, the design presented here features a near-uniform geometry for both the laser array and supersymmetric reservoir (i.e. the widths and distances between the cavity arrays are almost the same). Secondly, the uniform field distribution in the presented structure leads to a far-field intensity that scales as N^2 where N is the number of lasing elements. Taken together, these two features can enable the implementation of higher-power laser arrays that are easy to fabricate, and hence provide a roadmap for pushing the frontier of SUSY laser arrays beyond the proof-of-concept phase.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Quenching of the Th-229 Nuclear Clock Isomer in Calcium Fluoride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 10-minute radiative lifetime of the first excited $^{229}$Th$^{4+}$ nuclear state in ionic crystals provides narrow spectroscopic linewidths, enabling the realization of a solid-state nuclear clock. Due to the 4+ noble gas configuration, electronic readout or state initialization schemes known from atomic clocks are inaccessible. This elongates the interrogation cycle, which will deteriorate the clock performance. To address this limitation we demonstrate laser-induced quenching (LIQ) as a method of depumping the $^{229}$Th isomer population in CaF$_2$. We provide experimental evidence for LIQ at different wavelengths (148 - 420 nm) and temperatures (100 - 350 K), achieving a threefold reduction in the isomer lifetime with 20 mW of laser power.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials: Origins and progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the discovery of ultrafast demagnetization in Ni thin films in 1996, laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics have become a prominent research topic in the field of magnetism and spintronics. This development offers new possibilities for the advancement of spintronics and magnetic storage technology. The subject has drawn a substantial number of researchers, leading to a series of research endeavors. Various models have been proposed to elucidate the physical processes underlying laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics in ferromagnetic materials. However, the potential origins of these processes across different material systems and the true contributions of these different origins remain challenging in the realm of ultrafast spin dynamics. This predicament also hinders the development of spintronic terahertz emitters. In this review, we initially introduce the different experimental methods used in laser-induced ultrafast spin dynamics. We then systematically explore the magnetization precession process and present seven models of ultrafast demagnetization in ferromagnetic materials. Subsequently, we discuss the physical processes and research status of four ultrafast demagnetization origins (including spin-flipping, spin transport, non-thermal electronic distribution, and laser-induced lattice strain). Since attosecond laser technique and antiferromagnetic materials exhibit promising applications in ultrahigh-frequency spintronics, we acknowledge the emerging studies used by attosecond pules and studies on ultrafast spin dynamics in antiferromagnets, noting the significant challenges that need to be addressed in these burgeoning field.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic stress, couple stress and flux tensors derived through energetic equivalence from microscopic continuous and discrete heterogeneous finite representative volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous derivation of equations to evaluate the macroscopic stress tensor, the couple stress tensor, and the flux vector equivalent to underlying microscopic fields in continuous and discrete heterogeneous systems with independent displacements and rotations. Contrary to the classical asymptotic expansion homogenization, finite size representative volume is considered. First, the macroscopic quantities are derived for a heterogeneous Cosserat continuum. The resulting continuum equations are discretized to provide macroscopic quantities in discrete heterogeneous systems. Finally, the expressions for discrete system are derived once again, this time considering the discrete nature directly.
  The formulations are presented in two variants, considering either internal or external forces, couples, and fluxes. The derivation is based on the virtual work equivalence and elucidates the fundamental significance of the couple stress tensor in the context of balance equations and admissible virtual deformation modes. Notably, an additional term in the couple stress tensor formula emerges, explaining its dependence on the reference system and position of the macroscopic point. The resulting equations are verified by comparing their predictions with known analytical solutions and results of other numerical models under both steady state and transient conditions.</description>

      <title>Barkhausen noise in the columnar hexagonal organic ferroelectric BTA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upon a polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material, one stable state changes into another which is typically described by a progression of switching events of smaller fractions of the material. These events give rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise and follow a characteristic distribution in their sizes. Barkhausen noise has been studied to better understand the switching processes of ferroelectrics and has been applied for inorganic ferroelectric materials and perovskites. In this work, we present results from kinetic Monte Carlo simulations investigating the switching process of the small organic molecular ferroelectric benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamides (BTAs). For temperatures below 175 K and sufficiently strong structural disorder, the system exhibits self-organized critical behavior; for higher temperatures, a creep regime is entered. Our extracted power-law exponents are smaller than those typically measured in inorganic crystals and ceramics which indicates that in the more disordered material BTA larger spanning avalanches are possible. The system was experimentally investigated with a high-sensitivity setup. No Barkhausen noise was observed which is consistent with the simulated event sizes, lying several orders beneath the noise threshold of the experimental setup. This finding corroborates the notion that switching in BTA progresses along the 1D columns in the hexagonal liquid crystal lattice, with little coupling between the columns that could give rise to larger lateral avalanches.</description>

      <title>Barkhausen noise in the organic ferroelectric copolymer P(VDF:TrFE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization reversal within a ferroelectric material is commonly described as a progression of smaller switching events, giving rise to crackling or Barkhausen noise. While studies on Barkhausen noise, and particularly the associated event size distribution, allow for better understanding of switching processes in ferroelectrics, they were not yet conducted experimentally on organic ferroelectric materials. In this work, Barkhausen noise in the organic ferroelectric copolymer poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF:TrFE)) is experimentally investigated under different electric fields, increasing at various rates. A weak dependence of the structure of the Barkhausen noise on both the magnitude and rise time of the applied electric field is observed, which manifests as a trend in the probability density function power-law exponents. Specifically, an increase in maximum electric field leads to an increase of the power-law exponent; increasing the rise time causes a parallel shift towards lower exponents. While these findings do not allow to conclusively confirm or refute universal self-organized critical behavior of the polarization reversal avalanches in P(VDF:TrFE), the exponents were found to seemingly converge to the universal value of 1.5 for fast and strong driving, suggesting the system is close to this limit.</description>
