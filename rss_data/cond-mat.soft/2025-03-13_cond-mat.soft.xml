      <title>A generalized framework for viscous and non-viscous damping models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inadequacy of the classical viscous damping model in capturing dissipation across a wide range of applications has led to the development of non-viscous damping models. While non-viscous models describe damping force satisfactorily, they offer limited physical insight. Leveraging an existing framework, well known to the physics community, this article provides fresh insights into the framework of non viscous damping for engineers. For this purpose, we revisit the motion of a particle coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators at a finite temperature. We obtain a general expression for non-viscous damping in terms of a general memory kernel function. For specific choices of the kernel function, we derive exact expressions for a host of non-viscous damping models including the classical viscous damping as a special case.</description>

      <title>Real-time simulation enabled navigation control of magnetic soft continuum robots in confined lumens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic soft continuum robots (MSCRs) have emerged as a promising technology for minimally invasive interventions, offering enhanced dexterity and remote-controlled navigation in confined lumens. Unlike conventional guidewires with pre-shaped tips, MSCRs feature a magnetic tip that actively bends under applied magnetic fields. Despite extensive studies in modeling and simulation, achieving real-time navigation control of MSCRs in confined lumens remains a significant challenge. The primary reasons are due to robot-lumen contact interactions and computational limitations in modeling MSCR nonlinear behavior under magnetic actuation. Existing approaches, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations and energy-minimization techniques, suffer from high computational costs and oversimplified contact interactions, making them impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we develop a real-time simulation and navigation control framework that integrates hard-magnetic elastic rod theory, formulated within the Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) framework, with an order-reduced contact handling strategy. Our approach captures large deformations and complex interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. Next, the navigation control problem is formulated as an inverse design task, where optimal magnetic fields are computed in real time by minimizing the constrained forces and enhancing navigation accuracy. We validate the proposed framework through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental studies, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and accuracy. The results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high-fidelity modeling, making it feasible for real-time deployment in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Modeling and computation of the effective elastic behavior of parallelogram origami metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Scattering of Mechanically Driven Polymers using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep learning approach for analyzing two-dimensional scattering data of semiflexible polymers under external forces. In our framework, scattering functions are compressed into a three-dimensional latent space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and two converter networks establish a bidirectional mapping between the polymer parameters (bending modulus, stretching force, and steady shear) and the scattering functions. The training data are generated using off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations to avoid the orientational bias inherent in lattice models, ensuring robust sampling of polymer conformations. The feasibility of this bidirectional mapping is demonstrated by the organized distribution of polymer parameters in the latent space. By integrating the converter networks with the VAE, we obtain a generator that produces scattering functions from given polymer parameters and an inferrer that directly extracts polymer parameters from scattering data. While the generator can be utilized in a traditional least-squares fitting procedure, the inferrer produces comparable results in a single pass and operates three orders of magnitude faster. This approach offers a scalable, automated tool for polymer scattering analysis and provides a promising foundation for extending the method to other scattering models, experimental validation, and the study of time-dependent scattering data.</description>

      <title>Extreme resilience and dissipation in heterogeneous disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long range order and symmetry in heterogeneous materials architected on crystal lattices lead to elastic and inelastic anisotropies and thus limit mechanical functionalities in particular crystallographic directions. Here, we present a facile approach for designing heterogeneous disordered materials that exhibit nearly isotropic mechanical resilience and energy dissipation capabilities. We demonstrate, through experiments and numerical simulations on 3D-printed prototypes, that near-complete isotropy can be attained in the proposed heterogeneous materials with a small, finite number of random spatial points. We also show that adding connectivity between random subdomains leads to much enhanced elastic stiffness, plastic strength, energy dissipation, shape recovery, structural stability and reusability in our new heterogeneous materials. Overall, our study opens avenues for the rational design of a new class of heterogeneous materials with isotropic mechanical functionalities for which the engineered disorder throughout the subdomains plays a crucial role.</description>

      <title>Dense suspensions as trainable rheological metafluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Memory-forming properties introduce a new paradigm to the design of adaptive materials. In dense suspensions, an adaptive response is enabled by non-Newtonian rheology; however, typical suspensions have little memory, which implies rapid cessation of any adapted behavior. Here we show how multiple adaptive responses can be achieved by designing suspensions where different stress levels trigger different memories. This is enabled by the interplay of interactions based on frictional contact and dynamic chemical bridging. These two interactions lead to novel rheology with several well-delineated shear thinning and thickening regimes, which enable stress-activated memories associated with opposite time-dependent trends. As a result, in response to different stress levels, the suspension can evolve by either softening or stiffening and is trainable, exhibiting targeted viscosity and energy dissipation with repeated low-velocity impact. Such behavior, usually associated with mechanical metamaterials, suggests that dense suspensions with multiple memories can be viewed as trainable rheological metafluids.</description>

      <title>PolyMorph: Extension of PolyHoop for tissue morphogenesis coupled to chemical signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PolyMorph, a lightweight standalone C++ program that extends its predecessor PolyHoop by a finite-difference solver for multi-component reaction-advection-diffusion equations. PolyMorph simulates two integral parts of tissue morphogenesis in two dimensions: 1) the mechanics of cellular deformation, growth and proliferation, and 2) transport and reaction of an arbitrary number of chemical species. Both of these components are bidirectionally coupled, allowing cells to base their behavior on local information on concentrations and flow, and allowing the chemical transport and reaction kinetics to depend on spatial information such as the local cell type. This bidirectional feedback makes PolyMorph a versatile tool to study a variety of cellular morphogenetic processes such as chemotaxis, cell sorting, tissue patterning with morphogen gradients, Turing patterning, and diffusion- or supply-limited growth with sub-cellular resolution.</description>

      <title>Melting of rods on a sphere via an intermediate hexatic phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied, using molecular dynamics simulations, the pressure-induced melting in a monolayer of soft repulsive spherocylinders whose centers of mass are constrained to move on the surface of a sphere. We show that the orientational degrees of freedom of the spherocylinders exhibit nematic order, whereas the positions of their centers of mass exhibit melting transitions that depend on the radius of the confining spherical surface. Our system presents a unique scenario where the decoupling of the orientational degrees of freedom from the positional degrees of freedom leads to an effectively two-dimensional (2D) crystal-to-liquid transition on a spherical surface. Further study of the nature of this 2D melting on a sphere shows that the transition is a two-step process, and there exists a very small window of an intermediate hexatic phase between crystal and liquid phases. Similar results are found for flat monolayers (with the radius of the sphere $ R \rightarrow \infty $). We show that, interestingly, the structure of the defects, originating from the curvature of the substrate, also changes during melting.</description>

      <title>A Fresh Perspective on Water Dynamics in Aqueous Salt Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics in pure water and aqueous salt solutions remain incompletely understood, partly due to the apparent contradictions between results from different spectroscopic techniques. In this work, we demonstrate, by detailed comparison of light scattering and dielectric spectroscopy data for pure water and aqueous lithium chloride solutions, that these apparent contradictions can be resolved by accounting for orientational cross-correlations of neighboring molecules. Remarkably, a single structural relaxation mode with largely temperature- and concentration-independent shape can be identified in all spectra, from room temperature down to the deeply supercooled regime. These results provide a new perspective for the study of molecular dynamics in aqueous salt solutions.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Adaptive Force Chains in Reconfigurable Granular Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under an externally applied load, granular packings form force chains that depend on the contact network and moduli of the grains. In this work, we investigate packings of variable modulus (VM) particles, where we can direct force chains by changing the Young's modulus of individual particles within the packing on demand. Each VM particle is made of a silicone shell that encapsulates a core made of a low-melting-point metallic alloy (Field's metal). By sending an electric current through a co-located copper heater, the Field's metal internal to each particle can be melted via Joule heating, which softens the particle. As the particle cools to room temperature, the alloy solidifies and the particle recovers its original modulus. To optimize the mechanical response of granular packings containing both soft and stiff particles, we employ an evolutionary algorithm coupled with discrete element method simulations to predict the patterns of particle moduli that will yield specific force outputs on the assembly boundaries. The predicted patterns of particle moduli from the simulations were realized in experiments using 2D assemblies of VM particles and the force outputs on the assembly boundaries were measured using photoelastic techniques. These studies represent a step towards making robotic granular metamaterials that can dynamically adapt their mechanical properties in response to different environmental conditions or perform specific tasks on demand.</description>

Abstract: We construct the most general equilibrium partition function for Newton-Cartan membranes of codimension-1 defined on a flat ambient Newton-Cartan spacetime at second order in the hydrodynamic derivative expansion. We find the equilibrium constraints and the corresponding set of equilibrium constitutive relations.

      <title>Discovering dynamic laws from observations: the case of self-propelled, interacting colloids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.14846v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter spans a wide range of time and length scales, from groups of cells and synthetic self-propelled particles to schools of fish, flocks of birds, or even human crowds. The theoretical framework describing these systems has shown tremendous success at finding universal phenomenology. However, further progress is often burdened by the difficulty of determining the forces that control the dynamics of the individual elements within each system. Accessing this local information is key to understanding the physics dominating the system and to create the models that can explain the observed collective phenomena. In this work, we present a machine-learning model, a graph neural network, that uses the collective movement of the system to learn the active and two-body forces controlling the individual dynamics of the particles. We verify our approach using numerical simulations of active brownian particles, considering different interaction potentials and levels of activity. Finally, we apply our model to experiments of electrophoretic Janus particles, extracting the active and two-body forces that control the dynamics of the colloids. Due to this, we can uncover the physics dominating the behavior of the system. We extract an active force that depends on the electric field and also area fraction. We also discover a dependence of the two-body interaction with the electric field that leads us to propose that the dominant force between these colloids is a screened electrostatic interaction with a constant length scale. We expect that this methodology can open a new avenue for the study and modeling of experimental systems of active particles.</description>

      <title>Polar Nematic Phases with Enantiotropic Ferro- and Antiferroelectric Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a new ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystalline phase became of utmost interest for the liquid crystal (LC) and the whole soft and condensed matter fields. Contrary to the previously known ferroelectric LC materials, whose ferroelectric characteristics were much weaker, new polar nematics exhibit properties comparable to solid ferroelectrics. This discovery brought about tremendous efforts to further explore compounds showing these phases, and fascinating physical properties have been reported. Herein, we present the first synthesized compounds with the enantiotropic ferro- (NF) and antiferroelectric (NX) nematic phases. The enantiotropic nature and an unprecedentedly broad temperature range of NF and NX phases are confirmed by various experimental techniques: polarized-light optical microscopy (POM) observations, different scanning calorimetry (DSC), dielectric spectroscopy, second harmonic generation (SHG), and molecular modeling. The presented achievements in designing achiral compounds that exhibit enantiotropic polar nematic phases with ferro- and antiferroelectric properties significantly contribute to the development of multicomponent mixtures with a broad temperature range of NF and NX phases down to room temperature. Furthermore, this accomplishment considerably enhances the general understanding of the structural correlations that promote polar nematic liquid crystal phases with high thermodynamic stability. Finally, this work may benefit various applications in photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Experimental observation of gapped shear waves and liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover in active granular matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike crystalline solids, liquids lack long-range order, resulting in diffusive shear fluctuations rather than propagating waves. Simulations predict that liquids exhibit a $k$-gap in wave-vector space, where solid-like transverse waves reappear above this gap. Experimental evidence in classical liquids has been limited, observed only in 2D dusty plasmas. Here, we investigate this phenomenon using active Brownian vibrators and uncover distinct gas-like and liquid-like phases depending on the packing fraction. We measure key properties, including pair correlation functions, mean square displacements, velocity auto-correlation functions, and vibrational density of states. In the liquid-like phase, we confirm the $k$-gap in transverse excitations, whose size grows as the packing fraction decreases and eventually disappears in the gas phase. Our findings extend the concept of the $k$-gap to active granular systems and reveal striking parallels with supercritical fluids.</description>

Abstract: We numerically analyze the steady flow of two-dimensional granular materials in a rotating drum using the discrete element method and a continuum model. The velocity fields obtained from both methods are quantitatively consistent. Two distinct regions exist in the granular flow: the surface flow layer and the static flow regime associated with the rigid rotation near the bottom. The thickness of the surface flow layer increases with the drum diameter and shows a slight dependence on the angular velocity of the rotating drum. We derived scaling laws for the velocity profile and surface layer thickness using dimensional analysis applied to the continuum equations. The validity of the scaling laws is confirmed numerically.</description>

      <title>Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same packing fractions, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic methods for confined fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and microstructure of confined fluids with small particle number are best described using the canonical ensemble. However, practical calculations can usually only be performed in the grand-canonical ensemble, which can introduce unphysical artifacts. We employ the method of asymptotics to transform grand-canonical observables to the canonical ensemble, where the former can be conveniently obtained using the classical density functional theory of inhomogeneous fluids. By formulating the ensemble transformation as a contour integral in the complex fugacity plane we reveal the influence of the Yang-Lee zeros in determining the form and convergence properties of the asymptotic series. The theory is employed to develop expansions for the canonical partition function and the canonical one-body density. Numerical investigations are then performed using an exactly soluble one-dimensional model system of hard-rods.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left- or right-handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer-twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, we develop two types of achiral molecules (BOE-NO2 and DIOLT) that possess different molecular structure but exhibit a NF-ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. We demonstrate that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE-NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.</description>

      <title>Insights into Formation of Bicontinuous Emulsion Gels via in-situ (Ultra-)Small Angle X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanostructured materials formed via kinetically controlled self-assembly processes gather more interest nowadays. Bicontinuous emulsion gels stabilized by colloidal particles, called bijels, are attractive materials in soft-matter as they combine bulk properties of two immiscible liquids into an interwoven network structure. The limited understanding of the complex formation phenomena of bijels restricts the control over the synthesis, and so its applicability. In this work, in-situ (ultra-) small-angle X-ray scattering is applied to gain insight into the phase separation and self-assembly kinetics of bijels formed via solvent transfer induced phase separation. An X-ray compatible microfluidic setup allows accessing the process kinetics with a millisecond resolution. The formation of such bijels is shown to occur via three consecutive steps related to fluid mechanics, nanoparticle self-assembly and liquid-liquid phase separation. This time-resolved monitor technique offers valuable insights into the structural evolution of kinetically controlled materials and enhances our understanding of the formation of bicontinuous emulsion gels.</description>

      <title>Emergent active turbulence and intermittency in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active-fluid turbulence has been found in bacterial suspensions, but not so far in their algal counterparts. We present the first experimental evidence for turbulence in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the flow present in these cell suspensions and show that they are quantitatively distinct from their counterparts in two-dimensional fluid and bacterial turbulence. Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms.</description>

      <title>Epithelial layer fluidization by curvature-induced unjamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12667v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transition of an epithelial layer from a stationary, quiescent state to a highly migratory, dynamic state is required for wound healing, development, and regeneration. This transition, known as the unjamming transition (UJT), is responsible for epithelial fluidization and collective migration. Previous theoretical models have primarily focused on the UJT in flat epithelial layers, neglecting the effects of strong surface curvature characteristic of the epithelium \textit{in vivo}. In this study, we investigate the role of surface curvature on tissue plasticity and cellular migration using a vertex model embedded on a spherical surface. Our findings reveal that increasing curvature promotes the UJT by reducing the energy barriers to cellular rearrangements. Higher curvature favors cell intercalation, mobility, and self-diffusivity, resulting in epithelial structures that are malleable and migratory when small, but become more rigid and stationary as they grow. Together, these results provide a conceptual framework to better understand how cell shape, cell propulsion, and tissue geometry contribute to tissue malleability, remodeling, and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Emergent turbulence and coarsening arrest in active-spinner fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover activity-driven crossover from phase separation to a new turbulent state in a two-dimensional system of counter-rotating spinners. We study the statistical properties of this active-rotor turbulence using the active-rotor Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model, and show that the vorticity $\omega \propto \phi$, the scalar field that distinguishes regions with different rotating states. We explain this intriguing proportionality theoretically, and we characterize power-law energy and concentration spectra, intermittency, and flow-topology statistics. We suggest biological implications of such turbulence.</description>
