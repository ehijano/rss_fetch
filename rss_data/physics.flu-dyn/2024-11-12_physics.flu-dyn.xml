      <title>ConvNet-Based Prediction of Droplet Collision Dynamics in Microchannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of droplet collisions in microchannels are inherently complex, governed by multiple interdependent physical and geometric factors. Understanding and predicting the outcomes of these collisions-whether coalescence, reverse-back, or pass-over-pose significant challenges, particularly due to the deformability of droplets and the influence of key parameters such as viscosity ratios, density ratios, confinement, and initial offset of droplets. Traditional methods for analyzing these collisions, including computational simulations and experimental techniques, are time-consuming and resource-intensive, limiting their scalability for real-time applications. In this work, we explore a novel data-driven approach to predict droplet collision outcomes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN-based approach presents a significant advantage over traditional methods, offering faster, scalable solutions for analyzing large datasets with varying physical parameters. Using a lattice Boltzmann method based on Cahn-Hilliard diffuse interface theory for binary immiscible fluids, we numerically generated droplet collision data under confined shear flow. This data, represented as droplet shapes, serves as input to the CNN model, which automatically learns hierarchical features from the images, allowing for accurate and efficient collision outcome predictions based on deformation and orientation. The model achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.972, even on test datasets with varied density and viscosity ratios not included in training. Our findings suggest that the CNN-based models offer improved accuracy in predicting collision outcomes while drastically reducing computational and time constraints. This work highlights the potential of machine learning to advance droplet dynamics studies, providing a valuable tool for researchers in fluid dynamics and soft matter.</description>

      <title>The Footprint of Laminar Separation on a Wall-Bounded Wing Section at Transitional Reynolds Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a chordwise Reynolds number (Re) falls below about $10^5$ the performance of wings and aerodynamic sections become sensitive to viscous phenomena, including boundary layer separation and possible reattachment. Here, detailed measurements of the flow inside the boundary layer on the suction surface are shown for an aspect ratio 3 wing with wall boundaries. The separation lines and recirculation zones are shown on the wing and on the wall junction as Re and angle of incidence, ($\alpha$) are varied. There is good agreement on the lowest Re case which has also been computed in direct numerical simulation. Though the flow at midspan may sometimes be described as two-dimensional, at $\alpha \leq 6^\circ$ it is unrepresentative of the remainder of the wing, and the influence of the wall is seen in strong spanwise flows aft of the separation line. The geometry of the NACA 65(1)-412 section, used here, promotes a substantial chord length for the development of the recirculating regions behind separation making it apt for their study. However, the phenomena themselves are likely to be found over a wide range of wings with moderate thickness at moderate $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>How vortices enhance heat transfer from an oscillating plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oscillations of a heated solid surface in an oncoming fluid flow can increase heat transfer from the solid to the fluid. Previous studies have investigated the resulting heat transfer enhancement for the case of a circular cylinder undergoing translational or rotational motions. Another common geometry, the flat plate, has not been studied as thoroughly. The flat plate sheds larger and stronger vortices that are sensitive to the plate's direction of oscillation. To study the effect of these vortices on heat transfer enhancement, we compute the heat transfer from a flat plate with different orientations and oscillation directions in an oncoming flow with Reynolds number 100. We consider plates with fixed temperature and fixed heat flux, and find large heat transfer enhancement in both cases. We investigate the effects of the plate orientation angle and the plate oscillation direction, velocity, amplitude, and frequency, and find that the plate oscillation velocity and direction have the strongest effects on global heat transfer. The other parameters mainly affect the local heat transfer distributions through shed vorticity distributions. We also discuss the input power needed for the oscillating plate system and the resulting Pareto optimal cases.</description>

      <title>3D characterization of reattached flow on an airfoil with finite-span synthetic jet flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes prior studies to develop a comprehensive three-dimensional description of reattached flow over an airfoil controlled by finite-span SJA arrays. When applied to a longer-span wing, the flow field exhibits three distinct regions: a directly controlled region, an unaffected region, and a transitional zone between them. Through the integration of multiple visualizations and measurements from both discrete and slot-style SJAs, this work provides insights into the shear layer behavior. The analysis of reattached mean flow provides insight into the interactions between controlled and surrounding flows, demonstrating broad applicability across different SJA configurations</description>

      <title>An experimental and numerical study on the behavior of finite-length column vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores experimental and numerical investigation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of a finite-length vortex column in three dimensions using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES). The research examines the combined impact of bending, buckling, and core-splitting on a finite-length vortex column. More precisely, the work centers on the fundamental motions, evolutions in flow along the axis, how the shape of the vortex core changes over time, the instability caused by the long waves on the vortex column, and the division of the vortex core. A novel prototype is developed that utilizes piston-driven inflow and produces a vortex column through the principles of flow separation and Biot-Savart induction, which is studied for predicting an ex-situ cyclonic line vortex. The present study discusses the complete three-dimensional overview of the same columnar vortex. The meridional swirl and the axial transport of vorticity deform the shape of the core cross-sections in different lengths of the column. The jump in the axial velocity at the core boundary allows for the occurrence of bending instabilities with a left-handed helical structure. These instabilities have a long wavelength, similar to the length of the vortex column, and belong to the m=+1 mode. The vortex column experiences a non-uniform curvature and torsion caused by the intricate shape of the laboratory model and varying flow speeds at different heights of the vortex column. The results offer valuable insights into the role of inertia, Coriolis, and viscous forces on the dynamics of the vortex column.</description>

      <title>Flow Dynamics of the Transversely Oscillating Tapered Circular Cylinder under Vortex-Induced Vibrations at low Reynolds number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study numerically investigates the influence of the taper on the flow-induced vibrations of an elastically mounted circular cylinder under Vortex-induced vibrations. The dynamic response of three different taper ratios defined as 12 (highly tapered cylinder), 20 (medium tapered cylinder), and 40 (low tapered cylinder))is studied at a fixed Reynolds number, defined based on the averaged cylinder diameter, of 150. The amplitude and frequency response of the tapered cylinder is characterized by a low mass ratio (defined as the ratio of the total oscillating mass to the displaced fluid mass) = 2 over the wide range of reduced velocity covering the full amplitude-response spectrum (based on the oscillation amplitude) of the VIV. The results show the existence of difference in the spanwise shedding of vortices owing to the poor spanwise pressure correlation. The flow field analysis in the wake of the oscillating cylinder reveals the dominance of the three-dimensional structures in the wake (near the top end with the larger diameter) behind the cylinder with the increase in the taper ratio (even at such low where the uniform cylinder exhibits the two-dimensional wake). Also, the tapered cylinder exhibits a wide range of frequency synchronization (i.e. wide lock-in area) compared to the uniform cylinder. Tapering the cylinder results in the shift of the peak of the max oscillation amplitude or, in turn, the shift in the transitioning of the response branches. Further, force decomposition, energy transfer, and phase dynamics are also discussed for the taper cylinders.</description>

      <title>Influence of three-dimensionality on wake synchronization of oscillatory cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of three-dimensionality on the synchronization characteristics of the wake behind an oscillating circular cylinder at Re = 300. Cylinder oscillations in rotation, transverse translation, and streamwise translation are considered. We utilize phase-reduction analysis, which quantifies the phase-sensitivity function of periodic flows, to examine the synchronization properties. Here, we present an ensemble-based framework for phase-reduction analysis to handle three-dimensional wakes that are not perfectly time-periodic. Based on the phase-sensitivity functions, synchronizability to three types of cylinder oscillations is evaluated. In spite of similar trends, we find that phase-sensitivity functions involving three-dimensional wakes are lower in magnitude compared to those of two-dimensional wakes, which leads to narrower conditions for synchronization to weak cylinder oscillations. We unveil that the difference between the phase-sensitivity functions of two- and three-dimensional flows is strongly correlated to the amplitude variation of the three-dimensional flow by the cylinder motions. This finding reveals that the cylinder motion modifies the three-dimensionality of the wake as well as the phase of vortex shedding, which leads to reduced phase modulation. The synchronization conditions of three-dimensional wakes, predicted by phase-reduction analysis, agree with the identification by parametric studies using direct numerical simulations for forced oscillations with small amplitudes. This study presents the potential capability of phase-reduction to study synchronization characteristics of complex flows.</description>

      <title>A conservative degree adaptive HDG method for transient incompressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to assess the accuracy of degree adaptive strategies in the context of incompressible Navier-Stokes flows using the high order hybridisable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method.
  Design/methodology/approach: The work presents a series of numerical examples to show the inability of standard degree adaptive processes to accurate capture aerodynamic quantities of interest, in particular the drag. A new conservative projection is proposed and the results between a standard degree adaptive procedure and the adaptive process enhanced with this correction are compared. The examples involve two transient problems where flow vortices or a gust needs to be accurately propagated over long distances.
  \noindent \textbf{}Findings:polynomials with a lower degree. Due to the coupling of velocity-pressure in incompressible flows, the violation of the incompressibility constraint leads to inaccurate pressure fields in the wake that have a sizeable effect on the drag. The new conservative projection proposed is found to remove all the numerical artefacts shown by the standard adaptive process.
  Originality/value: This work proposes a new conservative projection for the degree adaptive process. The projection does not introduce a significant overhead because it requires to solve an element-by-element problem and only for those elements where the adaptive process lowers the degree of approximation. Numerical results show that with the proposed projection non-physical oscillations in the drag disappear and the results are in good agreement with reference solutions.</description>

      <title>Effects of confinement, impinging shock deflection angle, and Mach number on the flow field of a supersonic open cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavities exhibit inherent self-sustaining oscillations driven by the coupling between their hydrodynamic and acoustic properties. In practical applications, cavities are often placed within confinements that introduce compression waves, significantly influencing their primary flow characteristics. The oscillations in cavities have widespread applications, such as in fuel-air mixing, heat exchangers, and landing gears However, when resonance occurs, these oscillations can lead to structural failures. Therefore, understanding cavity oscillations under diverse geometrical configurations and flow conditions is essential. The present study examines the impact of top wall confinement on an open cavity with a length-to-depth ratio (L/D) ratio of 3 at Mach 1.71, along with the effects of varying deflection angles on flow characteristics and the influence of an increased Mach number on configurations with the highest and lowest oscillation frequencies. A three-dimensional numerical investigation is carried out, employing large eddy simulations within the OpenFOAM framework. We analyze the flow fields through the spatial variation of density over time. Fast Fourier Transformation and Wavelet Transformation reveal the frequency content from unsteady pressure signals and illustrate its evolution over time under different conditions. Additionally, reduced-order modeling provides a better understanding of the relationship between frequencies and flow structures of the cavity. Results from these analyses demonstrate that top wall confinement increases oscillation frequency, while greater deflection angles introduce Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in the flow field, reducing the frequency. An increase in the Mach number to 2, further intensifies instability, substantially affecting oscillations.</description>

      <title>New Higher-Order Super-Compact Finite Difference Scheme to Study Three-Dimensional Natural Convection and Entropy Generation in Non-Newtonian Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new higher-order super-compact (HOSC) implicit finite difference scheme for analyzing three-dimensional (3D) natural convection and entropy generation in non-Newtonian fluids. The proposed scheme achieves fourth-order accuracy in space and second-order accuracy in time while utilizing only seven directly adjacent grid points of the compact stencils at the $(n+1)$ time level, making it highly efficient and super compact. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first higher-order accurate finite difference scheme proposed to study 3D natural convection and entropy generation in non-Newtonian fluids. A time-marching technique is applied, where pressure corrections are addressed using a modified artificial compressibility method. The scheme is applied to the power-law model of non-Newtonian fluids, investigating both shear-thinning and shear-thickening effects on natural convection and entropy generation within a 3D cubic cavity. In the numerical simulations, the Prandtl number remains constant at $Pr = 1.0$, while various Rayleigh numbers ($Ra = 10^2$, $10^3$, $10^4$, $10^5$) and power-law indices ($n = 0.75$, $1.0$, $1.25$) are considered. Results are presented in terms of isotherms, streamlines, Nusselt numbers, Bejan numbers, and local entropy generation rates. The validation of the proposed scheme demonstrates excellent agreement with existing benchmark results. The numerical study reveals that the $n$ and $Ra$ have significant impacts on flow dynamics, heat transfer, and entropy generation. As $Ra$ increases, the maximum value of average Nusselt number ($Nu_{\text{avg}}$) also increases, whereas an opposite trend is observed with $n$ values. Shear-thinning fluids demonstrate the highest convection efficiency compared to Newtonian and shear-thickening fluids at any specific $Ra$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model acoustic dynamics in space and time from synthetic sensor data. The tasks are (i) to predict and extrapolate the spatiotemporal dynamics, and (ii) reconstruct the acoustic state from partial observations. To achieve this, we develop acoustic neural networks that learn from sensor data, whilst being constrained by prior knowledge on acoustic and wave physics by both informing the training and constraining parts of the network's architecture as an inductive bias. First, we show that standard feedforward neural networks are unable to extrapolate in time, even in the simplest case of periodic oscillations. Second, we constrain the prior knowledge on acoustics in increasingly effective ways by (i) employing periodic activations (periodically activated neural networks); (ii) informing the training of the networks with a penalty term that favours solutions that fulfil the governing equations (soft-constrained); (iii) constraining the architecture in a physically-motivated solution space (hard-constrained); and (iv) combination of these. Third, we apply the networks on two testcases for two tasks in nonlinear regimes, from periodic to chaotic oscillations. The first testcase is a twin experiment, in which the data is produced by a prototypical time-delayed model. In the second testcase, the data is generated by a higher-fidelity model with mean-flow effects and a kinematic model for the flame source. We find that (i) constraining the physics in the architecture improves interpolation whilst requiring smaller network sizes, (ii) extrapolation in time is achieved by periodic activations, and (iii) velocity can be reconstructed accurately from only pressure measurements with a combination of physics-based hard and soft constraints. In and beyond acoustics, this work opens strategies for constraining the physics in the architecture, rather than the training.</description>

      <title>Flagellum Pumping Efficacy in Shear-Thinning Viscoelastic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microorganism motility often takes place within complex, viscoelastic fluid environments, e.g., sperm in cervicovaginal mucus and bacteria in biofilms. In such complex fluids, strains and stresses generated by the microorganism are stored and relax across a spectrum of length and time scales and the complex fluid can be driven out of its linear response regime. Phenomena not possible in viscous media thereby arise from feedback between the "swimmer" and the complex fluid, making swimming efficiency co-dependent on the propulsion mechanism and fluid properties. Here we parameterize a flagellar motor and filament properties together with elastic relaxation and nonlinear shear-thinning properties of the fluid in a computational immersed boundary model. We then explore swimming efficiency over this parameter space. One exemplary insight is that motor efficiency (measured by the volumetric flow rate) can be boosted vs.\ degraded by moderate vs.\ strong shear-thinning of the viscoelastic environment.</description>

      <title>Turbulent flows over porous and rough substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15244v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows over porous substrates are studied via a systematic exploration of the dependence of the flow properties on the substrate parameters, including permeability $K$, grain pitch $L$, and depth $h$. The study uses direct numerical simulations mainly for staggered-cube substrates with $L^+\approx10$ - $50$, $\sqrt{K}/L\approx0.01$ - $0.25$, and depths from $h=O(L)$ to $h\gg L$, ranging from typical impermeable rough surfaces to deep porous substrates. The results indicate that the permeability has significantly greater relevance than the grain size and microscale topology for the properties of the overlying flow, including the mean-flow slip and the shear across the interface, the drag increase relative to smooth-wall flow, and the statistics and spectra of the overlying turbulence, whereas the direct effect of grain size is only noticeable near the interface as grain-coherent flow fluctuations. The substrate depth also has a significant effect, with shallower substrates suppressing the effective transpiration at the interface. Based on the direct-simulation results, we propose an empirical `equivalent permeability' $K_{eq}^t$, that incorporates this effect and scales well the overlying turbulence for substrates with different depths, permeabilities, etc. Based on this, we propose a conceptual $h^+$-$\sqrt{K^+}$ regime diagram where, for any given substrate topology, turbulence transitions smoothly from that over impermeable rough surfaces with $h=O(L)$ to that over deep porous substrates with $h^+\gtrsim50$, with the latter limit determined by the typical lengthscale of the overlying pressure fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Topology of shallow-water waves on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological properties of the spectrum of shallow-water waves on a rotating spherical body are established. Particular attention is paid to its spectral flow, i.e. the modes whose frequencies transit between the Rossby and inertia-gravity wavebands as the zonal wave number is varied. Organising the modes according to the number of zeros of their meridional velocity, we conclude that the net number of modes transiting between the shallow-water wavebands on the sphere is null, in contrast with the Matsuno spectrum. This difference can be explained by a miscount of zeros under the $\beta$-plane approximation. We corroborate this result with the analysis of Delplace et al (2017) by showing that the curved metric discloses a pair of degeneracy points in the Weyl symbol of the wave operator, non-existent under the $\beta$-plane approximation, each of them bearing a Chern number $-1$.</description>

      <title>Data-driven computation of adjoint sensitivities without adjoint solvers: An application to thermoacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adjoint methods have been the pillar of gradient-based optimization for decades. They enable the accurate computation of a gradient (sensitivity) of a quantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters in one calculation. When the gradient is embedded in an optimization routine, the quantity of interest can be optimized for the system to have the desired behaviour. Adjoint methods require the system's governing equations and their Jacobian. We propose a computational strategy to infer the adjoint sensitivities from data when the governing equations might be unknown (or partly unknown), and noise might be present. The key component of this strategy is an echo state network, which learns the dynamics of nonlinear regimes with varying parameters, and evolves dynamically via a hidden state. Although the framework is general, we focus on thermoacoustics governed by nonlinear and time-delayed systems. First, we show that a parameter-aware Echo State Network (ESN) infers the parameterized dynamics. Second, we derive the adjoint of the ESN to compute the sensitivity to parameters and initial conditions. Third, we propose the Thermoacoustic Echo State Network (T-ESN), which embeds the physical knowledge in the network architecture. Fourth, we apply the framework to a variety of nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes of a prototypical system. We show that the T-ESN accurately infers the correct adjoint sensitivities of the time-averaged acoustic energy with respect to the flame parameters. The results are robust to noisy data, from periodic, through quasiperiodic, to chaotic regimes. A single network predicts the nonlinear bifurcations on unseen scenarios, and so the inferred adjoint sensitivities are employed to suppress an instability via steepest descent. This work opens new possibilities for gradient-based data-driven design optimization.</description>

      <title>Unification theory of instabilities of visco-diffusive swirling flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal theory of linear instabilities in swirling flows, occurring in both natural settings and industrial applications, is formulated. The theory encompasses a wide range of open and confined flows, including spiral isothermal flows and baroclinic flows driven by radial temperature gradients and natural gravity in rotating fluids. By employing short-wavelength local analysis, the theory generalizes previous findings from numerical simulations and linear stability analyses of specific swirling flows, such as spiral Couette flow, spiral Poiseuille flow, and baroclinic Couette flow. A general criterion, extending and unifying existing criteria for instability to both centrifugal and shear-driven perturbations in swirling flows is derived, taking into account viscosity and thermal diffusion, and guiding experimental and numerical investigations in the otherwise inaccessible parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>A consistent, volume preserving, and adaptive mesh refinement-based framework for modeling non-isothermal gas-liquid-solid flows with phase change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work expands on our recently introduced low Mach enthalpy method [1] for simulating the melting and solidification of a phase change material (PCM) alongside (or without) an ambient gas phase. The method captures PCM's volume change (shrinkage or expansion) by accounting for density change-induced flows. We present several improvements to the original work. First, we introduce consistent time integration schemes for the mass, momentum, and enthalpy equations, which enhance the method stability. Demonstrating the effectiveness of this scheme, we show that a system free of external forces and heat sources can conserve its initial mass, momentum, enthalpy, and phase composition. This allows the system to transition from a non-isothermal, non-equilibrium, phase-changing state to an isothermal, equilibrium state without exhibiting unrealistic behavior. Furthermore, we show that the low Mach enthalpy method accurately simulates thermocapillary flows without introducing spurious phase changes. We propose an analytical model to validate advanced CFD codes for simulating metal manufacturing processes like welding and 3D printing. These processes involve a heat source melting metal or alloy in an inert gas environment. Traditionally, validation relied on manipulating material properties to match complex experiments. Our model uses the Stefan problem with a density jump to provide a straightforward method for validating multiphysics simulations involving heat sources and phase changes in three-phase flows.Lastly, we demonstrate the practical utility of the method in modeling porosity defects (gas bubble trapping) during metal solidification. A field extension technique is used to accurately apply surface tension forces in a three-phase flow situation. This is where part of the bubble surface is trapped within the (moving) solidification front.</description>

      <title>Particle transport and deposition in wall-sheared thermal turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the transport and deposition behaviour of point particles in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection cells subjected to Couette-type wall shear. Direct numerical simulations (DNSs) are performed for Rayleigh number ($Ra$) in the range $10^7 \leq Ra \leq 10^9$ with a fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$, while the wall-shear Reynolds number ($Re_w$) is in the range $0 \leq Re_w \leq 12000$. With the increase of $Re_w$, the large-scale rolls expanded horizontally, evolving into zonal flow in two-dimensional simulations or streamwise-oriented rolls in three-dimensional simulations. We observed that, for particles with a small Stokes number ($St$), they either circulated within the large-scale rolls when buoyancy dominated or drifted near the walls when shear dominated. For medium $St$ particles, pronounced spatial inhomogeneity and preferential concentration were observed regardless of the prevailing flow state. For large $St$ particles, the turbulent flow structure had a minor influence on the particles' motion; although clustering still occurred, wall shear had a negligible influence compared with that for medium $St$ particles. We then presented the settling curves to quantify the particle deposition ratio on the walls. Our DNS results aligned well with previous theoretical predictions, which state that small $St$ particles settle with an exponential deposition ratio and large $St$ particles settle with a linear deposition ratio. For medium $St$ particles, where complex particle-turbulence interaction emerges, we developed a new model describing the settling process with an initial linear stage followed by a nonlinear stage. Unknown parameters in our model can be determined either by fitting the settling curves or using empirical relations. Compared with DNS results, our model also accurately predicts the average residence time across a wide range of $St$ for various $Re_w$.</description>

      <title>Fluid wetting and penetration characteristics in T-shaped microchannels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A thorough understanding of media tightness in automotive electronics is crucial for ensuring more reliable and compact product designs, ultimately improving product quality. Concerning the fundamental characteristics of fluid leakage issues, the dynamic wetting and penetration behavior on small scales is of special interest and importance. In this work, four T-shaped microchannels with one inlet and two outlets are experimentally investigated in terms of contact angle dynamics and interface movement over time, generating novel insight into the wetting mechanisms and fluid distribution. With a main channel width of 1 mm, a crevice width of w = 0.3 mm, 0.4 mm and a rounding edge radius of r = 0.1 mm, 0.2 mm, the geometrical effects on the fluid penetration depth in the crevice and the interface edge pinning effect are analyzed quantitatively using an automated image processing procedure. It is found that the measured dynamic contact angles in all parts can be well described by molecular kinetic theory using local contact line velocities, even with local surface effects and abrupt geometry changes. Moreover, a smaller crevice width, a sharper edge and a larger flow velocity tend to enhance the interface pinning effect and prevent fluid penetration into the crevice. The rounding radius has a more significant effect on the interface pinning compared with crevice width. The experimental data and image processing algorithm are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Impact of array interactions and control scheme on the wave sheltering performance of various wave energy converter archetypes for offshore wind turbines</title>

Abstract: Wave energy converter farms have the potential to reduce wave-induced fatigue loads on offshore wind turbines, reducing material, production, transportation, and wave energy converter farms have the potential to reduce wave-induced fatigue loads on offshore wind turbines, reducing material, production, transportation, and installation costs. Wave energy converters (WECs) dampen incoming waves, producing a sheltering effect for downstream bodies. This work compares the sheltering effect of three wave energy converter architectures (all rated for the same power production) and one floating breakwater. The near-field wave-body interactions and the far-field energy balance are modeled using linear potential flow theory in a boundary element method solver coupled with a spectral action balance model. Array interactions as well as the effect of different WEC control schemes on the wave field are also investigated. Finally, a relationship between wave height reduction and reduction in fatigue damage over the turbine lifetime is defined. Near-field interactions affected the far-field performance between 5% and 60% depending on configuration, control scheme, and architecture. The six-body arrays of oscillating surge, point absorber, and breakwater architectures performed similarly, providing up to 5.70% wave height reduction after 0.5 nautical miles. Finally, small reductions in wave height (2%) were observed to have large reductions in monopile fatigue damage due to wave loading over the turbine lifetime (10%)..</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Swimming in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain an active particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts by developing a novel physics-informed reinforcement learning strategy and comparing it with prescribed control and physics-agnostic reinforcement learning strategies. Our scheme, coined the actor-physicist, is an adaptation of the actor-critic algorithm in which the neural network parameterized critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function, the physicist. We validate the proposed physics-informed reinforcement learning approach through extensive numerical experiments in both synthetic BK and more realistic Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow environments, demonstrating its superiority in controlling particle dynamics when compared to standard reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Emergent vorticity asymmetry of one and two-layer shallow water system captured by a next-order balanced model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasigeostrophic (QG) system has served as a useful simplified model for understanding geophysical physical fluid phenomena. The fact that it is based on only one prognostic variable $\textrm{ -- }$ potential vorticity (PV) $\textrm{ -- }$ is a simplification that has facilitated much theoretical understanding. However, although QG captures many geophysical turbulence phenomena, it misses important features that occur in shallow water systems at finite Rossby numbers, even those that are "balanced". For example, QG does not capture the emergent vorticity asymmetry or the finite divergence of the velocity fields. Here we present a next-order-in-Rossby extension of QG in the single-layer and multi-layer shallow water context: SWQG$^{+1}$. A freely decaying simulation shows that SWQG$^{+1}$ can capture the negatively skewed vorticity found in simulations of the shallow water model in the same setting. We also extend the model to the multi-layer configuration. Simulation of nonlinear evolution of a baroclinically unstable jet in SWQG$^{+1}$ shows that it can capture vorticity asymmetry and finite divergence of strain-driven fronts. We propose here that SWQG$^{+1}$ could be a useful intermediate model for theoretical and numerical study of the balanced dynamics of geophysical physical fluid dynamics, with possible applications for forward and inverse modeling of atmospheres and oceans on Earth and other planets.</description>
