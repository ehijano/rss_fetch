      <title>Simulation of Transcatheter Therapies for Atrioventricular Valve Regurgitation in an Open-Source Finite Element Simulation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) and annuloplasty devices are increasingly used to treat mitral valve regurgitation, yet their mechanical effects and interactions remain poorly understood. This study aimed to establish an open-source finite element modeling (FEM) framework for simulating patient-specific mitral valve repairs and to evaluate how TEER, annuloplasty, and combined strategies influence leaflet coaptation and valve mechanics. Methods: Four G4 MitraClip geometries were modeled and deployed in FEBio to capture leaflet grasp and subsequent clip-leaflet motion under physiologic pressurization. CardioBand annuloplasty was simulated by reducing annular circumference via displacement-controlled boundary conditions, and Mitralign suture annuloplasty was modeled using discrete nodal constraints. Simulations were performed for prolapse and dilated annulus cases. Valve competence (regurgitant orifice area, ROA), coaptation/contact area (CA), and leaflet stress and strain distributions were quantified. Results: In prolapse, TEER restored coaptation but increased leaflet stresses, whereas band and suture annuloplasty produced distinct valve morphologies with lower stress distributions. In dilation, TEER alone left residual regurgitation, while annuloplasty improved closure. Combined TEER &amp; band annuloplasty minimized ROA, maximized CA, and reduced stresses relative to TEER alone, though stresses remained higher than annuloplasty alone. Conclusion: This study establishes a reproducible, open-source FEM framework for simulating transcatheter TEER and annuloplasty repairs, with the potential to be extended beyond the mitral valve. By quantifying the mechanical trade-offs of TEER, suture annuloplasty, band annuloplasty, and their combinations, this methodology highlights the potential of virtual repair to guide patient selection and optimize surgical planning.</description>

      <title>Mapping fat-water separated R1, R2*, and proton density fat fraction with the multi-echo MP2RAGE sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a technique for joint measurement of fat and water-specific longitudinal relaxation rates (R1f and R1w), effective transverse relaxation rate (R2*), and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) combining the Multi-Echo Magnetization Prepared Two Rapid Acquisition of Gradient Echoes (ME-MP2RAGE) sequence and fat-water separation.
  Theory and Methods: R1f and R1w were calculated with fat-specific and water-specific MP2RAGE signals. R2* and PDFF maps were obtained from fat-water separation applied to the second RAGE block. Sequence parameters optimization was performed via Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds theory, and we designed four protocols with different combinations of number of echoes and readout gradient schemes (I: 3 echoes unipolar, II: 6 echoes unipolar, III: 6 echoes bipolar, and IV: 10 echoes bipolar). We tested and validated these protocols with numerical simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. In phantoms, we compared ME-MP2RAGE measurements with inversion recovery spin-echo (IR-SE) global R1 and 3D Fast Low Angle Shot (3D FLASH) R2* and PDFF. In vivo, we scanned the lower leg and neck of a healthy volunteer.
  Results: Numerical simulations showed accurate quantification of relaxation rates with mean relative bias &lt; 3% and PDFF with mean bias &lt; 0.003 using protocol ME-MP2RAGE IV (10 echoes bipolar). Phantom experiments showed excellent agreement with IR-SE and 3D FLASH measurements. In vivo, measurements in the lower leg and neck were consistent with literature values.
  Conclusion: We proposed an accurate method for simultaneous quantification of R1f, R1w, R2*, and PDFF from a single acquisition with the ME-MP2RAGE sequence.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of intraventricular bioimpedance in an in vivo pilot study with contextual pressure measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrocephalus is a neurological condition characterized by disturbed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics and is typically treated with shunt systems that drain excessive CSF out of the ventricular system. Continuous monitoring of ventricular CSF volume, however, remains a major unmet need in the clinical management of this condition. While intraventricular bioimpedance (BI) has been proposed as a potential marker of CSF volume, prior investigations have been limited to simulations, in vitro phantoms, and small animal models. This work presents the development of a measurement system for intraventricular BI and its evaluation in a large animal model. The measurement system was first validated in vitro using a mechatronic test bench replicating physiological CSF dynamics and subsequently applied in an in vivo pilot study with concurrent CSF and blood pressure monitoring. Time series analysis of the recorded signals revealed physiological BI waveform components linked to the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In addition, changes in BI following CSF volume alterations induced through intrathecal bolus infusions of artificial CSF were observed and found to be correlated to changes in CSF and blood pressures. These results provide the first in vivo evidence in a large animal model that BI reflects CSF dynamics as well as cerebral hemodynamics. Complementing intracranial pressure and CSF drainage measurements in smart shunt systems with BI could enable more comprehensive patient monitoring and physiologically informed control of hydrocephalus therapy.</description>

      <title>Left-lateralized reduced white matter structural connectivity in young women with obesity: analysis of graph theory applied to inter-tract correlation matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Differences in WM structural connectivity were sought by comparing graph measures from young women with normal weight ($D_\mathrm{norm}$) and obesity ($D_\mathrm{over}$), studying FA-based inter-tract correlation matrices.
  Methods: Undirected binary adjacency matrices were created from WM inter-tract correlation matrices. Sixteen global graph measures were compared between the $D_\mathrm{norm}$ and $D_\mathrm{over}$ groups. At the nodal level, four graph measures were compared. Optimal community structures were calculated using the Louvain community detection algorithm. This was done considering all network, as well as the left and right hemispheres separately.
  Results: At the global level and considering all network, the $D_\mathrm{over}$ group had significantly reduced global efficiency compared to the $D_\mathrm{norm}$ group. Considering only the right hemisphere, none of the graph measures were significantly different between the two groups. Studying only the left hemisphere, the $D_\mathrm{over}$ group obtained significantly reduced measures compared to the $D_\mathrm{norm}$ group in five global graph measures. At the nodal level, the $D_\mathrm{over}$ group obtained significantly reduced graph measures in WM tracts when studying all network and the left hemisphere separately. These tracts were mainly involved in the reward network. The optimal community structures calculated were consistent with the results reported.
  Conclusion: The $D_\mathrm{over}$ group showed altered and reduced structural connectivity in WM tracts compared to the $D_\mathrm{norm}$ group. The reported tracts are involved in reward processing, inhibitory control, executive decision-making, and cognitive processing. In addition to obtaining results consistent with those reported in the literature, it was additionally observed that the results were lateralized to the left hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Motion Correction in Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy: AI solution inspired by fundamental science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is a powerful non-invasive tool for metabolic tissue analysis but is often degraded by patient motion, limiting clinical utility. The RECENTRE project (REal-time motion CorrEctioN in magneTic Resonance) presents an AI-driven, real-time motion correction pipeline based on optimized GRU networks, inspired by tagging and fast-trigger algorithms from high-energy physics. Models evaluated on held-out test sets achieve good predictive performance and overall positive framewise displacement (FD) gains. These results demonstrate feasibility for prospective scanner integration; future work will complete in-vivo validation.</description>

      <title>Modeling Bilateral Lymphatic Head and Neck Tumour Progression for Personalized Elective Target Volume Definition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Large irradiated volumes are a major contributor to severe side-effects in patients with head and neck cancer undergoing curatively intended radiotherapy. We propose a data-driven approach for defining the elective clinical target volume (CTV-E) on a patient-specific basis, with the potential to reduce irradiated volumes compared to standard guidelines. Approach: We introduce a bilateral Bayesian Network (BN), trained on a large cohort, to estimate the patient-specific risk of undetected nodal involvement for both ipsilateral and contralateral lymph node levels (LNLs) I, II, III, and IV, using clinical features, such as patterns of nodal involvement, T-stage, tumour location. By applying risk thresholds, we generated individualized, risk-dependent CTV-E's for representative patient scenarios and compared the resulting treatment volumes and residual risk to those recommended by standard clinical guidelines. Main results: We computed the risks for a set of representative patient scenarios including 1) N0 (T1 and T2 tumour stage), 2) N+ in ipsilateral LNL II (T1 and T2 tumour stage), 3) N+ in ipsilateral LNL II and III (T1 and T2 tumour stage), and 4) N+ of both ipsilateral and contralateral LNL II (T3 and T4 tumour stage). Depending on the chosen risk threshold, the bilateral BN allowed for reductions in irradiated volumes relative to standard clinical protocols. For every patient scenario considered, the CTV-E's defined by the applied risk thresholds were associated with a low estimated probability of undetected nodal involvement in any excluded LNL. Significance: We present a data-driven framework for personalized CTV-E definition, encouraging the discussion of more patient-specific elective nodal target volumes, with potential for de-escalation of irradiated elective volumes.</description>

      <title>Consistency Models as Plug-and-Play Priors for Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM, which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method. We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM, and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Multifractal features of multimodal cardiac signals: Nonlinear dynamics of exercise recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the recovery dynamics of healthy cardiac activity after physical exertion using multimodal biosignals recorded with a polycardiograph. Multifractal features derived from the singularity spectrum capture the scale-invariant properties of cardiovascular regulation. Five supervised classification algorithms - Logistic Regression (LogReg), Suport Vector Machine with RBF kernel (SVM-RBF), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF) - were evaluated to distinguish recovery states in a small, imbalanced dataset. Our results show that multifractal analysis, combined with multimodal sensing, yields reliable features for characterizing recovery and points toward nonlinear diagnostic methods for heart conditions.</description>

      <title>Correlative Symmetric Index: An alternative mathematical evaluation for beam profile symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Current mathematical quantification methods for beam symmetry are highly sensitive to noise, especially in beam profiles with significant variation. Purpose: This study evaluates the accuracy of standard radiotherapy beam symmetry metrics and compares them to a proposed cross-correlation-based metric called the Correlative Symmetric Index (CSI), as well as the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM). We aim to demonstrate that CSI is less susceptible to noise than traditional methods. Methods: Simulated non-symmetric beam profiles with similar left and right areas were analyzed using both standard and proposed symmetry metrics. To test the robustness of each method to noise, a noisy non-symmetric beam profile was also generated. Measured beam profiles at various depths in a water tank were used to compare the performance of each symmetry metric under realistic clinical conditions. Results: In the noisy, non-symmetric case, CSI and SSIM values were 0.387 and 0.5401, respectively. Traditional metrics such as the Point Difference Quotient (PDQ) and area-based symmetry yielded values of 0.312 and 0.400. The percentage change between the non-symmetric (no noise) and non-symmetric (with noise) cases for PDQ, area-based symmetry, SSIM, and CSI were 11.1%, 5.6%, 16.25%, and 1.43%, respectively. For clinically measured symmetric profiles, all metrics produced values above 0.9. Conclusion: The Correlative Symmetric Index (CSI) demonstrates greater robustness to noise than both pointwise and area-based symmetry methods. CSI provides a reliable measure for quantifying beam symmetry, particularly under noisy conditions.</description>

      <title>First positronium imaging using $^{44}$Sc with the J-PET scanner: a case study on the NEMA-Image Quality phantom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positronium Lifetime Imaging (PLI), an emerging extension of conventional positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, offers a novel window for probing the submolecular properties of biological tissues by imaging the mean lifetime of the positronium atom. Currently, the method is under rapid development in terms of reconstruction and detection systems. Recently, the first in vivo PLI of the human brain was performed using the J-PET scanner utilizing the $^{68}$Ga isotope. However, this isotope has limitations due to its comparatively low prompt gamma yields, which is crucial for positronium lifetime measurement. Among alternative radionuclides, $^{44}$Sc stands out as a promising isotope for PLI, characterized by a clinically suitable half-life (4.04 hours) emitting 1157 keV prompt gamma in 100% cases after the emission of the positron. This study reports the first experimental demonstration of PLI with $^{44}$Sc, carried out on a NEMA-Image Quality (IQ) phantom using the Modular J-PET tomograph-the first plastic scintillators-based PET scanner.</description>

      <title>Training-Free Defense Against Adversarial Attacks in Deep Learning MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency, we devise a novel mitigation objective that is minimized in a small ball around the attack input. Results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining. We also introduce a practically relevant scenario for small adversarial perturbations that models impulse noise in raw data, which relates to \emph{herringbone artifacts}, and show the applicability of our approach in this setting. Finally, we show our mitigation approach remains effective in two \emph{realistic} extension scenarios: a blind setup, where the attack strength or algorithm is not known to the user; and an adaptive attack setup, where the attacker has full knowledge of the defense strategy.</description>
