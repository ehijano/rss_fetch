      <title>Intrinsic Khovanov homology in $\mathbb{RP}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that Khovanov homology is an invariant of links in unparametrized $\mathbb{RP}^3$'s, i.e., oriented $3$-manifolds diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{RP}^3$. Along the way, we establish the functoriality of Khovanov homology for link cobordisms in $I\times\mathbb{RP}^3$.</description>

      <title>An Unexpected Rational Blowdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rational blowdown operation in 4-manifold topology replaces a neighborhood of a configuration of spheres by a rational homology ball. Such configurations typically arise from resolutions of surface singularities that admit rational homology disk smoothings. Conjecturally, all such singularities must be weighted homogeneous and belong to certain specific families: Stipsicz-Szab\'o--Wahl constructed QHD smoothings for these families and used Donaldson's theorem to obtain very restrictive necessary conditions on the resolution graphs for singularities with this property. In particular, these results, as well as subsequent work of Bhupal-Stipsicz, show that for certain resolution graphs, the canonical contact structure on the link of the singularity cannot admit a QHD symplectic filling. By contrast, we exhibit Stein rational homology disk fillings for the contact links of an infinite family of rational singularities that are {\em not} weighted homogeneous, producing a new symplectic rational blowdown. Inspiration for our construction comes from de Jong-van Straten's description of Milnor fibers of sandwiched singularities; we use the symplectic analog of de Jong-van Straten theory developed by the second and third authors. The unexpected Stein fillings are built using spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations.</description>

      <title>Volumes of Nullhomotopies in Nilpotent Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shadowing Principle of Manin has proved a valuable tool for addressing questions of quantitative topology raised by Gromov in the late 1900s. The principle informally provides a way for bounded algebraic maps between differential graded algebras to be translated into nearby genuine maps between their geometric realizations. We extend this principle to finite towers of principal $K(G,n)$ fibrations, and in particular apply this construction to nilpotent spaces. As a specific application of the extended principle, we provide upper bounds on the asymptotic behavior of volumes of nullhomotopies of Lipschitz maps into nilpotent spaces. We further refine these bounds in the case when $c = 1$ to nearly meet those of the simply connected setting. We similarly refine these bounds in the event the target space is coformal, and demonstrate that the bounds in this setting are nearly sharp.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study limit sets of Teichm\"uller disks in the Thurston boundary of Teichm\"uller space of a closed surface S of genus at least 2. It is well known that almost every Teichm\"uller geodesic ray converges to a point on the boundary. We show that unlike rays, Teichm\"uller disks with smallest possible limit sets are extremely rare.</description>

      <title>Constructing and Cataloging 2-Adjacent Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing unknotting number, $n$-adjacent knots have $n$ crossings such that changing any non-empty subset of them results in the unknot. In this paper, we determine the 2-adjacent knots through 12 crossings. Using Heegaard Floer $d$-invariants and the Alexander polynomial, we develop a new technique to obstruct 2-adjacency, and we prove conjectures of Ito and Kato regarding 2-adjacent knots.</description>

      <title>The mapping class group invariants of the truncated group ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the invariant subspace of the rational group ring of a surface, truncated by powers of the augmentation ideal, under the action of the mapping class group. The surface is compact, oriented with one boundary component. This provides the first group cohomology computation for the mapping class group with non-symplectic coefficients since Kawazumi-Souli\'e. Our computation is valid in a range growing with the genus.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic systole of Seifert surfaces and distortion of knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1983, Gromov introduced the notion of distortion of a knot, and asked if there are knots with arbitrarily large distortion. In 2011, Pardon proved that the distortion of $T_{p,q}$ is at least $\min\{p,q\}$ up to a constant factor. We prove that the distortion of $T_{p, p+1}\# K$ is at least $p$ up to a constant, independent of $K$. We also prove that any embedding of a minimal genus Seifert surface for $T_{p,p+1}\# K$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has small extrinsic systole, in the sense that it contains a non-contractible loop with small $\mathbb{R}^3$-diameter relative to the length of the knot. These results are related to combinatorial properties of the monodromy map associated to torus knots.</description>

      <title>Smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema and constructing natural functions of the class on connected sums of manifolds admitting these functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema. We call such a function internally Morse or I-Morse.
  The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of single points of it topologized with the natural quotient topology of the manifolds and a vertex of it is a point corresponding to a preimage with critical points. A smooth function is neat with respect to the Reeb graph or N-Reeb if the preimages of the vertices are the closed subsets in the manifolds of the domains with interiors being empty.
  We discuss I-Morse and N-Reeb functions, IN-Morse-Reeb functions. Our main result presents an IN-Morse-Reeb function respecting two such functions, on a connected sum of these given manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transversality theorem is one of the most important tools in singularity theory, and it yields various applications. In this paper, we establish a refined transversality theorem on crossings from a new perspective of Hausdorff measures and give its various applications. Moreover, by using one of them, we generalize Mather's ``stability theorem for generic projections" in his celebrated paper ``Generic projections" under special dimension pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we classify simply connected closed smooth $13$-dimensional manifolds whose cohomology ring is isomorphic to that of $\mb{CP}^3\times S^7$, up to diffeomorphism, homeomorphism, and homotopy equivalence. Furthermore, if such a manifold satisfies certain conditions, either itself or its connected sum with an exotic $13$-sphere $\Sigma^{13}$ admits a Riemannian metric of non-negative sectional curvature. As an additional application of our classification, we classify the diagonal $S^1$-actions on $S^7\times S^7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the canonical reduction system of an element in an Artin-Tits group of spherical type, which generalizes the similar notion for braids (and mapping classes) introduced by Birman, Lubotzky and McCarthy. We show its basic properties, which coincide with those satisfied in braid groups, and we provide an algorithm to compute it. We improve the algorithm in the case of braid groups, and discuss its complexity in this case. As a necessary result for obtaining the general algorithm, we prove that the centralizers of positive powers of an element form a periodic sequence and we show how to compute its period.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a finitely generated group acting properly discontinuously by isometries on a visibility CAT(0) space $X$ that satisfies the bounded packing property. We prove that $\Gamma$ satisfies the Tits alternative: it is either almost nilpotent or contains a free nonabelian subgroup of rank $2$. In the former case, it is equivalent to that the cardinality of the limit set of $\Gamma$ in the geometric boundary of $X$ is no greater than $2$. As an application of the Tits alternative, we show that any finitely generated torsion group acting properly discontinuously by isometries on such a space must be a finite group and have a global fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction strength I(X) of a compact hyperbolic surface X is the best upper bound for the intersection number of two closed geodesics divided by the product of their lengths. Let $M_g$ be the moduli space of compact hyperbolic surfaces of genus g and sys(X) the length of a shortest closed geodesic on $X \in M_g$. We determine the asymptotic behavior of I(X), as $X \to \infty$ in $M_g$, in terms of sys(X). We also determine the approximate behavior of the minimum of I(X) over $M_g$, as $g \to \infty$.</description>

Abstract: We consider tight contact structures on plumbed 3-manifolds with no bad vertices. We discuss how one can count the number of tight contact structures with zero Giroux torsion on such 3-manifolds and explore conditions under which Giroux torsion can be added to these tight contact structures without making them overtwisted. We give an explicit algorithm to construct stein diagrams corresponding to tight structures without Giroux torsion. We focus mainly on plumbed 3-manifolds whose vertices have valence at most 3 and then briefly consider the situation for plumbed 3-manifolds with vertices of higher valence.</description>

      <title>A "cubist" decomposition of the Handel-Mosher axis bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the axis bundle of a nongeometric fully irreducible outer automorphism admits a canonical "cubist" decomposition into branched cubes that fit together with special combinatorics. From this structure, we locate a canonical finite collection of periodic fold lines in each axis bundle. This can be considered as an analogue of results of Hamenst\"adt and Agol from the surface setting, which state that the set of trivalent train tracks carrying the unstable lamination of a pseudo-Anosov map can be given the structure of a CAT(0) cube complex, and that there is a canonical periodic fold line in this cube complex. This work also gives a "hands on" solution to the fully irreducible conjugacy problem in $\mathrm{Out}(F_r)$, and an answer to questions of Handel-Mosher and Bridson-Vogtmann regarding the geometry of the axis bundle.</description>

      <title>Groups admitting Wirtinger presentations and Gromov hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted Wirtinger presentations are generalizations of the classical Wirtinger presentations of knot and link groups. In this paper, we prove that if a finitely generated group admitting a twisted Wirtinger presentation is Gromov hyperbolic, then its second rational homology group vanishes. Moreover, if the group is torsion-free, then its second integral homology group also vanishes.</description>
