      <title>PoliTok-DE: A Multimodal Dataset of Political TikToks and Deletions From Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PoliTok-DE, a large-scale multimodal dataset (video, audio, images, text) of TikTok posts related to the 2024 Saxony state election in Germany. The corpus contains over 195,000 posts published between 01.07.2024 and 30.11.2024, of which over 18,000 (17.3%) were subsequently deleted from the platform. Posts were identified via the TikTok research API and complemented with web scraping to retrieve full multimodal media and metadata. PoliTok-DE supports computational social science across substantive and methodological agendas: substantive work on intolerance and political communication; methodological work on platform policies around deleted content and qualitative-quantitative multimodal research. To illustrate one possible analysis, we report a case study on the co-occurrence of intolerance and entertainment using an annotated subset. The dataset of post IDs is publicly available on Hugging Face, and full content can be hydrated with our provided code. Access to the deleted content is restricted, and can be requested for research purposes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Community Notes: A Framework for Understanding and Building Crowdsourced Context Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly developing features that display crowdsourced context alongside posts, modeled after X's Community Notes. These systems, which we term Crowdsourced Context Systems (CCS), have the potential to reshape our information ecosystem as major platforms embrace them as alternatives to top-down fact-checking. To deeply understand the features and implications of such systems, we perform a systematic literature review of existing CCS research and analyze several real-world CSS implementations. Based on our analysis, we develop a framework with three distinct components. First, we present a theoretical model to help conceptualize and define CCS. Second, we identify a design space encompassing six key aspects of CCS: participation, inputs, curation, presentation, platform treatment, and transparency. Third, we identify key normative implications of different CCS design and implementation choices. Our framework integrates these theoretical, design, and ethical perspectives to establish a foundation for future human-centered research on Crowdsourced Context Systems.</description>

      <title>Solar Forecasting with Causality: A Graph-Transformer Approach to Spatiotemporal Dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate solar forecasting underpins effective renewable energy management. We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors (e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.</description>

      <title>How Do Social Bots Participate in Misinformation Spread? A Comprehensive Dataset and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media platforms provide an ideal environment to spread misinformation, where social bots can accelerate the spread. This paper explores the interplay between social bots and misinformation on the Sina Weibo platform. We construct a large-scale dataset that includes annotations for both misinformation and social bots. From the misinformation perspective, the dataset is multimodal, containing 11,393 pieces of misinformation and 16,416 pieces of verified information. From the social bot perspective, this dataset contains 65,749 social bots and 345,886 genuine accounts, annotated using a weakly supervised annotator. Extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the dataset, the clear distinction between misinformation and real information, and the high quality of social bot annotations. Further analysis illustrates that: (i) social bots are deeply involved in information spread; (ii) misinformation with the same topics has similar content, providing the basis of echo chambers, and social bots would amplify this phenomenon; and (iii) social bots generate similar content aiming to manipulate public opinions.</description>

      <title>Multi-set spectral clustering of time-evolving networks using the supra-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11984v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex time-varying networks are prominent models for a wide variety of spatiotemporal phenomena. The functioning of networks depends crucially on their connectivity, yet reliable techniques for determining communities in spacetime networks remain elusive. We adapt successful spectral techniques from continuous-time dynamics on manifolds to the graph setting to fill this gap. We formulate an inflated dynamic Laplacian for graphs and develop a spectral theory to underpin the corresponding algorithmic realisations. We develop spectral clustering approaches for both multiplex and non-multiplex networks, based on the eigenvectors of the inflated dynamic Laplacian and specialised Sparse EigenBasis Approximation (SEBA) post-processing of these eigenvectors. We demonstrate that our approach can outperform the Leiden algorithm applied both in spacetime and layer-by-layer, and we analyse voting data from the US senate (where senators come and go as congresses evolve) to quantify increasing polarisation in time.</description>

      <title>Silenced voices: social media polarization and women's marginalization in peacebuilding during the Northern Ethiopia War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the complex relationship between social media, polarization, and conflict, with a focus on digital peacebuilding and women's participation, using the Northern Ethiopia War as a case study. Using a qualitative exploratory design through in-depth interviews, focus groups, and document analysis, the research examines how social media platforms influence conflict dynamics. The study applies and advances social identity, liberal feminist, and intersectionality theories to analyze social media's role in shaping conflict, mobilizing ethnic politics, and influencing women's involvement in peacebuilding. Findings reveal that the weaponization of social media intensifies polarization and offline violence. Women are disproportionately impacted through displacement, exclusion from peace negotiations, and heightened risks of gender-based violence, including rape. Contributing factors include hostile online environments, the digital divide, and prevailing socio-cultural norms. The study identifies significant gaps in leveraging digital platforms for sustainable peace, including government-imposed internet shutdowns, unregulated social media environments, and low media literacy. It recommends media literacy initiatives, inclusive peacebuilding frameworks, open and safe digital spaces, and gender-sensitive technological approaches. By centering digital technology, conflict, and gender in the Global South, this research contributes valuable insights to ongoing debates on ICT in conflict, peacebuilding, and women's empowerment.</description>
