      <title>Language modelling techniques for analysing the impact of human genetic variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interpreting the effects of variants within the human genome and proteome is essential for analysing disease risk, predicting medication response, and developing personalised health interventions. Due to the intrinsic similarities between the structure of natural languages and genetic sequences, natural language processing techniques have demonstrated great applicability in computational variant effect prediction. In particular, the advent of the Transformer has led to significant advancements in the field. However, Transformer-based models are not without their limitations, and a number of extensions and alternatives have been developed to improve results and enhance computational efficiency. This review explores the use of language models for computational variant effect prediction over the past decade, analysing the main architectures, and identifying key trends and future directions.</description>

      <title>Pesti-Gen: Unleashing a Generative Molecule Approach for Toxicity Aware Pesticide Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global climate change has reduced crop resilience and pesticide efficacy, making reliance on synthetic pesticides inevitable, even though their widespread use poses significant health and environmental risks. While these pesticides remain a key tool in pest management, previous machine-learning applications in pesticide and agriculture have focused on classification or regression, leaving the fundamental challenge of generating new molecular structures or designing novel candidates unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Pesti-Gen, a novel generative model based on variational auto-encoders, designed to create pesticide candidates with optimized properties for the first time. Specifically, Pesti-Gen leverages a two-stage learning process: an initial pre-training phase that captures a generalized chemical structure representation, followed by a fine-tuning stage that incorporates toxicity-specific information. The model simultaneously optimizes over multiple toxicity metrics, such as (1) livestock toxicity and (2) aqua toxicity to generate environmentally friendly pesticide candidates. Notably, Pesti-Gen achieves approximately 68\% structural validity in generating new molecular structures, demonstrating the model's effectiveness in producing optimized and feasible pesticide candidates, thereby providing a new way for safer and more sustainable pest management solutions.</description>
