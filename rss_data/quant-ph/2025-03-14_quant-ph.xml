      <title>On the generalized eigenvalue problem in subspace-based excited state methods for quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving challenging problems in quantum chemistry is one of the leading promised applications of quantum computers. Within the quantum algorithms proposed for problems in excited state quantum chemistry, subspace-based quantum algorithms, including quantum subspace expansion (QSE), quantum equation of motion (qEOM) and quantum self-consistent equation-of-motion (q-sc-EOM), are promising for pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices. The working equation of QSE and qEOM requires solving a generalized eigenvalue equation with associated matrix elements measured on a quantum computer. Our quantitative analysis of the QSE method shows that the errors in eigenvalues increase drastically with an increase in the condition number of the overlap matrix when a generalized eigenvalue equation is solved in the presence of statistical sampling errors. This makes such methods unstable to errors that are unavoidable when using quantum computers. Further, at very high condition numbers of overlap matrix, the QSE's working equation could not be solved without any additional steps in the presence of sampling errors as it becomes ill-conditioned. It was possible to use the thresholding technique in this case to solve the equation, but the solutions achieved had missing excited states, which may be a problem for future chemical studies. We also show that excited-state methods that have an eigenvalue equation as the working equation, such as q-sc-EOM, do not have such problems and could be suitable candidates for excited-state quantum chemistry calculations using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Variational preparation of normal matrix product states on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing matrix product states (MPSs) on quantum computers is important for a wide class of quantum algorithms including the simulation of many-body physics. However, widely-used schemes based on staircase circuits are often too deep to be run on quantum computers today. In this work, we demonstrate how normal MPSs, which have short-range correlations, can be prepared with shallow circuits using heuristics from approximate quantum compiling (AQC). We achieve this with ADAPT-AQC, an adaptive-ansatz preparation algorithm developed in this work, as well as with a generalised initialisation scheme for the existing AQC-Tensor algorithm. We subsequently apply these methods to study the dynamics of a 50-site Heisenberg XXZ spin chain following a global quench over the antiferromagnetic-XY phase boundary. Through the execution of circuits with up to 59 CZ depth and 1251 CZ gates, we obtain the signature relaxation of magnetic ordering for a parameter regime previously inaccessible on quantum hardware due to deep ground state preparation near the second-order phase transition. Overall, our results demonstrate how the close integration of quantum and classical resources can push the boundary of what can be studied on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Quantum Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An operational description of quantum phenomena concerns developing models that describe experimentally observed behaviour. $\textit{Higher-order quantum operations}\unicode{x2014}$quantum operations that transform quantum operations$\unicode{x2014}$are fundamental to modern quantum theory, extending beyond basic state preparations, evolutions, and measurements described by the Born rule. These operations naturally emerge in quantum circuit architectures, correlated open dynamics, and investigations of quantum causality, to name but a few fields of application. This Review Article provides both a pedagogical introduction to the framework of higher-order quantum operations and a comprehensive survey of current literature, illustrated through physical examples. We conclude by identifying open problems and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Efficient Entanglement Distillation Using Bosonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity entanglement shared between distant quantum systems is an essential resource for quantum communication and computation. Entanglement distillation addresses this need by converting multiple noisy Bell pairs into fewer higher-fidelity pairs, using only local quantum operations and classical communication. However, this approach typically requires a substantial overhead in the number of qubits. To bypass this hurdle, we propose to leverage the high-dimensional Hilbert space of a single pair of bosonic systems to store a large amount of entanglement, replacing the need for multi-qubit systems. To distill entanglement in such a setup, we devise a new entanglement distillation protocol, tailored for bosonic systems. The protocol converts a highly-entangled noisy state between two bosonic systems into a lower-dimensional but high-fidelity entangled state, using only local bosonic operations. We show that our protocol significantly enhances the fidelity of the entangled state in the presence of naturally occurring loss and dephasing errors. Compared to methods relying on multiple Bell pairs, our scheme offers a more hardware-efficient strategy, providing a practical route toward the realization of entanglement distillation.</description>

      <title>Trotter error mitigation by error profiling with shallow quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of quantum systems is crucial in many areas of physics, but simulating many-body systems presents significant challenges due to the large Hilbert space to navigate and the exponential growth of computational overhead. Quantum computers offer a promising platform to overcome these challenges, particularly for simulating the time evolution with Hamiltonians. Trotterization is a widely used approach among available algorithms in this regard, and well suited for near-term quantum devices. However, it introduces algorithmic Trotter errors due to the non-commutativity of Hamiltonian components. Several techniques such as multi-product formulas have been developed to mitigate Trotter errors, but often require deep quantum circuits, which can introduce additional physical errors. In this work, we propose a resource-efficient scheme to reduce the algorithmic Trotter error with relatively shallow circuit depth. We develop a profiling method by introducing an auxiliary parameter to estimate the error effects in expectation values, enabling significant error suppression with a fixed number of Trotter steps. Our approach offers an efficient way of quantum simulation on near-term quantum processors with shallow circuits.</description>

      <title>Gap between quantum theory based on real and complex numbers is arbitrarily large</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Information Theory, the standard formalism used to represent information contained in quantum systems, is based on complex Hilbert spaces (CQT). It was recently shown that it predicts correlations in quantum networks which cannot be explained by Real Quantum Theory (RQT), a quantum theory with real Hilbert spaces instead of complex ones, when three parties are involved in a quantum network with non-trivial locality constraints. In this work, we study a scenario with $N+1$ parties sharing quantum systems in a star network. Here, we construct a "conditional" multipartite Bell inequality that exhibits a gap between RQT and CQT, which linearly increases with $N$ and is thus arbitrarily large in the asymptotic limit. This implies, that, as the number of parties grows, Hilbert space formalism based on real numbers becomes exceedingly worse at describing complex networks of quantum systems. Furthermore, we also compute the tolerance of this gap to experimental errors.</description>

      <title>Light Drag in a Cavity Magnomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The term "light dragging" describes how the trajectory of light changes as it travels through a moving medium. This phenomenon facilitates the precise detection of incredibly slow speeds of light, which is widely used in quantum gate operations, state transfer, and quantum memory implementations, etc. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time we have proposed the existence of a light-dragging effect in a magnomechanical system (MMS). The origin of this crucial element stems from nonlinear dipole and magnetostrictive interactions in MMS. Magnomechanical characteristics such as magnon-photon and magnon-phonon couplings have a strong impact on both refractive and group index profile spectra. We also explore that lateral light drag shows a strong dependence on detuning by altering the amplitude and direction of the translational velocity. This enabled us to alter the light's propagation within the magnomechanical system from superluminal to subluminal and vice versa by adjusting the probe's detuning. The ability to control and manipulate the light drag through the MMS could be helpful in designing novel devices with improved functionality at the microscopic scale.</description>

      <title>Multi-Timescale Quantum Averaging Theory for Driven Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a generalized unitarity-preserving analytic framework for modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realistic quantum systems are affected by environmental loss, which is often seen as detrimental for applications in quantum technologies. Alternatively, weak coupling to an environment can aid in stabilizing highly entangled and mixed states, but determining optimal system-environment parameters can be challenging. Here, we describe a technique to optimize parameters for generating desired non-equilibrium steady states (NESSs) in driven-dissipative quantum systems governed by the Lindblad equation. We apply this approach to predict highly-entangled and mixed NESSs in Ising, Kitaev, and Dicke models in several quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics of a Dicke Model for V-Type Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear, semiclassical dynamics of an open spin-1 (three-level) variant of the traditional Dicke model. In particular, we focus on V-type energy-level configurations with varying degrees of energy-level asymmetry. We also allow for unbalanced coupling -- where co-rotating and counter-rotating Hamiltonian terms are independently tunable. We characterise the system with a dynamical systems approach, where different behaviors map to definite dynamical objects, and phase transitions to bifurcations. We find the emergence of both periodic and two-frequency oscillations, as well as multistability and chaotic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Acceleration without photon pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since quantum physics is more complex, it cannot be derived from classical theories and additional postulates are needed. However, whenever an experiment {\em can} be described classically, quantum physics must predict the same outcome. Otherwise, it would be possible to contradict quantum theories with classical experiments. Intuitively, an accelerating observer travelling through a vacuum seems to be a situation that can be analysed classically. It is, therefore, not surprising that many people are puzzled by the Unruh effect, which predicts that the observer encounters photons in a thermal state. This paper shows that the quantised electromagnetic field in a non-inertial frame can be modelled consistently without transforming the vacuum into a thermal state.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computer Controlled by Superconducting Digital Electronics at Millikelvin Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current superconducting quantum computing platforms face significant scaling challenges, as individual signal lines are required for control of each qubit. This wiring overhead is a result of the low level of integration between control electronics at room temperature and qubits operating at millikelvin temperatures, which raise serious doubts among technologists about whether utility-scale quantum computers can be built. A promising alternative is to utilize cryogenic, superconducting digital control electronics that coexist with qubits. Here, we report the first multi-qubit system integrating this technology. The system utilizes digital demultiplexing, breaking the linear scaling of control lines to number of qubits. We also demonstrate single-qubit fidelities above 99%, and up to 99.9%. This work is a critical step forward in realizing highly scalable chip-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Response to Step-like Gate Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the influence of a step-like gate voltage on the entanglement formation of two interacting charge qubits, where charge is injected on demand into the qubits. The gate voltage modulates the tunnel coupling between the qubits and two electronic reservoirs (leads), which supply the initial charges to the system. The qubits interact capacitively through Coulomb repulsion, and the interplay between Coulomb interactions and hopping processes leads to the formation of entangled states. Our analysis focuses on how the physical parameters of the gate pulse affect the degree of entanglement. In pursuit of this aim, we calculate fidelity, linear entropy, and negativity within the framework of density matrix formalism. Our analysis demonstrate how to optimize the gate pulse to reach a ``sweet spot'' that maximizes entanglement, even in the presence of additional dephasing sources. These results could contribute to the future experimental realization of entanglement in interacting charge qubits.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Secured DSP-Lite Data Transmission Architectures for AI-Driven Data Centres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-driven (AI-driven) data centres, which require high-performance, scalable, energy-efficient, and secure infrastructure, have led to unprecedented data traffic demands. These demands involve low latency, high bandwidth connections, low power consumption, and data confidentiality. However, conventional optical interconnect solutions, such as intensity-modulated direct detection and traditional coherent systems, cannot address these requirements simultaneously. In particular, conventional encryption protocols that rely on complex algorithms are increasingly vulnerable to the rapid advancement of quantum computing. Here, we propose and demonstrate a quantum-secured digital signal processing-lite (DSP-Lite) data transmission architecture that meets all the stringent requirements for AI-driven data centre optical interconnects (AI-DCIs) scenarios. By integrating a self-homodyne coherent (SHC) system and quantum key distribution (QKD) through the multicore-fibre-based space division multiplexing (SDM) technology, our scheme enables secure, high-capacity, and energy-efficient data transmission while ensuring resilience against quantum computing threats. In our demonstration, we achieved an expandable transmission capacity of 2 Tbit per second (Tb/s) and a quantum secret key rate (SKR) of 229.2 kb/s, with a quantum bit error rate (QBER) of approximately 1.27% and with ultralow power consumption. Our work paves the way for constructing secure, scalable, and cost-efficient data transmission frameworks, thus enabling the next generation of intelligent, leak-proof optical interconnects for data centres.</description>

      <title>Observation of the acoustic Purcell effect with a color-center and a nanomechanical resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative properties of atoms are inherently linked to their surrounding environment. Placing an electromagnetic resonator around atoms can enhance spontaneous emission, as shown by Purcell in the 1940s. This approach is now routinely used in quantum computing and communication to channel photons emitted by atoms into well-defined modes and control atom-photon interactions. For solid-state artificial atoms, such as color-centers, the host lattice introduces an acoustic environment, allowing excited atoms to relax by emitting phonons. Here we observe the acoustic Purcell effect by constructing a specially engineered, microwave-frequency nanomechanical resonator around a color-center spin qubit in diamond. Using a co-localized optical mode of the structure that strongly couples to the color-center's excited state, we perform single-photon-level laser spectroscopy at milliKelvin temperatures and observe ten-fold faster spin relaxation when the spin qubit is tuned into resonance with a 12 GHz acoustic mode. Additionally, we use the color-center as an atomic-scale probe to measure the broadband phonon spectrum of the nanostructure up to a frequency of 28 GHz. Our work establishes a new regime of control for quantum defects in solids and paves the way for interconnects between atomic-scale quantum memories and qubits encoded in acoustic and superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Coherence and Genuine Multipartite Entanglement : A Framework Based on Witness Operators and Frobenius Norm Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying the entanglement and coherence of quantum systems is a topic of significant theoretical and practical interest. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate lower bounds for several widely used coherence measures and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) measures. Our approach, which is resource-efficient and computationally feasible, provides bounds of coherence and GME measures with the help of witnesses by the F-norm. Finally, we present a practical framework for estimating these quantum resources in various physical scenarios.</description>

      <title>General phase diagram features of superradiant phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various light-matter interactions lead to diverse phase diagram structures in superradiant phase transition (SPT) studies. Such systems consist of multiqubit and multimode with anisotropic couplings, one-photon and two-photon interactions, Stark shifts, inter-cavity hoppings, qubit-qubit interactions and so on. We find a general phase diagram feature that the origin is in normal phase (NP) and SPT happens only once along the radial direction of a chosen coupling parameter vector with the mean-field method at finite temperature. We can calculate the the phase boundary and SPT properties by a concise method. We illustrate it with specific models and find SPT can be achieved in strong coupling regime by means of multimode collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Entanglement witness for combined atom interferometer-mechanical oscillator setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how to entangle an atom interferometer and a macroscopic mechanical oscillator in order to create non-classical states of the oscillator. We propose an entanglement witness, from whose violation, the generation of entanglement can be determined. We do this for both the noiseless case and when including thermal noise. Thermal noise can arise from two sources: the first being when the oscillator starts in a thermal state, and the second when a continuous thermal bath is in contact with the oscillator. We find that for the appropriate oscillator quality factor $Q$, violation always exists for any value of magnetic coupling $\lambda$ and thermal occupancy $\bar n$. Cooling the oscillator to its ground state provides an $O(\bar n)$ improvement in the EW violation than starting in a thermal state. However, this still requires at least 10$^{5}$ measurements to be determined. We then consider how to use magnetic interactions to realize this idea.</description>

      <title>Partial Blind Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing is rapidly advancing toward cloud-based services, raising significant concerns about the privacy and security of computations outsourced to untrusted quantum servers. Traditional Blind Quantum Computation (BQC) protocols enable clients with limited quantum resources to delegate computations while concealing both inputs and circuit details. However, applying BQC uniformly to an entire quantum circuit incurs additional quantum resources and computational overhead, which can be a significant burden in practical implementations. In many cases, such as Grover's algorithm, only specific subroutines-like oracles-contain sensitive information, while the rest of the circuit does not require the same level of protection. Therefore, selectively applying BQC to critical components can enhance computational efficiency while maintaining security.
  In this work, we propose a selective application of BQC that targets only the critical components of quantum circuits. By integrating techniques from Quantum Homomorphic Encryption (QHE) and Universal Blind Quantum Computation (UBQC), our approach secures the sensitive subcircuits while allowing the remaining, non-sensitive portions to be executed more efficiently. In our framework, BQC-protected sections output quantum states that are encrypted via bit-flip and phase-flip operations, and we devise a mechanism based on selective X and Z gate corrections to seamlessly interface these with unprotected sections. We provide a security analysis demonstrating that our selective BQC approach preserves universality, correctness, and blindness, and we illustrate its practical advantages through an application to Grover's algorithm. This work paves the way for more efficient and practical secure quantum computing on near-term devices.</description>

      <title>A discrete Fourier transform based quantum circuit for modular multiplication in Shor$'$s algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shor$'$s algorithm for the prime factorization of numbers provides an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithms. However, nontrivial practical applications have remained out of reach due to experimental limitations. The bottleneck of the experimental realization of the algorithm is the modular exponentiation operation. In this paper, based on a relation between the modular multiplication operator and generalizations of discrete Fourier transforms, we propose a quantum circuit for modular exponentiation. A distinctive feature of our proposal is that our circuit can be entirely implemented in terms of the standard quantum circuit for the discrete Fourier transform and its variants. The gate-complexity of our proposal is $O(L^3)$ where L is the number of bits required to store the number being factorized. It is possible that such a proposal may provide easier avenues for near-term generic implementations of Shor$'$s algorithm, in contrast to existing realizations which have often explicitly adapted the circuit to the number being factorized.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Chiplet: A Novel Python-Based Efficient and Scalable Design Methodology for Quantum Circuit Verification and Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis and verification of quantum circuits are highly challenging, given the exponential dependence of the number of states on the number of qubits. For analytical derivation, we propose a new quantum polynomial representation (QPR) to facilitate the analysis of massively parallel quantum computation and detect subtle errors. For the verification of quantum circuits, we introduce Quantum-Chiplet, a hierarchical quantum behavior modeling methodology that facilitates rapid integration and simulation. Each chiplet is systematically transformed into quantum gates. For circuits involving n qubits and k quantum gates, the design complexity is reduced from "greater than O(2^n)" to O(k). This approach provides an open-source solution, enabling a highly customized solution for quantum circuit simulation within the native Python environment, thereby reducing reliance on traditional simulation packages. A quantum amplitude estimation example demonstrates that this method significantly improves the design process, with more than 10x speed-up compared to IBM Qiskit at 14 qubits.</description>

      <title>Capturing an Electron in the Virtual State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address a foundational question in quantum mechanics: can a particle be directly found in a classically forbidden virtual state? We instantiate this conceptual question by investigating the traversal of electrons through a tunnel barrier, which we define in a triple quantum dot (TQD) system where the occupation of the central dot is energetically avoided. The motivation behind this setup is to answer whether the central dot is occupied or not during a virtual transition when it is being explicitly monitored. We investigate this problem in two different limits of continuous measurements: the stochastic quantum diffusion and the quantum jump. We find that, even though individual trajectories differ considerably across these limits, measuring leads to a higher occupation in the central dot on average. Our results demonstrate that the act of observation fundamentally reshapes tunneling dynamics, resolving the seeming paradox of detecting a particle in a classically forbidden region: weak measurements partially localize the particle, while strong measurements enforce a discontinuous either/or detection or no detection outcome.</description>

      <title>The Art of Avoiding Constraints: A Penalty-free Approach to Constrained Combinatorial Optimization with QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is designed to determine optimum and near optimum solutions of quadratic (and higher order) unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO or HUBO) problems, which in turn accurately model unconstrained combinatorial optimization problems. While the solution space of an unconstrained combinatorial optimization problem consists of all possible combinations of the objective function's decision variables, for a constrained combinatorial optimization problem, the solution space consists only of solutions that satisfy the problem constraints. While solving such a QUBO problem optimally results in an optimal solution to the underlying constrained problem, setting the right penalty parameters is crucial. Moreover, finding suitable penalties that ensure near-optimal solutions is also challenging. In this article, we introduce our innovative profit-relaxation framework to solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. Our effective hybrid approach transforms a selected constrained combinatorial optimization problem into an unconstrained profit problem, such that the solution spaces of the two problems are interrelated with respect to their solution qualities. This allows us to determine optimal and near-optimal solutions for the constrained problem.
  We use three NP-hard problems -- Minimum Vertex Cover, Maximum Independent Set, and Maximum Clique -- to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. We conducted a detailed performance evaluation of our profit-relaxation framework on two different platforms: Xanadu PennyLane and Argonne QTensor Quantum Circuit Simulator.</description>

      <title>Sagnac interferometer-based noise-free superresolution using phase-controlled quantum erasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometer-based precision measurements have been intensively studied for sensing and metrology over the last half century. In classical optics, the resolution and phase sensitivity of an optical signal are confined by diffraction limit and standard quantum limit (SQL), respectively. Quantum entanglement has been adapted to quantum sensing to overcome SQL over the last two decades. In quantum sensing, the use of higher-order entangled photon pairs of N00N states is key to beating diffraction limit and SQL with superresolution of the de Broglie wavelength. Recently, coherent light has been demonstrated for the de Broglie wavelength resulting from phase-controlled quantum erasers. Here, a Sagnac interferometer-based de Broglie wavelength is proposed for noise-free superresolution to solve the limited scalability in N00N-based quantum sensing. For this, the output port of a Sagnac interferometer is phase-manipulated for intensity product of multiple quantum erasers. Due to the practically unlimited scalability in the phase manipulation using a spatial light modulator, the proposed Sagnac superresolution can be applicable to upgrade the state-of-art classical sensors such has grating-based wavelength meters or cavity-based ring laser gyroscope to a quantum version.</description>

      <title>On Sufficient and Necessary Criteria of Multipartite Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the generalized Bloch representation, we study the separability and genuine multipartite entanglement of arbitrary dimensional multipartite quantum states. Some sufficient and some necessary criteria are presented. For certain states, these criteria together are both sufficient and necessary. Detailed examples show that our criteria are better than some existing ones in identifying entanglement. Based on these criteria, the largest separable ball around the maximally mixed state for arbitrary multi-qubit systems is found, and it is proved that its radius is the constant 1. Furthermore, the criteria in this paper can be implemented experimentally.</description>

      <title>High-rate self-referenced continuous-variable quantum key distribution over high-loss free-space channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computers has significantly challenged the security of traditional cryptographic systems, prompting a surge in research on quantum key distribution (QKD). Among various QKD approaches, continuous-variable QKD (CVQKD) offers superior resilience against background noise. However, the local local oscillator (LLO) CVQKD scheme faces substantial physical limitations in scenarios with high channel attenuation, and the large attenuation CVQKD remains unrealized. Bottleneck challenges include ensuring stable low-noise transmission and accurately estimating parameters under fluctuating channel conditions. In this paper, we introduce a continuous-time mode theory for high-precision estimation of time-varying parameters and design a free-space experimental system with a main quantum system and an auxiliary counterpart. We further develop advanced digital signal post-processing techniques for compensating time-varying frequency offset and phase noise under dynamic channel. Notably, the estimation of the time-varying free-space channel is achieved through the use of the auxiliary quantum system. Through experimental validation, we demonstrate high-rate secure quantum key distribution over high-loss free-space channels. Specifically, we achieve asymptotic key rates of 76.366 kbps and 403.896 kbps in 25 dB attenuation free-space channels without turbulence and 21.5 dB average attenuation free-space channels with turbulence, respectively. Additionally, we confirm the feasibility of experiments on mildly turbulent atmospheric channels spanning at least 10.5 km using current equipments. Our scheme provides direct insight into constructing an integrated air-ground quantum communication network.</description>

Abstract: The extraction of transition frequencies from a spectrum has conventionally relied on empirical methods, and particularly in complex systems it is a time-consuming and cumbersome process. To address this challenge, we establish an semi-automated efficient and precise spectrum analysis method. It, at first, employs image processing methods to extract transition frequencies, subsequently estimates Hamiltonians of superconducting quantum circuit containing multiple Josephson junctions. Additionally, we determine the suitable range of approximations in simulation methods, evaluating the physical reliability of analyses.</description>

      <title>Refining Noise Mitigation in NISQ Hardware Through Qubit Error Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key characteristic of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era is the accurate assessment and consideration of errors through error mitigation techniques, which play a fundamental role in achieving quantum utility, i.e., quantum results that are at the state of the art of classical calculations. In this paper, we examine the primary sources of errors in contemporary (IBM) quantum computers through a new important metric, the qubit error probability (QEP), which estimates the probability of a qubit to suffer an error. We show that QEP can be used to improve one of the most important error mitigation techniques, the zero noise extrapolation (ZNE). Our method, named zero error probability extrapolation (ZEPE), is based on calibration parameters which enables a good scalability in terms of number of qubits and circuit depth. Besides, we prove that ZEPE performs better than the standard ZNE, specially for a mid-size depth ranges.</description>

      <title>Quantum switches for single-photon routing and entanglement generation in waveguide-based networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interconnection of quantum nodes holds great promise for scaling up quantum computing units and enabling information processing across long-distance quantum registers. Such quantum networks can be realized using superconducting qubits linked by waveguides, which facilitate fast and robust on-demand quantum information exchange via traveling single photons. In this article, we propose leveraging additional qubit degrees of freedom as quantum switches that coherently condition the system dynamics. These switches are implemented using a qubit dispersively coupled to transfer resonators, which mediate interactions between node qubits and quantum links. Through wavepacket shaping techniques, we demonstrate that when the switch is closed, full excitation transfer occurs as a propagating photon, whereas an open switch allows only partial transfer without distorting the shape of the emitted photon. Based on this switch mechanism, we present deterministic protocols for generating entangled states via single-photon routing across the network, such as Bell, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states. The feasibility of our approach is validated through numerical simulations of a three-node network, incorporating decoherence and photon loss effects. Our results indicate that high-fidelity entangled states can be realized employing the proposed quantum switches in current state-of-the-art platforms.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Boundary of Quantum Advantage in Hard Combinatorial Optimization with Probabilistic Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent demonstrations on specialized benchmarks have reignited excitement for quantum computers, yet whether they can deliver an advantage for practical real-world problems remains an open question. Here, we show that probabilistic computers (p-computers) when co-designed with hardware to implement powerful Monte Carlo algorithms surpass state-of-the-art quantum annealers [\href{https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05867-2}{King et al., Nature (2023)}] in solving hard optimization problems. We focus on two key algorithms: discrete-time simulated quantum annealing (DT-SQA) and adaptive parallel tempering (APT), both applied to 3D spin glasses. For DT-SQA, we find that increasing the number of replicas improves residual energy scaling, while parallelizing fewer replicas across independent runs also achieves comparable scaling. Both strategies align with the theoretical expectations from extreme value theory. In addition, APT outperforms DT-SQA when supported by non-local isoenergetic cluster moves. Finite-size scaling analysis suggests a universal behavior that explains the superior performance of APT over both DT-SQA and quantum annealing. We show that these algorithms are readily implementable in modern hardware thanks to the mature semiconductor technology. Unlike software simulations, replicas can be monolithically housed on a single chip and a large number of spins can be updated in parallel and asynchronously, similar to a quantum annealer. We project that custom Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) or specialized chips leveraging massive parallelism can further accelerate these algorithms by orders of magnitude, while drastically improving energy efficiency. Our results challenge the notion of a practical quantum advantage in optimization and present p-computers as scalable, energy-efficient hardware for real-world optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state learnability transitions in monitored noisy quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider learnability transitions in monitored quantum systems that undergo noisy evolution, subject to a global strong symmetry -- i.e., in addition to the measuring apparatus, the system can interact with an unobserved environment, but does not exchange charge with it. As in the pure-state setting, we find two information-theoretic phases -- a sharp (fuzzy) phase in which an eavesdropper can rapidly (slowly) learn the symmetry charge. However, because the dynamics is noisy, both phases can be simulated efficiently using tensor networks. Indeed, even when the true dynamics is unitary, introducing noise by hand allows an eavesdropper to efficiently learn the symmetry charge from local measurements, as we demonstrate. We identify the fuzzy phase in this setting as a mixed-state phase that exhibits spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and average symmetry protected topological order in the doubled Hilbert space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition takes place between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</description>

      <title>The quantum non-Markovianity for a special class of generalized Weyl channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum channel is usually represented as a sum of Kraus operators. The recent study [Phys. Rev. A 98, 032328 (2018)] has shown that applying a perturbation to the Kraus operators in qubit Pauli channels, the dynamical maps exhibit interesting properties, such as non-Markovianity, singularity. This has sparked our interest in studying the properties of other quantum channels. In this work, we study a special class of generalized Weyl channel where the Kraus operators are proportional to the Weyl diagonal matrices and the rest are vanishing. We use the Choi matrix of intermediate map to study quantum non-Markovianity. The crossover point of the eigenvalues of Choi matrix is a singularity of the decoherence rates in the canonical form of the master equation. Moreover, we identify the non-Markovianity based on the methods of CP divisibility and distinguishability. We also quantify the non-Markovianity in terms of the Hall-Cresser-Li-Andersson (HCLA) measure and the Breuer-Laine-Piilo (BLP) measure, respectively. In particular, we choose mutually unbiased bases as a pair of orthogonal initial states to quantify the non-Markovianity based on the BLP measure.</description>

      <title>Approximation Methods for Simulation and Equivalence Checking of Noisy Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) era, simulating and verifying noisy quantum circuits is crucial but faces challenges such as quantum state explosion and complex noise representations, constraining simulation, and equivalence checking to circuits with a limited number of qubits. This paper introduces an approximation algorithm for simulating and assessing the equivalence of noisy quantum circuits, specifically designed to improve scalability under low-noise conditions. The approach utilizes a novel tensor network diagram combined with singular value decomposition to approximate the tensors of quantum noises. The implementation is based on Google's TensorNetwork Python package for contraction. Experimental results on realistic quantum circuits with realistic hardware noise models indicate that our algorithm can simulate and check the equivalence of QAOA (Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm) circuits with around 200 qubits, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by noise number and execution time.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic elimination and Wigner function approach in microscopic derivation of open quantum Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum Brownian motion (OQBM) represents a new class of quantum Brownian motion where the dynamics of the Brownian particle depend not only on the interactions with a thermal environment but also on the state of the internal degrees of freedom. For an Ohmic bath spectral density with a Lorentz-Drude cutoff frequency at a high-temperature limit, we derive the BornMarkov master equation for the reduced density matrix of an open Brownian particle in a harmonic potential. The resulting master equation is written in phase-space representation using the Wigner function, and due to the separation of associated timescales in the high-damping limit, we perform adiabatic elimination of the momentum variable to obtain OQBM. We numerically solve the derived master equation for the reduced density matrix of the OQBM for Gaussian and non-Gaussian initial distributions. In each case, the OQBM dynamics converge to several Gaussian distributions. To gain physical insight into the studied system, we also plotted the dynamics of the off-diagonal element of the open quantum Brownian particle and found damped coherent oscillations. Finally, we investigated the time-dependent variance in the position of the OQBM walker and observed a transition between ballistic and diffusive behavior.</description>

      <title>Extractors: QLDPC Architectures for Efficient Pauli-Based Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In pursuit of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation, quantum low-density parity-check (LPDC) codes have been established as promising candidates for low-overhead memory when compared to conventional approaches based on surface codes. Performing fault-tolerant logical computation on QLDPC memory, however, has been a long standing challenge in theory and in practice. In this work, we propose a new primitive, which we call an $\textit{extractor system}$, that can augment any QLDPC memory into a computational block well-suited for Pauli-based computation. In particular, any logical Pauli operator supported on the memory can be fault-tolerantly measured in one logical cycle, consisting of $O(d)$ physical syndrome measurement cycles, without rearranging qubit connectivity. We further propose a fixed-connectivity, LDPC architecture built by connecting many extractor-augmented computational (EAC) blocks with bridge systems. When combined with any user-defined source of high fidelity $|T\rangle$ states, our architecture can implement universal quantum circuits via parallel logical measurements, such that all single-block Clifford gates are compiled away. The size of an extractor on an $n$ qubit code is $\tilde{O}(n)$, where the precise overhead has immense room for practical optimizations.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that the unitary operation on the system's subspace uniquely determines the corresponding unitary operator on the environment's subspace. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we identify the requirements that local operations must satisfy to ensure that the eternal black hole states remain static in AdS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Direct estimation of arbitrary observables of an oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum harmonic oscillators serve as fundamental building blocks for quantum information processing, particularly within the bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platform. Conventional methods for extracting oscillator properties rely on predefined analytical gate sequences to access a restricted set of observables or resource-intensive tomography processes. Here, we introduce the Optimized Routine for Estimation of any Observable (OREO), a numerically optimized protocol that maps the expectation value of arbitrary oscillator observables onto a transmon state for efficient single-shot measurement. We demonstrate OREO in a bosonic cQED system as a means to efficiently measure phase-space quadratures and their higher moments, directly obtain faithful non-Gaussianity ranks, and effectively achieve state preparation independent of initial conditions in the oscillator. These results position OREO as a powerful and flexible tool for extracting information from quantum harmonic oscillators, unlocking new possibilities for measurement, control, and state preparation in continuous-variable quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Solving Dicke superradiance analytically: A compendium of methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Dicke superradiance problem, namely the time evolution of the density operator for an initially inverted ensemble of $N$ identical two-level systems (spins), undergoing collective spontaneous emission. This is one of the simplest examples of an open quantum system dynamics problem that admits a fully analytical solution. We provide a few different approaches to derive the analytical solution valid for any time during the evolution and for any number of spins. These approaches range from solving a set of coupled rate equations, to observing exceptional points stemming from non-Hermitian evolution, to the use of combinatorics and probabilistic methods, and finally to utilizing techniques based on the quantum jump unraveling of the master equation. The solution is expressed as a residue sum stemming from a contour integral in the complex plane and suggests the possibility of fully analytical solutions for a wider range of quantum open system dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>Grokking as an entanglement transition in tensor network machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grokking is a intriguing phenomenon in machine learning where a neural network, after many training iterations with negligible improvement in generalization, suddenly achieves high accuracy on unseen data. By working in the quantum-inspired machine learning framework based on tensor networks, we numerically prove that grokking phenomenon can be related to an entanglement dynamical transition in the underlying quantum many-body systems, consisting in a one-dimensional lattice with each site hosting a qubit. Two datasets are considered as use case scenarios, namely fashion MNIST and gene expression communities of hepatocellular carcinoma. In both cases, we train Matrix Product State (MPS) to perform binary classification tasks, and we analyse the learning dynamics. We exploit measurement of qubits magnetization and correlation functions in the MPS network as a tool to identify meaningful and relevant gene subcommunities, verified by means of enrichment procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While machine learning holds great promise for quantum technologies, most current methods focus on predicting or controlling a specific quantum system. Meta-learning approaches, however, can adapt to new systems for which little data is available, by leveraging knowledge obtained from previous data associated with similar systems. In this paper, we meta-learn dynamics and characteristics of closed and open two-level systems, as well as the Heisenberg model. Based on experimental data of a Loss-DiVincenzo spin-qubit hosted in a Ge/Si core/shell nanowire for different gate voltage configurations, we predict qubit characteristics i.e. $g$-factor and Rabi frequency using meta-learning. The algorithm we introduce improves upon previous state-of-the-art meta-learning methods for physics-based systems by introducing novel techniques such as adaptive learning rates and a global optimizer for improved robustness and increased computational efficiency. We benchmark our method against other meta-learning methods, a vanilla transformer, and a multilayer perceptron, and demonstrate improved performance.</description>

      <title>Experimental factoring integers using fixed-point-QAOA with a trapped-ion quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Factoring integers is considered as a computationally-hard problem for classical methods, whereas there exists polynomial-time Shor's quantum algorithm for solving this task. However, requirements for running the Shor's algorithm for realistic tasks, which are beyond the capabilities of existing and upcoming generations of quantum computing devices, motivates to search for alternative approaches. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate factoring of the integer with a trapped ion quantum processor using the Schnorr approach and a modified version of quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The key difference of our approach in comparison with the recently proposed QAOA-based factoring method is the use of the fixed-point feature, which relies on the use of universal parameters. We present experimental results on factoring $1591=37\times43$ using 6 qubits as well as simulation results for $74425657=9521\times7817$ with 10 qubits and $35183361263263=4194191\times8388593$ with 15 qubits. Alongside, we present all the necessary details for reproducing our results and analysis of the performance of the factoring method, the scalability of this approach both in classical and quantum domain still requires further studies.</description>

      <title>Performance of the spin qubit shuttling architecture for a surface code implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qubit shuttling promises to advance some quantum computing platforms to the qubit register sizes needed for effective quantum error correction (QEC), but also introduces additional errors whose impact must be evaluated. The established method to investigate the performance of QEC codes in a realistic scenario is to employ a standard noise model known as circuit-level noise, where all quantum operations are modeled as noisy. In the present work, we take this noise model and single out the effect of shuttling errors by introducing them as an additional so-called error location. This hardware abstraction is motivated by the SpinBus architecture and allows a systematic numerical investigation to map out the resulting two-dimensional parameter space. To this end, we take the Surface code and perform large scale simulations, most notably extracting the threshold across said two-dimensional parameter space. We study two scenarios for shuttling errors, depolarization on the one hand and dephasing on the other hand. For a purely dephasing shuttling error, we find a threshold of several percent, provided that all other operations have a high fidelity. The qubit overhead needed to reach a logical error rate of $10^{-12}$ (known as the "teraquop" regime~\cite{Gidney2021Jul}) increases only moderately for shuttling error rates up to about 1 \% per shuttling operation. The error rates at which practically useful, i.e. well below threshold error correction is predicted to be possible are comfortably higher than what is expected to be achievable for spin qubits. Our results thus show that it is reasonable to expect shuttling operations to fall below threshold already at surprisingly large error rates. With realistic efforts in the near term, this offers positive prospects for spin qubit based quantum processors as a viable avenue for scalable fault-tolerant error-corrected quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Utilizing discrete variable representations for decoherence-accurate numerical simulation of superconducting circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the prevalence of superconducting platforms for uses in quantum computing and quantum sensing, the simulation of quantum superconducting circuits has become increasingly important for identifying system characteristics and modeling their relevant dynamics. Various numerical tools and software packages have been developed with this purpose in mind, typically utilizing the harmonic oscillator basis or the charge basis to represent a Hamiltonian. In this work, we instead consider the use of discrete variable representations (DVRs) to model superconducting circuits. In particular, we use `sinc DVRs' of both charge number and phase to approximate the eigenenergies of several prototypical examples, exploring their use and effectiveness in the numerical analysis of superconducting circuits. We find that not only are these DVRs capable of achieving decoherence-accurate simulation, i.e., accuracy at the resolution of experiments subject to decay, decoherence, and dephasing, they also demonstrate improvements in efficiency with smaller basis sizes and better convergence over standard approaches, showing that DVRs are an advantageous alternative for representing superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Fast Sideband Control of a Weakly Coupled Multimode Bosonic Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) with superconducting cavities coupled to nonlinear circuits like transmons offers a promising platform for hardware-efficient quantum information processing. We address critical challenges in realizing this architecture by weakening the dispersive coupling while also demonstrating fast, high-fidelity multimode control by dynamically amplifying gate speeds through transmon-mediated sideband interactions. This approach enables transmon-cavity SWAP gates, for which we achieve speeds up to 30 times larger than the bare dispersive coupling. Combined with transmon rotations, this allows for efficient, universal state preparation in a single cavity mode, though achieving unitary gates and extending control to multiple modes remains a challenge. In this work, we overcome this by introducing two sideband control strategies: (1) a shelving technique that prevents unwanted transitions by temporarily storing populations in sideband-transparent transmon states and (2) a method that exploits the dispersive shift to synchronize sideband transition rates across chosen photon-number pairs to implement transmon-cavity SWAP gates that are selective on photon number. We leverage these protocols to prepare Fock and binomial code states across any of ten modes of a multimode cavity with millisecond cavity coherence times. We demonstrate the encoding of a qubit from a transmon into arbitrary vacuum and Fock state superpositions, as well as entangled NOON states of cavity mode pairs\textemdash a scheme extendable to arbitrary multimode Fock encodings. Furthermore, we implement a new binomial encoding gate that converts arbitrary transmon superpositions into binomial code states in $\qty{4}{\micro\second}$ (less than $1/\chi$), achieving an average post-selected final state fidelity of $\qty{96.3}{\percent}$ across different fiducial input states.</description>

      <title>Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.</description>

      <title>Improved Honeycomb and Hyper-Honeycomb Lattice Hamiltonians for Quantum Simulations of Non-Abelian Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improved Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonians for quantum simulations of non-Abelian Yang-Mills gauge theories are developed for honeycomb (2+1D) and hyper-honeycomb (3+1D) spatial tessellations. This is motivated by the desire to identify lattices for quantum simulations that involve only 3-link vertices among the gauge field group spaces in order to reduce the complexity in applications of the plaquette operator. For the honeycomb lattice, we derive a classically ${\cal O}(b^2)$-improved Hamiltonian, with $b$ being the lattice spacing. Tadpole improvement via the mean-field value of the plaquette operator is used to provide the corresponding quantum improvements. We have identified the (non-chiral) hyper-honeycomb as a candidate spatial tessellation for 3+1D quantum simulations of gauge theories, and determined the associated ${\cal O}(b)$-improved Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Disentangling anomaly-free symmetries of quantum spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We clarify the lore that anomaly-free symmetries are either on-site or can be transformed into on-site symmetries. We prove that any finite, internal, anomaly-free symmetry in a 1+1d lattice Hamiltonian system can be disentangled into an on-site symmetry by introducing ancillas and applying conjugation via a finite-depth quantum circuit. We provide an explicit construction of the disentangling circuit using Gauss's law operators and emphasize the necessity of adding ancillas. Our result establishes the converse to a generalized Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem by demonstrating that any anomaly-free symmetry admits a trivially gapped Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A Short Scalability Study on the SeQUeNCe Parallel Quantum Network Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum networking continues to grow in importance, its study is of interest to an ever wider community and at an increasing scale. However, the development of its physical infrastructure remains burdensome, and services providing third party access are not enough to meet demand. A variety of simulation frameworks provide a method for testing aspects of such systems on commodity hardware, but are predominantly serial and thus unable to scale to larger networks and/or workloads. One effort to address this was focused on parallelising the SeQUeNCe discrete event simulator, though it has yet to be proven to work well across system architectures or at larger scales. Therein lies the contribution of this work - to more deeply examine its scalability using ORNL Frontier. Our results provide new insight into its scalability behaviour, and we examine its strategy and how it may be able to be improved.</description>

      <title>Fusion Dynamics of Majorana Zero Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braiding and fusion of Majorana zero modes are key elements of any future topological Majorana-based quantum computer. Here, we investigate the fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes in the spinless Kitaev model, as well as in a spinfull model describing magnet-superconductor hybrid structures. We consider various scenarios allowing us to reproduce the fusion rules of the Ising anyon model. Particular emphasis is given to the charge of the fermion obtained after fusing two Majorana zero modes: as long as it remains on the superconductor, charge quantization is absent. When moving the fermion to a non-superconducting region, such as a quantum dot, nearly-quantized charge can be measured. Our findings confirm for both platforms that fusion dynamics of Majorana zero modes can indeed be used for the readout of Majorana qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper defines coherent manifolds and discusses their properties and their application in quantum mechanics. Every coherent manifold with a large group of symmetries gives rise to a Hilbert space, the completed quantum space of $Z$, which contains a distinguished family of coherent states labeled by the points of the manifold.
  The second quantization map in quantum field theory is generalized to quantization operators on arbitrary coherent manifolds. It is shown how the Schr\"odinger equation on any such completed quantum space can be solved in terms of computations only involving the coherent product. In particular, this applies to a description of Bosonic Fock spaces as completed quantum spaces of a class of coherent manifolds called Klauder spaces.</description>

      <title>Rotation-mediated bosonic Josephson junctions in position and momentum spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ultracold atoms, bosons tunneling in a double-well potential can produce a typical Josephson junction in real space. A major advancement in quantum matter and simulations is anticipated by the recently found momentum-space Josephson junction effect, which elucidates the supercurrent flow between spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates at two distinct independent momentum states. For the first time, our study unveils specific protocols to engineer momentum-space Josephson dynamics for scalar bosons (or a single-component condensate) in a rotating frame through modulation of the geometry of a double-well trapping potential and rotation frequencies. In this setup, rotation simultaneously results in effective double wells both in position and in momentum spaces, and the dynamics of the corresponding Josephson junctions is hosted in these double wells. Consequently, it is observed that the rotation generates momentum-space Josephson dynamics of the condensate along the transverse direction and position-space Josephson dynamics along the longitudinal direction; these effects are particularly noticeable for high rotation frequencies. Additionally, the rotation-induced momentum-space effects are highly significant in both the mean-field and many-body dynamics. Our protocols offer a framework for investigating momentum-space Josephson effects for single-component condensate in both theoretical and experimental contexts, as well as their significant applications in quantum mechanical devices.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen Atom in a Fuzzy Spherical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy onion model formed by connecting a set of concentric fuzzy spheres of increasing radius is motivated by studies of quantum space but can also be used to study standard physics. The main feature of the model is that functions in three-dimensional space, for example, scalar fields or wavefunctions, are expressed in terms of Hermitian matrices of a certain form. Relevant equations are then matrix equations, and some problems, such as searching for energy spectrum for fixed angular momentum quantum numbers $(l,m)$, can be expressed as an eigenvalue problem. We show how this simple approach can reproduce the results of other studies analyzing the hydrogen atom in a spherical cavity. We also test the effect of short distance quantum structure of the space on these solutions -- not looking for the phenomenological consequences, as the scale of quantum space is many orders below the order of the Bohr radius, but to understand the effect quantum space in general. We observe a set of solutions with no classical counterpart that has been described in a former theoretical study.</description>

      <title>Increasing quantum speed meter sensitivity using optical spring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The double-pass interferometer scheme was proposed in Ref.\,[Light Sci. Appl. {\bf 7}, 11 (2018)] as the method of implementation of the quantum speed meter concept in future laser gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Later it was shown in Ref.\,[Phys. Rev. D {\bf 110}, 062006 (2024)] that it allows to implement the new type of the optical spring that does not require detuning of the interferometer. Here we show that both these regimes can coexist, combining the speed meter type broadband sensitivity gain with the additional lows-frequency minimum in the quantum noise originated from the optical spring. We show that the location of this minimum can be varied without affecting the core optics of the interferometer, allowing to tune the quantum noise shape in real time to follow the ``chirp'' GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that quantum theory is non-differentiable, while general relativity is built on the assumption of differentiability sources an incompatibility between quantum theory and gravity. Higher order geometry addresses this issue directly by extending differential geometry, such that it can be applied to theories that are non-differentiable, but have a certain degree of H\"older regularity. As this includes the path integral formulation of quantum theory, it provides a natural mathematical framework for describing the interplay between gravity and quantum theory. In this article, we review the motivation for and the basic features of this framework and point towards future developments.</description>

      <title>Complex Frequency Detection in a Subsystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically explore the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and its associated complex-frequency detection in the context of a frequency-dependent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. This Hamiltonian arises from the self-energy correction of the subsystem and can be calculated exactly within our theoretical model, without the need for non-Hermitian approximations. Additionally, complex frequency detection, which encompasses complex frequency excitation, synthesis, and fingerprint, enables us to detect the physical responses driven by complex frequency excitations. Our calculations reveal that both complex frequency excitation and synthesis are sensitive to the non-Hermitian approximation and are unable to characterize the presence or abscence of the NHSE. In contrast, the complex-frequency fingerprint successfully detects the novel responses induced by the NHSE through the introduction of a double-frequency Green's function. Our work paves the way for a rigorous understanding of non-Hermitian physics in quantum systems and their experimental verification through complex frequency-domain techniques.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural quantum states have recently achieved remarkable performance in solving challenging quantum many-body problems. While transformer networks appear particularly promising due to their success in computer science, we show that previously reported transformer wave functions haven't so far been capable to utilize their full power. Here, we introduce the convolutional transformer wave function (CTWF). We show that our CTWFs exhibit superior performance in ground-state search and non-equilibrium dynamics compared to previous results, demonstrating promising capacity in complex quantum problems.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a novel machine learning based framework for discovering integrable models. Our approach first employs a synchronized ensemble of neural networks to find high-precision numerical solution to the Yang-Baxter equation within a specified class. Then, using an auxiliary system of algebraic equations, [Q_2, Q_3] = 0, and the numerical value of the Hamiltonian obtained via deep learning as a seed, we reconstruct the entire Hamiltonian family, forming an algebraic variety. We illustrate our presentation with three- and four-dimensional spin chains of difference form with local interactions. Remarkably, all discovered Hamiltonian families form rational varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whole-slide image classification represents a key challenge in computational pathology and medicine. Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as an effective approach for this problem. However, the effect of attention mechanism architecture on model performance is not well-documented for biomedical imagery. In this work, we compare different methods and implementations of MIL, including deep learning variants. We introduce a new method using higher-dimensional feature spaces for deep MIL. We also develop a novel algorithm for whole-slide image classification where extreme machine learning is combined with attention-based MIL to improve sensitivity and reduce training complexity. We apply our algorithms to the problem of detecting circulating rare cells (CRCs), such as erythroblasts, in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that nonlinearities play a key role in the classification, as removing them leads to a sharp decrease in stability in addition to a decrease in average area under the curve (AUC) of over 4%. We also demonstrate a considerable increase in robustness of the model with improvements of over 10% in average AUC when higher-dimensional feature spaces are leveraged. In addition, we show that extreme learning machines can offer clear improvements in terms of training efficiency by reducing the number of trained parameters by a factor of 5 whilst still maintaining the average AUC to within 1.5% of the deep MIL model. Finally, we discuss options of enriching the classical computing framework with quantum algorithms in the future. This work can thus help pave the way towards more accurate and efficient single-cell diagnostics, one of the building blocks of precision medicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel microfabricated neutral atom source for quantum technologies that can be easily integrated onto microchip devices using well-established MEMS fabrication techniques, and contrast this to conventional off-chip ion loading mechanisms. The heating filament of the device is shown to be as small as 90$\times$90 $\mu$m$^2$. Testing of the $^{171}$Yb fluorescence response is found to be in the low tens of milliseconds, two orders of magnitude faster compared to previous literature at a power of milliwatts making it desirable for low-power device packages. We demonstrate how the evaporation material can be capped in vacuum to work with materials such as Ba that oxidise easily in air, which can avoid the need for ablation lasers in the loading process. We calculate oven lifetimes to be over 10 years of continuous use for commonly used ion species in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Apparent teleportation of indistinguishable particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Teleportation, introduced in science fiction literature, is an instantaneous change of the position of a microscopic object. Two teleportation-like phenomena were predicted by quantum mechanics: quantum teleportation and, recently, quantum particle teleportation. The former is investigated experimentally and has applications in quantum communication and computing.
  Here, we introduced the third teleportation-like phenomenon - an apparent teleportation. It seems to be a natural consequence of elementary particles and antiparticles of the Standard Model being indistinguishable. We give an example of a process leading to the apparent teleportation within a toy model of boson-like particles. It utilizes the local transport of particles and antiparticles and the local creation and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs. Furthermore, we suggest a method to observe the apparent teleportation in nucleus-nucleus collisions at properly selected collision energy. The method requires the measurement of correlations between momenta of charm and anticharm hadrons in collisions with a single $c\bar{c}$ pair being produced. The ultimate prediction following the apparent teleportation hypothesis is the uncorrelated emission of charm and anticharm hadrons. It can be tested by contemporary experiments.
  Observing the apparent teleportation would uncover the basic transport properties of indistinguishable particles. In particular, the apparent teleportation may explain the rapid thermalisation of the system created in collisions of two atomic nuclei. Theoretical and experimental efforts are needed to observe the apparent teleportation processes and study their properties.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking low-power flopping-mode spin qubit fidelities in Si/SiGe devices with alloy disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the "flopping-mode" regime of electron spin resonance, a single electron confined in a double quantum dot is electrically driven in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. The increased dipole moment of the charge in the flopping mode significantly reduces the amount of power required to drive spin rotations. However, the susceptibility of flopping-mode spin qubits to charge noise, and consequently their overall performance, has not been examined in detail. In this work, we simulate single-qubit gate fidelities of electrically driven spin rotations in an ensemble of devices configured to operate in both the single-dot and flopping-mode regimes. Our model accounts for the valley physics of conduction band electrons in silicon and realistic alloy disorder in the SiGe barrier layers, allowing us to investigate device-to-device variability. We include charge and magnetic noise, as well as spin relaxation processes arising from charge noise and electron-phonon coupling. We find that the two operating modes exhibit significantly different susceptibilities to the various noise sources, with valley splitting and spin relaxation times also playing a role in their relative performance. For realistic noise strengths, we find that single-dot gate fidelities are limited by magnetic noise while flopping-mode fidelities are primarily limited by charge noise and spin relaxation. For sufficiently long spin relaxation times, flopping-mode spin operation is feasible with orders-of-magnitude lower drive power and gate fidelities that are on par with conventional single-dot electric dipole spin resonance.</description>

      <title>Entropy Gain and Information Loss by Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:1908.10364v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When the quantum entropy (QE) of a system increases due to measurements, it leads to the loss of certain information, part of which may be recoverable. We define Information Loss (IL) as a function of the density matrix through quantum entropy to effectively represent this relationship between gain and loss. For example, if the quantum entropy of a system increases from zero to 2ln2, its information loss rises from zero to 75 percent. We demonstrate that when a pure, unbiased m-qubit state collapses into a maximally mixed state, it acquires the highest possible gain in entropy and the maximal loss of information. We analyze the QE and IL of single qubits, entangled photon pairs in Bell tests, multi-qubit systems such as in quantum teleportation, GHZ and W states, as well as the two-qubit Werner mixed states, focusing on their dependence on parameters like polarization bias. We notice that the data exchange between the two observers in Bell tests can recover some of the lost quantum information even years later, indicating that the associated quantum entropy can be removed years later, which implies a possible explanation linked to quantum non-locality. We show that measuring the Bell, GHZ, and marginally entangled Werner state yields the same minimal entropy gain (ln2) and an equal minimal information loss (50 percent).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.02247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum non-Gaussian states of photons and phonons are conclusive and direct witnesses of higher-than-quadratic nonlinearities in optical and mechanical processes. Moreover, they are proven resources for quantum sensing, communication and error correction with diverse continuous-variable systems. This review introduces theoretical analyses of nonclassical and quantum non-Gaussian states of photons and phonons. It recapitulates approaches used to derive operational criteria for photons tolerant to optical losses, their application in experiments and their nowadays extension to quantum non-Gaussian photon coincidences. It extends to a recent comparison of quantum non-Gaussianity, including robustness to thermal noise, and sensing capability for high-quality phononic Fock states of single trapped cooled ions. The review can stimulate further development in the criteria of quantum non-Gaussian states and experimental effort to prepare and detect such useful features, navigating the community to advanced quantum physics and technology.</description>

      <title>Noise-immune quantum correlations of intense light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05535v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lasers with high intensity generally exhibit strong intensity fluctuations far above the shot-noise level. Taming this noise is pivotal to a wide range of applications, both classical and quantum. Here, we demonstrate the creation of intense light with quantum levels of noise even when starting from inputs with large amounts of excess noise. In particular, we demonstrate how intense squeezed light with intensities approaching 0.1 TW/cm^2, but noise at or below the shot noise level, can be produced from noisy inputs associated with high-power amplified laser sources (an overall noise-reduction of 30-fold). Based on a new theory of quantum noise in multimode systems, we show that the ability to generate quantum light from noisy inputs results from multimode quantum correlations, which maximally decouple the output light from the dominant noise channels in the input light. As an example, we demonstrate this effect for femtosecond pulses in nonlinear fibers, but the noise-immune correlations that enable our results are generic to many other nonlinear systems in optics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Frequency-dependent squeezing for gravitational-wave detection through quantum teleportation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04295v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ground-based interferometric gravitational wave detectors are highly precise sensors for weak forces, limited in sensitivity across their detection band by quantum fluctuations of light. Current and future instruments address this limitation by injecting frequency-dependent squeezed vacuum into the detection port, utilizing narrow-band, low-loss optical cavities for optimal rotation of the squeezing ellipse at each signal frequency. This study introduces a novel scheme employing the principles of quantum teleportation and entangled states of light. It allows achieving broadband suppression of quantum noise in detuned signal recycled-Fabry-Perot--Michelson interferometers, which is the baseline design of the low-frequency detector within the Einstein Telescope xylophone detector, without requiring additional filter cavities or modifications to the core optics of the main interferometer.</description>

      <title>Virtual Z gates and symmetric gate compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The virtual Z gate has been established as an important tool for performing quantum gates on various platforms, including but not limited to superconducting systems. Many such platforms offer a limited set of calibrated gates and compile all other gates using combinations of X-type and virtual Z gates. Here, we show that the method of compilation has important consequences in an open quantum system setting. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate that it is crucial to choose a compilation that is symmetric with respect to virtual Z rotations. An important example is dynamical decoupling (DD) sequences, where improper gate decomposition can result in unintended effects such as the implementation of the wrong sequence. Our findings indicate that in many cases the performance of DD is adversely affected by the incorrect use of virtual Z gates, compounding other coherent pulse errors. This holds even for DD sequences designed to be robust against systematic control errors. In addition, we identify another source of coherent errors: interference between consecutive pulses that follow each other too closely. This work provides insights into improving general quantum gate performance and optimizing DD sequences in particular.</description>

      <title>Single-photon scattering in giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems have recently emerged as a promising platform for manipulating light-matter interactions. The combination of the multiple-point couplings and topological phase effect could lead to rich physical phenomena and effects. Here, we study single-photon scattering in a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide coupled to either one or two two-level giant atoms. We assume that each giant atom is coupled to the waveguide via two coupling points and hence there exist four and sixteen coupling configurations for the single-giant-atom case and two-giant-atom separate coupling case, respectively. By solving the single-photon scattering problem in the real space, we obtain the exact expressions of the single-photon scattering amplitudes. It is found that a single photon in the SSH waveguide can be completely reflected or transmitted by choosing proper coupling configurations, coupling-point distances, atomic resonance frequency, and dimerization parameter. In addition, under proper parameter conditions, the scattering spectra are periodically modulated by the coupling-point distances. We also find that the collective behavior of the two giant atoms can be adjusted by quantum interference effect and topological effect and that the single-photon scattering spectra can exhibit the Lorentzian, super-Gaussian, electromagnetically induced transparencylike, and asymmetric Fano line shapes for some coupling configurations. This work will inspire the development of controllable single-photon devices based on the giant-atom topological-waveguide-QED systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum purity amplification (QPA) provides a novel approach to counteracting the pervasive noise that degrades quantum states. We present the optimal QPA protocol for general quantum systems and global noise, resolving a two-decade open problem. Under strong depolarization, our protocol achieves an exponential reduction in sample complexity over the best-known methods. We provide an efficient implementation of the protocol based on generalized quantum phase estimation. Additionally, we introduce SWAPNET, a sparse and shallow circuit that enables QPA for near-term experiments. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our protocol applied to quantum simulation of Hamiltonian evolution, enhancing the fidelity of input states even under circuit-level noise. Our findings suggest that QPA could improve the performance of quantum information processing tasks, particularly in the context of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, where reducing the effect of noise with limited resources is critical.</description>

      <title>Tensor Product Structure Geometry under Unitary Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, complex dynamics delocalize the physical degrees of freedom. This spreading of information throughout the system has been extensively studied in relation to quantum thermalization, scrambling, and chaos. Locality is typically defined with respect to a tensor product structure (TPS) which identifies the local subsystems of the quantum system. In this paper, we investigate a simple geometric measure of operator spreading by quantifying the distance of the space of local operators from itself evolved under a unitary channel. We show that this TPS distance is related to the scrambling properties of the dynamics between the local subsystems and coincides with the entangling power of the dynamics in the case of a symmetric bipartition. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for the maximization of the TPS distance and show that the class of 2-unitaries provides examples of dynamics that achieve this maximal value. For Hamiltonian evolutions at short times, the characteristic timescale of the TPS distance depends on scrambling rates determined by the strength of interactions between the local subsystems. Beyond this short-time regime, the behavior of the TPS distance is explored through numerical simulations of prototypical models exhibiting distinct ergodic properties, ranging from quantum chaos and integrability to Hilbert space fragmentation and localization.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermal machine regimes in the transverse-field Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify and interpret the possible quantum thermal machine regimes with a transverse-field Ising model as the working substance. In general, understanding the emergence of such regimes in a many-body quantum system is challenging due to the dependence on the many energy levels in the system. By considering infinitesimal work strokes, we can understand the operation from equilibrium properties of the system. We find that infinitesimal work strokes enable both heat engine and accelerator operation, with the output and boundaries of operation described by macroscopic properties of the system, in particular the net transverse magnetization. At low temperatures, the regimes of operation and performance can be understood from quasiparticles in the system, while at high temperatures an expansion of the free energy in powers of inverse temperature describes the operation. The understanding generalises to larger work strokes when the temperature difference between the hot and cold reservoirs is large. For hot and cold reservoirs close in temperature, a sufficiently large work stroke can enable refrigerator and heater regimes. Our results and method of analysis will prove useful in understanding the possible regimes of operation of quantum many-body thermal machines more generally.</description>

      <title>Topological stabilizer models on continuous variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of two-dimensional topological stabilizer codes on continuous variable (CV) degrees of freedom, which generalize homological rotor codes and the toric-GKP code. Our topological codes are built using the concept of boson condensation -- we start from a parent stabilizer code based on an $\mathbb{R}$ gauge theory and condense various bosonic excitations. This produces a large class of topological CV stabilizer codes, including ones that are characterized by the anyon theories of $U(1)_{2n}\times U(1)_{-2m}$ Chern-Simons theories, for arbitrary pairs of positive integers $(n,m)$. Most notably, this includes anyon theories that are non-chiral and nevertheless do not admit a gapped boundary. It is widely believed that such anyon theories cannot be realized by any stabilizer model on finite-dimensional systems. We conjecture that these CV codes go beyond codes obtained from concatenating a topological qudit code with a local encoding into CVs, and thus, constitute the first example of topological codes that are intrinsic to CV systems. Moreover, we study the Hamiltonians associated to the topological CV stabilizer codes and show that, although they have a gapless spectrum, they can become gapped with the addition of a quadratic perturbation. We show that similar methods can be used to construct a gapped Hamiltonian whose anyon theory agrees with a $U(1)_2$ Chern-Simons theory. Our work initiates the study of scalable stabilizer codes that are intrinsic to CV systems and highlights how error-correcting codes can be used to design and analyze many-body systems of CVs that model lattice gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advances in quantum algorithms suggest a tentative scaling advantage on certain combinatorial optimization problems. Recent work, however, has also reinforced the idea that barren plateaus render variational algorithms ineffective on large Hilbert spaces. Hence, finding annealing protocols by variation ultimately appears to be difficult. Similarly, the adiabatic theorem fails on hard problem instances with first-order quantum phase transitions. Here, we show how to use the spin coherent-state path integral to shape the geometry of quantum adiabatic evolution, leading to annealing protocols at polynomial overhead that provide orders-of-magnitude improvements in the probability to measure optimal solutions, relative to linear protocols. These improvements are not obtained on a controllable toy problem but on randomly generated hard instances (Sherrington-Kirkpatrick and Maximum 2-Satisfiability), making them generic and robust. Our method works for large systems and may thus be used to improve the performance of state-of-the-art quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Analytic solution to degenerate biphoton states generated in arrays of nonlinear waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrays of nonlinear waveguides are a powerful integrated photonics platform for studying and manipulating quantum states of light. Also, they are a valuable resource for various quantum technologies. In this work, we employed a supermode approach to obtain an analytic solution to the evolution of degenerate biphoton states in arrays of nonlinear waveguides. The solution accounts for arrays of an arbitrary number of waveguides and coupling profiles. In addition, it provides an explicit analytic expression without the need of computationally-expensive steps. Actually, it only relies on the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the coupling matrix. In general, this needs to be performed numerically, but there are relevant instances in which analytic expressions are available. Thus, in certain cases, the procedure proposed here does not require the use of any numerical method. We analyze the general properties of the solution and show some application examples. Particularly, simple solutions that can be obtained by special symmetric injection profiles, the results for small arrays, and the properties of the propagation when only the center waveguide is pumped in a symmetric odd array. In addition, we present a proof-of-principle example on how to use the analytic solution to tackle inversion problems. That is, obtaining the initial conditions required to achieve a desired quantum state -- which is a valuable technological application. A relevant aspect of the method presented here is its scalability for large arrays due to the lack of resource-intensive steps -- both for the direct and inverse problems.</description>

Abstract: Recent work argued that the scaling of a dimensionless quantity $Q_D$ with path length is a better proxy for quantifying the scaling of the computational cost of maintaining adiabaticity than the timescale. It also conjectured that generically the scaling will be superlinear (although special cases exist in which it is linear). The quantity $Q_D$ depends only on the properties of ground states along the Hamiltonian path and the rate at which the path is followed. In this paper, we demonstrate that this conjecture holds for simple Hamiltonian systems that can be studied numerically. In particular, the systems studied exhibit the behavior that $Q_D$ grows approximately as $L \log L$ where $L$ is the path length when the threshold error is fixed.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Realization of Majorana Zero Modes in a Particle-Conserving Ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a scheme to realize a topological superconducting system supporting Majorana zero modes, within a number-conserving framework suitable for optical-lattice experiments. Our approach builds on the engineering of pair-hopping processes on a ladder geometry, using a sequence of pulses that activate single-particle hopping in a time-periodic manner. We demonstrate that this dynamic setting is well captured by an effective Hamiltonian that preserves the parity symmetry, a key requirement for the stabilization of Majorana zero modes. The phase diagram of our system is determined using a bosonization theory, which is then validated by a numerical study of the topological bulk gap and entanglement spectrum using matrix product states. Our results indicate that Majorana zero modes can be stabilized in a large parameter space, accessible in optical-lattice experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT), used to estimate the linear map that best describes a quantum operation, is usually performed using a priori assumptions about state preparation and measurement (SPAM), which yield a biased and inconsistent estimator. This estimate can be made more accurate and less biased by incorporating SPAM-calibration data. Unobservable properties of the SPAM operations introduce a small gauge freedom that can be regularized using the a priori SPAM. We give an explicit correction procedure for standard linear-inversion QPT and overcomplete linear-inversion QPT, and describe how to extend it to statistically principled estimators like maximum likelihood estimation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Non-Local Nonstabilizerness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06393v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum nonstabilizerness are fundamental resources that characterize distinct aspects of a quantum state: entanglement reflects non-local correlations, while nonstabilizerness quantifies the deviation from stabilizer states. A quantum state becomes a valuable resource for applications like universal quantum computation only when both quantities are present. Here, we propose that quantum non-local nonstabilizerness (NN) serves as an effective measure of this combined resource, incorporating both entanglement and nonstabilizerness. We demonstrate that NN can be precisely computed for two-qubit pure states, where it is directly related to the entanglement spectrum. We then extend the definition of NN to mixed states and explore its presence in many-body quantum systems, revealing that the two-point NN decays according to a power law in critical states. Furthermore, we explore measurement-induced NN and uncover an intriguing phenomenon termed "nonstabilizerness swapping", analogous to entanglement swapping, wherein post-measurement NN decays more slowly than any pre-measurement correlations. Our results thus represent a pivotal step towards accurately quantifying the "quantumness" of a state and reveal the potential for manipulating this resource through measurements.</description>

      <title>Unveiling a Hidden Percolation Transition in Monitored Clifford Circuits: Inroads from ZX-Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>

Abstract: We study, experimentally and theoretically, temporal correlations between the polarization of photon pairs emitted during the biexciton-exciton radiative cascade from a single semiconductor quantum dot, optically excited by a continuous-wave light source. The system is modeled by a Lindbladian coupled to two Markovian baths: One bath represents the continuous light source, and a second represents the emitted radiation. Very good agreement is obtained between the theoretical model that we constructed and a set of 36 different time resolved, polarization correlation measurements between cascading photon pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05693v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum spin glasses form a good testbed for studying the performance of various quantum annealing and optimization algorithms. In this work we show how two- and three-dimensional tensor networks can accurately and efficiently simulate the quantum annealing dynamics of Ising spin glasses on a range of lattices. Such dynamics were recently simulated using D-Wave's Advantage$2$ system [A. D. King et al, Science, 10.1126/science.ado6285 (2025)] and, following extensive comparisons to existing numerical methods, claimed to be beyond the reach of classical computation. Here we show that by evolving lattice-specific tensor networks with simple belief propagation to keep up with the entanglement generated during the time evolution and then extracting expectation values with more sophisticated variants of belief propagation, state-of-the-art accuracies can be reached with modest computational resources. We exploit the scalability of our simulations and simulate a system of over $300$ qubits, allowing us to verify the universal physics present and extract a value for the associated Kibble-Zurek exponent which agrees with recent values obtained in literature. Our results demonstrate that tensor networks are a viable approach for simulating large scale quantum dynamics in two and three dimensions on classical computers, and algorithmic advancements are expected to expand their applicability going forward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Training Hybrid Deep Quantum Neural Network for Reinforced Learning Efficiently</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers a new paradigm for computation, exploiting an exponentially growing Hilbert space for data representation and operation. Computing results are obtained from measurement based stochastic sampling over nontrivial distributions produced by the quantum computing process with complex correlations from quantum entanglement. Quantum machine learning (QML) emerged as a promising method, potentially surpassing classical counterparts in efficiency and accuracy. While large scale fault tolerant quantum (LSFTQ) machines are not yet available, recent works on hybrid quantum machine learning models, compatible with noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) computers, have hinted at improved generalizability. Such hybrid deep quantum neural networks (hDQNNs) integrate GPU CPU based deep neural networks (DNNs) with forward parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) that can be straightforwardly executed on quantum processors. However, backpropagating through forward PQCs remains computationally inefficient if it is simulated on classical hardware, and current quantum hardware constraints impede batched backpropagation even with dedicated PQCs for calculating gradients of forward PQCs, limiting scalability for modern machine learning tasks. Here, we present a scalable quantum machine learning architecture that overcomes these challenges with efficient backpropagation, enabling scalable hDQNN training with PQCs on physical quantum computers or classical PQC simulators. Applied to reinforcement learning benchmarks, our method highlights that hDQNNs could exhibit potentially improved generalizability compared to purely classical models. These findings offer a pathway toward near term hybrid quantum classical computing systems for large scale machine learning and underscore the potential of hybrid quantum classical architectures in advancing artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>An Achievable Rate Region for $3-$User Classical-Quantum Broadcast Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.00110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the scenario of communicating on a $3\mhyphen$user classical-quantum broadcast channel. We undertake an information theoretic study and focus on the problem of characterizing an inner bound to its capacity region. We design a new coding scheme based \textit{partitioned coset codes} - an ensemble of codes possessing algebraic properties. Analyzing its information-theoretic performance, we characterize a new inner bound. We identify examples for which the derived inner bound is strictly larger than that achievable using IID random codes.
  Proceeding further, we incorporate Sen's technique of tilting smoothing and augmentation to perform simultaneous decoding via a simultaneous decoding POVM and thereby characterize a further enlarged achievable rate region for communicating classical bits over the $3-$user classical-quantum broadcast channel. Finally, in our last step, we characterize a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of the $3-$user classical-quantum broadcast channel that subsumes all previous known inner bounds by combining the conventional unstructured IID codes with structured coset code strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of interacting quantum and classical systems in the Heisenberg representation. Unlike the usual construction in standard quantum mechanics, mixed quantum-classical systems involve the interplay of unitary operators acting on the quantum observables and the Lagrangian trajectories sweeping the classical degrees of freedom. This interplay reflects an intricate structure which is made particularly challenging by the backreaction excerpted on the classical trajectories by the quantum degrees of freedom. While the backreaction is underestimated in the common Ehrenfest model, more recent methodologies succeed in capturing this important effect by resorting to Koopman wavefunctions in classical mechanics. Luckily, both Ehrenfest and Koopman models enjoy a variational framework which is exploited here to unfold the geometric structure underlying quantum-classical coupling. A special role is played by the action of the diffeomorphic Lagrangian paths on a non-Abelian pure-gauge potential which comprises statistical correlations. After presenting the treatment in the simple case of Ehrenfest dynamics, we move on to the Koopman model and present the role of the backreaction terms therein. Finally, we compare both models in the context of pure-dephasing systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism to explain the emergence of an intermediate gapless spin liquid phase in the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model in an externally applied magnetic field, sandwiched between the well-known gapped chiral spin liquid and the gapped partially polarized phase. We propose that, in moderate fields, $\pi$-fluxes nucleate in the ground state and trap Majorana zero modes. As these fluxes proliferate with increasing field, the Majorana zero modes overlap creating an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum Majorana metallic state with a `Fermi surface' at zero energy. We further show that the Majorana spectral function captures the dynamical spin and dimer correlations obtained by the infinite Projected Entangled Pair States method, thereby validating our variational approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel analytical approach to solving large-scale Ising problems by reformulating the discrete Ising Hamiltonian into a continuous framework. This transformation enables us to derive exact solutions for a non-trivial class of fully connected Ising models. To validate our method, we conducted numerical experiments comparing our analytical solutions with those obtained from a quantum-inspired Ising algorithm and a quantum Ising machine. The results demonstrate that the quantum-inspired algorithm and brute-force method successfully align with our solutions, while the quantum Ising machine exhibits notable deviations. Our method offers promising avenues for analytically solving diverse Ising problem instances, while the class of Ising problems addressed here provides a robust framework for assessing the fidelity of Ising machines.</description>

Abstract: We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and focus on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of a $3-$user QIC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.</description>

Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.</description>
