      <title>Storage Capacity Evaluation of the Quantum Perceptron using the Replica Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a quantum perceptron implemented on a quantum circuit using a repeat until method. We evaluate this from the perspective of capacity, one of the performance evaluation measures for perceptions. We assess a Gardner volume, defined as a volume of coefficients of the perceptron that can correctly classify given training examples using the replica method. The model is defined on the quantum circuit. Nevertheless, it is straightforward to assess the capacity using the replica method, which is a standard method in classical statistical mechanics. The reason why we can solve our model by the replica method is the repeat until method, in which we focus on the output of the measurements of the quantum circuit. We find that the capacity of a quantum perceptron is larger than that of a classical perceptron since the quantum one is simple but effectively falls into a highly nonlinear form of the activation function.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Polarization in One-dimensional Aperiodic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By implementing a charge pumping scheme for one-dimensional aperiodic chains, we confirm the existence of topological phases in these systems whenever their finite-size realizations admit inversion symmetry. These phases are usually characterized by an anomalous edge response as a result of the bulk-boundary correspondence. We show that these signatures are all present in various chains, each representing a different class of structural aperiodicity: the Fibonacci quasicrystal, the Tribonacci quasicrystal, and the Thue-Morse chain. More specifically, we calculate three quantities: the Berry phase of the crystalline approximation of the finite-size systems, the polarization response to an inifintesimal static and constant electric field in systems with open boundary conditions, and the degeneracy of the entanglement spectrum. We find that all of them provide signatures of a topologically nontrivial phase.</description>

      <title>Unifying the Temperature Dependent Dynamics of Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong changes in bulk properties, such as modulus and viscosity, are observed near the glass transition temperature, T_{g}, of amorphous materials. For more than a century, intense efforts have been made to define a microscopic origin for these macroscopic changes in properties. Using transition state theory, we delve into the atomic/molecular level picture of how microscopic localized relaxations, or "cage rattles," translate to macroscopic structural relaxations above T_{g}. Unit motion is broken down into two populations: (1) simultaneous rearrangement occurs among a critical number of units, n_{\alpha}, which ranges from 1 to 4, allowing a systematic classification of glasses that is compared to fragility; (2) near T_{g}, adjacent units provide additional free volume for rearrangement, not simultaneously, but within the "primitive" lifetime, {\tau}_{1}, of one unit rattling in its cage. Relaxation maps illustrate how Johari-Goldstein \{beta} relaxations stem from the rattle of n_{\alpha} units. We analyzed a wide variety of glassy materials, and materials with glassy response, using literature data. Our four-parameter equation fits "strong" and "weak" glasses over the entire range of temperatures and also extends to other glassy systems, such as ion-transporting polymers and ferroelectric relaxors. The role of activation entropy in boosting preexponential factors to high "unphysical" apparent frequencies is discussed.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Boltzmann samplers in dense liquids: weak-coupling approximation and mode-coupling theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exerting a nonequilibrium drive on an otherwise equilibrium Langevin process brings the dynamics out of equilibrium but can also speedup the approach to the Boltzmann steady-state. Transverse forces are a minimal framework to achieve dynamical acceleration of the Boltzmann sampling. We consider a simple liquid in three space dimensions subjected to additional transverse pairwise forces, and quantify the extent to which transverse forces accelerate the dynamics. We first explore the dynamics of a tracer in a weak coupling regime describing high temperatures. The resulting acceleration is correlated with a monotonous increase of the magnitude of odd transport coefficients (mobility and diffusivity) with the amplitude of the transverse drive. We then develop a nonequilibrium version of the mode-coupling theory able to capture the effect of transverse forces, and more generally of forces created by additional degrees of freedom. Based on an analysis of transport coefficients, both odd and longitudinal, both for the collective modes and for a tracer particle, we find a systematic acceleration of the dynamics. Quantitatively, the gain, which is guaranteed throughout the ergodic phase, turns out to be a decreasing function of temperature beyond a temperature crossover, in particular as the glass transition is approached. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with available numerical results.</description>

      <title>Stark localization near Aubry-Andr\'{e} criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the Stark localization near the Aubry-Andr\'{e} (AA) critical point. We study system-dependent parameters, such as localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy gap between the ground and first excited state, for characterizing the localization-delocalization transition. We show that the scaling exponents possessed by these key descriptors of localization are quite different from that of a pure AA model or Stark model. Near the critical point of the AA model, inducing Stark field of strength $h$, the localization length $\zeta$ scales as $\zeta\propto h^{-\nu}$ with $\nu\approx0.29$ which is different than both the pure AA model ($\nu=1$) and Stark model ($\nu\approx0.33$). The IPR scales as IPR $\propto h^{s}$ with $s\approx0.096$ which is again significantly different than both the pure AA model ($s\approx0.33$) and Stark model ($s\approx0.33$). The energy gap, $\Delta$, scales as $E\propto h^{\nu z}$, where $z\approx2.37$ which is however same as the pure AA model.</description>

      <title>Achieving the volume-law entropy regime with random-sign Dicke states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating entanglement, which reflects non-local correlations in a quantum system and defines the complexity of describing its wave function, represents the extremely tough challenge in the fields of quantum computing, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. In this work, by the example of the well-structured Dicke states we demonstrate that the complexity of these real-valued wave functions can be accurately tuned by introducing a random-sign structure, which allows us to explore the regime of the volume-law entanglement. Importantly, setting nontrivial sign structure one can increase the entanglement entropy of the Dicke state to the values that are close to Page's estimates for Haar-random states. The practical realization of these random-sign Dicke states is possible on different physical platforms with shallow quantum circuits. On the level of the measurements the change in the quantum state complexity due to sign structure can be traced out with the dissimilarity measure that estimates multi-scale variety of patterns in bit-string arrays.</description>

      <title>Successive Phase Transition in Higher-order Topological Anderson Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder, traditionally believed to hinder the propagation of waves. has recently been shown to prompt the occurrence of topological phase transitions. For example, when disorder strength continuously increases and surpasses certain critical value, a phase transition from topologically trivial to nontrivial insulating phases occurs. However, in the parameter domain of the nontrivial phase, whether there exists a finer phase diagram that can be further classified by different disorder strengths is still unclear. Here we present a successive topological phase transition driven by the disorder strength in a higher-order topological insulator with long-range couplings. As the strength of the disorder gradually increases, the real-space topological invariant of the system undergoes a consecutive change from 0 to 4, accompanied by the stepped increase in the number of boundary-localized corner states. Our work opens an avenue for utilizing disorder to induce phase transitions among different higher-order topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Designing athermal disordered solids with automatic differentiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to control forces between sub-micron-scale building blocks offers considerable potential for designing new materials through self-assembly. A typical paradigm is to first identify a particular (crystal) structure that has some desired property, and then design building-block interactions so that this structure assembles spontaneously. While significant theoretical and experimental progress has been made in assembling complicated structures in a variety of systems, this two-step paradigm fundamentally fails for structurally disordered solids, which lack a well-defined structure to use as a target. Here we show that disordered solids can still be treated from an inverse self-assembly perspective by targeting material properties directly. Using the Poisson's ratio, $\nu$, as a primary example, we show how differentiable programming connects experimentally relevant interaction parameters with emergent behavior, allowing us to iteratively "train" the system until we find the set of interactions that leads to the Poisson's ratio we desire. Beyond the Poisson's ratio, we also tune the pressure and a measure of local 8-fold structural order, as well as multiple properties simultaneously, demonstrating the potential for nontrivial design in disordered solids. This approach is highly robust, transferable, and scalable, can handle a wide variety of model systems, properties of interest, and preparation dynamics, and can optimize over 100s or even 1000s of parameters. This result connects the fields of disordered solids and inverse self-assembly, indicating that many of the tools and ideas that have been developed to understand the assembly of crystals can also be used to control the properties of disordered solids.</description>

      <title>Identifying phase transitions in physical systems with neural networks: a neural architecture search perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning algorithms to investigate phase transitions in physical systems is a valuable way to better understand the characteristics of these systems. Neural networks have been used to extract information of phases and phase transitions directly from many-body configurations. However, one limitation of neural networks is that they require the definition of the model architecture and parameters previous to their application, and such determination is itself a difficult problem. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the relationship between the accuracy of neural networks for information of phases and the network configuration (that comprises the architecture and hyperparameters). We formulate the phase analysis as a regression task, address the question of generating data that reflects the different states of the physical system, and evaluate the performance of neural architecture search for this task. After obtaining the optimized architectures, we further implement smart data processing and analytics by means of neuron coverage metrics, assessing the capability of these metrics to estimate phase transitions. Our results identify the neuron coverage metric as promising for detecting phase transitions in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the crystallization kinetics in Ge-rich Ge$_x$Te alloys by large scale simulations with a machine-learned interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A machine-learned interatomic potential for Ge-rich Ge$_x$Te alloys has been developed aiming at uncovering the kinetics of phase separation and crystallization in these materials. The results are of interest for the operation of embedded phase change memories which exploits Ge-enrichment of GeSbTe alloys to raise the crystallization temperature. The potential is generated by fitting a large database of energies and forces computed within Density Functional Theory with the neural network scheme implemented in the DeePMD-kit package. The potential is highly accurate and suitable to describe the structural and dynamical properties of the liquid, amorphous and crystalline phases of the wide range of compositions from pure Ge and stoichiometric GeTe to the Ge-rich Ge$_2$Te alloy. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations revealed a crystallization mechanism which depends on temperature. At 600 K, segregation of most of Ge in excess occurs on the ns time scale followed by crystallization of nearly stoichiometric GeTe regions. At 500 K, nucleation of crystalline GeTe occurs before phase separation, followed by a slow crystal growth due to the concurrent expulsion of Ge in excess.</description>

      <title>A general multi-wave quasi-resonance theory for lattice energy diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, a multi-wave quasi-resonance framework is established to analyze energy diffusion in classical lattices, uncovering that it is fundamentally determined by the characteristics of eigenmodes. Namely, based on the presence and the absence of extended modes, lattices fall into two universality classes with qualitatively different thermalization behavior. In particular, we find that while the one with extended modes can be thermalized under arbitrarily weak perturbations in the thermodynamic limit, the other class can be thermalized only when perturbations exceed a certain threshold, revealing for the first time the possibility that a lattice cannot be thermalized, violating the hypothesis of statistical mechanics. Our study addresses conclusively the renowned Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou problem for large systems under weak perturbations, underscoring the pivotal roles of both extended and localized modes in facilitating energy diffusion and thermalization processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the quantification of metabolism, nonequilibrium steady states play a central role in living matter, but are beyond the purview of equilibrium statistical mechanics. Here we develop a fermionic theory of nonequilibrium steady states in continuous-time Markovian systems, generalizing Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics to this case. The response to an arbitrary perturbation is computed, and simplified in canonical cases. Beyond response, we consider ensembles of nonequilibrium steady states and show that a general class of ensembles is described by a 2D statistical field theory with infinitesimally broken supersymmetry, which may form the basis of nontrivial solvable models of nonequilibrium steady states.</description>
