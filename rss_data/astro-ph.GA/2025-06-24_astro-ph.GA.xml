      <title>A new window into the sub-parsec scale magnetic field in the Milky Way? Unveiling small-scale magneto-ionic structures with Faraday complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio broadband spectro-polarimetric observations are sensitive to the spatial fluctuations of the Faraday depth (FD) within the telescope beam. Such FD fluctuations are referred to as "Faraday complexity", and can unveil small-scale magneto-ionic structures in both the synchrotron-emitting and the foreground volumes. We explore the astrophysical origin of the Faraday complexity exhibited by 191 polarised extragalactic radio sources (EGSs) within 5 deg from the Galactic plane in the longitude range of 20-52 deg, using broadband data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array presented by a previous work. A new parameter called the FD spread is devised to quantify the spatial FD fluctuations. We find that the FD spread of the EGSs (i) demonstrates an enhancement near the Galactic mid-plane, most notable within Galactic latitude of +-3 deg, (ii) exhibits hints of modulations across Galactic longitude, (iii) does not vary with the source size across the entire range of 2.5"-300", and (iv) has an amplitude higher than expected from magneto-ionic structures of extragalactic origin. All these suggest that the primary cause of the Faraday complexity exhibited by our target EGSs is &lt;2.5"-scale magneto-ionic structures in the Milky Way. We argue that the anisotropic turbulent magnetic field generated by galactic-scale shocks and shears, or the stellar feedback-driven isotropic turbulent magnetic field, are the most likely candidates. Our work highlights the use of broadband radio polarimetric observations of EGSs as a powerful probe of multi-scale magnetic structures in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic fields in ram pressure stripping of satellite galaxies in the circumgalactic medium around massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of magnetic fields in galaxies and their haloes could have important consequences for satellite galaxies moving through the magnetised circumgalactic medium (CGM) of their host. We therefore study the effect of magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping of satellites in the CGM of massive galaxies. We use cosmological `zoom-in' simulations of three massive galaxy haloes ($M_{\rm{200c}} = 10^{12.5-13}$M$_\odot$), each simulated with and without magnetic fields. The fraction of gas retained after infall through the CGM across our full satellite sample shows no population-wide impact of magnetic fields on ram pressure stripping. However, for the most massive satellites, we find that twice as much gas is stripped without magnetic fields. The evolution of a galaxy's stripped tail is also strongly affected. Magnetic fields reduce turbulent mixing, significantly inhibiting the dispersion of metals into the host CGM. This suppressed mixing greatly reduces condensation from the host CGM onto the stripped tail. By studying the magnetic field structure, we find evidence of magnetic draping and attribute differences in the stripping rate to the draping layer. Differences in condensation from the host CGM are attributed to magnetic field lines aligned with the tail suppressing turbulent mixing. We simulate one halo with enhanced resolution in the CGM and show these results are converged with resolution, though the structure of the cool gas in the tail is not. Our results show that magnetic fields can play an important role in ram pressure stripping in galaxy haloes and should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Direct Collapse pre-SMBH Objects as Ly$\alpha$ Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct Collapse scenario to form the supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds offers the most promising way to explain the origin of quasars at $z&gt;7$. Assuming atomic primordial gas, can Ly$\alpha$ photons escape from the central regions of the collapse and serve as a diagnostic for the detection of these pre-SMBH objects? Models assuming spherical collapse have found these photons to be trapped and destroyed. We use Ly$\alpha$ radiation transfer within the inflow-outflow geometry, based on earlier zoom-in cosmological modeling involving radiation transfer and magnetic forces. Adopting geometry that includes ongoing disky and spherical accretion, and formation of bi-conical outflow funnel, we obtain formation of a dense radiatively-driven expanding shell. The Ly$\alpha$ transfer is performed through a Monte Carlo algorithm, accounting for destruction of Ly$\alpha$ photons and emergence of two-photon emission. We find that substantial fraction of Ly$\alpha$ photons can escape through the funnel, and calculate the line profiles, the line peak velocity shift, asymmetry and cuspiness, by varying basic model parameters. The escaping Ly$\alpha$ emission is anisotropic, and sensitive to overall inflow-outflow geometry. The escaping fraction of Ly$\alpha$ radiation exceeds 95% from a $z=10$ pre-SMBH object -- in principle detectable by the JWST NIRSpec in the MOS mode, during $\sim 10^4$seconds for a $10\sigma$ signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, comparisons with line shapes from high-$z$ galaxies and quasars allow to separate them from pre-SMBH objects based on the line asymmetry -- the pre-SMBH line show a profound asymmetry and extended red tail.</description>

      <title>From simulations to observations. Methodology and data release of mock TNG50 galaxies at 0.3 &lt; z &lt; 0.7 for WEAVE-StePS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new generation of optical spectrographs (i.e., WEAVE, 4MOST, DESI, and WST) offer unprecedented opportunities for statistically studying the star formation histories of galaxies. However, these observations are not easily comparable to predictions from cosmological simulations. Our goal is to build a reference framework for comparing spectroscopic observations with simulations and test tools for deriving stellar population properties of galaxies. We focus on the observational strategy of the Stellar Population at Intermediate Redshift Survey (StePS) with the WEAVE instrument. We generate mock datasets of ~750 galaxies at redshifts z = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 using the TNG50 simulation, perform radiative transfer with SKIRT, and analyze the spectra with pPXF as if they were real observations. We present the methodology to generate these datasets and provide an initial exploration of stellar population parameters (i.e., mass-weighted ages and metallicities) and star formation histories for three galaxies at z = 0.7 and their descendants at z = 0.5 and 0.3. We find good agreement between the mock spectra and intrinsic ages in TNG50 (average difference $0.2\pm0.3$ Gyr) and successfully recover their star formation histories, especially for galaxies form the bulk of their stars on short timescales and at early epochs. We release these datasets, including multi-wavelength imaging and spectra, to support forthcoming WEAVE observations.</description>

      <title>An LBT view of the co-rotating group of galaxies around NGC 2750: Deep imaging and new satellite candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some galaxies such as the Milky Way and Andromeda display coherently rotating satellite planes, posing tensions with cosmological simulations. NGC 2750 has emerged as an additional candidate system hosting a co-rotating group of galaxies. We aim to assess the presence of a coherent satellite plane around NGC 2750 by identifying new candidate dwarf galaxies and low surface brightness features. We conducted deep, wide-field photometric observations of NGC 2750 using the Large Binocular Telescope in the g- and r-bands. Standard data reduction techniques were applied to enhance the detection of low-surface-brightness features down to about 31 mag/arcsec^2 in r. Our observations led to the discovery of six new candidate dwarf galaxies, including one with properties consistent with an ultra-diffuse galaxy. We also identified tidal features around NGC 2750, indicating past interactions with nearby satellites. The spatial distribution of satellites suggests a moderate flattening, further supported by the newly identified candidates. Follow-up spectroscopic measurements will be critical in confirming or challenging the strong kinematic coherence observed previously. The luminosity function of NGC 2750 reveals an excess of bright satellites compared to similar systems, adding to the growing tension between observed satellite populations and cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>The Galactic Bulge exploration V.: The secular spherical and X-shaped Milky Way bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we derive systemic velocities and subsequently orbits for 8456 RR~Lyrae stars. We identify interlopers from other Milky Way (MW) structures, which amount to 22 percent of the total sample. Most interlopers are associated with the halo, with the remainder linked to the Galactic disk. We confirm the previously reported lag in the rotation curve of bulge RR~Lyrae stars regardless of the removal of interlopers. Metal-rich RR~Lyrae stars' rotation patterns are consistent with that of non-variable metal-rich giants, following the MW bar, while metal-poor stars exhibit slower rotation. The analysis of orbital parameter space is used to distinguish bulge stars that, in the bar reference frame, have prograde orbits from those in retrograde orbits. We classify the prograde stars into orbital families and estimate the chaoticity (in the form of frequency drift) of their orbits. RR~Lyrae stars with banana-like orbits have a bimodal distance distribution, similar to the distance distribution seen in the metal-rich red clump stars. The fraction of stars with banana-like orbits decreases linearly with metallicity, as does the fraction of stars on prograde orbits (in the bar reference frame). The retrograde moving stars (in the bar reference frame) form a centrally concentrated nearly spherical distribution. Analyzing an $N$-body+SPH simulation, we find that some stellar particles in the central parts oscillate between retrograde and prograde orbits and only a minority stays prograde over a long period of time. Based on the simulation, the ratio between prograde and retrograde stellar particles seems to stabilize within a couple of gigayears after bar formation. The non-chaoticity of retrograde orbits and their high numbers can explain some of the spatial and kinematical features of the MW bulge that have been often associated with a classical bulge.</description>

      <title>Modeling Star Formation Histories of Changing-Look AGN Host Galaxies with Prospector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Changing-look active galactic nuclei, or CL-AGN, are AGN which appear to transition between Seyfert Type 1 and 2 over periods of months to years. Several mechanisms to trigger these transitions have been proposed, but we have yet to conclusively determine their cause. Recent studies suggest CL-AGN are hosted primarily in galaxies which are shutting down star formation (Dodd et al. 2021; Liu et al. 2021, Wang et al. 2023), which may indicate a link between galaxy quenching and changing look events. We use Prospector stellar population synthesis software (Leja et al. 2017; Johnson &amp; Leja 2017; Johnson et al. 2021) to model non-parametric star formation histories for 39 CL-AGN host galaxies. We find that $43^{+13}_{-12}\%$ of our gold sample CL-AGN at z &lt; 0.15 are star forming, while $29^{+13}_{-10}\%$ fall in the Green Valley of the stellar mass-sSFR diagram. At z &gt; 0.15, $57^{+13}_{-18}\%$ of CL-AGN in the gold sample are star-forming and $29^{+19}_{-14}\%$ are in the Green Valley. CL-AGN hosts have similar star formation properties to the host galaxies of Seyfert 1 and 2 AGN at z &lt; 0.15 and to Seyfert 2 AGN at z &gt; 0.15. We find no statistically significant differences in the star formation properties of turn-on and turn-off CL-AGN. We also find no evidence for rapid quenching in the Green Valley CL-AGN. We conclude that CL-AGN state transitions are not associated with the formation history of CL-AGN host galaxies on large spatial scales, implying CL-AGN state transitions may instead result from nuclear-scale or accretion disk effects.</description>

      <title>The DECam MAGIC Survey: Spectroscopic Follow-up of the Most Metal-Poor Stars in the Distant Milky Way Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present high-resolution spectroscopic observations for six metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]&lt;-3 (including one with [Fe/H]&lt;-4), selected using narrow-band Ca II HK photometry from the DECam MAGIC Survey. The spectroscopic data confirms the accuracy of the photometric metallicities and allows for the determination of chemical abundances for 16 elements, from carbon to barium. The program stars have chemical abundances consistent with this metallicity range. A kinematic/dynamical analysis suggests that all program stars belong to the distant Milky Way halo population (heliocentric distances 35 &lt; dhelio/kpc &lt; 55), including three with high-energy orbits that might have been associated with the Magellanic system and one, J0026-5445, having parameters consistent with being a member of the Sagittarius stream. The remaining two stars show kinematics consistent with the Gaia-Sausage/Enceladus dwarf galaxy merger. J0433-5548, with [Fe/H]=-4.12, is a carbon-enhanced ultra metal-poor star, with [C/Fe]=+1.73. This star is believed to be a bona fide second-generation star, and its chemical abundance pattern was compared with yields from metal-free supernova models. Results suggest that J0433-5548 could have been formed from a gas cloud enriched by a single supernova explosion from a ~11Mo star in the early universe. The successful identification of such objects demonstrates the reliability of photometric metallicity estimates, which can be used for target selection and statistical studies of faint targets in the Milky Way and its satellite population. These discoveries illustrate the power of measuring chemical abundances of metal-poor Milky Way halo stars to learn more about early galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>What drives the growth of black holes: a decade of progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has witnessed significant progress in our understanding of the growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs). It is now clear that an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN: the observed manifestation of a growing SMBH) is an "event" within the broader lifecycle of a galaxy, which can significantly influence the shape and evolution of the galaxy itself. Our view of the obscuring medium that affects the observed properties of an AGN has also undergone a revolution, and we now have a more physical understanding of the connection between the fuelling of (and feedback from) the SMBH and the broader host-galaxy and larger-scale environment. We have a greater understanding of the physics of SMBH accretion, can identify AGNs out to z = 8-10 witnessing the very earliest phases of SMBH growth, and have a more complete census of AGN activity than ever before. This great progress has been enabled by new innovative facilities, an ever-increasing quantity of multi-wavelength data, the exploitation and development of new techniques, and greater community-wide engagement. In this article we review our understanding of AGNs and the growth of SMBHs, providing an update of the earlier Alexander and Hickox (2012) review. Using citation-network analyses we also show where this review fits within the broader black-hole research literature and, adopting the previous article as a snapshot of the field over a decade ago, identify the drivers that have enabled the greatest scientific progress.</description>

      <title>The VVV near-IR galaxy catalogue of the southern Galactic disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distribution of galaxies in the Zone of Avoidance (ZoA) is incomplete due to the presence of our own Galaxy. Our research focused on the identification and characterisation of galaxies in the ZoA, using the new near-infrared data from the VVVX survey in the regions that cover the southern Galactic disc. We used our previously-established procedure based on photometric and morphological criteria to identify galaxies. The large data volume collected by the VVVX required alternatives to visual inspection, including artificial intelligence techniques, such as classifiers based on neural networks. The VVV NIR galaxy catalogue is presented, covering the southern Galactic disc, significantly extending the vision down to $K^0_s=16$ mag throughout the ZoA. This catalogue provides positions, photometric and morphological parameters for a total of 167,559 galaxies with their probabilities determined by the CNN and XGBoost algorithms based on image and photometric data, respectively. The construction of the catalogue involves the employment of optimal probability criteria. 14% of these galaxies were confirmed by visual inspection or by matching with previous catalogues. The peculiarities exhibited by distinct regions across the Galactic disc, along with the characteristics of the galaxies, are thoroughly examined. The catalogue serves as a valuable resource for extragalactic studies within the ZoA, providing a crucial complement to the forthcoming radio catalogues and future surveys utilizing the Vera C.~Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. We present a deep galaxy map, covering a 1080 sq. deg. region, which reveals that the apparent galaxy density is predominantly influenced by foreground extinction from the Milky Way. However, the presence of intrinsic inhomogeneities, potentially associated with candidate galaxy groups or clusters and filaments, is also discernible.</description>

      <title>Bar properties as a function of wavelength in Illustris TNG50: analysis of mock images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies used Illustris TNG50 galaxies to study bar formation, evolution, and properties like length, strength, and pattern speed. In simulations, these are typically derived from particle positions and mass distribution, neglecting stellar light and extinction effects. However, observational studies indicate that bar appearance depends on wavelength. To test whether this dependence exists in TNG50 at $z \sim 0$, we analysed 50 strongly barred galaxies using mock images from SKIRT radiative transfer simulations covering infrared to ultraviolet filters (Spitzer 3.6 um, SDSS i, r, g, S-PLUS J0378, GALEX NUV, and GALEX FUV). Bar ellipticity and length were measured via ellipse fitting. Ellipticity generally increases by 6 percent from 3.6 um to g band, and by 9 percent to J0378 band. On average, TNG50 bars cannot be said to be longer in bluer filters when the entire sample is used. However, the trend is detected when only star-forming galaxies are considered. In this star-forming subsample, bar length increases by 10 percent from 3.6 um to g band, and by 17 percent to J0378 band; moreover, the bar can appear up to 20${-}$30 percent longer in bluer mocks than in the mass map. Over 90 percent of bars vanish in UV due to minimal emission by dominant stellar populations. We reproduced the bar properties morphological dependence phenomenon using age-filtered mass maps, where older stars form shorter, rounder bars, and younger stars generate longer, more elliptical ones. TNG50 bars exhibit a wavelength-dependent trend similar to observations: bars appear more elliptical and longer in bluer filters, with this effect being stronger in star-forming galaxies.</description>

      <title>Metallic species in interstellar medium: Astrochemical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-bearing species in diffuse or molecular clouds are often overlooked in astrochemical modeling except for the charge exchange process. However, catalytic cycles involving these metals can affect the abundance of other compounds. We prepared a comprehensive chemical network for Na, Mg, Al, Fe, K, and Si-containing species. Assuming water as the major constituent of interstellar ice in dark clouds, quantum chemical calculations were carried out to estimate the binding energy of important metallic species, considering amorphous solid water as substrate. Significantly lower binding energies (approximately 5 to 6 times) were observed for Na and Mg, while the value for Fe was roughly 4 times higher than what was used previously. Here, we calculated binding energy values for Al and K, for which no prior guesses were available. The total dipole moments and enthalpies of formation for several newly included species are unknown. Furthermore, the assessment of reaction enthalpies is necessary to evaluate the feasibility of the new reactions under interstellar conditions. These parameters were estimated and subsequently integrated into models. Some additional species that were not included in the UMIST/KIDA database have been introduced. The addition of these new species, along with their corresponding reactions, appears to significantly affect the abundances of related species. Some key reactions that significantly influence general metal-related chemistry include: $\rm{M^+ + H_2 \rightarrow M{H_2}^+ + h\nu}$, $\rm{MH + O \rightarrow MO + H}$ ($\rm{M \ = \ Fe, \ Na, \ Mg, \ Al, \ K}$), and $\rm{M_1^+ + M_2H \rightarrow M_1H + M_2^+}$ (where $\rm{M_1 \neq M_2}$, $M_1, \ M_2 \ = \ Na, \ Mg, \ Al, \ K, \ Fe$). Significant changes were observed in magnesium and sodium-bearing cyanides, isocyanides, and aluminum fluoride when additional reaction pathways were considered.</description>

      <title>The vertical structure of the stellar disk in NGC 551</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We self-consistently determine the 3D density distribution of NGC 551's stellar disk and study observational signatures of two-component stellar disks. Assuming baryonic disks are in hydrostatic equilibrium, we solved the Poisson-Boltzmann equation to estimate 3D density distribution. We used integral-field spectroscopic observations to estimate stellar velocity dispersion and built a 3D dynamical model using these density solutions and the observed rotation curve. We generated simulated surface brightness maps and compared them with observations to verify modeling consistency. The dynamical model was inclined to 90{\deg} to produce an edge-on surface density map, which we investigated by fitting different 2D functions and plotting vertical cuts in logarithmic scale. We estimated vertical stellar velocity dispersion using an iterative method, obtaining results consistent with the Disk Mass Survey formalism. Through dynamical modeling, we produced moment maps that reasonably matched observations. We examined the simulated edge-on model by taking vertical cuts and decomposing them into multiple Gaussian components. We find that artificial double Gaussian components arise due to line-of-sight integration effects, even for single-component disks. This indicates that decomposing vertical intensity cuts into multiple Gaussian components is unreliable for multicomponent disks. Instead, an up-bending break visible in logarithmic-scale vertical cuts serves as a more reliable indicator for two-component disks. We performed 2D fitting on the edge-on surface density map using the product of a scaled modified Bessel function and $sech^2$ function to estimate structural parameters. These traditional methods systematically underestimate the scale length and flattening ratio. Therefore, we suggest using detailed modeling to accurately deduce stellar disk structural parameters.</description>

      <title>Searching for stars ejected from the Galactic Centre in DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical interactions between stars and the super massive black hole Sgr A* at the Galactic Centre (GC) may eject stars into the Galactic halo. While recent fast ejections by Sgr A* have been identified in the form of hypervelocity stars (hundreds to thousands km/s), it is also expected that the stellar halo contains slower stars, ejected over the last few billion years. In this study, we use the first data release of DESI to search for these slower GC ejecta, which are expected to stand out from the stellar halo population for their combined high metallicity (${\rm [Fe/H]}\gtrsim0$) and small values of their vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$), whose distribution should peak at zero. Our search does not yield a detection, but allows us to place an upper limit on the ejection rate of stars from the GC of $\sim2.8\times10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ over the past ~5 Gyr, which is ejection model independent. This implies that our result can be used to put constraints on different ejection models, including that invoking mergers of Sgr A* with other massive black holes in the last last few billion years.</description>

      <title>Power-law Emission-line Wings and Radiation-Driven Superwinds in Local Lyman Continuum Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate broad emission-line wings, reaching velocities up to 800 km/s, observed in 26 galaxies with Lyman continuum (LyC) observations, primarily from the Low-redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS). Using Magellan/MIKE, VLT/X-shooter, and WHT/ISIS high-resolution spectroscopy, we show that this fast gas appears to probe the dominant feedback mechanisms linked to LyC escape. We find that in 14 galaxies, the wings are best fit with power laws with slopes -3.5 to -1.6, with four others best fit by Gaussians of width ~300 km/s; the remaining eight show ambiguous wing morphologies. Gaussian wings are found only at low O32 = [O III]5007/[O II]3726,3729 and high metallicity, while power-law wings span the full range of these parameters. The general evidence suggests a dual-mode paradigm for LyC escape: radiation-driven superwinds traced by power-law wings and supernova-driven feedback traced by Gaussian wings. For the former, the &lt; 3 Myr-old, pre-supernova stellar population correlates with more luminous, faster winds. The data also show that radiation-driven wind parameters like wind luminosity and power-law slope depend on the UV luminosity more than the optically thick covering fraction, consistent with ``picket-fence" radiative transfer. Observed wing slope values flatten with both escaping LyC luminosity and higher extinction, while still preserving the anticorrelation between these two quantities. Additionally, the differential between red and blue slopes implies that extinction and dense gas are centrally concentrated relative to the wind emission. Overall, our results show that power-law emission-line wings probe LyC-driven winds and LyC escape in metal-poor starbursts.</description>

      <title>Impact of the ambipolar diffusion in the structuration of the magnetic Rayleigh Taylor instability with oblique magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We investigate the impact of ambipolar diffusion on the development of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability (RTI) with an oblique magnetic field in the incompressible limit. Methods. We developed a general bi-fluid framework comprising charges and neutrals with the specific feature of differing gravity between charges and neutrals. We derived the perturbed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations and obtained an analytic dispersion relation for an oblique magnetic field. The growth rate was then evaluated using a numerical integration of the dispersion relation. In particular, we focussed on the anisotropy in the mode growth induced ambipolar diffusion. Results. In contrast to the case of a magnetic field within the interface, an oblique magnetic field is much less restrictive with respect to the wavenumbers that can develop; rather than a sharp cut-off, it results in a selection of preferred scales for mode growth. The presence of a second neutral fluid that is insensitive to gravity tends to amplify the anisotropy in the possible direction of the instability development. In particular, we show that this effect is maximal when the coupling is in an intermediate range between full and no charge-neutral coupling, specifically in the region where the ambipolar diffusion is highest.</description>

      <title>MUSE-DARK-I: Dark matter halo properties of intermediate-z star-forming galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] We analyse the dark matter (DM) halo properties of 127 0.3&lt;z&lt;1.5 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) down to low stellar masses (7&lt;log(Mstar/Msun)&lt;11), using data from the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey and photometry from HST and JWST. We employ a 3D forward modelling approach to analyse the morpho-kinematics of our sample, enabling measurement of individual rotation curves out to 2-3 times the effective radius. We perform a disk-halo decomposition with a 3D parametric model that includes stellar, gas, and DM components, with pressure support corrections. We validate our methodology on mock data cubes generated from idealised disk simulations. We select the best-fitting DM model among six density profiles, including the Navarro-Frenk-White and the generalised alpha-beta-gamma profile of Di Cintio et al. (2014, DC14). Our Bayesian analysis shows that DC14 performs as well as or better than the other profiles in &gt;65% of the sample. We find that the kinematically inferred stellar masses agree with values from SED fitting. We find that 89% of galaxies have DM fractions &gt;50%. For 70% of SFGs, we infer a DM inner slope, gamma &lt; 0.5, indicating cored DM profiles, but no correlation is found between gamma and star formation rate of the sample. The stellar- and concentration-mass relations agree with theoretical expectations, but with larger scatter. We confirm the anticorrelation between halo scale radius and DM density. The halo scale radii and DM surface densities increase with Mstar, while DM densities stay constant. We find tentative evidence of an evolution of the DM density with z, which suggests that the DM halos of intermediate-z systems are denser than those of local galaxies. In contrast, the halo scale radii are z-invariant.</description>

      <title>Loose threads: parsec-scale filamentation in the high Galactic latitude molecular clouds MBM 3 and MBM 16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of high galactic latitude molecular clouds has been known for several decades, and studies of their dust and gas distributions reveal complicated morphological structures. Their dynamics involve turbulence even in the absence of internal energy sources such as stars. We study in detail two such clouds, MBM 3 and MBM 16, trying to recover the geometric structure and topology of the gas distribution. In particular, we address the evidence of superthermal asymmetric atomic and molecular line profiles as a result of filament superposition combined with turbulent motions. We use a variety of spectroscopic and imaging archival observations of the gas and dust components. The spectroscopic data set comprises HI 21 cm, 12CO, 13CO, and CH line profiles. We also use archival infrared images to study the dust distribution and temperature. To understand the topology of MBM 3 and MBM 16 we compare molecular and atomic spectra, along with profile decomposition of the HI 21 cm line. Standard tools such as Structure Functions of velocity centroids are used to characterise the turbulence in MBM 3, and channel maps and position-velocity diagrams are employed for elucidating the filament topology of both clouds. The unusually large linewidths previously reported for MBM 3 are due to superposition of individual filaments whose superthermal linewidths are about 1 km/s. In MBM 16, the cloud appears to decompose into two adjacent structures with similar properties. The filaments have a high aspect ratio, with lengths of about 1 pc and widths of about 0.1 pc. In general, the molecular gas is embedded within more extended neutral hydrogen structures. Velocity gradients found within these structures are not necessarily dynamical, convergent flows. Projection effects and topology of the driving flows produce signatures that mimic velocity shears even if they are simply distortions of ordered gas.</description>

      <title>Parametric models of core-helium-burning stars: structural glitches near the core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the internal structure of core helium burning (CHeB) stars is crucial for evaluating transport processes in nuclear-burning regions, constructing accurate stellar population models, and assessing nucleosynthesis processes that impact the chemical evolution of galaxies. While asteroseismic observations have recently enabled detailed probing of CHeB star interiors, seismic signatures related to structural variations at the boundary between the convective and radiative core, and chemical composition gradients within the radiative core remain underexplored. This paper investigates how such gradients affect the oscillation modes of low-mass CHeB stars, focusing on mixed dipole modes and uncoupled g-modes as diagnostic tools. Using semi-analytical models calibrated with the evolutionary codes $\texttt{BaSTI-IAC}$,$ \texttt{CLES}$, and $\texttt{MESA}$, we examine the impact of density discontinuities and associated structural glitches on mode period spacings. These codes span diverse physical prescriptions, allowing us to isolate robust features relevant for calibration. Our approach enables controlled glitch insertion while preserving a realistic representation of the star. Consistent with prior works, we find that structural glitches introduce periodic components in the period spacings, providing constraints on the location and amplitude of interior variations. We compare models with smooth and sharp transitions, demonstrating how glitch sharpness affects period spacing and mode trapping. Simulations based on four-year $\textit{Kepler}$ data show that our models yield oscillation frequencies closely matching observations. Ultimately, our results offer realistic predictions of how specific structural features affect the power spectral density, validating our theoretical framework and guiding future efforts to interpret glitch signatures in high-precision asteroseismic data.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Quasar Spectra and Measuring the Ly$\alpha$ Forest with ${\rm S{\scriptsize pender}Q}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasar spectra carry the imprint of foreground intergalactic medium (IGM) through absorption features. In particular, absorption caused by neutral hydrogen gas, the ``Ly$\alpha$ forest,'' is a key spectroscopic tracer for cosmological analyses used to measure cosmic expansion and test physics beyond the standard model. Despite their importance, current methods for measuring LyA absorption cannot directly derive the intrinsic quasar continuum and make strong assumptions on its shape, thus distorting the measured LyA clustering. We present SpenderQ, a ML-based approach for directly reconstructing the intrinsic quasar spectra and measuring the LyA forest from observations. SpenderQ uses the Spender spectrum autoencoder to learn a compact and redshift-invariant latent encoding of quasar spectra, combined with an iterative procedure to identify and mask absorption regions. To demonstrate its performance, we apply SpenderQ to 400,000 synthetic quasar spectra created to validate the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 LyA cosmological analyses. SpenderQ accurately reconstructs the true intrinsic quasar spectra, including the broad LyB, LyA, SiIV, CIV, and CIII emission lines. Redward of LyA, SpenderQ provides percent-level reconstructions of the true quasar spectra. Blueward of LyA, SpenderQ reconstructs the true spectra to &lt; 5\%. SpenderQ reproduces the shapes of individual quasar spectra more robustly than the current state-of-the-art. We, thus, expect it will significantly reduce biases in LyA clustering measurements and enable studies of quasars and their physical properties. SpenderQ also provides informative latent variable encodings that can be used to, e.g., classify quasars with Broad Absorption Lines. Overall, SpenderQ provides a new data-driven approach for unbiased LyA forest measurements in cosmological, quasar, and IGM studies.</description>

      <title>Simulated impact on LSST data of Starlink V1.5 and V2 satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The new Starlink V2 satellites incorporate improvements to the chassis brightness through dielectric mirrors, off-pointing solar arrays, and black paint on exposed components. For the general case in which the reflectivities are initially unknown, we simulate LSST operations and repeated photometry of every satellite in simulated model constellations. We derive a brightness model of the Starlink V2 satellite and study the simulated apparent brightness as a function of the satellite position relative to the observer and the sun. We find that the V2 Starlink satellites appear brightest at two distinct positions in the sky: when oriented toward the sun at low elevations where light is specularly reflected, and nearly overhead where the satellite is closest to the observer.
  A simulation of Starlink V2 satellites at 550 km height distributed across a series of Walker constellations with varying inclinations was analyzed to study the impact on the LSST observations.
  Some bright satellites will be visible in LSST observations. For every thousand V1.5 Starlink satellites imaged by LSST in the first hour of a summer night, we find 1.2 of them will appear brighter than 7 AB magnitude. By comparison, for every thousand V2 Starlink satellites observed, we find only 0.93 of them will appear this bright. The off-pointed solar array and reduced diffuse reflection of the chassis mitigate the brightness.
  Finally, we simulate lowering this Walker constellation to 350km. Only 0.56 V2 Starlink satellites per thousand brighter than 7 AB magnitude will be observed in the first hour at this height. This is a 40% reduction in number of bright satellites entering the focal plane compared to the constellation at 550km height. We find that a combination of factors yield an apparent surface brightness of these satellites for LSST operations only 5% brighter than at 550km orbit.</description>

      <title>The OVz stars in NGC 346: distribution, stellar parameters and insights into low-metallicity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OVz stars are identified by their optical spectra, in which the He II 4686 absorption line is stronger than any other He line. This spectral characteristic suggests that these stars may be less luminous, less evolved, and located closer to the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS). Although their evolutionary status is still debated, OVz stars are key candidates for understanding the earliest stages of massive star evolution. In this study, we analyze OVz stars in the star-forming regions NGC 346 in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) and 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), aiming to determine their physical properties and investigate the role of low metallicity in the emergence of the Vz peculiarity. We identified a sample of OVz and OV stars in NGC 346 using spectra obtained with the Magellan Echellette (MagE) spectrograph at Las Campanas Observatory. Spectral classification was based on the equivalent width ratios of key He lines. Quantitative spectroscopic analyses were carried out using the IACOB-BROAD and IACOB-GBAT/FASTWIND tools. For consistency, previously identified OV and OVz stars in 30 Doradus were reclassified following the same criteria.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.</description>

      <title>BRAiSE: synthetic polarisation in RMHD AGN jet simulations</title>

Abstract: We present a new method to calculate the polarised synchrotron emission of radio AGN sources using magnetic field information from 3-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (RMHD) simulations. Like its predecessor, which uses pressure as a proxy for the magnetic field, this method tracks the spatially resolved adiabatic and radiative loss processes using the method adapted from the Radio AGN in Semi-analytic Environments formalism. Lagrangian tracer particles in RMHD simulations carried out using the PLUTO code are used to track the fluid quantities of each `ensemble of electrons' through time to calculate the radio emissivity ex-situ. By using the magnetic field directly from simulations, the full set of linear Stokes parameters I, Q, and U can be calculated to study the synthetic radio polarisation of radio AGN sources. We apply this method to a suite of RMHD simulations to study their polarisation properties. The turbulent magnetic field present in radio lobes influences the emission, causing a complex clumpy structure that is visible at high resolution. Our synthetic polarisation properties are consistent with observations; we find that the fractional polarisation is highest (approximately 50 percent) at the lobe edges. We show that for the same source, the integrated and mean fractional polarisation depends on viewing angle to the source. At oblique viewing angles the behaviour of the integrated and mean fractional polarisation over time depends on the morphology of the jet cocoon. Using Faraday rotation measures, we reproduce known depolarisation effects such as the Laing-Garrington depolarisation asymmetry in jets angled to the line of sight. We show that the hotspots and hence the Fanaroff-Riley classification become less clear with our new, more accurate method.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1) -- Watching ICM-selected galaxy clusters with Euclid eyes -- prospects of Euclid data in the context of large SZ and X-ray based surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters detected through their X-ray emission or Sunyaev--Zeldovich effect (SZE), both produced by the intra-cluster medium (ICM), are key probes in cosmological and astrophysical studies. To maximise the scientific return of such surveys, complementary data are required for cluster confirmation and redshift estimation. This is typically provided by wide-field optical and infrared surveys, which are increasingly challenged by ongoing and future ICM-selected samples. In particular, at high redshifts ($z&gt;1$) probed by upcoming SZE-selected samples, current large surveys may be insufficient for reliable confirmation. Deep, high-resolution infrared surveys like Euclid will thus be essential for confirming most high-redshift clusters. We present an analysis of the first sizeable Euclid dataset (Q1), overlapping with several ICM-selected cluster samples. We apply an adaptation of the MCMF cluster confirmation tool to estimate key properties, including redshift and richness, and to predict Euclid's capabilities for high-redshift cluster confirmation. We find promising performance, particularly at high redshifts, while richness estimates at low redshifts ($z&lt;0.4$) are currently limited by Q1 data quality but should improve with future releases. Using MCMF runs on random lines of sight, we predict that Euclid will confirm clusters at $1&lt;z&lt;2$ as effectively as current optical surveys at $z&lt;0.6$, significantly enhancing high-redshift confirmation. SZE-selected samples will thus greatly benefit from Euclid overlap. Among five known high-$z$ SZE clusters in Q1, we identify the highest-redshift jellyfish galaxy candidate to date, EUCLJ035330.86$-$504347.6 in SPT-CLJ0353$-$5043 ($z=1.32$), two massive star-forming galaxies near ACT-CLJ0350.0$-$4819 ($z=1.46$), and strong lensing features in SPT-CLJ0353$-$5043 and SPT-CLJ0421$-$4845.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in the Red-sequence Elliptical Galaxies at Redshifts $\sim 0.7-2.5$: Not Dark Energy Source but Remanants of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of dark energy remains one of the most profound mysteries in modern cosmology. One intriguing proposal is that black holes (BHs) could be the astrophysical source of dark energy through a cosmological coupling mechanism, and strong evidence has been claimed via analyzing the growth of the black hole masses in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies at redshifts $\leq 2.5$. In this work, with a group of very high redshift AGNs detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in the red-sequence elliptical galaxies, we show that the possibility of BHs being the astrophysical source of dark energy has been rejected at a confidence level exceeding 10$\sigma$. Moreover, it turns out that the Little Red Dots recently discovered by JWST, characterized by the low accretion rates, can naturally evolve into the red-sequence elliptical galaxies hosting the relatively low mass black holes at the redshifts of $\sim 0.7-2.5$, without the need of black hole cosmological coupling.</description>

      <title>Line ratio identification of external photoevaporation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: External photoevaporation of protoplanetary discs, by massive O stars in stellar clusters, is thought to be a significant process in the evolution of a disc. It has been shown to result in significant mass loss and disc truncation, ultimately reducing the lifetime of the discs, and possibly affecting potential planet populations. It is a well-studied process in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) where the cometary morphology of proplyds is spatially resolvable due to its proximity to Earth. However, we need to study external photoevaporation in additional stellar clusters to better understand its prevalence and significance more globally. Unfortunately, more massive stellar clusters where the majority of stars form are much farther away than the ONC. In these more distant clusters the proplyds are spatially unresolvable with current facilities, hence the cometary morphology is not a useful identification of external photoevaporation. Therefore, in order to identify and interpret external photoevaporation, the only observations we have are of spatially unresolved emission lines. To resolve this issue we have used the CLOUDY code to develop an approximate general model of the emission lines emanating from the hot ionized wind of a proplyd. We have used the model to determine which line ratios are most sensitive to the distance from an OB star, and found that the most sensitive line ratios vary by multiple orders of magnitude over an FUV field of between 10$^3$ G$_0$ to 10$^6$ G$_0$. By identifying spatial gradients of line ratios in stellar clusters, we can identify regions of ongoing external photoevaporation.</description>

      <title>21cm signal from Dark Ages collapsing halos with detailed molecular cooling treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. To understand the formation of the first stars, a detailed description of the thermal and chemical processes in collapsing gas clouds is essential. Molecular cooling, particularly via H2, plays a significant role in triggering thermal instabilities that lead to star formation. The 21 cm hydrogen line serves as a potential probe of the first collapsing structures during the dark ages of the early Universe, and it is affected by the gas temperature evolution.
  Aims. We aim to investigate the molecular cooling in the gas halos prior to the formation of the first stars, with a particular focus on how the H2 cooling affects the gas temperature. Additionally, we explore the sensitivity of the 21 cm hydrogen line to these cooling processes during the collapse of the first overdense regions.
  Results. We introduce the \texttt{CHEMFAST} code, which tracks the evolution of chemical abundances and computes the 21cm neutral hydrogen signal in collapsing halos. Our results show that molecular cooling significantly affects the gas temperature inside collapsing clouds of mass ranging from $10^6$ to $10^9$ M$_\odot$, influencing the 21cm signal. The signal exhibits an emission feature that is distinct from the one predicted in simpler expansion models.
  Conclusions. The 21cm brightness temperature inside collapsing clouds displays an emission feature driven by molecular cooling, closely mirroring the gas temperature evolution. This makes the dark-age 21cm signal a promising probe for studying the thermal processes and structure formation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>The Milky Way as Seen by Classical Cepheids II: Spiral Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a relatively young and bright population and the archetype of standard candles, classical Cepheids are an ideal population on which to trace the non-axisymmetric structure in the young stellar disk to large distances. We used the new distances derived in Paper I based on mid-IR WISE photometry for a selected sample of 2857 dynamically young Cepheids to trace the spiral arms of the Milky Way. The Perseus and Sagittarius-Carina arms are clearly evident in the third and fourth Galactic quadrants, while the Local and Scutum arms are much weaker, and extinction severely limits our view of the latter innermost spiral arm. Pitch angles were derived for each arm over various ranges of Galactic azimuth, each covering at least 90deg in azimuth. Our method of detecting spiral arms and deriving pitch angles does not rely on pre-assigning sources to specific arms. While the spiral structure in the first and second quadrant is not obvious in part because of extinction effects, it is not inconsistent with the structure seen in the third and fourth quadrants. In summary, the Cepheids allow us to map spiral structure in the third and fourth Galactic quadrants where currently few masers have astrometric parallaxes, significantly extending our understanding of the Milky Way at large scales.</description>

      <title>The physical origin of positive metallicity radial gradients in high-redshift galaxies: insights from the FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09290v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations, we investigate the temporal evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients of Milky Way-mass progenitors in the redshift range of $0.4&lt;z&lt;3$. We pay special attention to the occurrence of positive (i.e. inverted) metallicity gradients -- where metallicity increases with galactocentric radius. This trend, contrary to the more commonly observed negative radial gradients, has been frequently seen in recent spatially resolved grism observations. The rate of occurrence of positive gradients in FIRE-2 is about $\sim7\%$ for $0.4&lt;z&lt;3$ and $\sim13\%$ at higher redshifts ($1.5&lt;z&lt;3$), broadly consistent with observations. Moreover, we investigate the correlations among galaxy metallicity gradient, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and degree of rotational support. Metallicity gradients show a strong correlation with both sSFR and the rotational-to-dispersion velocity ratio ($v_c/\sigma$), implying that starbursts and kinematic morphology of galaxies play significant roles in shaping these gradients. The FIRE-2 simulations indicate that galaxies with high sSFR (${\rm log(sSFR~[yr^{-1}])}\gtrsim-9.2$) and weak rotational support ($v_c/\sigma\lesssim 1$) are more likely -- by $\sim$15\% -- to develop positive metallicity gradients. This trend is attributed to galaxy-scale gas flows driven by stellar feedback, which effectively redistribute metals within the interstellar medium. Our results support the important role of stellar feedback in governing the chemo-structural evolution and disk formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies at the cosmic noon epoch.</description>

      <title>The GECKOS Survey: Identifying kinematic sub-structures in edge-on galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vertical evolution of galactic discs is governed by the sub-structures within them. We examine the diversity of kinematic sub-structure present in the first 12 galaxies observed from the GECKOS survey, a VLT/MUSE large programme providing a systematic study of 36 edge-on, Milky Way-mass disc galaxies. Employing the nGIST analysis pipeline, we derive the mean line-of-sight stellar velocity ($V_{\star}$), velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\star}$), skew ($h_{3}$), and kurtosis ($h_{4}$) for the sample, and examine 2D maps and 1D line profiles. Visually, the majority of this sample (8/12) are found to possess boxy-peanut bulges and host the corresponding kinematic structure predicted for stellar bars viewed in projection. Four galaxies exhibit strong evidence for the presence of nuclear discs, including central $h_{3}$-$V_{\star}$ sign mismatch, `croissant'-shaped central depressions in $\sigma_{\star}$ maps, strong gradients in $h_{3}$, and positive $h_{4}$ plateaus over the expected nuclear disc extent. The strength of the $h_{3}$ feature corresponds to the size of the nuclear disc, measured from the $h_{3}$ turnover radius. We can explain the features within the kinematic maps of all sample galaxies via disc structure(s) alone. We do not find any need to invoke the existence of dispersion-dominated bulges. Obtaining the specialised data products for this paper and the broader GECKOS survey required significant development of existing integral field spectroscopic (IFS) analysis tools. Therefore, we also present the nGIST pipeline: a modern, sophisticated, and easy-to-use pipeline for the analysis of galaxy IFS data. We conclude that the variety of kinematic sub-structures seen in GECKOS galaxies requires a contemporary view of galaxy morphology, expanding on the traditional view of galaxy structure, and uniting the kinematic complexity observed in the Milky Way with the extragalactic.</description>

      <title>Another piece to the puzzle: radio detection of a JWST detected AGN candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio observations can provide crucial insight into the nature of a new abundant and mysterious population of dust-reddened active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidates discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), including Little Red Dots (LRDs). In this study, we search for radio bright sources in a large sample of $\sim$700 JWST discovered AGN candidates ($z\sim2-11$) in the 0.144-3 GHz frequency range, utilizing deep radio imaging in COSMOS, GOODS-N, and GOODS-S. Only one source, PRIMER-COS 3866 at $z=4.66$, is significantly detected in our radio surveys, which has been previously identified as an X-ray AGN. Its radio properties are consistent with both an AGN and star formation origin with a spectral index of $\alpha=-0.76^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$, radio-loudness of $R\approx0.5$, and brightness temperature limit of $T_b \gtrsim 10^{3}$ K. Our stacking results of both spectroscopically and photometrically selected AGN candidates yield non-detections in all fields, with 3$\sigma$ limits of $L_{1.4\text{GHz}} &lt; 8.6\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (spectroscopic sample) and $L_{1.3\text{GHz}} &lt; 1.3\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (photometric sample). We demonstrate that these results are still consistent with expectations from the empirical $L_X - L_{\text{H}\alpha}$ and $L_X - L_R$ correlations established for local AGN. We argue that current radio observations in these studied fields have insufficient depth to claim JWST discovered AGN candidates are radio-weak. We project that future surveys carried out by the SKA and ngVLA should be able to obtain significant detections within a few hours, providing crucial measurements of their brightness temperature, which would allow for distinguishing between AGN and starburst-driven origins of this new abundant population.</description>

Abstract: Protoclusters represent the densest regions of cosmic large-scale structure in the early universe and are the environment where present-day massive elliptical galaxies are assembled. Millimeter continuum emission offers a powerful probe of obscured star formation at high redshifts across various environments. In this paper, we present a deep ALMA 1.17 mm mosaic of the central 8 arcmin$^2$ ($\approx30$ comoving Mpc$^{2}$) region in the SSA22 protocluster at $z=3.09$ to study the faint dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) population. The continuum map achieves an RMS noise level of $\approx25$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at $\approx1\arcsec$ spatial resolution, $\approx2\times$ the depth of previous observation of this field. We detected 53 sources with a signal-to-noise ratio above 4.2, doubling the number of detections. Utilizing optical to mid-infrared ancillary data, we search for spectroscopic redshift and identify 18 of 53 as cluster members. For sources with more than two photometric data points in the near-infrared, stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR) from spectral energy distribution fitting are presented. The 1.17 mm number count shows $&gt;2\times$ excess at flux density $\gtrsim1$ mJy but are consistent with blank field in fainter flux bins. The monochromatic far-infrared luminosity function of the SSA22 protocluster core region suggests a lack of faint DSFGs. All SSA22 protocluster member galaxies detected at 1.17 mm have SFR within the $M_\star$-SFR relation of general star-forming galaxies. Our results suggest that an early overdense environment like SSA22 protocluster predominantly enhances the formation of massive early-type galaxies in present-day galaxy clusters, but that the star formation in individual member galaxies is likely driven by gas supply along the cosmic web and occurs in a secular way.</description>

      <title>Studying stellar populations in Omega Centauri with phylogenetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nature and formation history of our Galaxy's largest and most enigmatic stellar cluster, known as Omega Centauri (ocen) remains debated. Here, we offer a novel approach to disentangling the complex stellar populations within ocen based on phylogenetics methodologies from evolutionary biology. These include the Gaussian Mixture Model and Neighbor-Joining clustering algorithms applied to a set of chemical abundances of ocen stellar members. Instead of using the classical approach in astronomy of grouping them into separate populations, we focused on how the stars are related to each other. In this way, we could identify stars that likely formed in globular clusters versus those originating from prolonged in-situ star formation and how these stars interconnect. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that ocen might be a nuclear star cluster of a galaxy accreted by the Milky Way with a mass of about 10^9M_sun. Furthermore, we revealed the existence of a previously unidentified in-situ stellar population with a distinct chemical pattern unlike any known population found in the Milky Way to date. Our analysis of ocen is an example of the success of cross-disciplinary research and shows the vast potential of applying evolutionary biology tools to astronomical datasets, opening new avenues for understanding the chemical evolution of complex stellar systems.</description>

Abstract: We present CAPERS-LRD-z9, a little red dot (LRD) which we confirm to be a $z=9.288$ broad-line AGN (BLAGN). First identified as a high-redshift LRD candidate from PRIMER NIRCam photometry, follow-up NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy of CAPERS-LRD-z9 from the CANDELS-Area Prism Epoch of Reionization Survey (CAPERS) has revealed a broad $3500$ km s$^{-1}$ H$\beta$ emission line and narrow [O III]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines, indicative of a BLAGN. Based on the broad H$\beta$ line, we compute a canonical black-hole mass of $\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})=7.58\pm0.15$, although full consideration of systematic uncertainties yields a conservative range of $6.65&lt;\log(M_{\textrm{BH}}/M_{\odot})&lt;8.50$. These observations suggest that either a massive black hole seed, or a lighter stellar remnant seed undergoing periods of super-Eddington accretion, is necessary to grow such a massive black hole in $\lesssim500$ Myr of cosmic time. CAPERS-LRD-z9 exhibits a strong Balmer break, consistent with a central AGN surrounded by dense ($\sim 10^{10}\textrm{ cm}^{-3}$) neutral gas. We model CAPERS-LRD-z9 using CLOUDY to fit the emission red-ward of the Balmer break with a dense gas-enshrouded AGN, and bagpipes to fit the rest-ultraviolet emission as a host-galaxy stellar population. This upper limit on the stellar mass of the host galaxy ($&lt;10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$) implies that the black-hole to stellar mass ratio may be extremely large, possibly $&gt;5\%$ (although systematic uncertainties on the black-hole mass prevent strong conclusions). However, the shape of the UV continuum differs from typical high-redshift star-forming galaxies, indicating that this UV emission may also be of AGN origin, and hence the true stellar mass of the host may be still lower.</description>

      <title>Star formation at different stages of ram-pressure stripping as observed through far-ultraviolet imaging of 13 GASP galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15066</link>

Abstract: Galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping develop gaseous tails that can extend several kiloparsecs outside the galaxy disc. We used far-ultraviolet and H$\alpha$ imaging from the GASP survey to investigate how different stages of stripping affect star formation properties in the tail and disc of 13 galaxies undergoing stripping. These galaxies have different stripping strengths, as identified from the MUSE integral field spectroscopy. The star-forming knots in the disc and tails show a good correspondence between the measured FUV and H$\alpha$ flux. This is especially true for strong and extreme cases of stripping, which have developed extended ionized gaseous tails featuring clumpy structures. The mechanism behind the H$\alpha$ emission on the tails of these regions, which correlates well with FUV emission, is photoionization caused by young massive stars. The optical emission line ratio maps enable us to understand the emission mechanism, which can be attributed to star formation, LINER activity, or a combination of both phenomena and AGN. The star-forming regions in the emission line maps correspond well to the areas with significant FUV flux in these galaxies. Six galaxies exhibit minimal star formation in their tails, with two cases star formation is limited to the central regions and their discs are truncated. In galaxies with truncated discs, star formation is confined to a smaller region on the disc, as indicated by the FUV flux, compared to H$\alpha$. Galaxies with strong stripping are undergoing recent star formation and are likely recent infalls. Galaxies with truncated discs confine star formation to the center, likely because they have completed a cluster crossing that depleted most of their outer gaseous disc. Galaxies with minimal FUV flux along their tails exhibit unresolved H$\alpha$ emission which may be attributed to processes other than star formation.</description>

      <title>Tracing the Milky Way: Calibrating chemical ages with high-precision Kepler data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical clocks offer a powerful tool for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic surveys. We present a new detailed spectroscopic analysis of 68 Kepler red giant stars to provide a suite of high-precision abundances along with asteroseismic ages with better than 10 percent precision from individual mode frequencies. We obtained several chemical clocks as ratios between s-process elements (Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce) and alpha-elements (Mg, Ca, Si, Al, Ti). Our data show that [Ce/Mg] and [Zr/Ti] display a remarkably tight correlation with stellar ages, with abundance dispersions of 0.08 and 0.01 dex respectively and below 3 Gyr in ages, across the entire Galactic chronochemical history. While improving the precision floor of spectroscopic surveys is critical for broadening the scope and applicability of chemical clocks, the intrinsic accuracy of our relations -- enabled by high-resolution chemical abundances and stellar ages in our sample -- allows us to draw meaningful conclusions about age trends across stellar populations. By applying our relations to the APOGEE and Gaia-ESO surveys, we are able to differentiate the low- and high-alpha sequences in age, recover the age-metallicity relation, observe the disc flaring of the Milky Way, and identify a population of old metal-rich stars.</description>

      <title>Super-Eddington Growth Ceiling: Analytic Constraints on the Rapid Growth of Light-Seed Black Holes in Massive Clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of $\sim10^{7-8}{\rm M}_\odot$ supermassive black holes at $z\gtrsim 8$ challenges conventional growth channels. One attractive possibility is that light seeds ($M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$) undergo short, super-Eddington episodes when they cross, and are captured by, dense massive gas clumps. We revisit this ``BH-clump-capture'' model using analytic arguments supported by toy-model simulations that follow Bondi-scale inflow, radiative feedback, gas dynamical friction and the recently discovered forward acceleration effect caused by the ionised bubble. For substantial growth the black hole must remain trapped for many dynamical times, which imposes three simultaneous constraints. The clump must be heavier than the black hole (mass doubling condition); its cooling time must exceed the super-Eddington growth time (lifetime condition); and dynamical friction must dominate shell acceleration (BH-trapping condition). These requirements confine viable clumps to a narrow density-temperature region, $n_{\rm H}\simeq10^{7-8}{\rm cm}^{-3}$ and $T\simeq(2-6)\times10^{3}{\rm K}$, for a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed. Even inside this sweet spot a $10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$ seed grow up at most $4\times10^{3}{\rm M}_\odot$; the maximum growth ratio $M_{\rm BH, fin}/M_{\rm BH}$ falls approximately as $M_{\rm BH}^{-0.4}$ and is negligible once $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$. The forward-acceleration effect is essential, expelling the black hole whenever photon trapping fails. We conclude that BH-clump-capture model, and potentially broad super-Eddington models, cannot produce the $&gt;10^{4}{\rm M}_\odot$ seeds required for subsequent Eddington-limited growth, suggesting that alternative pathways, such as heavy seed formation, remain necessary.</description>

      <title>Fermi detection of gamma-ray Emission from the Hot Coronae of Radio-quiet Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relativistic jets around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are well-known powerful $\gamma$-ray emitters. In absence of the jets in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs), how the SMBHs work in $\gamma$-ray bands is still unknown despite of great observational efforts made in the last 3 decades. Considering the previous efforts, we carefully select an AGN sample composed of 37 nearby Seyfert galaxies with ultra-hard X-rays for the goals of $\gamma$-ray detections by excluding all potential contamination in this band. Adopting a stacking technique, here we report the significant $\gamma$-ray detection (${\rm TS}=30.6$, or $5.2\,\sigma$) from the sample using 15-year Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observation. We find an average $\gamma$-ray luminosity of the sample as $(1.5\pm1.0)\times10^{40}{\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$ at energies from 1-300\,GeV. Limited by the well-known pair production from the interaction of $\gamma$-rays with low energy photons, $\gtrsim$ several GeV $\gamma$-rays are found to originate from an extended corona ($\sim 2.7\times 10^6\,R_{\rm g}$), whereas the canonical much more compact X-ray corona ($\sim 10\,R_{\rm g}$) is responsible for 1 to several GeV $\gamma$-rays. The finding of the compact region lends to strong supports to the long-time theoretical expectations, but the extended corona is beyond all the existing models. One promising scenario is that the electron-positron pairs produced in the compact X-ray corona would expand as fireball, similar to that in $\gamma$-ray bursts, forming the structure of extended corona.</description>

      <title>Detecting galaxy-21-cm cross-correlation during reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic 21-cm signal promises to revolutionize studies of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Radio interferometers are aiming for a preliminary, low signal-to-noise (S/N) detection of the 21-cm power spectrum. Cross-correlating 21-cm with galaxies will be especially useful in these efforts, providing both a sanity check for initial 21-cm detection claims and potentially increasing the S/N due to uncorrelated residual systematics. Here we self-consistently simulate large-scale (1 Gpc) galaxy and 21-cm fields, computing their cross-power spectra for various choices of instruments as well as survey properties. We use 1080h observations with SKA-low AA* and HERA-350 as our benchmark 21-cm observations. We create mock Lyman alpha narrow-band, slitless and slit spectroscopic surveys, using benchmarks from instruments such as Subaru HyperSupremeCam, Roman grism, VLT MOONS, ELT MOSAIC, and JWST NIRCam. We forecast the resulting S/N of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum, varying the galaxy survey area, depth and level of 21-cm foreground contamination for each pair of instruments. We find that the highest S/N is achievable through slitless, wide-area spectroscopic surveys, with the proposed Roman HLS survey resulting in a 55$\sigma$ detection of the cross power with 21-cm as observed with SKA-low AA* for our fiducial model. Narrow-band dropout surveys are unlikely to result in a detectable cross-power, due to their poor redshift localization. Slit spectroscopy can provide a high S/N detection of the cross power for SKA-low AA* observations. Specifically, the planned MOONRISE survey with MOONS on the VLT can result in a 3$\sigma$ detection, while a survey of comparable observing time using MOSAIC on the ELT can result in a 4$\sigma$ detection. Our results can be used to guide survey strategies, facilitating the detection of the galaxy-21-cm cross power spectrum.</description>

      <title>IGR J12580+0134: The Nearest Tidal Disruption Event and its Faint Resurrection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are X-ray and gamma-ray radiations emerging from the tidal disintegration of a star or substellar object that passes too close to a supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of a galaxy. In November 2010, a TDE designated as IGR J12580+0134 occurred in the galaxy NGC 4845, and it was traced by follow-up XMM-Newton observations in January 2011. To identify a further TDE based on the radio outburst cycle, we requested NICER monitoring observations for nearly a year beginning in March 2023, which we studied here along with the previous XMM-Newton observations. We analyzed X-ray brightness changes using hardness analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), and conducted spectral analysis of the source continuum. The NICER observations revealed the presence of some X-ray flares during March-June 2023 that were much fainter than the TDE observed using XMM-Newton in 2011. The PCA component that mainly contributes to the X-ray outbursts during the TDE is a heavily absorbed power-law continuum emission, whereas there is a small contribution from collisionally ionized plasma in the soft excess, likely from a colliding wind or jet. Similarly, the PCA of the NICER data relates the X-ray flares to a power-law spectrum, albeit with a much lower absorbing column, and partially to soft collisional plasma. The faint X-ray flares captured by NICER could be associated with extremely weak accretion onto the SMBH resident in this galaxy and thus potentially a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus.</description>
