      <title>Open star clusters and their asymmetrical tidal tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars that evaporate from their star cluster by the energy equipartition process end up either in a leading or a trailing tidal tail. In Newtonian gravitation and for open star clusters in the Solar vicinity, the tidal threshold, or prah, for escape is symmetrical, such that the leading and trailing tails are equally populated. The data by six independent teams that applied the convergent point method to map out the tidal tails of four open clusters (the Hyades, the Praesepe, Coma Berenices and COIN-Gaia13) using Gaia DR2 and DR3 are here applied to test for the expected symmetry. All tidal tails contain more stars in the leading tail. The combined confidence amounts to an 8 sigma falsification of the prah symmetry. The same test using Milgromian dynamics leads to consistency with the data. More effort needs to be exerted on this matter, but the data indicate with high confidence that the tidal prah of an open star cluster is asymmetrical with the corresponding confidence that Newtonian gravitation is falsified. Open star clusters depopulate more rapidly in Milgromian than in Newtonian dynamics and the COIN-Gaia13 cluster is here found to be nearly completely dissolved. In view of these results, the wide-binary star test and the Keplerian Galactic rotation curve finding are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>COSMOS-Web: The Role of Galaxy Interactions and Disk Instabilities in Producing Starbursts at z&lt;4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study of the role of galaxy-galaxy interactions and disk instabilities in producing starburst activity in galaxies out to z=4. For this, we use a sample of 387 galaxies with robust total star formation rate measurements from Herschel, gas masses from ALMA, stellar masses and redshifts from multi-band photometry, and JWST/NIRCam rest-frame optical imaging. Using mass-controlled samples, we find an increased fraction of interacting galaxies in the starburst regime at all redshifts out to z=4. This increase correlates with star formation efficiency (SFE), but not with gas fraction. However, the correlation is weak (and only significant out to z=2), which could be explained by the short duration of SFE increase during interaction. In addition, we find that isolated disk galaxies make up a significant fraction of the starburst population. The fraction of such galaxies with star-forming clumps ("clumpy disks") is significantly increased compared to the main-sequence disk population. Furthermore, this fraction directly correlates with SFE. This is direct observational evidence for a long-term increase of SFE maintained due to disk instabilities, contributing to the majority of starburst galaxies in our sample and hence to substantial mass growth in these systems. This result could also be of importance for explaining the growth of the most massive galaxies at z&gt;6.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Radial Profile of Galactic Magnetic Fields using Rotation Measure of Background Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing magnetic fields in high-redshift galactic systems is crucial to investigate galactic dynamics and evolution. Utilizing the rotation measure of the background quasars, we have developed a radial profile of the magnetic field in a typical high-$z$ galaxy. We have compiled a catalog of 59 confirmed quasar sightlines, having one intervening Mg \rom{2} absorber in the redshift range $0.372\leq z_{\text{abs}} \leq 0.8$. The presence of the foreground galaxy is ensured by comparing the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts within $3 \sigma_{z-\text{photo}}$ and visual checks. These quasar line-of-sights (LoS) pass through various impact parameters (D) up to $160$ kpc, covering the circumgalactic medium of a typical Milky-Way type galaxy. Utilizing the residual rotation measure (RRM) of these sightlines, we estimated the excess in RRM dispersion, $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$. We found that the sightlines having impact parameters $\text{D} \leq 50$ kpc and $\text{D} &gt; 50$ kpc, $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ show significant difference from $24.86 \pm 3.08$ rad m$^{-2}$ to $16.34 \pm 1.88$ rad m$^{-2}$ respectively. The profile of $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ with D exhibits a decreasing trend. We translated $\sigma_{\text{ex}}^{\text{RRM}}$ to average LoS magnetic field strength, $\langle B_{\|}\rangle$ by considering a typical electron column density. Consequently, the anti-correlation is sustained, resulting in a decreasing magnetic field profile. This suggests a clear indication of varying magnetic field from the disk to the circumgalactic medium. This work provides a methodology that, when applied to ongoing and future radio polarisation surveys such as LOFAR and SKA, promises to significantly enhance our understanding of magnetic field mapping in galactic systems.</description>

      <title>The tangled warp of the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the influence of the Milky Way's warp on the kinematics of stars across the disc, and therefore measure its precession rate and line of nodes under different assumptions. We do this by applying Jeans' first equation to a model of a rigidly precessing warp. The predictions of these models are fit to the average vertical velocities of stars with measured line-of-sight velocities in Gaia DR3 data. We test models in which the warp's line of nodes and precession speed are fixed, and models in which they are allowed to vary linearly with radius. We also test models in which the velocity of stars radially in the disc is included in Jeans' equation. The kinematic data is best fit by models with a line of nodes that is 40 degrees offset from the Sun's Galactic azimuth, significantly leading the line of nodes found from the positions of stars. These models have a warp precession speed of around 13 km/s/kpc in the direction of Galactic rotation, close to other recent estimates. We find that including the velocity of stars radially in the disc in our kinematic model leads to a significantly worse fit to the data, and implausible warp parameters. We conclude that the Milky Way's warp appears to be rapidly precessing, but the structure and kinematics of the warped disc are not consistent within the approximation of a fixed, precessing, warp shape. This implies that the Milky Way's warp is dynamically evolving, which is a challenge to models of the warp's creation, and must be considered in the context of other known disturbances of the disc.</description>

      <title>Dynamical coupling of Keplerian orbits in a hierarchical four-body system: from the Galactic Centre to compact planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on the long-term evolution of two bodies in nearby initially coplanar orbits around a central dominant body perturbed by a fourth body on a distant Keplerian orbit. Our previous works that considered this setup enforced circular orbits by adding a spherical potential of extended mass, which dampens Kozai--Lidov oscillations; it led to two qualitatively different modes of the evolution of the nearby orbits. In one scenario, their mutual interaction exceeds the effect of differential precession caused by a perturbing body. This results in a long-term coherent evolution, with nearly coplanar orbits experiencing only small oscillations of inclination. We extend the previous work by (i) considering post-Newtonian corrections to the gravity of the central body, either instead of or in addition to the potential of extended mass, (ii) relaxing the requirement of strictly circular orbits, and (iii) removing the strict requirement of complete Kozai--Lidov damping. Thus, we identify the modes of inter-orbital interaction described for the zero-eccentricity case in the more general situation, which allows for its applicability to a much broader range of astrophysical systems than considered initially. In this work, we scale the systems to the orbits of S-stars; we consider the clockwise disc to represent the perturbing body, with post-Newtonian corrections to the gravity of Sagittarius A* playing the role of damping potential. Considering post-Newtonian corrections, even stellar-mass central bodies in compact planetary systems can allow for the coupled evolution of Keplerian orbits.</description>

      <title>3D structure of the Milky Way out to 10 kpc from the Sun. Catalogue of large molecular clouds in the Galactic Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the 3D structure of the Milky Way is a crucial step in deriving properties of the star-forming regions, as well as the Galaxy as a whole. We present a novel 3D map of the Milky Way plane that extends to 10 kpc distance from the Sun. We leverage the wealth of information in the near-IR APOGEE dataset and combine that with our state-of-the-art 3D mapping technique using Bayesian statistics and the Gaussian process to provide a large-scale 3D map of the dust in the Milky Way. Our map stretches across 10 kpc along both the X and Y axes, and 750 pc in the Z direction, perpendicular to the Galactic plane. Our results reveal multi-scale over-densities as well as large cavities in the Galactic plane and shed new light on the Galactic structure and spiral arms. We also provide a catalogue of large molecular clouds identified by our map with accurate distance and volume density estimates. Utilising volume densities derived from this map, we explore mass distribution across various Galactocentric radii. A general decline towards the outer Galaxy is observed, followed by local peaks, some aligning with established features like the Molecular Ring and segments of the spiral arms. Moreover, this work explores extragalactic observational effects on derived properties of molecular clouds by demonstrating the potential biases arising from column density measurements in inferring properties of these regions, and opens exciting avenues for further exploration and analysis, offering a deeper perspective on the complex processes that shape our galaxy and beyond.</description>

      <title>Feedback in emerging extragalactic star clusters, FEAST: The relation between 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission and Star Formation Rate traced by ionized gas in NGC 628</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present maps of ionized gas (traced by Pa$\alpha$ and Br$\alpha$) and 3.3 $\mu$m Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 628, derived from new JWST/NIRCam data from the FEAST survey. With this data, we investigate and calibrate the relation between 3.3 $\mu$m PAH emission and star formation rate (SFR) in and around emerging young star clusters (eYSCs) on a scale of ${\sim}40$ pc. We find a tight (correlation coefficient $\rho$${\sim}$0.9) sub-linear (power-law exponent $\alpha$${\sim}$0.75) relation between the 3.3 $\mu$m PAH luminosity surface density and SFR traced by Br$\alpha$ for compact, cospatial (within 0.16$''$ or ${\sim}$7 pc) peaks in Pa$\alpha$, Br$\alpha$, and 3.3 $\mu$m (eYSC-I). The scatter in the relationship does not correlate well with variations in local interstellar medium (ISM) metallicity due to a radial metallicity gradient, but rather is likely due to stochastic sampling of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and variations in the PAH heating and age of our sources. The deviation from a linear relation may be explained by PAH destruction in more intense ionizing environments, variations in age, and IMF stochasticity at intermediate to low luminosities. We test our results with various continuum subtraction techniques using combinations of NIRCam bands and find that they remain robust with only minor differences in the derived slope and intercept. An unexpected discrepancy is identified between the relations of hydrogen recombination lines (Pa$\alpha$ versus Br$\alpha$; H$\alpha$ versus Br$\alpha$).</description>

      <title>How Stellar Stream Torsion may reveal aspherical Dark Matter Haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flat rotation curves follow from elongated Dark Matter distributions, as shown by our earlier competitive fits to the SPARC database. Intending to probe that distortion of the DM halo one needs observables not contained by the galactic plane. Stellar streams are caused by tidal stretching of massive substructures such as satellite dwarf galaxies, and would lie on a plane should the DM-halo gravitational field be spherically symmetric. But if the field does not display such spherical symmetry, stellar trajectories, as well as stellar streams, should torsion out of the plane. This is where the torsion of the stream can be of use: it is a local observable that measures the deviation from planarity of a curve; thus, it quantifies how noncentral the gravitational potential is. We have performed small simulations to confirm that indeed a galactic central force produces negligible torsion, and quantified the torsion for prolate haloes instead. Examining observational data, we select several streams at large distance from the galactic center, as most promising for the study, and by means of helicoidal fits extract their differential torsion. We see that their torsion is much larger than expected for a central spherical bulb alone, pointing to an elongated Milky Way halo.</description>

      <title>The Metallicity Dependence of PAH Emission in Galaxies I: Insights from Deep Radial Spitzer Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use deep Spitzer mid-infrared spectroscopic maps of radial strips across three nearby galaxies with well-studied metallicity gradients (M101, NGC 628, and NGC 2403) to explore the physical origins of the observed deficit of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at sub-solar metallicity (i.e. the PAH-metallicity relation or PZR). These maps allow us to trace the evolution of all PAH features from 5-18 $\mu$m as metallicity decreases continuously from solar ($Z_\odot$) to 0.2 $Z_\odot$. The total PAH to dust luminosity ratio remains relatively constant until reaching a threshold of $\sim$$\frac{2}{3}$$Z_\odot$, below which it declines smoothly but rapidly. The PZR has been attributed to preferential destruction of the smallest grains in the hard radiation environments found at low metallicity. In this scenario, a decrease in emission from the shortest wavelength PAH features is expected. In contrast, we find a steep decline in long wavelength power below $Z_\odot$, especially in the 17 $\mu$m feature, with the shorter wavelength PAH bands carrying an increasingly large fraction of power at low metallicity. We use newly developed grain models to reproduce the observed PZR trends, including these variations in fractional PAH feature strengths. The model that best reproduces the data employs an evolving grain size distribution that shifts to smaller sizes as metallicity declines. We interpret this as a result of inhibited grain growth at low metallicity, suggesting continuous replenishment in the interstellar medium is the dominant process shaping the PAH grain population in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Ionizing Photon Contributions of High-Redshift Galaxies to Reionization with JWST NIRCam Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST observations have the potential to provide unprecedented constraints on the history of reionization and the sources responsible for the ionizing photons due to the detection of large populations of faint galaxies at $z\gg6$. Modelling reionization requires knowing both the number of ionizing photons that are produced by galaxies and the fraction of those photons that escape into the intergalactic medium. Observational estimates of these values generally rely on spectroscopy for which large samples with well-defined selection functions remain limited. To overcome this challenge, we present an implicit likelihood inference (ILI) pipeline trained on mock photometry to predict the escaped ionizing luminosity of individual galaxies ($\dot{n}_{\rm ion}$) based on photometric magnitudes and redshifts. Compared to traditional SED-fitting methods, the new ILI pipeline is consistently more accurate and significantly faster. We deploy the method on a sample of 4,559 high-redshift galaxies from the JADES Deep survey, finding a gentle redshift evolution of $\log_{10}(\dot{n}_{\rm ion}) = (0.08\pm0.01)z + (51.60\pm0.06)$, with late-time values for $\dot{N}_{\rm ion}$ consistent with theoretical models and observations. We measure the evolution of the volume-averaged ionized fraction and optical depth to find that observed populations of star-forming galaxies are capable of driving reionization to completion at $z\sim 5.3$ without the need for AGN or other exotic sources. The $20\%$ of UV-brightest galaxies ($M_{\rm UV}&lt;-18.5$) in our sample can reionize only $\sim30\%$ of the survey volume, demonstrating that faint LyC emitters are crucial for reionization.</description>

      <title>X-ray Cool Core Remnants Heated by Strong Radio AGN Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong AGN heating provides an alternative means for the disruption of cluster cool cores (CCs) to cluster mergers. In this work we present a systematic Chandra study of a sample of 108 nearby ($z&lt;0.1$) galaxy clusters, to investigate the effect of AGN heating on CCs. About 40% of clusters with small offsets between the BCG and the X-ray centre ($\le50$ kpc) have small CCs. For comparison, 14 of 17 clusters with large offsets have small CCs, which suggests that mergers or sloshing can be efficient in reducing the CC size. Relaxed, small CC clusters generally have weak radio AGNs ($P_{1.4\rm GHz}&lt;10^{23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$), and they show a lack of systems hosting a radio AGN with intermediate radio power ($2\times10^{23}&lt;P_{1.4\rm GHz}&lt;2\times10^{24}$ W Hz$^{-1}$). We found that the strongest circumnuclear ($&lt;1$ kpc) X-ray emission only exists in clusters with strong radio AGN. The duty cycle of relaxed, small CC clusters is less than half of that for large CC clusters. It suggests that the radio activity of BCGs is affected by the properties of the surrounding gas beyond the central $\sim10$ kpc, and strong radio AGNs in small X-ray CCs fade more rapidly than those embedded in large X-ray CCs. A scenario is also presented for the transition of large CCs and coronae due to radio AGN feedback. We also present a detailed analysis of galaxy cluster 3C 129.1 as an example of a CC remnant possibly disrupted by radio AGN.</description>

      <title>A 20 kiloparsec bipolar Lyman $\alpha$ outflow from a radio galaxy at z=2.95</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of ionized gas kinematics in high-z active galaxies plays a key part in our understanding of galactic evolution, in an age where nuclear activity was widespread and star formation close to its peak. We present a study of TXS 0952-217, a radio galaxy at z=2.95, using VLT/MUSE integral field optical spectroscopy as part of a project aimed studying of the properties of ionized gas in high redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs). The Lyman $\alpha$ line profile of this object presents various emission and absorption components. By utilizing Voronoi binning, we obtained a comprehensive map of the kinematic properties of these components. These observations revealed the presence of a redshifted, high velocity (v $\sim 500$ km s$^-1$) bipolar structure of Lyman $\alpha$ emission, most likely corresponding to an outflow of ionized gas. The outflow extends beyond the compact radio source on both sides, with a total size of $\sim$ 21 kpc. Its kinetic power ($10^{42.1}$ erg s$^{-1}$) is about five orders of magnitude smaller than its radio power. Additional ionized lines, including HeII$\lambda$1640, CIV$\lambda$1550 and CIII]$\lambda$1908 were detected and their line flux ratios determined. The presence of HeII allowed for a precise redshift measurement (z=2.945$\pm$0.002). Along with the recent discovery of a similar structure in TN J1049-1258, another HzRG, it displays the feasibility of using Lyman $\alpha$ as a tracer of outflowing gas in high redshift sources, and particularly so when supported by non-resonant ionized lines such as HeII, which allow for accurate redshift and velocity measurements.</description>

      <title>CCD $UBV(RI)_{KC}$ photometry and dynamics of the open cluster NGC 1513</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive astrophysical parameters of the open cluster NGC 1513 by means of colour indices built with new $CCD\,UBV(RI)_{KC}$ photometry. Based on early-type members, the mean foreground reddening and total to selective extinction ratio are E(B-V)=0.79$\pm$0.09 mag and $R_{V}$=2.85$\pm$0.05. Through the differential grid method, we derive the metal abundance [Fe/H]=-0.06 dex (Z=+0.013), which is consistent with the value [Fe/H]=-0.088 of the bright giant member-LAMOST-695710060. The Z=+0.013 isochrone fit to the V x (B-V) colour-magnitude diagram leads to a turn-off age of 224$\pm$27 Myr (thus an intermediate-age cluster), and a distance modulus of ($V_{0}$ - $M_{\rm V}$)=10.90$\pm$0.15 mag, thus implying a distance from the Sun d=1514$\pm$105 pc. Within the uncertainties, our photometric distance is consistent with the value d=1435$\pm$14 pc from the Gaia DR3 parallax. We find signs of small mass segregation through a minimum spanning tree analysis for the 190 most massive stars, together with the rather steep mass function ($\chi$=+2.39) slope. The high core to half-light radius ratio $R_{core}$/$R_{h}$=0.82, together with the compact half-light to tidal radius ratio $R_{h}$/$R_{t}$=0.22, suggest that it is probably related to cluster-formation effects, due to little dynamical evolution, instead of driving its dynamical evolution by internal relaxation. Indeed, NGC 1513 is located in the second quadrant ($\ell$=152.59$^{\circ}$ and Galactocentric distance $R_{GC}$=9.57 kpc), which tends to minimize tidal effects by external processes and tidal disruption. Therefore, internal mass segregation effects in NGC 1513 seem to be more efficient than cluster evaporation processes. We find that NGC 1513 migrated about 0.50 kpc from its birth place.</description>

      <title>Probing the role of self-gravity in clouds impacted by AGN-driven winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of winds and jet-inflated bubbles driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to significantly affect the host galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) and regulate star formation. To explore this scenario, we perform a suite of hydrodynamic simulations to model the interaction between turbulent star-forming clouds and highly pressurised AGN-driven outflows, focusing on the effects of self-gravity. Our results demonstrate that the cloudlets fragmented by the wind can become gravitationally bound, significantly increasing their survival time. While external pressurisation leads to a global collapse of the clouds in cases of weaker winds ($10^{42}-10^{43}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$), higher-power winds ($10^{44}-10^{45}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$) disperse the gas and cause localised collapse of the cloudlets. We also demonstrate that a kinetic energy-dominated wind is more efficient in accelerating and dispersing the gas than a thermal wind with the same power. The interaction can give rise to multi-phase outflows with velocities ranging from a few 100 to several 1000~${\rm km\,s^{-1}}$. The mass outflow rates are tightly correlated with the wind power, which we explain by an ablation-based mass-loss model. Moreover, the velocity dispersion and the virial parameter of the cloud material can increase by up to one order of magnitude through the effect of the wind. Even though the wind can suppress or quench star formation for about 1 Myr during the initial interaction, a substantial number of gravitationally bound dense cloudlets manage to shield themselves from the wind's influence and subsequently undergo rapid gravitational collapse, leading to an enhanced star formation rate (SFR).</description>

      <title>First star formation in extremely early epochs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First stars play crucial roles in development of the universe, influencing events like cosmic reionization and the chemical enrichment. While first stars are conventionally thought to form at around $z \sim 20-30$ in the standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology, observational constraints on small-scale density fluctuations remain limited, possibly differing significantly from the scale-invariant fluctuations assumed in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Should this be the case, the formation of first stars could occur much earlier than typically predicted. In this study, we investigate the formation process of first stars in the extremely early epochs of $z \gtrsim 100$ in the post-recombination universe. At such early times, the effects of the warm cosmic microwave background (CMB) become significant. We calculate the collapse of primordial star-forming clouds using a one-zone thermo-chemical model that accounts for CMB influences on radiative heating, Compton cooling, and photodissociation reactions. We found that the impact of the CMB on the evolution is limited at $z \lesssim 100$, with the temperature evolution closely resembling the conventional model. However, within the range $100 \lesssim z \lesssim 400$, the formation of H$_2$ via the H$^-$ channel is impeded by H$^-$ photodetachment induced by the CMB, leading to higher temperatures compared to standard one. Consequently, first stars with masses exceeding $1000 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ can emerge at $z \gtrsim 100$. Furthermore, at $z \gtrsim 500$, the temperature evolution becomes nearly isothermal solely due to atomic cooling, as H$_2$ formation is entirely suppressed. In such cases, supermassive stars with masses around $\sim 10^5 ~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ are expected to form solely via atomic cooling. These findings emphasize the significant variation in the typical mass of the first stars depending on the epoch of formation.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of gas emission in dwarf galaxies hosting accreting black hole candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies on dwarf galaxies reveal that some of them harbor a massive black hole (BH), which is believed to have a similar mass of the Supermassive BH "seeds" at early times. The origin and growth of the primitive BHs are still open questions, since these BH seeds are hardly observed at high redshifts. Therefore, massive BH of dwarf galaxies can be the perfect candidates to untangle BH "seeds" properties and their influence on their host galaxy evolution, since massive BH may preserve their initial conditions due to its quiet merger and accretion histories. We use optical integral field unit observations, obtained with the Gemini GMOS-IFU, to study the gas emission and kinematics in four dwarf galaxies, candidates to host massive BH, based on the analysis of their [Fe X] luminosities measured from SDSS spectra. The [Fe X] emission line is not detected in our GMOS in any of the galaxies, prompting speculation that its absence in our recent data may stem from a past tidal disruption event coinciding with the observation period of the SDSS data. All galaxies exhibit extended gas emissions, and the spatially resolved emission-line ratio diagnostic diagrams present values that suggest AGN photoionization from the [S II] - BPT diagram. The gas velocity fields of all galaxies are indicative of disturbed rotation patterns, with no detection of gas outflows in any of the sources. Although the [S II] - BPT diagrams indicate AGN photoionization, further confirmation through multi-wavelength observations is required to validate this scenario.</description>

      <title>Filling in the Blanks: A Method to Infer the Substructure Membership and Dynamics of 5D Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and test a method to infer a probability density function (PDF) for the missing vlos of a star with 5D information within $2.5$ kpc. We use stars from the Gaia DR3 RVS catalogue to describe the local orbital structure in action space. This technique also allows us to infer the probability that a 5D star is associated with the Milky Way's stellar Disc or the stellar Halo, which can be further decomposed into known stellar substructures. The method is tested on a 6D Gaia DR3 RVS sample and a 6D Gaia sample crossmatched to groundbased spectroscopic surveys, stripped of their true vlos. The stars predicted vlos, membership probabilities, and inferred structure properties are then compared to the true 6D equivalents, allowing the method's accuracy and limitations to be studied in detail. Our predicted vlos PDFs are statistically consistent with the true vlos, with accurate uncertainties. We find that the vlos of Disc stars can be well constrained, with a median uncertainty of 26 kms. Halo stars are typically less well constrained with a median uncertainty of 72 kms, but those found likely to belong to Halo substructures can be better constrained. The dynamical properties of the total sample and subgroups, such as distributions of integrals of motion and velocities, are also accurately recovered. The group membership probabilities are statistically consistent with our initial labelling, allowing high quality sets to be selected from 5D samples by choosing a trade off between higher expected purity and decreasing expected completeness.</description>

      <title>Model-independent Reconstruction of UV Luminosity Function and Reionization Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a first comprehensive study of the Luminosity Function (LF) using a non-parametric approach. We use Gaussian Process to fit available luminosity data between redshifts $z \sim 2-8$. Our free-form LF in the non-parametric approach rules out the conventional Schechter function model to describe the luminosity-magnitude relation at redshifts $z=3$ and $4$. Hints of deviation from the Schechter function are also noticed at redshifts 2, 7 and 8 at lower statistical significance. Significant deviation starts for brighter ionizing sources at $M_{\rm UV} \lesssim -21$. The UV luminosity density data at different redshifts are then derived by integrating the LFs obtained from both methods with a truncation magnitude of $-17$. In our analysis, we also include the first 90 arcmin$^2$ JWST/NIRCam data at $z \sim 9-12$. Since at larger magnitudes, we do not find major deviations from the Schechter function, the integrated luminosity density differs marginally between the two methods. Finally, we obtain the history of reionization from a joint analysis of UV luminosity density data along with the ionization fraction data and Planck observation of Cosmic Microwave Background. The history of reionization is not affected by the deviation of LFs from Schechter function at lower magnitudes. We derive reionization optical depth to be $\tau_{\rm re}=0.0494^{+0.0007}_{-0.0006}$ and the duration between 10$\% $ and 90$\%$ completion of ionization process is found to be $\Delta z\sim 1.627^{+0.059}_{-0.071}$.</description>

      <title>Formation pathways of the compact stellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation pathways of compact stellar systems (CSSs) are still under debate. We utilize the \NH\ simulation to investigate the origins of such objects in the field environment. We identified 55 CSS candidates in the simulation whose properties are similar to those of the observed ultra-compact dwarfs and compact ellipticals. All but two most massive objects (compact elliptical candidates) are a result of a short starburst. Sixteen are formed by tidal stripping, while the other 39 are intrinsically compact from their birth. The stripped objects originate from dwarf-like galaxies with a dark halo, but most of their dark matter is stripped through their orbital motion around a more massive neighbor galaxy. The 39 intrinsically compact systems are further divided into ``associated'' or ``isolated'' groups, depending on whether they were born near a massive dark halo or not. The isolated intrinsic compact objects (7) are born in a dark halo and their stellar properties are older and metal-poor compared to the associated counterparts (32). The stripped compact objects occupy a distinct region in the age-metallicity plane from the intrinsic compact objects. The associated intrinsic compact objects in our sample have never had a dark halo; they are the surviving star clumps of a massive galaxy.</description>

      <title>A SN Ia Near a Globular Cluster in the Early-Type Galaxy NGC 5353</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: No progenitor of a Type Ia supernova is known, but in old population early-type galaxies, one may find SN Ia associated with globular clusters, yielding a population age and metallicity. It also provides insight into the formation path and the SN enhancement rate in globular clusters. We sought to find such associations and identified SN 2019ein to be within the ground-based optical positional uncertainty of a globular cluster candidate within the early-type galaxy NGC 5353 at about 30 Mpc distance. We reduced the positional uncertainties by obtaining Hubble Space Telescope images with the Advanced Camera for Surveys, using filters F475W and F814W and obtained in June 2020. We find that the globular cluster candidate has a magnitude, color, and angular extent that are consistent with it being a typical globular cluster. The separation between the globular cluster and SN 2019ein is 0.43'', or 59 pc in projection. The chance occurrence with a random globular cluster is about 3%, favoring but not proving an association. If the SN progenitor originated in the globular cluster, one scenario is that SN 2019ein was previously a double degenerate white dwarf binary that was dynamically ejected from the globular cluster and exploded within 10 Myr; models do not predict this to be common. Another, but less likely scenario is where the progenitor remained bound to the globular cluster, allowing the double degenerate binary to inspiral on a much longer timescale before producing a SN.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar spectra from LAMOST Medium Resolution Survey can be used to search for compact objects in binaries. The LAMOST DR10 catalog includes &gt; 980, 000 targets with multiple medium resolution spectra. We select the targets with large or rapid radial velocity variation, and obtained an input-sample of 1822 sources. We use light curves and spectra to identify and exclude eclipsing binaries and double-lined spectroscopic binaries in the input-sample. We finally derive a catalog of 89 candidates with well-folded radial velocity, which are all single-lined spectroscopic binaries, indicating an unseen companion residing in each system. The mass function of each system can be well constrained based on the radial velocity curve. In our sample, 26 sources have mass function higher than 0.1 $M_{\odot}$, among which 18 sources have ellipsoidal type light curves. In our opinion, compact objects are likely existent in all these 26 binaries, which are worth follow-up identification.</description>

      <title>The IACOB project XI. No increase of mass-loss rates over the bi-stability region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of blue supergiants are key for constraining the end of the main sequence (MS) of massive stars. Whether the observed drop in the relative number of fast-rotating stars below $\sim$21$\,$kK is due to enhanced mass-loss rates at the location of the bi-stability jump, or the result of the end of the MS is still debated. Here, we combine newly derived estimates of photospheric and wind parameters with Gaia distances and wind terminal velocities from the literature to obtain upper limits on the mass-loss rates for a sample of 116 Galactic luminous blue supergiants. The parameter space covered by the sample ranges between 35-15$\,$kK in $T_{\rm eff}$ and 4.8-5.8$\,$dex in log(L/L$_{\odot}$). Our results show no increase in the mass-loss rates over the bi-stability jump. Therefore, we argue that the drop in rotational velocities cannot be explained by enhanced mass loss. Since a large jump in the mass-loss rates is commonly included in evolutionary models, we suggest an urgent revision of the currently used default prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous radial acceleration of galaxies and clusters supports hyperconical modified gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General relativity (GR) is the most successful theory of gravity, with great observational support at local scales. However, to keep GR valid at over cosmic scales, some phenomena (such as the flat galaxy rotation curves and the cosmic acceleration) require the assumption of exotic dark matter. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) indicates a tight correlation between dynamical mass and baryonic mass in galaxies and galaxy clusters. This suggests that the observations could be better explained by modified gravity theories without exotic matter. Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is an alternative theory for explaining some cases of flat galaxy rotation curves by using a new fundamental constant acceleration $a_0$, the so-called Milgromian parameter. However, this non-relativistic model is too rigid (with insufficient parameters) to fit the large diversity of observational phenomena. In contrast, a relativistic MOND-like gravity naturally emerges from the hyperconical model, which derives a fictitious acceleration compatible with observations. This study analyses the compatibility of the hyperconical model with respect to RAR observations of 10 galaxy clusters obtained from HIFLUGCS and 60 high-quality SPARC galaxy rotation curves. The results show that a general relation can be fitted to most cases with only one or two parameters, with an acceptable chi-square and $p$-value. These findings suggest a possible way to complete the proposed modification of GR on a cosmic scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense flaring events in the near-infrared and X-ray wavebands of our Galactic Center have been the subject of research for decades. In recent years, the GRAVITY instrument of the Very Large Telescope captured the motion and polarimetric signature of such a flare in close proximity to the supermassive black hole. This study aims to investigate a broad parameter space for hot spot motion in the vicinity of Sgr$A*$ and reproduce the observed flaring behavior. To this end, we have developed a General Relativistic Radiative Transfer code and conducted a parameter study including both planar and ejected hot spot configurations around supermassive black holes. Super-Keplerian orbital frequencies are favored by circular equatorial, cylindrical and parabolic models, whereas conical hot spot trajectories provide a better fit for orbital frequencies below the Keplerian value. Additionally, a distant observer cannot effectively differentiate between Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, as well as face-on orbits at different observation angles.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Warm Dark Matter: from Cosmological Asymmetry to Chirality of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel scenario involving asymmetric keV-range dark matter (DM) in the form of right-handed (sterile) neutrinos. Based on the Fermi-Dirac distribution, we demonstrate that asymmetric fermionic DM forms a Fermi degenerate gas, making it potentially colder than symmetric fermionic DM. This setup simultaneously accounts for the Universe's baryon asymmetry through tiny Yukawa interactions with Standard Model leptons and the Higgs field, and the homochirality of amino acids via decay into circularly polarized photons. This scenario can be investigated through soft X-ray searches conducted by current and upcoming space missions. The helical X-rays is a smoking-gun signal of our scenario. Additionally, we propose a new mechanism to suppress DM thermal production by introducing a light modulus, which may also benefit cosmology involving generic right-handed neutrinos with large mixing.</description>

Abstract: [Abridged] To understand the role of the galaxy group environment on galaxy evolution, we present a study of radio luminosity functions (RLFs) of group galaxies based on the VLA-COSMOS 3 GHz Large Project. The radio-selected sample of 7826 COSMOS galaxies with robust optical/near-infrared counterparts, excellent photometric coverage, and the COSMOS X-ray galaxy groups (M_200c &gt; 10^13.5 M_sun) enables us to construct the RLF of group galaxies (GGs) and their contribution to the total RLF since z ~ 2.3. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, we fit a redshift-dependent pure luminosity evolution model and a linear and power-law model to the luminosity functions. We compare it with past RLF studies from VLA-COSMOS on individual populations of radio-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). These populations are classified based on the presence or absence of a radio excess concerning the star-formation rates derived from the infrared emission. We find that the density of radio galaxies in groups is low compared to the field at z ~ 2 down to z ~ 1.25, followed by a sharp increase at z ~ 1 by a factor of 6, and then a smooth decline towards low redshifts. This trend is caused by both decrease in the volume abundance of massive groups at high-z and the changes in the halo occupation of radio AGN, which are found by other studies to reside at smaller halo mass groups. This indicates that the bulk of high-$z$ log10(M_200c/M_sun) &gt; 13.5 groups must have been forming recently, and so the cooling has not been established as yet. The slope of the GG RLF is flatter compared to the field, with excess at high radio luminosities. The evolution in the GG RLF is driven mainly by satellite galaxies in groups. A drop in occurrence of AGN in groups at z &gt; 1 by a factor of 6, manifests an important detail on the processes governing galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>JWST/CEERS sheds light on dusty star-forming galaxies: forming bulges, lopsidedness and outside-in quenching at cosmic noon</title>

Abstract: We investigate the morphology and resolved physical properties of a sample of 22 IR-selected DSFG at cosmic noon using the JWST/NIRCam images obtained in the EGS field for the CEERS survey. The resolution of the NIRCam images allowed to spatially resolve these galaxies up to 4.4um and identify their bulge even when extinguished by dust. The goal of this study is to obtain a better understanding of the formation and evolution of FIR-bright galaxies by spatially resolving their properties using JWST in order to look through the dust and bridge the gap between the compact FIR sources and the larger optical SFG. Based on RGB images from the NIRCam filters, we divided each galaxy into several uniformly colored regions, fitted their respective SEDs, and measured physical properties. After classifying each region as SF or quiescent, we assigned galaxies to three classes, depending on whether active SF is located in the core, in the disk or in both. We find (i) that galaxies at a higher z tend to have a fragmented disk with a low core mass fraction. They are at an early stage of bulge formation. When moving toward a lower z, the core mass fraction increases, and the bulge growth is associated with a stabilization of the disk: the NIRCam data clearly point toward bulge formation in preexisting disks. (ii) Lopsidedness is a common feature of DSFGs. It could have a major impact on their evolution; (iii) 23% of galaxies have a SF core embedded in a quiescent disk. They seem to be undergoing outside-in quenching, often facilitated by their strong lopsidedness inducing instabilities. (iv) We show that half of our galaxies with SF concentrated in their core are good SMG counterpart candidates, demonstrating that compact SMGs are usually surrounded by a larger, less obscured disk. (v) Finally, we found surprising evidence for clump-like substructures being quiescent or residing in quiescent regions.</description>

      <title>The Hyper Suprime-Cam extended Point Spread Functions and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present extended point spread function (PSF) models for the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program Public Data Release 3 (HSC-SSP PDR3) in all $\textit{g,r,i,Z}$ and $\textit{Y}$-bands. Due to its 8.2m primary mirror and long exposure periods, HSC combines deep images with wide-field coverage. Both properties make HSC one of the most suitable observing facilities for low surface brightness (LSB) studies, which are particularly sensitive to the PSF. By applying a median stacking technique of point-like sources with different brightness, we show how to construct the HSC-SSP PDR3 PSF models to an extent of R $\sim$ 5.6 arcmin. These models are appropriate for the HSC-PDR3 intermediate-state data which do not have applied the final aggressive background subtraction. The intermediate-state data is especially stored for users interested in large extended objects, where our new PSFs provide them with a crucial tool to characterise LSB properties at large angles. We demonstrate that our HSC PSFs behave reasonably in two scenarios. In the first one, we generate 2-D models of a bright star, showing no evidence of residual structures across the five bands. In the second scenario, we recreate the PSF-scattered light on mock images with special consideration of the effect of this additional flux on LSB measurements. We find that, despite the well-behaved nature of the HSC-PDR3 PSFs, there is a non-negligible impact on the faint light present in the mock images. This impact could lead to incorrect LSB measurements if a proper star subtraction is not applied.</description>

      <title>On the magnetic field properties of protostellar envelopes in Orion</title>

Abstract: We present 870 um polarimetric observations toward 61 protostars in the Orion molecular clouds, with ~400 au (1") resolution using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. We successfully detect dust polarization and outflow emission in 56 protostars, in 16 of them the polarization is likely produced by self-scattering. Self-scattering signatures are seen in several Class 0 sources, suggesting that grain growth appears to be significant in disks at earlier protostellar phases. For the rest of the protostars, the dust polarization traces the magnetic field, whose morphology can be approximately classified into three categories: standard-hourglass, rotated-hourglass (with its axis perpendicular to outflow), and spiral-like morphology. 40.0% (+-3.0%) of the protostars exhibit a mean magnetic field direction approximately perpendicular to the outflow on several 100--1000 au scales. However, in the remaining sample, this relative orientation appears to be random, probably due to the complex set of morphologies observed. Furthermore, we classify the protostars into three types based on the C17O (3--2) velocity envelope's gradient: perpendicular to outflow, non-perpendicular to outflow, and unresolved gradient (&lt;1.0~km/s/arcsec). In protostars with a velocity gradient perpendicular to outflow, the magnetic field lines are preferentially perpendicular to outflow, most of them exhibit a rotated hourglass morphology, suggesting that the magnetic field has been overwhelmed by gravity and angular momentum. Spiral-like magnetic fields are associated with envelopes having large velocity gradients, indicating that the rotation motions are strong enough to twist the field lines. All of the protostars with a standard-hourglass field morphology show no significant velocity gradient due to the strong magnetic braking.</description>

      <title>Chemical Diagnostics to Unveil Environments Enriched by First Stars</title>

Abstract: Unveiling the chemical fingerprints of the first (Pop III) stars is crucial for indirectly studying their properties and probing their massive nature. In particular, very massive Pop III stars explode as energetic Pair-Instability Supernovae (PISNe), allowing their chemical products to escape in the diffuse medium around galaxies, opening the possibility to observe their fingerprints in distant gas clouds. Recently, three z &gt; 6.3 absorbers with abundances consistent with an enrichment from PISNe have been observed with JWST. In this Letter, we present novel chemical diagnostics to uncover environments mainly imprinted by PISNe. Furthermore, we revise the JWST low-resolution measurements by analyzing the publicly available high-resolution X-Shooter spectra for two of these systems. Our results reconcile the chemical abundances of these absorbers with those from literature, which are found to be consistent with an enrichment dominated (&gt; 50% metals) by normal Pop II SNe. We show the power of our novel diagnostics in isolating environments uniquely enriched by PISNe from those mainly polluted by other Pop III and Pop II SNe. When the subsequent enrichment from Pop II SNe is included, however, we find that the abundances of PISN-dominated environments partially overlap with those predominantly enriched by other Pop III and Pop II SNe. We dub these areas confusion regions. Yet, the odd-even abundance ratios [Mg,Si/Al] are extremely effective in pinpointing PISN- dominated environments and allowed us to uncover, for the first time, an absorber consistent with a combined enrichment by a PISN and another Pop III SN for all the six measured elements.</description>

      <title>An early dark matter-dominated phase in the assembly history of Milky Way-mass galaxies suggested by the TNG50 simulation and JWST observations</title>

Abstract: Whereas well-studied galaxies at cosmic noon are found to be baryon-dominated within the effective radius, recent JWST observations of $z\sim6-7$ galaxies with stellar masses of only $M_*\sim10^{8-9}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ surprisingly indicate that they are dark matter-dominated within $r_{\rm e}\approx 1\,$kpc. Here, we place these high-redshift measurements in the context of the TNG50 galaxy formation simulation, by measuring the central (within $1\,$kpc) stellar, gas, and dark matter masses of galaxies in the simulation. The central baryon fraction varies strongly with galaxy stellar mass in TNG50, and this $M_*$-dependence is remarkably constant across $0&lt;z&lt;6$: galaxies of low stellar mass ($M_*\sim10^{8-9}\,{\rm M_\odot}$) are dark matter-dominated, as $f_{\rm baryon}(&lt;1\,{\rm kpc})\sim0.25$. At $z=6$, the baryonic mass in the centers of low-mass galaxies is largely comprised of gas, exceeding the stellar mass component by a factor $\sim4$. We use the simulation to track the typical evolution of such low-mass dark matter-dominated galaxies at $z=6$, and show that these systems become baryon-dominated in their centers at cosmic noon, with high stellar-to-gas mass ratios, and grow to galaxies of $M_*\sim10^{10.5}\,{\rm M_\odot}$ at $z=0$. Comparing to the dynamical and stellar mass measurements from observations at high redshifts, these findings suggest that the inferred star formation efficiency in the early Universe is broadly in line with the established assumptions for the cosmological simulations. Moreover, our results imply that the JWST observations may indeed have reached the early, low-mass regime where the central parts of galaxies transition from being dark matter-dominated to being baryon-dominated.</description>

      <title>JWST PRIMER: A new multi-field determination of the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function at redshifts $\mathbf{z \simeq 9-15}$</title>

Abstract: We present a new determination of the evolving galaxy UV luminosity function (LF) over the redshift range $8.5&lt;z&lt;15.5$ using a combination of several major Cycle-1 JWST imaging programmes - PRIMER, JADES and NGDEEP. This multi-field approach yields a total of $\simeq370$ sq. arcmin of JWST/NIRCam imaging, reaching (5-$\sigma$) depths of $\simeq30$ AB mag in the deepest regions. We select a sample of 2548 galaxies with a significant probability of lying at high redshift ($p(z&gt;8.5)&gt;0.05$) to undertake a statistical calculation of the UV LF. Our new measurements span $\simeq4$ magnitudes in UV luminosity at $z=9-12.5$, placing new constraints on both the shape and evolution of the LF at early times. Our measurements yield a new estimate of the early evolution of cosmic star-formation rate density ($\rho_{\rm{SFR}}$) confirming the gradual decline deduced from early JWST studies, at least out to $z \simeq 12$. Finally we show that the observed early evolution of the galaxy UV LF (and $\rho_{\rm{SFR}}$) can be reproduced in a ${\rm \Lambda}$CDM Universe, with no change in dust properties or star-formation efficiency required out to $z \simeq 12$. Instead, a progressive trend towards younger stellar population ages can reproduce the observations, and the typical ages required at $z \simeq$ 8, 9, 10, and 11 all converge on $\simeq 380-330$ Myr after the Big Bang, indicative of a rapid emergence of early galaxies at $z \simeq 12 - 13$. This is consistent with the first indications of a steeper drop-off in $\rho_{\rm{SFR}}$ we find beyond $z \simeq 13$, possibly reflecting the rapid evolution of the halo mass function at earlier times.</description>

      <title>Star formation exists in all early-type galaxies -- evidence from ubiquitous structure in UV images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent surveys have demonstrated the widespread presence of UV emission in early-type galaxies (ETGs), suggesting the existence of star formation in many of these systems. However, potential UV contributions from old and young stars, together with model uncertainties, makes it challenging to confirm the presence of young stars using integrated photometry alone. This is particularly true in ETGs that are fainter in the UV and have red UV-optical colours. An unambiguous way of disentangling the source of the UV is to look for structure in UV images. Optical images of ETGs, which are dominated by old stars, are smooth and devoid of structure. If the UV is also produced by these old stars, then the UV images will share this smoothness, while, if driven by young stars, they will exhibit significant structure. We compare the UV and optical morphologies of 32 ETGs (93 per cent of which are at $z&lt;0.03$) using quantitative parameters (concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness and the S\'ersic index), calculated via deep UV and optical images with similar resolution. Regardless of stellar mass, UV-optical colour or the presence of interactions, the asymmetry and clumpiness of ETGs is significantly larger (often by several orders of magnitudes) in the UV than in the optical, while the UV S\'ersic indices are typically lower than their optical counterparts. The ubiquitous presence of structure demonstrates that the UV flux across our entire ETG sample is dominated by young stars and indicates that star formation exists in all ETGs in the nearby Universe.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of dark matter with the extreme galaxy AGC 114905</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AGC 114905 is a dwarf gas-rich ultra-diffuse galaxy seemingly in tension with the cold dark matter (CDM) model. Specifically, the galaxy appears to have an extremely low-density halo and a high baryon fraction, while CDM predicts dwarfs to have very dense and dominant dark haloes. The alleged tension relies on the galaxy's rotation curve decomposition, which depends heavily on its inclination. This inclination, estimated from the gas (neutral atomic hydrogen, HI) morphology, remains somewhat uncertain. We present unmatched ultra-deep optical imaging of AGC 114905 reaching surface brightness limits $\mu_{\rm r,lim} \approx 32$ mag/arcsec$^2$ ($3\sigma$; 10 arcsec $\times$ 10 arcsec) obtained with the 10.4-m Gran Telescopio Canarias. With the new imaging, we characterise the galaxy's morphology, surface brightness, colours, and stellar mass profiles in great detail. The stellar disc has a similar extent as the gas, presents spiral arms-like features, and shows a well-defined edge. Stars and gas share similar morphology, and crucially, we find an inclination of $31\pm2^\circ$, in agreement with the previous determinations. We revisit the rotation curve decomposition of the galaxy, and we explore different mass models in the context of CDM, self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), fuzzy dark matter (FDM) or Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We find that the latter does not fit the circular speed of the galaxy, while CDM only does so with dark halo parameters rarely seen in cosmological simulations. Within the uncertainties, SIDM and FDM remain feasible candidates to explain the observed kinematics of AGC 114905.</description>

      <title>Multi-phase black-hole feedback and a bright [CII] halo in a Lo-BAL quasar at $z\sim6.6$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the mass growth of supermassive black holes during the Epoch of Reionisation is expected to play a role in shaping the concurrent growth of their host-galaxies, observational evidence of feedback at z$\gtrsim$6 is still sparse. We perform the first multi-scale and multi-phase characterisation of black-hole driven outflows in the $z\sim6.6$ quasar J0923+0402 and assess how these winds impact the cold gas reservoir. We employ the SimBAL spectral synthesis to fit broad absorption line (BAL) features and find a powerful ionized outflow on $\lesssim210$ pc scale, with a kinetic power $\sim2-100$\% of the quasar luminosity. ALMA observations of [CII] emission allow us to study the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas. We detect high-velocity [CII] emission, likely associated with a cold neutral outflow at $\sim0.5-2$ kpc scale in the host-galaxy, and a bright extended [CII] halo with a size of $\sim15$ kpc. For the first time at such an early epoch, we accurately constrain the outflow energetics in both the ionized and the atomic neutral gas phases. We find such energetics to be consistent with expectations for an efficient feedback mechanism, and both ejective and preventative feedback modes are likely at play. The scales and energetics of the ionized and atomic outflows suggest that they might be associated with different quasar accretion episodes. The results of this work indicate that strong black hole feedback is occurring in quasars at $z\gtrsim6$ and is likely responsible for shaping the properties of the cold gas reservoir up to circum-galactic scales.</description>

      <title>Over 200 globular clusters in the Milky Way and still none with super-Solar metallicity</title>

Abstract: Many globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) have been studied in recent years, especially in hidden regions such as those of the Galactic bulge. Our main goal is to understand what we can learn if we include these new objects into the MWGC system that we know today. We catalogue 37 recently discovered GCs. We use different distributions for investigating the MWGC system: metallicity distribution (MD), luminosity function (LF), and age distribution. We first treat separately the new GCs sample from the known and well-characterised GCs. We merge these two samples, upgrading the MWGC system. We performed a comparison between our clusters sample and field star (FS) population. We find a double peaked distribution for the LF, which shows an elongated faint end tail. Considering the "merged" sample, the LF and the MDs display a bimodality trend. We construct the MD for the FS sample, and comparing this with that one of the GCs, we learn that a high percentage of FS show [Fe/H]$&gt;0$, whereas we do not detect any GCs in the same metallicity range. In order to understand this inconsistency, we construct the age-metallicity diagram for both samples, noting that the old and metal-poor population (age$\geq8$ Gyr and [Fe/H]$\leq -1.0$) is represented by GCs, while the young and metal-rich population (age$&lt;8$ Gyr and [Fe/H]$&gt;-1.0$) corresponds to FS. From the analysis of the GC LF and MD, we can conclude that many GCs, probably those very faint, have survived strong dynamical processes, typical of the Bulge regions. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of them have been accreted during past merging events, especially the metal-poor component, whereas the metal-rich population may be related to the formation of the bulge and/or disk. Finally, the difference that we notice between the GC and FS samples should be sought in the evolutionary difference between these two stellar populations.</description>

Abstract: We present the census of H$\beta$+[O III] $4960,5008$ \AA emitters at $6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0$ from the JWST FRESCO survey over 124 arcmin$^2$ in the GOODS-North and GOODS-South fields. Our unbiased spectroscopic search results in 137 spectroscopically-confirmed galaxies at $6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0$ with observed [O III] fluxes $f_{[O III]}\gtrsim 1\times 10^{-18}\ \rm{erg}\ \rm{s}^{-1} \ \rm{cm}^{-2}$. The rest-frame optical line ratios of the median stacked spectrum indicate negligible dust attenuation, low metallicity ($12+\log(\rm{O/H})= 7.2-7.7$) and a high ionisation parameter $\log_{10}U \simeq -2.5$ at a median UV magnitude $M_{\rm{UV}}=-19.65^{+0.59}_{-1.05}$. We find a factor $\times\ 1.3$ difference in the number density of $6.8&lt;z&lt;9.0$ galaxies between GOODS-South and GOODS-North, which is caused by single overdensity at $7.0&lt;z&lt;7.2$ in GOODS-North. The bright end of the UV luminosity function of spectroscopically-confirmed [O III] emitters is in good agreement with that from pre-JWST dropout-selected samples. Discrepancies between the observed [O III] LF, [O III] /UV ratio and [O III] equivalent widths distribution and that predicted by theoretical models suggest burstier star-formation histories and/or more heterogeneous metallicity and ionising conditions in $z&gt;7$ galaxies. We report a rapid decline of the [O III] luminosity density at $z\gtrsim 6-7$ which cannot be explained solely by the evolution of the cosmic star-formation rate density. Finally, we find that FRESCO, in only $2$h, captures star-forming galaxies likely accounting for $\sim 10-20\%$ of the ionising budget at $z=7$ and $z=8$, raising the prospect of detecting directly all the sources of reionisation with JWST.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Simulating dwarf galaxies at solar mass resolution with radiative transfer and feedback from individual massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the RIGEL model, a novel framework to self-consistently model the effects of stellar feedback in the multiphase ISM of dwarf galaxies with radiative transfer (RT) on a star-by-star basis. The RIGEL model integrates detailed implementations of feedback from individual massive stars into the RHD code, AREPO-RT. It forms individual massive stars from the resolved multiphase ISM by sampling the IMF and tracks their evolution individually. The lifetimes, photon production rates, mass-loss rates, and wind velocities of these stars are determined by their initial masses and metallicities based on a library that incorporates a variety of stellar models. The RT equations are solved in seven spectral bins accounting for the IR to HeII ionizing bands, using an M1 RT scheme. The thermochemistry model tracks the non-equilibrium H, He chemistry and the equilibrium abundance of CI, CII, OI, OII, and CO to capture the thermodynamics of all ISM phases. We evaluate the performance of the RIGEL model using $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. We found that the SFR and ISRF show strong positive correlations to the metallicity of the galaxy. Photoionization and photoheating can reduce the SFR by an order of magnitude by removing the available cold-dense gas fuel for star formation. The ISRF also changes the thermal structure of the ISM. Radiative feedback occurs immediately after the birth of massive stars and rapidly disperses the molecular clouds within 1 Myr. As a consequence, radiative feedback reduces the age spread of star clusters to less than 2 Myr, prohibits the formation of massive star clusters, and shapes the cluster initial mass function to a steep power-law form with a slope of $\sim-2$. The mass-loading factor of the fiducial galaxy has a median of $\sim50$, while turning off radiative feedback reduces this factor by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Comparing bulge RR Lyrae stars with bulge giants -- Insight from 3D kinematics</title>

Abstract: The structure and kinematics of the old component of the Galactic bulge are still a matter of debate. The bulk of the bulge as traced by red clump stars includes two main components, which are usually identified as the metal-rich and metal-poor components. They have different shapes, kinematics, mean metallicities, and alpha-element abundances. It is our current understanding that they are associated with a bar and a spheroid, respectively. On the other hand, RR Lyrae variables trace the oldest population of the bulge. While it would be natural to think that they follow the structure and kinematics of the metal-poor component, the data analysed in the literature show conflicting results. We aim to derive a rotation curve for bulge RR Lyrae stars in order to determine that the old component traced by these stars is distinct from the two main components observed in the Galactic bulge. This paper combines APOGEE-2S spectra with OGLE-IV light curves, near-IR photometry, and proper motions from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea survey for 4197 RR Lyrae stars. Six-dimensional phase-space coordinates were used to calculate orbits within an updated Galactic potential and to isolate the stars. The stars that stay confined within the bulge represent 57% of our sample. Our results show that bulge RR Lyrae variables rotate more slowly than metal-rich red clump stars and have a lower velocity dispersion. Their kinematics is compatible with them being the low-metallicity tail of the metal-poor component. We confirm that a rather large fraction of halo RR Lyrae stars pass by the bulge within their orbits, increasing the velocity dispersion. A proper orbital analysis is therefore critical to isolate bona fide bulge variables. Finally, bulge RR Lyrae seem to trace a spheroidal component, although the current data do now allow us to reach a firm conclusion about the spatial distribution.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array: IV. Implications for massive black holes, dark matter and the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) and Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) collaborations have measured a low-frequency common signal in the combination of their second and first data releases respectively, with the correlation properties of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Such signal may have its origin in a number of physical processes including a cosmic population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs); inflation, phase transitions, cosmic strings and tensor mode generation by non-linear evolution of scalar perturbations in the early Universe; oscillations of the Galactic potential in the presence of ultra-light dark matter (ULDM). At the current stage of emerging evidence, it is impossible to discriminate among the different origins. Therefore, in this paper, we consider each process separately, and investigate the implications of the signal under the hypothesis that it is generated by that specific process. We find that the signal is consistent with a cosmic population of inspiralling SMBHBs, and its relatively high amplitude can be used to place constraints on binary merger timescales and the SMBH-host galaxy scaling relations. If this origin is confirmed, this is the first direct evidence that SMBHBs merge in nature, adding an important observational piece to the puzzle of structure formation and galaxy evolution. As for early Universe processes, the measurement would place tight constraints on the cosmic string tension and on the level of turbulence developed by first-order phase transitions. Other processes would require non-standard scenarios, such as a blue-tilted inflationary spectrum or an excess in the primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations at large wavenumbers. Finally, a ULDM origin of the detected signal is disfavoured, which leads to direct constraints on the abundance of ULDM in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Weak Lensing with Gaia DR3 and Future Catalogs: Searches for Dark Matter Substructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small-scale dark matter structures lighter than a billion solar masses are an important probe of primordial density fluctuations and dark matter microphysics. Due to their lack of starlight emission, their only guaranteed signatures are gravitational in nature. We report on results of a search for astrometric weak lensing by compact dark matter subhalos in the Milky Way with Gaia DR3 data. Using a matched-filter analysis to look for correlated imprints of time-domain lensing on the proper motions of background stars in the Magellanic Clouds, we exclude order-unity substructure fractions in halos with masses $M_{l}$ between $10^{7} \, M_{\odot}$ and $10^{9} \, M_{\odot}$ and sizes of one parsec or smaller. We forecast that a similar approach based on proper accelerations across the entire sky with data from Gaia DR4 may be sensitive to substructure fractions of $f_{l} \gtrsim 10^{-3}$ in the much lower mass range of $10 \, M_{\odot} \lesssim M_{l} \lesssim 3 \times 10^{3} \, M_{\odot}$. We further propose an analogous technique for stacked star-star lensing events in the regime of large impact parameters. Our first implementation is not yet sufficiently sensitive but serves as a useful diagnostic and calibration tool; future data releases should enable average stellar mass measurements using this stacking method.</description>

      <title>An Anti-halo Void Catalogue of the Local Super-Volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an anti-halo void catalogue of $150$ voids with radii $R &gt; 10\,h^{-1}\mathrm{\,Mpc}$ in the Local Super-Volume ($&lt;135\,h^{-1}\mathrm{\,Mpc}$ from the Milky Way), using posterior resimulation of initial conditions inferred by field-level inference with Bayesian Origin Reconstruction from Galaxies (\codefont{BORG}). We describe and make use of a new algorithm for creating a single, unified void catalogue by combining different samples from the posterior. The catalogue is complete out to $135\,h^{-1}\mathrm{\,Mpc}$, with void abundances matching theoretical predictions. Finally, we compute stacked density profiles of those voids which are reliably identified across posterior samples, and show that these are compatible with $\Lambda$CDM expectations once environmental selection (e.g., the estimated $\sim 4\%$ under-density of the Local Super-Volume) is accounted for.</description>

      <title>Detecting strongly-lensed type Ia supernovae with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly-lensed supernovae are rare and valuable probes of cosmology and astrophysics. Upcoming wide-field time-domain surveys, such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), are expected to discover an order-of-magnitude more lensed supernovae than have previously been observed. In this work, we investigate the cosmological prospects of lensed type Ia supernovae (SNIa) in LSST by quantifying the expected annual number of detections, the impact of stellar microlensing, follow-up feasibility, and how to best separate lensed and unlensed SNIa. We simulate SNIa lensed by galaxies, using the current LSST baseline v3.0 cadence, and find an expected number of 44 lensed SNIa detections per year. Microlensing effects by stars in the lens galaxy are predicted to lower the lensed SNIa detections by $\sim 8 \%$. The lensed events can be separated from the unlensed ones by jointly considering their colours and peak magnitudes. We define a `gold sample' of $\sim 10$ lensed SNIa per year with time delay $&gt; 10$ days, $&gt; 5$ detections before light-curve peak, and sufficiently bright ($m_i &lt; 22.5$ mag) for follow-up observations. In three years of LSST operations, such a sample is expected to yield a $1.5\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Efficient prescription to search for linear gravitational wave memory from hyperbolic black hole encounters and its application to the NANOGrav 12.5-year dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03472v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Burst with memory events are potential transient gravitational wave sources for the maturing pulsar timing array (PTA) efforts. We provide a computationally efficient prescription to model pulsar timing residuals induced by supermassive black hole pairs in general relativistic hyperbolic trajectories employing a Keplerian-type parametric solution. Injection studies have been pursued on the resulting bursts with linear GW memory (LGWM) events with simulated datasets to test the performance of our pipeline, followed by its application to the publicly available NANOGrav 12.5-year (NG12.5) dataset. Given the absence of any evidence of LGWM events within the real NG12.5 dataset, we impose $95\%$ upper limits on the PTA signal amplitude as a function of the sky location of the source and certain characteristic frequency ($n$) of the signal. The upper limits are computed using a signal model that takes into account the presence of intrinsic timing noise specific to each pulsar, as well as a common, spatially uncorrelated red noise, alongside the LGWM signal. Our investigations reveal that the $95\%$ upper limits on LGWM amplitude, marginalized over all other parameters, is 3.48 $\pm 0.51 \ \mu$s for $n&gt;3.16$ nHz. This effort should be relevant for constraining both burst and memory events in the upcoming International Pulsar Timing Array data releases.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters II: Difficulty of Gaia NS formation in low-mass star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called "Gaia BHs" and "Gaia NSs", respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $3$ and $21$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore compactifications of the form of three tori with general genus and one circle in the framework of 11D supergravity. By imposing suitable gauge conditions and boundary conditions, we find that the four-dimensional FRW universe emerges as a solution representing cosmological D3-branes in the eleven-dimensional bulk. These specific compactification methods can produce cosmological inflation that aligns with the observational constraints set by the 2021 BICEP/Keck and Planck 2018 results. In the cosmological inflation models we construct, the inflaton can be interpreted as the conformal vibrations of extra dimensions with a size around 10^5 times the reduced Planck length. Additionally, we offer the theoretical predictions for the mass of the inflaton, and the tree-level Newton's gravity law between two massive point particles surrounded by a spherically symmetric distribution of the inflaton, which can reproduce the Tully-Fisher relation and explain the flat rotation curves of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Rapidly rotating Population III stellar models as a source of primary nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first stars might have been fast rotators. This would have important consequences for their radiative, mechanical and chemical feedback. We discuss the impact of fast initial rotation on the evolution of massive Population III models and on their nitrogen and oxygen stellar yields. We explore the evolution of Population III stars with initial masses in the range of 9Msol &lt; Mini &lt; 120Msol starting with an initial rotation on the Zero Age Main Sequence equal to 70% of the critical one. We find that with the physics of rotation considered here, our rapidly-rotating Population III stellar models do not follow a homogeneous evolution. They lose very little mass in case mechanical winds are switched on when the surface rotation becomes equal or larger than the critical velocity. Impact on the ionising flux appears modest when compared to moderately-rotating models. Fast rotation favours, in models with initial masses above ~20Msol, the appearance of a very extended intermediate convective zone around the H-burning shell during the core He-burning phase. This shell has important consequences on the sizes of the He- and CO-cores and thus impacts the final fate of stars. Moreover, it has a strong impact on nucleosynthesis boosting the production of primary 14N. Fast initial rotation impacts significantly the chemical feedback of Population III stars. Observations of extremely metal-poor stars and/or starbursting regions are essential to provide constraints on the properties of the first stars.</description>
