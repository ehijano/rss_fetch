      <title>Constraints on an optical counterpart for the long-period radio transient GPM J1839-10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long period radio transients (LPTs) are periodic radio sources showing pulsed emission on timescales from minutes to hours. The underlying sources behind this emission are currently unclear. There are two leading candidates: neutron stars or white dwarfs. Neutron stars could emit at LPT timescales as magnetars, binaries, or precessing sources. White dwarfs on the other hand have only been observed to emit in radio as binary systems with companions that provide charged particles through their wind. A key distinction is that an optical counterpart is much more likely in the white dwarf scenario. GPM J1839-10 is an LPT with a radio period of 21 min for which the white dwarf scenario has been favoured, but no optical counterpart is confirmed. Using HiPERCAM, a high-speed multi-colour photometer that observes simultaneously in ugriz filters, we probe the existence of a white dwarf in GPM J1839-10. We do not directly detect a white dwarf, but cannot rule out its presence given the uncertain distance and reddening of GPM J1839-10. On the other hand, we find evidence in our data for periodic behaviour in harmonics of the radio period, as expected from the white dwarf scenario.</description>

      <title>The elusive chase for the first RR Lyr star in a binary system: the case of KIC 2831097</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of RR Lyr stars in binary systems is an atypical fact when we compared it to other classes of variables. Therefore, it has become a challenge for observers to detect an RR Lyr variable in a binary system. The RR Lyr variable KIC 2831097 was one of the most promising candidates. The phases of maximum brightness in the Kepler photometry showed a regular variation superimposed on a parabolic trend. These variations in the times of maximum brightness (Tmax ) were interpreted as a possible light-time travel effect (LTTE) in a wide binary and a fast evolutionary change in the period. We planned two spectroscopic runs with the FIES instrument mounted at the NOT to test the hypothesis of binarity. The observations were programmed at the predicted quadratures of the orbit. The GEOS collaboration complemented the spectroscopic survey by a photometric one. We also analysed Gaia time series and intensive TESS photometry. The RV curves obtained at the quadratures show the same mean RV (-203 km/s), which rules the possibility of an LTTE out. KIC 2831097 is a single high-velocity metal-poor RRc star belonging to the Galactic halo. We revisited Kepler photometry and detected a weak Blazhko effect consisting of an oscillation of only 1.1% of the period in about 50 d. We also analysed the TESS photometry of Kepler-1601, whose photometry is contaminated by KIC 2831097. In total, we collected 3624 times of maximum brightness. Linear ephemerides cannot fit the whole dataset, but only parts of them. The period shows a tendency to decrease in value, as if it were an evolutionary effect, but not at a constant rate.</description>

      <title>Separating Photospheric and Starspot Magnetic Fields in Pre-Main-Sequence Stars Using IGRINS Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields in pre main sequence stars regulate angular momentum evolution, drive magnetic activity, and modify stellar structure, yet their surface distributions remain poorly constrained. Traditional single component Zeeman broadening analyses typically yield mean field strengths of 2-4 kG, sometimes exceeding the photospheric equipartition limit, and assume complete magnetic coverage. These assumptions conflict with evidence that strong fields are concentrated in cool starspots. Here we present the first systematic separation of photospheric and starspot magnetic field strengths in PMS stars, using high resolution R=45000 H and K band spectra from the Raw and Reduced IGRINS Archive. By modeling temperature and magnetic field strength simultaneously for a vetted sample of 33 Class II-III young stellar objects, we find median photospheric field strengths of 1.2 kG and median spot field strengths over two times stronger at 2.56 kG, resolving the apparent super equipartition tension and removing the need for a unity magnetic filling factor. Our results show that PMS surfaces are permeated by concentrated, kG strength spot fields covering 27-83% of the visible hemisphere. This two component framework offers a physically motivated means to reconcile spectroscopic and imaging based magnetic diagnostics and enables large scale magnetic population studies across young clusters and star forming regions.</description>

      <title>Blue Stragglers and Friends: Initial Evolutionary Pathways in Close Low-Mass Binaries: Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scope of this literature review is observations of the products of first-stage evolution for binaries having components with M &lt; 2 $M_\odot$. A taxonomy for these products comprises dwarfs ("blue stragglers"), giants ("yellow stragglers"), subdwarf B stars, and giant-like stars ("sub-subgiants" and "red stragglers"). This literature review is organized according to this taxonomy within three distinct environments: open star clusters, globular star clusters, and the Galactic field.
  This literature review is the Supplemental Material for Blue Stragglers and Friends: Initial Evolutionary Pathways in Close Low-Mass Binaries (Mathieu &amp; Pols, 2025, ARAA, 63:467-512, doi: www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-astro-071221-054402). It is intended to support and expand on Section 3 of the main text of this Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, where an integrated perspective on the common and contrasting astrophysical properties of these binary evolution products is provided. Figures used in the main text to highlight key observational results are referenced in this literature review.
  The closing date of this review is January 17, 2025, with some citations subsequently updated.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Nanoflare Energy and Frequency through Field Line Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of a 3D MHD simulation of a subset of the magnetic flux in an active region. The simulation models the generation of nanoflares and response of the plasma to imposed photospheric motions. Our study focuses on characterizing the energy distribution and occurrence frequency of the nanoflares in the simulation that self-consistently heat the corona. This field line based analysis reveals that the nanoflare energy distribution (energy per unit cross sectional area) follows a log-normal profile, where low energy nanoflares are significantly more prevalent than those with high energy. When compared with the plasma cooling time, different energy nanoflares tend to repeat with different frequencies. Low energy nanoflares repeat at high frequencies, while high energy nanoflares repeat at low frequencies. However, the thermal evolution of plasma along individual field lines is governed predominantly by the high energy nanoflares. These findings provide critical insights into the role of small-scale magnetic reconnection events in heating the solar corona.</description>

      <title>HWO Target Stars and Systems: A Prioritized Community List of Potential Stellar Targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory's ExoEarth Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HWO Target Stars and Systems 2025 (TSS25) list is a community-developed catalog of potential stellar targets for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) in its survey to directly image Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. The TSS25 list categorizes potential HWO targets into priority tiers based on their likelihood to be surveyed and the necessity of obtaining observations of their stellar properties prior to the launch of the mission. This target list builds upon previous efforts to identify direct imaging targets and incorporates the results of multiple yield calculations assessing the science return of current design concepts for HWO. The TSS25 list identifies a sample of target stars that have a high probability to be observed by HWO (Tiers 1 and 2), independent of assumptions about the mission's final architecture. These stars should be the focus of community precursor science efforts in order to mitigate risks and maximize the science output of HWO. This target list is publicly available and is a living catalog that will be continually updated leading up to the mission.</description>

      <title>The SOMA Atomic Outflow Survey. I. An Atomic OI and Highly Ionized OIII Outflow from Massive Protostar G11.94-00.62</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars regulate galaxy evolution and star formation through their powerful physical and chemical feedback, but their formation remains poorly understood. Accretion powered outflows can provide important diagnostics of massive star formation. We present first results from the SOMA Atomic Outflow Survey, a far-infrared massive star formation survey using the FIFI-LS spectrometer on SOFIA. We report detection of [OIII] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ emission at 52 $\mu$m from the massive protostar G11.94-0.62, tracing highly ionized gas. We also detect [OI] $^3P_2\rightarrow^3P_1$ and $^3P_1\rightarrow^3P_0$ at 63 and 145 $\mu$m tracing atomic gas, as well as CO $J=14\rightarrow13$ at 186 $\mu$m from highly excited molecular gas. The [OIII] and [OI] lines exhibit large line widths ($\sim400$ and $\sim40-80$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively) and their morphologies are consistent with a wide-angle bipolar outflow. Molecular tracers ($^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, C$^{18}$O, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH) observed with ALMA also suggest a self-consistent outflow morphology. Ionized nebula/PDR modeling imply an ionized outflow mass flux of $\sim8\times10^{-5}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and an atomic outflow mass flux of $\sim5\times10^{-6}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, while the molecular outflow traced by CO has an implied mass flux of $\sim3\times10^{-4}\:M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The mass and momentum flux in the ionized outflow is consistent with the main component of the primary disk wind, while the molecular component is mainly swept-up, secondary outflow gas. We also observe G11.94-0.62 with the LBT in the near-infrared, potentially tracing the base of wide-angle outflow cavities. SED modeling implies $m_\star = 22.4^{+21}_{-11}\:M_\odot$, while the [OIII] emission implies $m_*\gtrsim30\:M_\odot$ and that the protostar is in the final stages of its accretion.</description>

      <title>Why do solar wind models get it wrong: understanding the capabilities of time-dependent solar wind simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the capabilities of time-dependent (TD) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) solar wind simulations with the coupled WSA model of the solar corona and GAMERA model of the inner heliosphere. We compare TD with steady state (SS) simulations and with in situ data from multiple spacecraft (Earth, STEREO-A, PSP). We show that TD predictions, although better than SS predictions, substantially mispredict the solar wind at different heliospheric locations. We identified three reasons for that: (1) the uncalibrated WSA velocity formula used to generate solar wind velocities at the inner boundary of a heliospheric domain, (2) the extraction of the WSA boundary conditions for input into MHD models very high in the corona, and (3) the abrupt and partial emergence of active regions from the solar east limb. Evaluation of one year of TD predictions at Earth and STEREO-A locations shows that by tuning accordingly the WSA relationship when used with MHD models, and by extracting the WSA boundary conditions lower in the corona (at 5 Rs instead of 21.5 Rs), can lead to improved predictions. However, the abrupt emergence of active regions from the east limb of the Sun which can highly disrupt the magnetic field topology in the corona, is a difficult task to deal with since complete knowledge of the conditions on the solar far side is not currently available. Solar Orbiter Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) data can help mitigate this effect, however, unless we get a 4pi view of the Sun we will be unable to completely address it.</description>

      <title>von K\'arm\'an--Howarth Similarity of Spatial Correlations and the Distribution of Correlation Lengths in Solar Photospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the Sun's photospheric magnetic field are the primary source of the turbulence that can heat and accelerate the solar atmosphere, and thus play an important role in the production and evolution of the solar wind that permeates the heliosphere. A key parameter that characterizes this turbulence is the correlation scale of fluctuations, which determines the injection of turbulent energy into the plasma and influences the diffusive transport of solar energetic particles. This study employs magnetogram data acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory to characterize an ensemble of spatial autocorrelation functions (ACFs) of magnetic fluctuations in the photosphere. It is shown that the two-point ACFs satisfy the similarity-decay hypothesis of von K\'arm\'an and Howarth, a fundamental property of turbulent systems: following a rescaling of the ACFs by energy and correlation lengths, a quasi-universal functional form is obtained demonstrating exponential decay of correlations. The probability distribution function of transverse correlation lengths (\(\lambda\)) is shown to be approximately log-normal. A mosaic of the spatial distribution of \(\lambda\) over the photosphere is presented; the ``quiet Sun'' tends to have \(\lambda\sim 1500\) km (albeit with a wide distribution), which is close to the scale of solar granulation; systematically longer lengths are associated with active regions. A positive correlation is observed between mean magnetic field magnitude and \(\lambda\), and empirical fits are derived to quantify this relationship. These results improve our understanding of the nature of turbulence in the solar photosphere and the origin of coronal and solar-wind turbulence, while providing observational constraints for models that describe the transport of turbulence from solar and stellar photospheres into their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Heating in the Sub-Alfv\'enic Solar Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless dissipation of turbulence is important for heating plasmas in astrophysical, space physics, and laboratory environments, controlling energy, momentum and particle transport. We analyze Parker Solar Probe observations to understand the collisionless heating of the sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind, which is connected to the solar corona. Our results show that linear resonant heating through parallel-propagating cyclotron waves cannot account for turbulent dissipation in sub-Alfv\'enic region, which observations suggest may dissipate turbulence at distances further from the Sun. Instead, we find that stochastic heating can account for the observed ion energization; however, because the dominant contributions arise from infrequent, large-amplitude events, turbulent intermittency must be explicitly incorporated. These observations directly connect stochastic heating via breaking of the proton magnetic moment with the intermittent and inhomogeneous heating of turbulence reported in many previous studies. Our identification of stochastic heating as a dynamic mechanism responsible for intermittent heating of the solar wind has significant implications for turbulent dissipation in the lower corona, other astrophysical environments, and laboratory plasma.</description>

      <title>Galactic chemical evolution of short-lived radioactive isotopes produced by explosive nucleosynthesis: $^{60}$Fe and $^{53}$Mn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several short-lived radionuclides (SLRs) are know to have existed in the early Solar System (ESS). These species, which typically decay with half-lives of the order of a few million years, can be used to probe the timescale of events preceding the birth of the Sun. We investigate the ESS origin of $^{53}$Mn, produced by core-collapse (CCSNe) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and $^{60}$Fe, produced exclusively by CCSNe. We model the evolution of the radioactive-to-stable abundance ratios of these SLRs with a galactic chemical evolution (GCE) framework accounting for different supernova yields, SN Ia delay times, and other galactic features $(K)$. A further set of models are calculated assuming that SN Ia did not contribute any $^{53}$Mn to the ESS. The predicted ratios are compared to meteoritic ratios to derive a distribution of solar isolation times that includes uncertainties due to stochastic chemical enrichment and precision of the ESS values. The isolation times are then compared to those of $^{107}$Pd and $^{182}$Hf calculated in previous work. A self-consistent solution can be found within the current uncertainties, especially when using the GCE setups with $K = 1.6$ and 2.3, although the maximum likelihood for the \iso{60}Fe distribution is typically $\sim 4-5$ Myr shorter than for \iso{53}Mn. The predicted \iso{60}Fe/\iso{53}Mn ratio, instead, is completely inconsistent with the ESS value; this could be resolved using a larger fraction of faint CCSNe than usually considered in GCE models.</description>

      <title>PENELLOPE VIII: Revisiting empirical relations to measure accretion luminosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accretion luminosity (Lacc) in young, low-mass stars is crucial for understanding stellar formation, but direct measurements are often hindered by limited spectral coverage and challenges in UV-excess modeling. Empirical relations linking Lacc to various accretion tracers are widely used to overcome these limitations. This work revisits these empirical relations using the PENELLOPE dataset, evaluating their applicability across different star-forming regions and to accreting young objects other than Classical T Tauri Stars (CTTSs). We analyzed the PENELLOPE VLT/X-Shooter dataset of 64 CTTSs, measuring fluxes of several accretion tracers and adopting the stellar and accretion parameters derived from PENELLOPE works. We supplemented our analysis with the ODYSSEUS HST data set, which covers a wider spectral range in NUV bands. We compared the Lacc values obtained in the PENELLOPE and ODYSSEUS surveys finding statistically consistent results. Our analysis confirms that existing empirical relations, previously derived for the Lupus sample, provide reliable Lacc estimates for CTTSs in several other star-forming regions. We revisit empirical relations for accretion tracers in our dataset, based on HST-fit, with coefficients which are consistent within 1sigma with XS-fit results for most lines. We also propose a method to estimate extinction using these relations and investigate the empirical relations for Brackett lines (Br8 to Br21). The Lacc vs Lline empirical relations can be successfully used for statistical studies of accretion on young forming objects in different star-forming regions. These relations also offer a promising approach to independently estimate extinction in CTTSs. We confirm that near-infrared lines (PaB and BrG) reliably trace Lacc in high accretors, making them valuable tools for probing accretion properties of high accreting young stars not accessible in the UVB.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundances in the disk around T Chamaeleontis (T Cha): PAH sizes, ionization fraction, and mass during JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The T Tauri star T Cha is known to have a protoplanetary disk with a dust gap separating the inner and outer disk regions. The mid-IR JWST spectrum of T Cha show multiple prominent aromatic infrared bands (AIBs) around 6.2, 8.1, and 11.3 $\mu$m. AIBs are commonly accepted as the emission stemming from PAH molecules. We aim to characterize the PAHs giving rise to the AIBs observed in the JWST spectrum of T Cha. Our objective is to estimate the PAH abundances, in terms of their sizes, ionization fraction, and mass, in the disk of T Cha. We perform spectral fitting of the observed AIBs to identify the possible underlying PAH emission components. We transfer the stellar radiation through a parametric disk model of T Cha in order to reproduce the mid-IR spectrum, optical photometric fluxes, and mm continuum band fluxes of T Cha. We include stochastically heated PAH dust grains in our model to simulate the AIBs, and hence estimate the PAH abundances from the modelling. We use the results from previous observations and modelling efforts to reduce our model degeneracies. We estimate the PAH abundances in T Cha self-consistently, with other important disk parameters. The overall disk morphology - an inner and an outer disk separated by a dust gap - derived in this work is consistent with the previous results from Spitzer, VLT, and ALMA observations. PAHs are located only in the outer disk in our model. We estimate a population of small PAHs of &lt;30 C atoms, with an ionized PAH fraction of ~0.15. We also obtain a PAH-to-dust mass ratio of ~6.5$\times$10$^{-3}$, which amounts to ~16% of the ISM value. We predict that the outer disk should have a frontal wall with smaller dust grains limited up to $\mu$m-order to fit the slope of the continuum within 14-15 $\mu$m. We propose a possibility of sub-micron dust grains within the gap to justify an observed plateau around ~10 $\mu$m in the JWST spectrum.</description>

      <title>J-PLUS: Understanding outlier white dwarfs in the third data release via dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the white dwarf catalog derived from the third data release of the Javalambre Photometric Local Universe Survey (J-PLUS DR3), which covers 3284 deg2 using 12 optical filters. A particular focus is given to the classification of outlier sources. We applied a Bayesian fitting process to the 12-band J-PLUS photometry of white dwarf candidates from Gaia EDR3. The derived parameters were effective temperature, surface gravity, and parallax. We used theoretical models from H- and He-dominated atmospheres, with priors applied to parallax and spectral type. From the posteriors, we derived the probability of an H-dominated atmosphere and of calcium absorption for each source. Outliers were identified as sources with chi2 &gt; 23.2, indicating significant deviations from the best-fitting model. We analyzed the residuals from the fits using the UMAP technique, which enables the classification of outliers into distinct categories. The catalog includes 14844 white dwarfs with r &lt; 20 mag and 1 &lt; parallax &lt; 100 mas, with 72% of the sources lacking spectroscopic (R &gt; 500) classification. The application of UMAP identified three main types of outliers: random measurement fluctuations (391 sources), metal-polluted white dwarfs (98 sources), and two-component systems (282 sources). The last category also includes white dwarfs with strong carbon absorption lines. We validated the J-PLUS classifications by comparison with spectroscopy from SDSS and DESI, and with Gaia BP/RP spectra, confirming a one-to-one correspondence between J-PLUS photometric and spectroscopic classifications. The J-PLUS DR3 white dwarf catalog provides a robust dataset for statistical studies. The use of dimensionality reduction techniques enhances the identification of peculiar objects, making this catalog a valuable resource for the selection of interesting targets such as metal-polluted white dwarfs or binary systems.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Orbit of the Young Substellar Companion GQ Lup B from High-Resolution Spectroscopy and VLTI/GRAVITY Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the orbits of giant planets is critical for testing planet formation models, particularly at wide separations greater than 10 au where traditional core accretion becomes inefficient. However, constraining orbits at these separations has been challenging because of sparse orbital coverage and degeneracies in the orbital parameters. We use existing high-resolution spectroscopic measurements from CRIRES+ (R ~ 100000), astrometric data from SPHERE, NACO, and ALMA, and new high-precision GRAVITY astrometry to refine the orbit of GQ Lup B, a ~30 M_J companion at ~100 au, in a system that also hosts a circumstellar disk and a wide companion, GQ Lup C. Including radial velocity data significantly improves orbital constraints by breaking the degeneracy between inclination and eccentricity that affects astrometry-only fits for long-period companions. This work is among the first to combine high-precision astrometry with the companion's relative radial velocity to achieve improved orbital constraints. The eccentricity is refined from e = 0.47 (+0.14, -0.16) with GRAVITY alone to e = 0.35 (+0.10, -0.09) when RVs and GRAVITY data are combined. The orbit is misaligned by 63 (+6, -14) deg relative to the circumstellar disk and 52 (+19, -24) deg relative to the host star spin axis, and is more consistent (34 (+6, -13) deg) with the inclination of the wide tertiary companion GQ Lup C disk. These results support a formation scenario for GQ Lup B consistent with cloud fragmentation and highlight the power of combining companion RV constraints with interferometric astrometry to probe the dynamics and formation of wide-orbit substellar companions.</description>

      <title>Exciting Stellar Eccentricity in Gaia BH3 via a Hidden Black Hole Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that the high eccentricity of the stellar orbit in Gaia BH3 system could be excited through a secular resonance effect if the inner dark object is, in effect, a tight and eccentric black hole binary (BHB). During the orbital decay of the inner BHB, the apsidal precession rate of the inner binary matches that of the outer stellar orbit, and this resonance advection can drive the outer eccentricity into some extreme values. For a Gaia BH3-like system, we show that a near equal-mass ($q=0.8$) BHB with an initial semi-major axis of 1--3 au and an initial eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.95$ is able to excite the outer orbit to the observed value, leaving a current BHB with semi-major axis 0.25--0.5 au and eccentricity $\sim 0.8$. The eccentric inner BHB imprints two observable signatures on the outer star: (1) short-term RV modulations with an amplitude $\lesssim 100$ m/s and (2) long-term apsidal precession with a rate $\lesssim 0.1^{\circ}$/yr. Although neither of these is detected in the currently available astrometry and RV data, we show that these signals are detectable with the full Gaia astrometry data and dedicated high-precision and/or long-term RV observations. Our work provides a new perspective on the dynamical formation of Gaia BH3, and the methodology is readily applicable to similar systems such as HD 130298, Gaia BH1, and Gaia BH2.</description>

      <title>Modelling the effect of stellar metallicity on the XUV evolution of low-mass stars and its impact on exoplanet atmospheres/habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how exoplanet atmospheres evolve is a key question in the context of habitability. One key process governing this evolution is atmospheric evaporation by stellar X-ray and EUV emission (collectively, XUV). As such, the evolution of exoplanet atmospheres is closely tied to the evolution of the host star's magnetic activity. Many studies have modelled the combined evolution of exoplanet atmospheres and their host stars. However, to date, the impact of the host star's metallicity on stellar activity/exoplanet atmosphere evolution has not been explored. In this work, we investigate how stellar metallicity affects the rotation and activity evolution of solar-like stars as well as the corresponding exoplanet atmospheric evolution. We reconfirm previous results that metal-rich stars spin down more rapidly than metal-poor stars. We also find that the XUV flux that an exoplanet in the habitable zone of its host star receives is larger when the host star is more metal-rich. As such, the atmospheres of exoplanets in the habitable zones of metal-rich stars are evaporated more rapidly than exoplanets in the habitable zones of metal-poor stars. Lastly, we find that the atmospheric evolution is most sensitive to the host star metallicity when the host star has a higher mass. In the highest mass solar-stars, the metallicity can have a larger influence on the atmospheric evolution than the initial rotation period of the star.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Webs in Stellar Radiative Zones</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotational evolution of stellar radiative zones is an old puzzle. We argue that angular momentum transport by turbulent processes induced by differential rotation is insufficient, and propose that a key role is played by ``magnetic webs." We define magnetic webs as stable magnetic configurations that enforce corotation of their coupled mass shells, and discuss their resistance to differential torques that occur in stars. Magnetic webs are naturally expected in parts of radiative zones that were formerly convective, retaining memory of extinguished dynamos. For instance, red giants with moderate masses $M\gtrsim 1.3M_\odot$ likely contain a magnetic web deposited on the main sequence during the retreat of the central convective zone. The web couples the helium core to the hydrogen envelope of the evolving red giant and thus reduces spin-up of the contracting core. The magnetic field and the resulting slower rotation of the core are both consistent with asteroseismic observations, as we illustrate with a stellar evolution model with mass $1.6M_\odot$. Evolved massive stars host more complicated patterns of convective zones that may leave behind many webs, transporting angular momentum towards the surface. Efficient web formation likely results in most massive stars dying with magnetized and slowly rotating cores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen recombination lines (HRLs) are valuable diagnostics of the physical conditions in ionized regions around high-mass stars. Understanding their broadening mechanisms and intensity trends can provide insights into the densities, temperatures, and kinematics of HII regions. We investigate the properties of ionized gas around massive protostars by analyzing hydrogen recombination lines (H-alpha and H-beta) in the Q-band. Observations were conducted using the Yebes 40m radio telescope in the Q-band (30.5~50 GHz) toward six high-mass protostars selected from the SOMA Survey (G45.12+0.13, G45.47+0.05, G28.20-0.05, G35.20-0.74, G19.08-0.29, and G31.28+0.06). The line profiles were analyzed to assess broadening mechanisms, from which electron densities and temperatures were derived. We compared our results with Q-band data from the TianMa 65m Radio Telescope (TMRT) and ALMA Band 1 Science Verification observations of Orion KL. A total of eight H-alpha (n = 51 to 58) and ten H-beta (n = 64 to 73) lines were detected toward G45.12+0.13, G45.47+0.05, and G28.20-0.05, with non-detections in the other sources. Electron densities of ~1-5$\times$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and temperatures of 8000-10000 K were derived. Orion KL shows one order of magnitude lower electron density, but a similar temperature. Notably, G45.12 and G28.20 show increasing intensity with frequency for both H-alpha and H-beta, in contrast to the decreasing trend in Orion KL. The observed line widths indicate contributions from both thermal and dynamical broadening, suggesting high-temperature ionized gas affected by turbulence, outflows, rotation, or stellar winds. Pressure broadening may also play a minor role. The contrasting intensity trends likely reflect differences in local physical conditions or radiative transfer effects, warranting further study through higher-resolution observations and modeling.</description>

      <title>PARSEC V2.0: Rotating tracks and isochrones for seven addtional metallicities in the range Z=0.0001-0.03</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PARSEC v2.0 rotating stellar tracks were previously presented for six values of metallicity from subsolar to solar values, with initial rotation rates ($\omega_\mathrm{i}$, defined as the ratio of angular velocity and its critical value) spanning from the non-rotating case to very near the critical velocity (i.e. $\omega_\mathrm{i}=0.99$), and for initial masses covering the $\sim 0.7 M_\odot$ to $14 M_\odot$ interval. Furthermore, we provided the corresponding isochrones converted into several photometric systems, for different inclination angles between the line-of-sight and the rotation axes, from $0^\circ$ (pole-on) to $90^\circ$ (equator-on). In this work, we expand this database with seven other sets of metallicity, including five sets of low metallicity ($Z=0.0001-0.002$) and two sets of super-solar values (up to $Z=0.03$). Here, we present the new stellar tracks, comprising $\sim$3\,040 tracks in total ($\sim$5\,500 including previous sets), along with the new corresponding rotating isochrones. We also introduce the possibility of creating isochrones, by interpolation, for values of rotating rates not available in the initial set of tracks. We compare a selection of our new models with rotating stellar tracks from the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code, and we assess the quality of our new tracks by fitting the colour-magnitude diagram of the open cluster NGC6067. We take advantage of the projected rotational velocity of member stars measured by Gaia to validate our results and examine the surface oxygen abundances in comparison with the observed data. All newly computed stellar tracks and isochrones are retrievable via our dedicated web databases and interfaces.</description>

      <title>Role of CME clusters and CME-CME interactions in producing sustained $\gamma$-ray emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast (V$_{\rm CME}$&gt;1000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$) coronal mass ejections (CMEs) capable of accelerating protons beyond 300MeV are thought to trigger hours-long sustained $\gamma$-ray emission (SGRE) after the impulsive flare phase. Meanwhile, CME-CME interactions can cause enhanced proton acceleration, increasing the fluxes of solar energetic particles. This study explores the role of fast CME interactions in SGRE production during CME clusters, which we define as a series of CMEs linked to &gt;C-class flares with waiting times &lt;$\,$1$\,$day from the same active region (AR). We focus on clusters in major CME-productive ARs (major ARs), by defining a major AR as one that produced &gt;$\,$1 CME-associated major (&gt;M-class) flare. The study identified 76 major ARs between 2011 and 2019, of which 12 produced all SGRE events. SGRE-producing ARs exhibit higher median values for the speed of their fastest CMEs (2013 vs. 775${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$) and the class of their strongest flares (X1.8 vs. M5.8), compared to SGRE-lacking ARs. They also produced relatively faster CMEs (median speed: 1418 vs. 1206.5${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$), with the SGRE-associated CMEs occurring during periods of higher CME rates than typical fast CME epochs. Twelve of 22 (54.5%) SGRE events and 5 of 7 (71.4%) long-duration (&gt;$10\,$h) SGRE events occurred during CME clusters, with high chances of CME-CME interactions. A case study on very active major ARs showed that all SGRE-associated CMEs with V$_{\rm CME}\lesssim$ 2000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$ underwent CME-CME interactions within 10$\,$R$_\odot$, while SGRE-associated CMEs faster than 3000${\rm \,km\,s^{-1}}$ did not undergo interactions.</description>

Abstract: This chapter provides an overview of the magnetic activity of the Sun and stars, discussing its underlying physical origin, manifestations, and fundamental role in exoplanet studies. It begins with a summary of the Sun's magnetic activity from the surface towards the outer atmospheric layers, highlighting features such as sunspots, faculae, chromospheric structures, and their temporal modulation known as the activity cycle. These phenomena are sustained throughout the lifetime of the Sun by the magnetic dynamo, which is driven by differential rotation and convective flows. Furthermore, extending these concepts to other stars, the chapter examines the diagnostics that are typically employed to track and quantify the magnetic activity level of stars, and it reviews spectropolarimetry, an observational technique with which to characterise stellar magnetic fields. We finally outline results from both observations and theoretical modelling of stellar activity across distinct spectral types, and we describe the variety of methods used to search for stellar activity cycles, underscoring the multi-wavelength nature of this field of research.</description>

      <title>Supernova axions convert to gamma-rays in magnetic fields of progenitor stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been established that axions could have been produced within the nascent proto-neutron-star formed following the type II supernova SN1987A, escaped the star due to their weak interactions, and then converted to gamma-rays in the Galactic magnetic fields; the non-observation of a gamma-ray flash coincident with the neutrino burst leads to strong constraints on the axion-photon coupling for axion masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV. In this work we use SN1987A to constrain higher mass axions, all the way to $m_a \sim 10^{-3}$ eV, by accounting for axion production from the Primakoff process, nucleon bremsstrahlung, and pion conversion along with axion-photon conversion on the still-intact magnetic fields of the progenitor star. Moreover, we show that gamma-ray observations of the next Galactic supernova, leveraging the magnetic fields of the progenitor star, could detect quantum chromodynamics axions for masses above roughly 50 $\mu$eV, depending on the supernova. We propose a new full-sky gamma-ray satellite constellation that we call the GALactic AXion Instrument for Supernova (GALAXIS) to search for such future signals along with related signals from extragalactic neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Limits on New Lorentz-violating Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain novel constraints on new scalar fields interacting with Standard Model fermions through Lorentz-violating couplings, bridging searches for scalar particles and Lorentz-symmetry tests. These constraints arise from torsion-balance experiments, magnetometer searches, and an excessive energy loss in Red Giant stars. Torsion-balance experiments impose stringent constraints, benefitting from large macroscopic sources including the Sun and Earth. Magnetometer-based searches, which detect pseudo-magnetic fields through spin precession, offer additional limiting power to low-mass scalar fields. Meanwhile, observations of Red Giant stars place strong limits on additional energy loss mechanisms, extending these constraints to higher scalar mass ranges and a wider range of Lorentz-violating couplings. Combining data from laboratory experiments and astrophysical observations, this approach strengthens constraints on Lorentz-violating interactions and paves the way for future investigations into physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Eclipse Timing Variations of Circumbinary Substellar Objects in TESS Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circumbinary planets and brown dwarfs form in complex gravitational environments, offering insights into formation, orbital stability, and habitability prospects. However, they remain underrepresented, with only 60 confirmed or candidate systems known. In this work, we leverage TESS photometry to search for circumbinary companions through eclipse timing variations (ETVs), analyzing 152 detached eclipsing binaries. By modeling eclipse timings, we identify 37 systems with significant periodic signals, 19 of which have false alarm probabilities below 0.01. One system, TIC 142979644, emerges as a promising candidate to host a circumbinary substellar companion, with estimated masses of $18.8~M_{\rm J}$ and $11.1~M_{\rm J}$ from different methods. Simulations using synthetic ETVs indicate a 5\% recovery rate for circumbinary brown dwarfs and 0.1\% for Jupiter-like planets, with median masses of $56.6^{+16.5}_{-23.4}~M_{\rm J}$ and periods of $1404^{+1361}_{-953}$ days. Our simulations show that the smallest detectable mass is $1.6~M_{\rm J}$ at a period of 1860 days and confirm that ETV methods are effective in detecting misaligned systems. In the absence of a detection, we set an upper limit of 40\% on the occurrence rate of circumbinary brown dwarfs at the 2$\sigma$ confidence level. In contrast, a confirmed single detection would imply an occurrence rate of 13.08\%. These constraints are consistent with previous abundance estimates for circumbinary brown dwarfs ($\lesssim6.5\%$). As most circumbinary substellar companions detected through ETVs are found around post-common envelope binaries, our recovery rate of 0.83\% in their progenitors implies that even a single detection would strongly favor a first-generation origin.</description>

      <title>StrCGAN: A Generative Framework for Stellar Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce StrCGAN (Stellar Cyclic GAN), a generative model designed to enhance low-resolution astrophotography images. Our goal is to reconstruct high-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task that is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of small-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional models such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but are restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and galaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with three key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial correlations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR) domains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar morphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning optical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain consistent across spectral bands. Together, these components allow StrCGAN to generate reconstructions that are not only visually sharper but also physically consistent, outperforming standard GAN models in the task of astrophysical image enhancement.</description>
