      <title>Impact of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and anisotropy on topological Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron transport combined with magnetism has gained more attention to the spintronics community in the last few decades. Among them, the topological Hall effect, which arises due to the emergent magnetic field of a non-trivial object, is found to be a promising tool for probing a skyrmion. A sizeable interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI) with reduced effective anisotropy can stabilize skyrmions in thin films. Recently, a large iDMI has been predicted in Pt/Co/Re thin film. Thus, we have studied the effect of iDMI and anisotropy on the topological Hall effect (THE) in perpendicularly magnetized Pt/Co/X (X=Ta, Re) thin films. The presence of skyrmions is confirmed via THE as well as magnetic force microscope (MFM) imaging. Two different natures of THE signals have been explained in the two different types of samples via micromagnetic simulations. It has been found that effective anisotropy and DMI interaction contribute significantly to decide the different topological Hall behavior.</description>

      <title>Current progress in corrosion of multi principal element alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whilst multi-principal element alloys (MPEAs) remain a promising class of materials owing to several attractive mechanical properties, their corrosion performance is also unique. In this concise review, we present an emerging overview of some of the general features related to MPEA corrosion, following a decade of work in the field. This includes highlighting some of the key aspects related to the electrochemical phenomena in MPEA corrosion, and the relevant future works required for a holistic mechanistic understanding. In addition, a comprehensive database of the reported corrosion performance of MPEAs is presented, based on works reported to date. The database is assembled to also allow users to undertake machine learning or their own data analysis, with a parsed representation of alloy composition, test electrolyte, and corrosion related parameters.</description>

      <title>Magnetic evolution of Cr$_2$Te$_3$ epitaxially grown on graphene with post-growth annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional and van der Waals ferromagnets are ideal platform to study low dimensional magnetism and proximity effects in van der Waals heterostructures. Their ultimate two dimensional character offers also the opportunity to easily adjust their magnetic properties using strain or electric fields. Among 2D ferromagnets, the Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ compounds with $x$=0-1 are very promising because their magnetic properties depend on the amount of self-intercalated Cr atoms between pure CrTe$_2$ layers and the Curie temperature (T$_C$) can reach room temperature for certain compositions. Here, we investigate the evolution of the composition, structural and magnetic properties of thin Cr$_{1.33}$Te$_2$ (Cr$_2$Te$_3$) films epitaxially grown on graphene upon annealing. We observe a transition above 450{\deg}C from the Cr$_{1.33}$Te$_2$ phase with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and a T$_C$ of 180 K to a composition close to Cr$_{1.39}$Te$_2$ with in-plane magnetic anisotropy and a T$_C$ of 240-250 K. This phase remains stable up to 650{\deg}C above which a pure Cr film starts to form. This work demonstrates the complex interplay between intercalated Cr, lattice parameters and magnetic properties in Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ compounds.</description>

      <title>A high-temperature multiferroic Tb$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric mutual control in multiferroics, which is the electric control of magnetization, or reciprocally the magnetic control of polarization has attracted much attention because of its possible applications to spintronic devices, multi-bit memories, and so on. While the required working temperature for the practical application is much higher than room temperature, which ensures stable functionality at room temperature, the reported working temperatures were at most around room temperature. Here, we demonstrated magnetic control of ferroelectric polarization at 432 K in ferroelectric and ferroelastic Tb$_2$(MoO$_4$)$_3$, in which the polarity of ferroelectric polarization is coupled to the orthorhombic strain below the transition temperature 432 K. The paramagnetic but strongly magnetoelastic Tb$^{3+}$ magnetic moments enable the magnetic control of ferroelectric and ferroelastic domains; the ferroelectric polarization is controlled depending on whether the magnetic field is applied along [110] or [$\bar{1}$10]. This result may pave a new avenue for designing high-temperature multiferroics.</description>

      <title>The mechanisms behind extreme susceptibility of photon avalanche emission to quenching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photon avalanche (PA) process that emerges in lanthanide-doped crystals yields a threshold and highly nonlinear (of the power law order &gt; 5) optical response to photoexcitation. PA emission is the outcome of excited-state absorption combined with a cross-relaxation process, which creates positive and efficient energy looping. In consequence, this combination of processes should be highly susceptible to small perturbations in energy distribution and thus can be hindered by other competitive 'parasite' processes such as energy transfer (ET) to quenching sites. Although luminescence quenching is a well-known phenomenon, the exact mechanisms of susceptibility of PA to resonant energy transfer (RET) remain poorly understood limiting practical applications. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may pave the way to new areas of PA exploitation. This study focuses on the investigation of the LiYF$_{4}$:3%Tm$^{3+}$ PA system co-doped with $Nd^{3+}$ acceptor ions, which was found to impact both the looping and emitting levels and thus to effectively disrupt PA emission, causing an increase in the PA threshold ($I_{th}$) and a decrease in PA nonlinearity ($S_{max}$). Our complementary modelling results revealed that the ET from the looping level increased $I_{th}$ and $S_{max}$, whereas the ET from the emitting level diminished $S_{max}$ and the final emission intensity. Ultimately, significant PA emission quenching demonstrates a high relative sensitivity ($S_{R}$) to infinitesimal amounts of $Nd^{3+}$ acceptors, highlighting the potential for PA to be utilized as an ultra-sensitive, fluorescence-based reporting mechanism that is suitable for the detection and quantification of physical and biological phenomena or reactions.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetic Polar Metallic phase in Ultra-Thin Epitaxially-Strained RuO2 Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism refers to a wide class of compensated magnetic orders featuring magnetic sublattices with opposite spins related by rotational symmetry rather than inversion or translational operations, resulting in non-trivial spin splitting and high-order multipolar orders. Here, by combining theoretical analysis, electrical transport, X-ray and optical spectroscopies, and nonlinear optical measurements, we establish a phase diagram in hybrid molecular beam epitaxy-grown RuO2/TiO2 (110) films, mapping the broken symmetries along the altermagnetic/electronic/structural phase transitions as functions of film thickness and temperature. This phase diagram features a novel altermagnetic metallic polar phase in strained 2 nm samples, extending the concept of multiferroics to altermagnetic systems. These results provide a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism upon epitaxial heterostructure design for emergent novel phases with multifunctionalities.</description>

      <title>Extreme high lattice-misfit superalloys with regular cubic L12 particles and excellent creep resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In novel Co and CoNi based superalloys, the creep resistance is limited at high temperatures due to low lattice misfit and solvus temperature. In this study, we combined the advantages of Co-Ti (high lattice misfit and solvus temperature) and Co-Al based superalloys (cuboidal precipitates) by using Ti to substitute Al in alloys of Co-30Ni-(12.5-x)Al-xTi-2.5Mo-2.5W (at.%) composition. With high Ti content, the alloys obtained extreme high lattice misfit (bigger than 1.3 %) and solvus temperature (bigger than 1150 degree). During aging at 900 degree, alloys with high Ti/Al ratio exhibited a lower gamma prime precipitate coarsening rate resulting from their lower gamma prime and gamma interfacial energy and higher lattice misfit. In addition, high Ti/Al ratio brought higher gamma prime volume fraction and excellent mechanical properties, such as higher yield stress and better creep resistance. However, at high temperature of 1100 degree, the cubic gamma prime phase was decomposed into deleterious Eta phase with D024 structure if the Ti/Al ratio exceeded 1. Based on this, we outreached new alloys design with a high content of Cr and Ta and appropriate Ti/Al ratio, i.e., Ti/Al ratio is smaller than 1. The newly designed alloys still have high solvus temperature (bigger than 1200 degree) and exhibit high lattice misfit (bigger than 1.2 %) as Co-12Ti (at.%) superalloys but more regular cubic gamma prime precipitates and significantly better creep resistance than superalloys Co-9Al-9W and Co-9Al-9W-2Ti at 850 and 950 degree. Nevertheless, compared with creep resistance of Ni based superalloys, our newly designed alloys still need to be further improved, especially in the 1000 and 1050 degree range.</description>

      <title>Strong electrostatic control of excitonic features in MoS$_2$ by a free-standing ultrahigh-$\kappa$ ferroelectric perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the electrostatic control of photoluminescence of monolayer MoS$_2$ at room temperature via integration of free-standing BaTiO$_3$ (BTO), a ferroelectric perovskite oxide, layers. We show that the use of BTO leads to highly tunable exciton emission of MoS$_2$ in a minimal range of gate voltages, effectively controlling the neutral excitons to charged excitons (trions) conversion. Due to BTO's ferroelectric polarization-induced doping we observe large peak emission shifts as well as a large and tunable A trion binding energy in the range of 40-100 meV. To further investigate the efficacy of electrostatic control, we compared our measurements with those carried out when the BTO is replaced by a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) dielectric layer of comparable thickness, confirming BTO's superior gating properties and thus lower power consumption. Additionally, we take advantage of the ferroelectric switching of BTO by fabricating devices where the BTO layer is decoupled from the gate electrode with a SiO$_2$ layer. Choosing to isolate the BTO allows us to induce large remanent behavior of MoS$_2$'s excitonic features, observing hysteretic behavior in the peak energy ratio between A exciton and its trion, as well as hysteretic behavior in the doping-related trion energy shift. This study illustrates the rich physics involved in combining free-standing complex oxide layers with two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Performance Parameters of Infra-red and Visible-active MXene Photocatalysts for Water Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water splitting reactions through photocatalysis is an efficient and sustainable technique for the generation of green energy. The photocatalyst's ability to effect simultaneous generation of hydrogen and oxygen, along with efficiency in utilisation of charged carriers, conversion of solar energy to hydrogen, fast migration, and low recombination rates of carriers, are the parameters to decide its suitability in water splitting. In literature, comprehensive calculation and analysis of all these performance parameters for a potential photocatalyst are rare. In this work, we have performed first-principles-based computations to find new efficient photocatalysts from the family of Janus MXenes and assessed their performance parameters. Strain engineering has been invoked in search of new materials. Out of 14 studied materials, we find 5 materials: Sc$_{2}$COS, Zr$_{2}$COS, Hf$_{2}$COS, and ZrHfCO$_{2}$ under zero or finite tensile strain and Hf$_{2}$COSe at 6\% tensile strain meeting the requirements of simultaneous reactions to split water. The computations of various efficiency-related parameters demonstrate that Zr$_{2}$COS, Hf$_{2}$COS, and Hf$_{2}$COSe have excellent efficiencies, significantly better than the well-known photocatalysts. The origin of such performances lies in their electronic and optical properties, which are analysed systematically.</description>

      <title>Optical contrast analysis of {\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ nanoflakes on oxidized silicon wafers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\alpha}-RuCl$_3$, a narrow-band Mott insulator with large work function, offers intriguing potential as a quantum material or as a charge acceptor for electrical contacts in van der Waals devices. In this work, we perform a systematic study of the optical reflection contrast of {\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ nanoflakes on oxidized silicon wafers and estimate the accuracy of this imaging technique to assess the crystal thickness. Via spectroscopic micro-ellipsometry measurements, we characterize the wavelength-dependent complex refractive index of {\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ nanoflakes of varying thickness in the visible and near-infrared. Building on these results, we simulate the optical contrast of {\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ nanoflakes with thicknesses below 100 nm on SiO$_2$/Si substrates under different illumination conditions. We compare the simulated optical contrast with experimental values extracted from optical microscopy images and obtain good agreement. Finally, we show that optical contrast imaging allows us to retrieve the thickness of the RuCl$_3$ nanoflakes exfoliated on an oxidized silicon substrate with a mean deviation of -0.2 nm for thicknesses below 100 nm with a standard deviation of only 1 nm. Our results demonstrate that optical contrast can be used as a non-invasive, fast, and reliable technique to estimate the {\alpha}-RuCl$_3$ thickness.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocity of supercurrent along applied magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal current responses arise in a broad range of systems, from magnons and phonons to supercurrents, due to an interplay between spatial and temporal symmetry breakings. These find applications in devices, such as circulators and rectifiers, as well as in probing the interactions and states that underlie the nonreciprocity. An established symmetry argument anticipates emergence of nonreciprocal currents along a direction perpendicular to the applied magnetic field that breaks the time-reversal symmetry. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we examine the emergence of nonreciprocity in vortex-limited superconducting critical currents along an applied magnetic field. Employing London's equations for describing the Meissner response of a superconducting film, we find that an additional symmetry breaking due to a preferred vortex axis enables nonreciprocal critical currents along the applied magnetic field, consistent with the so far unexplained experimental observation. Building on our concrete theoretical model for supercurrents, we discuss a possible generalization of the prevailing symmetry consideration to encompass nonreciprocal currents along the time-reversal symmetry breaking direction.</description>

      <title>2D ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics with 2D: materials and device prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric and two-dimensional materials are both heavily investigated classes of electronic materials. This is unsurprising since they both have superlative fundamental properties and high-value applications in computing, sensing etc. In this Perspective, we investigate the research topics where 2D semiconductors and ferroelectric materials both in 2D or 3D form come together. 2D semiconductors have unique attributes due to their van der Waals nature that permits their facile integration with any other electronic or optical materials. In addition, the emergence of ferroelectricity in 2D monolayers, multilayers, and artificial structures offers further advantages since traditionally ferroelectricity has been difficult to achieve in extremely thickness scaled materials. In this perspective, we elaborate on the applications of 2D materials + ferroelectricity in non-volatile memory devices highlighting their potential for in-memory computing, neuromorphic computing, optoelectronics, and spintronics. We also suggest the challenges posed by both ferroelectrics and 2D materials, including material/device preparation, and reliable characterizations to drive further investigations at the interface of these important classes of electronic materials.</description>

      <title>Depth-resolved Characterization of Meissner Screening Breakdown in Surface Treated Niobium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report direct measurements of the magnetic field screening at the limits of the Meissner phase for two superconducting Nb samples. The samples are processed with two different surface treatments that have been developed for superconducting radio-frequency cavity applications -- a "baseline" treatment and an oxygen-doping ("O-doping") treatment. The measurements show: 1) that the screening length is significantly longer in the "O-doping" sample compared to the "baseline" sample; 2) that the screening length near the limits of the Meissner phase increases with applied field; 3) the evolution of the screening profile as the material transitions from the Meissner phase to the mixed phase; and 4) a demonstration of the absence of any screening profile for the highest applied field, indicative of the full flux entering the sample. Measurements are performed utilizing the $\beta$-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ($\beta$-NMR) technique that allows depth resolved studies of the local magnetic field within the first 100 nm of the surface. The study takes advantage of the $\beta$-SRF beamline, a new facility at TRIUMF, Canada, where field levels up to 200 mT are available parallel to the sample surface to replicate radio frequency (RF) fields near the Meissner breakdown limits of Nb.</description>

      <title>Atomic layer etching of SiO$_2$ using sequential exposures of Al(CH$_3$)$_3$ and H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On-chip photonic devices based on SiO$_2$ are of interest for applications such as microresonator gyroscopes and microwave sources. Although SiO$_2$ microdisk resonators have achieved quality factors exceeding one billion, this value remains an order of magnitude less than the intrinsic limit due to surface roughness scattering. Atomic layer etching (ALE) has potential to mitigate this scattering because of its ability to smooth surfaces to sub-nanometer length scales. While isotropic ALE processes for SiO$_2$ have been reported, they are not generally compatible with commercial reactors, and the effect on surface roughness has not been studied. Here, we report an ALE process for SiO$_2$ using sequential exposures of Al(CH$_3$)$_3$ (trimethylaluminum, TMA) and Ar/H$_2$/SF$_6$ plasma. We find that each process step is self-limiting, and that the overall process exhibits a synergy of 100%. We observe etch rates up to 0.58 \r{A} per cycle for thermally-grown SiO$_2$ and higher rates for ALD, PECVD, and sputtered SiO$_2$ up to 2.38 \r{A} per cycle. Furthermore, we observe a decrease in surface roughness by 62% on a roughened film. The residual concentration of Al and F is around 1-2%, which can be further decreased by O$_2$ plasma treatment. This process could find applications in smoothing of SiO$_2$ optical devices and thereby enabling device quality factors to approach limits set by intrinsic dissipation.</description>

      <title>Negative longitudinal resistance of monolayer graphene in the quantum Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the quantum Hall regime the charge current is carried by ideal one-dimensional edge channels where the backscattering is prohibited by topology. This results in the constant potential along the edge of the Hall bar leading to zero 4-terminal longitudinal resistance r_xx. Finite scattering between the counter-propagating edge states, when the topological protection is broken, commonly results in r_xx &gt; 0. However, a local disorder, if allowing intersection of the edge states, can result in a counter-intuitive scenario when r_xx&lt;0. In this work we report the observation and a systematic study of such unconventional negative longitudinal resistance seen in an encapsulated monolayer graphene Hall bar device measured in the quantum Hall regime. We supplement our findings with the numerical calculations which allow us to outline the conditions necessary for the appearance of negative r_xx and to exclude the macroscopic disorder (contamination bubble) as the main origin of it.</description>

      <title>Development and optimization of large-scale integration of 2D material in memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials like transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have proved to be serious candidates to replace silicon in several technologies with enhanced performances. In this respect, the two remaining challenges are the wafer scale growth of TMDs and their integration into operational devices using clean room compatible processes. In this work, two different CMOS-compatible protocols are developed for the fabrication of MoS$_2$-based memristors, and the resulting performances are compared. The quality of MoS$_2$ at each stage of the process is characterized by Raman spectroscopy and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. In the first protocol, the structure of MoS$_2$ is preserved during transfer and patterning processes. However, a polymer layer with a minimum thickness of 3 nm remains at the surface of MoS$_2$ limiting the electrical switching performances. In the second protocol, the contamination layer is completely removed resulting in improved electrical switching performances and reproducibility. Based on physico-chemical and electrical results, the switching mechanism is discussed in terms of conduction through grain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Topological flat bands in a family of multilayer graphene moir\'e lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e materials host a wealth of intertwined correlated and topological states of matter, all arising from flat electronic bands with nontrivial quantum geometry. A prominent example is the family of alternating-twist magic-angle graphene stacks, which exhibit symmetry-broken states at rational fillings of the moir\'e band and superconductivity close to half filling. Here, we introduce a second family of twisted graphene multilayers made up of twisted sheets of $M$- and $N$-layer Bernal-stacked graphene flakes. Calculations indicate that applying an electric displacement field isolates a flat and topological moir\'e conduction band that is primarily localized to a single graphene sheet below the moir\'e interface. Phenomenologically, the result is a striking similarity in the hierarchies of symmetry-broken phases across this family of twisted graphene multilayers. Our results show that this family of structures offers promising new opportunities for the discovery of exotic new correlated and topological phenomena, enabled by using the layer number to fine tune the flat moir\'e band and its screening environment.</description>

      <title>XPS analysis of molecular contamination and sp2 amorphous carbon on oxidized (100) diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficacy of oxygen (O) surface terminations on diamond is an important factor for the performance and stability for diamond-based quantum sensors and electronics. Given the wide breadth of O-termination techniques, it can be difficult to discern which method would yield the highest and most consistent O coverage. Furthermore, the interpretation of surface characterization techniques is complicated by surface morphology and purity, which if not accounted for will yield inconsistent determination of the oxygen coverage. We present a comprehensive approach to consistently prepare and analyze oxygen termination of surfaces on (100) single-crystalline diamond. We report on X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) characterization of diamond surfaces treated with six oxidation methods that include various wet chemical oxidation techniques, photochemical oxidation with UV illumination, and steam oxidation using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Our analysis entails a rigorous XPS peak-fitting procedure for measuring the functionalization of O-terminated diamond. The findings herein have provided molecular-level insights on oxidized surfaces in (100) diamond, including the demonstration of clear correlation between the measured oxygen atomic percentage and the presence of molecular contaminants containing nitrogen, silicon, and sulfur. We also provide a comparison of the sp2 carbon content with the O1s atomic percentage and discern a correlation with the diamond samples treated with dry oxidation which eventually tapers off at a max O1s atomic percentage value of 7.09 +/- 0.40%. Given these results, we conclude that the dry oxidation methods yield some of the highest oxygen amounts, with the ALD water vapor technique proving to be the cleanest technique out of all the oxidation methods explored in this work.</description>

      <title>Double glass transition in polyethylene naphthalate structural relaxation by MDSC, BDS and TSDC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an experimental study of the primary and secondary relaxations of the semi-crystalline polymer polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), by Modulated Differential Scanning Calorimetry (MDSC), Thermally Stimulated Depolarization Currents (TSDC) and Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy (BDS), and how they are affected by physical aging. Three dipolar relaxation modes can be observed: (from slowest to fastest) the primary $\alpha$ relaxation, which vitrifies at the glass transition temperature, $T_{g\alpha}$, and two secondary relaxations, named $\beta^*$ and $\beta$. MDSC results show how the secondary $\beta^*$ relaxation also vitrifies, giving rise to an additional glass transition at $T_{g\beta^*} &lt; T_{g\alpha}$. In fact, the $\alpha$ and $\beta^*$ relaxations can be considered as part of a very broad and distributed relaxation. Its main part is the primary $\alpha$ relaxation with a shoulder at the high-frequency region corresponding to a complex secondary $\beta^*$ relaxation. BDS results about the $\beta^*$ can be modeled by a main contribution ($\beta_3^*$) and two additional ones ($\beta_1^*$ and $\beta_2^*$) with a weaker dielectric strength. TSDC results show that each single mode of the relaxation has its own glass transition temperature and they are compatible with the structure inferred by BDS. This scenario gives rise to an extended glass transition dually centered in the $T_{g\beta^*} \sim 305$ K and $T_{g\alpha} \sim 387$ K. temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Chiral properties have seen increasing use in recent years, leading to the emerging fields of chiral quantum optics, plasmonics, and phononics. While these fields have achieved manipulation of the chirality of light and lattice vibrations, controlling the chirality of materials on demand has yet remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that linearly polarized phonons can be used to induce geometric chirality in achiral crystals when excited with an ultrashort laser pulse. We show that nonlinear phonon coupling quasistatically displaces the crystal structure along phonon modes that reduce the symmetry of the lattice to that of a chiral point group corresponding to a chiral crystal. By reorienting the polarization of the laser pulse, the two enantiomers can be induced selectively. Therefore, geometric chiral phonons enable the light-induced creation of chiral crystal structures and offer a pathway to engineering chiral electronic states and optical properties.</description>

Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive laws forms an emerging research area, that focuses on automatically obtaining symbolic expressions describing the constitutive behavior of solid materials from experimental data. Existing symbolic/sparse regression methods rely on the availability of libraries of material models, which are typically hand-designed by a human expert using known models as reference, or deploy generative algorithms with exponential complexity which are only practicable for very simple expressions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to constitutive law discovery relying on formal grammars as an automated and systematic tool to generate constitutive law expressions. Compliance with physics constraints is partly enforced a priori and partly empirically checked a posteriori. We deploy the approach for two tasks: i) Automatically generating a library of valid constitutive laws for hyperelastic isotropic materials; ii) Performing data-driven discovery of hyperelastic material models from displacement data affected by different noise levels. For the task of automatic library generation, we demonstrate the flexibility and efficiency of the proposed methodology in avoiding hand-crafted features and human intervention. For the data-driven discovery task, we demonstrate the accuracy, robustness and significant generalizability of the proposed methodology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) are a potential field for the energy storage of the future but are restricted by insufficient rate capability and rapid capacity degradation. Magnesium-sodium hybrid ion batteries (MSHBs) are an effective way to address these problems. Here, we report a new type of MSHBs that use layered sodium vanadate ((Na, Mn)V8O20 5H2O, Mn-NVO) cathodes coupled with an organic 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI) anode in Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. During electrochemical cycling, Mg2+ and Na+ co-participate in the cathode reactions, and the introduction of Na+ promotes the structural stability of the Mn-NVO cathode, as cleared by several ex-situ characterizations. Consequently, the Mn-NVO cathode presents great specific capacity (249.9 mAh g-1 at 300 mA g-1) and cycling (1500 cycles at 1500 mA g-1) in the Mg2+/Na+ hybrid electrolytes. Besides, full battery displays long lifespan with 10,000 cycles at 1000 mA g-1. The rate performance and cycling stability of MSHBs have been improved by an economical and scalable method, and the mechanism for these improvements was discussed.</description>

Abstract: We present theoretical observations on the topological nature of strained III-V semiconductors. By $k \cdot p$ perturbation, it can be shown that the strain-engineered conduction band hosts a Kramers-Weyl node at the $\Gamma$ point. It is theoretically shown a curated strain can create and then tune the sign of the topological charge. Furthermore, we outline experimental methods for both the realization and detection of strain-induced topological phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically report a new large family of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal sulfides $M$$_{2}$S with MXene structure in 2H and 1T phases, which we name as MSene. Twenty-four out of fifty-eight MSenes are proved to be stable. Notably, this family includes twelve superconducting (SC) materials, seven SC topological metals (SCTMs), four charge density wave (CDW) materials, and five magnetic materials including one ferromagnetic (FM) and four antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials. For example, 2H-Mo$_{2}$S is a SCTM which exhibits SC critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of 10.2 K and nontrivial topological properties; 1T-Hf$_{2}$S is a CDW material with the CDW originating from electron-phonon coupling. The CDW can be suppressed by compressive strain, leading to the emergence of superconductivity; 2H-Cr$_{2}$S and 1T-Mn$_{2}$S show FM and AFM properties, respectively. Thus, the new large family we predicted shows rich physical properties and significantly expands the repertoire of 2D materials. It serves as a novel platform for investigating the competition or coexistence of multiple orders such as SC, CDW, FM, AFM and topological orders in 2D materials.</description>

Abstract: Chiral magnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions feature a rich phase diagram with a variety of thermodynamical phases. These include helical and conical spin arrangements and topologically charged objects such as (anti)skyrmions. Crucially, due to hysteresis effects, the thermodynamical phases can co-exist at any given temperature and external magnetic field, typically leading to metastability of, e.g., the material's topological phase. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to study these effects. We compute the relative free energies of co-existing states, enabling us to determine the ground state at all values of the external parameters. We also introduce a method to estimate the activation energy, i.e. the height of the energy barrier that separates the topological phase from the ground state. This is one of the key ingredients for the determination of the skyrmion lifetime, which is relevant for technological applications. Finally, we prescribe predicting the system's evolution through any path in the space of external parameters. This can serve as a guideline to prepare the magnetic material in any desired phase or even trigger a phase transition in an experimental setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon-driven $s$-wave superconductivity is fundamentally antagonistic to uniform magnetism, and field-induced suppression of the critical temperature is one of its canonical signatures. Examples of the opposite are unique and require fortuitous cancellations and very fine parameter tuning. The recently discovered Ising superconductors violate this rule: an external magnetic field applied in a certain direction does not suppress superconductivity in an ideal, impurity-free material. We propose a simple and experimentally accessible system where the effects of spin-conserving and spin-flip scattering can be studied in a controlled way, namely NbSe$_2$ monolayers dosed with magnetic $3d$ atoms. We predict that the critical temperature is slightly increased by an in-plane magnetic field in NbSe$_2$ dosed with Cr. Due to the band spin splitting, magnetic spin-flip scattering requires a finite momentum transfer, while spin-conserving scattering does not. If the magnetic anisotropy is easy-axis, an in-plane field reorients the impurity spins and transforms spin-conserving scattering into spin-flip. The critical temperature is enhanced if the induced magnetization of NbSe$_2$ has a substantial long-range component, as is the case for Cr ions.</description>

      <title>Accurate Hyperfine Tensors for Solid State Quantum Applications: Case of the NV Center in Diamond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decoherence of point defect qubits is often governed by the electron spin-nuclear spin hyperfine interaction that can be parameterized by using ab inito calculations in principle. So far most of the theoretical works have focused on the hyperfine interaction of the closest nuclear spins, while the accuracy of the predictions for distinct nuclear spins is barely discussed. We demonstrate for the case of the NV center in diamond that the absolute relative error of the computed hyperfine parameters can exceed 100\% in VASP for weakly coupled nuclear spins. To overcome this issue, we implement an alternative method and report on significantly improved hyperfine values with $O$(1\%) relative mean error at all distances. The provided accurate hyperfine data for the NV center enables high-precision simulation of NV quantum nodes for quantum information processing and positioning of nuclear spins by comparing experimental and theoretical hyperfine data.</description>

Abstract: Silicon-Germanium heterostructures are a promising quantum circuit platform, but crucial aspects as the long-term charge dynamics and cooldown-to-cooldown variations are still widely unexplored quantitatively. In this letter we present the results of an extensive bias cooling study performed on gated silicon-germanium quantum dots with an Al2O3-dielectric. Over 80 cooldowns were performed in the course of our investigations. The performance of the devices is assessed by low-frequency charge noise measurements in the band of 200 micro Hertz to 10 milli Hertz. We measure the total noise power as a function of the applied voltage during cooldown in four different devices and find a minimum in noise at 0.7V bias cooling voltage for all observed samples. We manage to decrease the total noise power median by a factor of 6 and compute a reduced tunneling current density using Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. Furthermore, we show the variation in noise from the same device in the course of eleven different cooldowns performed under the nominally same conditions.</description>

Abstract: We construct a fast, transferable, general purpose, machine-learning interatomic potential suitable for large-scale simulations of $N_2$. The potential is trained only on high quality quantum chemical molecule-molecule interactions, no condensed phase information is used. The potential reproduces the experimental phase diagram including the melt curve and the molecular solid phases of nitrogen up to 10 GPa. This demonstrates that many-molecule interactions are unnecessary to explain the condensed phases of $N_2$. With increased pressure, transitions are observed from cubic ($\alpha-N_2$), which optimises quadrupole-quadrupole interactions, through tetragonal ($\gamma-N_2$) which allows more efficient packing, through to monoclinic ($\lambda-N_2$) which packs still more efficiently. On heating, we obtain the hcp 3D rotor phase ($\beta-N_2$) and, at pressure, the cubic $\delta-N_2$ phase which contains both 3D and 2D rotors, tetragonal $\delta^\star-N_2$ phase with 2D rotors and the rhombohedral $\epsilon-N_2$. Molecular dynamics demonstrates where these phases are indeed rotors, rather than frustrated order. The model does not support the existence of the wide range of bondlengths reported for the complex $\iota-N_2$ phase. The thermodynamic transitions involve both shifts of molecular centres and rotations of molecules. We simulate these phase transitions between finding that the onset of rotation is rapid whereas motion of molecular centres is inhibited and the cause of the observed sluggishness of transitions. Routine density functional theory calculations give a similar picture to the potential.</description>
