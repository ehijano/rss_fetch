      <title>Holographic Gaseous Lenses for High-Power Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of the world's highest energy and peak-power pulsed lasers are limited by optical damage, and further advances in high-intensity laser science will require optics that are substantially more robust than existing components. We describe here the experimental demonstration of off-axis diffractive gaseous lenses capable of withstanding extreme laser fluence and immune to cumulative damage. We used less than 8 mJ of energy from interfering ultraviolet laser pulses to holographically write millimeter-scale diffractive gas lenses into an ozone, oxygen, and carbon-dioxide gas mixture. These lenses allowed us to focus, defocus, and collimate 532-nm nanosecond laser pulses with up to 210 mJ of energy at efficiencies above 50% and fluences up to 35 J/cm$^2$. We also show that the gas lenses have sufficient bandwidth to efficiently diffract 35-fs 800-nm pulses and that beam pointing, divergence, and diffraction efficiency are stable while operating at 10 Hz. These diffractive lenses are simple holograms, and the principles demonstrated here could be extended to other types of optics, suggesting that gaseous optics may enable arbitrary, damage-resistant manipulation of intense light for next-generation ultra-high-power lasers.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal growth and optimal perturbations in magnetohydrodynamic shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In astrophysical shear flows, the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability is generally suppressed by magnetic tension provided a sufficiently strong streamwise magnetic field. This is often used to infer upper (or lower) bounds on field strengths in systems where shear-driven fluctuations are (or are not) observed, on the basis that fluctuations cannot grow in the absence of linear instability. On the contrary, by calculating the maximum growth that small-amplitude perturbations can achieve in finite time for such a system, we show that perturbations can grow in energy by orders of magnitude even when the flow is sub-Alfv\'enic, suggesting that shear-driven turbulence is possible even in the presence of strong magnetic fields, and challenging inferences from the observed presence or absence of shear-driven fluctuations. We further show that magnetic fields introduce additional nonmodal growth mechanisms relative to the hydrodynamic case, and that 2D simulations miss key aspects of these growth mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Plasma Position Constrained Free-Boundary MHD Equilibrium in Tokamaks using pyIPREQ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A free-boundary, axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium code, pyIPREQ, has been developed for Tokamak plasmas using finite difference and Green's function approach. The code builds upon the foundational frameworks of the PEST and IPREQ codes, introducing several enhancements and new capabilities. Notably, pyIPREQ supports the specification of limiter boundaries and enables the computation of key physical quantities. The code has also been extended to compute equilibria constrained by a prescribed magnetic axis position, which is particularly useful when such information can be inferred from the diagnostics data. In addition, pyIPREQ includes functionality to address vertical instabilities, a requirement for accurately modeling elongated plasma configurations. Benchmarking has been carried out against published results and the original IPREQ code. Applications are demonstrated for ADITYA-U Tokamak experiments, where magnetic axis measurements are available, and predictions are also made for SST-1 and ADITYA-U Tokamaks under various operational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic waves in astrophysical Druyvesteyn plasmas: I. Langmuir waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmas in various astrophysical systems are in non-equilibrium states as evidenced by direct in-situ measurements in the solar wind, solar corona and planetary environments as well as by indirect observations of various sources of waves and emissions in astrophysical systems. Specific are non-Maxwellian velocity distributions with suprathermal tails, for whose description the most-used are the Kappa (power-law) distributions. With this paper we introduce a modeling alternative for linear waves in plasmas described by another non-equilibrium model, namely the generalized Druyvesteyn distribution. This can reproduce not only high-energy tails, but also low-energy flat-tops of velocity distributions, like those of electrons associated with the Earth's bow shock and interplanetary shocks or of electrons in the solar transition region. We derive the corresponding dispersion relation for longitudinal waves in terms of the newly introduced Druyvsteyn dispersion function, numerically compute, for the isotropic case, the dispersion curves as well as damping rates, and provide analytical approximation in the limit of weak damping. Thereby, we provide a new modeling tool that facilitates the quantitative treatment of a variety of non-Maxwellian plasmas.</description>
