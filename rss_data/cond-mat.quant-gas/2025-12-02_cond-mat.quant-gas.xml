      <title>Roles of Polarization and Detuning in the Noise-induced Relaxation Dynamics of Atomic-Molecular Bose Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relaxation process of a resonant Bose gas under the influence of Gaussian white noise. We characterize the system dynamics in terms of the polarization or imbalance between the atoms and molecules, and the system coherence. The relaxation times corresponding to these two quantities are studied both using a mean-field model, and a Born Green Kirkwood Yvon hierarchy that takes into account the higher-order correlations. The role of the initial polarization and the Feshbach detuning are investigated. It is found with an increasing initial population imbalance, the longituidinal relaxation time (that governs the dyanamics of the polarization) grows, while the transverse relaxation time (that governs the dynamics of the coherence) decays. As for the varying Feshbach detuning, it is observed that the longituidinal relaxation time reaches its minima and its transverse counterpart reaches its maxima near the resonance. We also study how the initial polarization and the detuning affect physical quantities like drift speed, condensate fraction, fidelity and entanglement entropy etc, and find the results to be fully consistent with the behavior of the relaxation dynamics of the system.</description>

      <title>Vortex configuration dependent equilibrium and non-equilibrium states in two-dimensional quantum turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of four vortex configurations, namely, dipole, plasma, cluster, and lattice, using the two-dimensional mean-field Gross-Pitaevskii equation, focusing on their dynamical decay and approach to the equilibrium. Our analysis reveals that the cluster vortex configuration reaches equilibrium more rapidly than the others, while the dipole, plasma, and lattice configurations exhibit persistent non-equilibrium behavior, tending toward non-thermal fixed points. Specifically, the cluster configuration follows Kolmogorov-like scaling ($\varepsilon^{i}(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$) in the incompressible spectrum, while the other configurations follow Vinen-like scaling ($\varepsilon^{i}(k)\sim k^{-1}$). In the compressible spectrum, the cluster case exhibits a $k$ scaling, indicating full mode equilibration, while for the other configurations, the modes thermalize only above a critical wave number. Additionally, the transfer function for the cluster configuration displays a Gaussian distribution, typical of equilibrium states, while the other configurations exhibit skewed Gaussian or exponential distributions, indicative of their non-equilibrium nature. Finally, the particle number spectra show that the cluster case follows dynamical scaling closer to equilibrium, while the dipole, plasma, and lattice configurations evolve towards non-thermal fixed points. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of vortex configurations and their approach to equilibrium or non-equilibrium states, offering guidance for future studies on quantum turbulence and its control.</description>

      <title>Spectral form factor and power spectrum for trapped rotating interacting bosons: An exact diagonalization study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Role of impurity statistics and medium constraints in polaron-polaron interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the behavior of a small density of mobile impurities (polarons) immersed in a quantum gas, a generic scenario that can be realized in cold atomic gases, liquid helium mixtures and doped semiconductors. We present a unified theoretical framework for understanding polaron quasiparticles beyond the single-impurity limit, and we identify two key factors that control the polaron-polaron interactions: (i) the statistics of the impurities, including whether or not they are degenerate, and (ii) the constraints on the medium response, i.e., whether the medium density or chemical potential is held fixed. By constructing wave functions for two bosonic, fermionic, or distinguishable impurities immersed in a Bose or Fermi gas, we derive rigorous results for the polaron interactions in the limit of weak impurity-medium coupling. We furthermore obtain an exact relationship between the polaron interactions at fixed medium density and at fixed chemical potential, a result which is valid for arbitrary interaction strength. Our work provides an important guide for understanding experiments, and it acts as a starting point for future strong-coupling theories of polaron interactions that capture all of the effects identified in this work.</description>

      <title>Floquet-induced $p_x+ip_y$ bosonic pair condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a dynamical pairing mechanism other than the pair-wise interactions. Starting from a two-dimensional hard-core boson model with periodically modulated hopping amplitude, we derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian with three-site interactions that are responsible for unconventional pairing between adjacent bosons. By performing a density matrix renormalization group study on this three-site interacting Hamiltonian, we reveal a bosonic pair condensate with $p_x+ ip_y$ symmetry, while the single-particle Bose-Einstein condensate is completely depleted. The experimental implementations of the proposed model on polar molecular systems and superconducting quantum circuit have also been discussed.</description>

      <title>Confinement-Induced Resonances in Rabi-Coupled Bosonic Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider coherently-coupled bosonic mixtures scattering at low energies in the presence of an external confinement along either one or two directions. We exactly solve the two-body scattering problem, showing that for large Rabi coupling the confinement-induced resonance can be displaced towards scattering lengths values much smaller than the oscillator length. Our results make the observation of confinement-induced resonances more tunable and accessible, offering yet another handle for the efficient control of strong interactions in ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Quantized nonlinear transport and its breakdown in Fermi gases with Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantized transport not only exist in gapped topological states but also in metallic states. Recently, Kane proposed a quantized nonlinear conductance in ballistic metals whose value is determined by the Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea [Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 076801 (2022)]. In this paper, we consider two-dimensional noninteracting fermionic systems whose Fermi surface has nonvanishing Berry curvature. We find that the Berry curvature at the Fermi surface does not affect the quantized nonlinear transport for translationally invariant systems. When spatial inhomogeneity is introduced, such quantization breaks down due to the combined effect of Berry curvature and the gradient of local potential. Such breakdown of quantization can be observed in trapped ultracold atoms with topological bands.</description>

      <title>Tunable Single- and Multiphoton Bundles in Cavity-Coupled Atomic Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an experimentally accessible scheme for realizing tunable nonclassical light in cavity-coupled reconfigurable atomic arrays. By coherently controlling the collective interference phase, the system switches from single-photon blockade to high-purity multiphoton bundle emission, unveiling a hierarchical structure of photon correlations dictated by atom-number parity and cavity detuning. The scaling of photon population identifies the transition between superradiant and subradiant regimes, while parity- and phase-dependent spin correlations elucidate the microscopic interference processes enabling coherent multiphoton generation. This work establishes a unified framework connecting cooperative atomic interactions to controllable nonclassical photon statistics and introduces a distinct interference-enabled mechanism that provides a practical route toward high-fidelity multiphoton sources in scalable cavity QEDs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism accompanied by flavor-selective Mott states in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ferromagnetic instability in an SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard model on the hypercubic lattice. Combining dynamical mean-field theory with continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find that, in the strong-coupling regime at low temperatures, ferromagnetically ordered (FM) states develop away from the commensurate fillings. In the particle-doped SU($3$) system near one-third filling, the FM state is accompanied by a spontaneous flavor-selective Mott state, where two of the three flavors are Mott insulating while the remaining flavor is metallic. Since particles in the metallic flavor can almost freely move on the lattice without correlation effects, the ordered state is stabilized by the kinetic-energy gain of the doped particles. This is similar to the generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetism discussed in the one-hole-doped system at one-third filling. In the SU($4$) case, we find that six distinct types of FM states appear as the particle density varies. The results uncover the nature of the FM state in the SU($N$) Fermi-Hubbard systems and highlight the rich magnetic behavior enabled by enlarged internal symmetries.</description>

      <title>Antibunching in locally driven dissipative Lieb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Lieb lattices, geometric frustration and destructive interference of hopping cancels the occupation of certain sites, leading to flat-band physics. Here, we show numerically how, in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard (DDBH) model arranged into Lieb lattices and related geometries, specific localised driving schemes can repurpose this interference to generate enhanced antibunching via a mechanism similar to the so-called unconventional photon blockade. Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments. This work demonstrates the possibility of using localised driving and interference effects to generate non-trivial quantum correlations in open quantum lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Multi-pole solitons and breathers with spatially periodic modulation induced by the helicoidal spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report analytical solutions for diverse multi-pole (MP) soliton and breather states in spatially inhomogeneous binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with the helicoidally shaped spin-orbit coupling (SOC), including MP stripe solitons on zero background, MP beating stripe solitons on a nonzero plane-wave background, as well as MP beating stripe solitons and MP breathers on periodic backgrounds. The results indicate that modulation effects produced by the helicoidal SOC not only induce stripe patterns in MP solitons, but also generate the spatially-periodic background for the MP beating stripe solitons and breathers. An asymptotic analysis reveals curved trajectories with a logarithmically increasing soliton/breather separation for these MP excitations, fundamentally distinguishing them from periodic trajectories of bound-state solitons/breathers or straight trajectories of conventional multi-soliton/breather sets. With complex periodic structures in individual components, the total density distribution is nonperiodic, due to their configurations which are out-of-phase with respect to the two components. We further examine several degenerate structures of MP solitons and breathers under varying SOC and spectral parameters. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and demonstrate stability of these MP excitations. These findings may facilitate deeper understanding of soliton/breather interactions beyond conventional multi-soliton systems and bound-state complexes in SOC BEC.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Eigenstates of a Doped Hole in the Ising Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-N\'eel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: Impurities immersed in hard-core Bose gases offer exciting opportunities to explore polaron and bipolaron physics. We investigate the ground state properties of a single and a pair of impurities throughout the superfluid and insulating (charge density wave) phases of the bosonic environment. In the superfluid phase, the impurity exhibits polaron-like behavior, forming a dressed quasiparticle. In contrast, in the insulating phase, the impurity regains its particle-like character, moving through a potential landscape shaped by the charge density wave order. Moreover, we show that two impurities can form a bound state even in the absence of an explicit impurity-impurity coupling. We establish the stability of this bound state within both the superfluid and insulating phases. Our results offer valuable insights for ongoing lattice polaron experiments with ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak wave turbulence regimes in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a turbulent Bose-Einstein condensate is driven out-of-equilibrium at a scale much smaller than the system size, nonlinear wave interactions transfer particles towards large scales in an inverse cascade process. In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. The role of vortices in such a strongly forced state is marginal, which makes this new state very different from the strongly turbulent state composed of a tangle of quantized vortex lines. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.</description>

      <title>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek scaling in Rydberg atom ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been extensively studied in various second-order phase transitions, yet the case of tricriticality-the point where second-order phase transition lines terminate-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\nu$ and $\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via "tangential" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\nu - 1/\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.</description>

      <title>Collisional relaxation in shielded dipolar molecular gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.</description>

      <title>Probing Lambda-Gravity with Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of tabletop experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Random displacements in critical Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays promise high-fidelity quantum simulations of critical phenomena with flexible geometries. Yet experimental realizations inevitably suffer from disorder due to random displacements of atoms, leading to departures from the expected behavior. Here, we study how such positional disorder influences the Ising criticality. Since disorder breaks the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, one might expect the system to flow to an infinite-strength disordered fixed point, erasing all nontrivial critical features in low spatial dimensions. Remarkably, we find instead that disorder in Rydberg systems is subjected to nontrivial local constraints, making the physics markedly different from systems with more conventional spatially short-range correlated or long-range correlated disorder. This leads to new classes of criticalities even at dimensions where conventional disorder would destroy criticality altogether. We then demonstrate as a consequence how a novel pseudo-criticality emerges in Rydberg atom chains of experimentally realistic scale, and show that the renormalization group flow is governed by a locally constrained $\mathbb{Z}_2$-breaking perturbation. Our findings uncover new disorder-driven phenomena and underscore the importance of carefully treating disorder effects in quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Self-similar kinetics for gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Dichroism from Chiral Thermoelectric Probes: Generalized Sum Rules for Orbital and Heat Magnetizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under chiral thermoelectric drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</description>
