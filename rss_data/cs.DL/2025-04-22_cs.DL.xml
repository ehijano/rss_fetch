      <title>Revisiting the field normalization approaches/practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field normalization plays a crucial role in scientometrics to ensure fair comparisons across different disciplines. In this paper, we revisit the effectiveness of several widely used field normalization methods. Our findings indicate that source-side normalization (as employed in SNIP) does not fully eliminate citation bias across different fields and the imbalanced paper growth rates across fields are a key factor for this phenomenon. To address the issue of skewness, logarithmic transformation has been applied. Recently, a combination of logarithmic transformation and mean-based normalization, expressed as ln(c+1)/mu, has gained popularity. However, our analysis shows that this approach does not yield satisfactory results. Instead, we find that combining logarithmic transformation (ln(c+1)) with z-score normalization provides a better alternative. Furthermore, our study suggests that the better performance is achieved when combining both source-side and target-side field normalization methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating transformative agreement impact on hybrid open access: A comparative large-scale study using Scopus, Web of Science and open metadata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares open metadata from hoaddata, an openly available dataset based on Crossref, OpenAlex and the cOAlition S Journal Checker Tool, with proprietary bibliometric databases Scopus and Web of Science to estimate the impact of transformative agreements on hybrid open access publishing. Analysing over 13,000 hybrid journals between 2019-2023, the research found substantial growth in open access due to these agreements, although most articles remain paywalled. The results were consistent across all three data sources, showing strong correlations in country-level metrics despite differences in journal coverage and metadata availability. By 2023, transformative agreements enabled the majority of open access in hybrid journals, with particularly high adoption in European countries. The analysis revealed strong alignment between first and corresponding authorship when measuring agreement uptake by publisher and country. This comparative approach supports the use of open metadata for large-scale hybrid open access studies, while using multiple data sources together provides a more robust understanding of hybrid open access adoption than any single database can offer, overcoming individual limitations in coverage and metadata quality.</description>

      <title>State of the Art on Artificial Intelligence Resources for Interaction Media Design in Digital Cultural Heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the design of interactive experiences for Cultural Heritage (CH). Previous studies indeed either miss to represent the specificity of the CH or mention possible tools without making a clear reference to a structured Interaction Design (IxD) workflow. The study also attempts to overcome one of the major limitations of traditional literature review, which may fail to capture proprietary tools whose release is rarely accompanied by academic publications. Besides the analysis of previous research, the study proposes a possible workflow for IxD in CH, subdivided into phases and tasks: for each of them, this paper proposes possible AI-based tools that can support the activity of designers, curators, and CH professionals. The review concludes with a final section outlining future paths for research and development in this domain.</description>

      <title>MaRDMO: Future Gateway to FAIR Mathematical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mathematical research data plays a crucial role across scientific disciplines, yet its documentation and dissemination remain challenging due to the lack of standardized research data management practices. The MaRDMO Plugin addresses these challenges by integrating mathematical models, algorithms, and interdisciplinary workflows into the established framework of the Research Data Management Organiser (RDMO). Built on FAIR principles, MaRDMO enables structured documentation and retrieval of mathematical research data through guided questionnaires. It connects to multiple knowledge graphs, including MathModDB, MathAlgoDB, and the MaRDI Portal. Users can document and search for models, algorithms, and workflows via dynamic selection interfaces that also leverage other sources such as Wikidata. The plugin facilitates the export to the individual MaRDI services, ensuring data quality through automated validation. By embedding mathematical research data management into the widely adopted RDMO platform, MaRDMO represents a significant step toward making mathematical research data more findable, accessible, and reusable.</description>

      <title>COARA will not save science from the tyranny of administrative evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05587v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Coalition for Advancing Research Assessment (CoARA) agreement is a cornerstone in the ongoing efforts to reform research evaluation. CoARA advocates for administrative evaluations of research that rely on peer review, supported by responsible metrics, as beneficial for both science and society. Its principles can be critically examined through the lens of Philip Kitcher's concept of well-ordered science in a democratic society. From Kitcher's perspective, CoARA's approach faces two significant challenges: definitions of quality and impact are determined by governments or evaluation institutions rather than emerging from broad public deliberation, and a select group of scientists is empowered to assess research based on these predefined criteria. This creates susceptibility to both the ''tyranny of expertise'' and the ''tyranny of ignorance'' that Kitcher cautions against. Achieving Kitcher's ideal would require limiting administrative evaluations to essential tasks, such as researcher recruitment and project funding, while establishing procedures grounded in principles of fairness.</description>
