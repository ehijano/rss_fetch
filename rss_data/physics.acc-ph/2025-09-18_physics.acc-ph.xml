      <title>Oakridge PPU Magnets: Results and Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is being upgraded from 1.0 GeV to 1.3 GeV (or 1.4 to 2.8 MW). Several water-cooled magnets have been upgraded to transport 30% higher beam energy. Fermilab contributed the magnet design for the new chicane magnets and injection/extraction septum. Designing the magnets was a challenging task because the new magnets required good combined integrated field quality and needed to occupy the old magnets space but with about 20% greater integrated magnetic field. Additional strong requirements applied to the magnets fringe field so as not to disturb the circulating beam. After fabrication of the magnets, an extensive measurement campaign was developed and performed at Fermilab's Magnet Test Facility. The measurements needed to assess magnet performance and provide comparison to design calculations. These included verification of field strength and harmonics along an 8 m length and 200 mm good field diameter for the chicane dipoles, end-field Hall probe mapping of these magnets, and measurements along two differently curved trajectories within the ~3 m septum gradient magnet. Details of the measurements and systems are presented along with results and comparison to field models.</description>

      <title>Magnetic measurements of Fermilab rapid-cycling Booster gradient magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermilab is upgrading its Booster synchrotron to increase ramp rate and intensity. This is part of the Proton Improvement Plan (PIP-II) that will allow the Main Injector to achieve proton beam power of 1.2 MW within the next few years. This upgrade includes running the 55-year-old Booster magnets at 20 Hz instead of the usual 15 Hz, and construction of some shorter and wider aperture versions of these combined-function gradient magnets. Magnetic measurements were performed to characterize the present 15 Hz AC performance, and then again with 20 Hz ramp cycle to ensure performance and compatibility in this new operating regime. A 3 m-long curved flat-coil was developed for these measurements using Printed Circuit Board (PCB) technology. The probe also has a separate 0.5 m-long body-field probe, allowing integral, body, and end fields to be measured across 100 mm of the magnet aperture. The sampling rate for these measurements during the AC cycle was 200 kHz, and field resolution was better than 0.01%. Details of the probe, measurements, and results are presented.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the Beam Longitudinal Properties in the Fermilab Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fermilab Linac delivers 400MeV, 25mA H$^-$; beam. The longitudinal bunch parameters are reconstructed using a Bunch Shape Monitor (BSM) installed in the middle of the Linac. For that, the bunch length is measured as a function of the phase of an upstream cavity and fitted to simulations. The cavity gradient and its phase with respect to the beam are recovered from readings of Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). Since the cavity provides a significant transverse defocusing, the BSM measurements are correlated with transverse beam size measurements by a wire scanner (WS). Simulations connect these three types of measurements, allowing to deduce the longitudinal emittance and Courant-Snyder parameters.</description>

      <title>Optics Reconstruction in the SCL Section of the FNAL Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Side-Coupled Linac (SCL) section of the FNAL linac accelerates the beam from 117 MeV to 401.5 MeV, operating at 22-24 mA beam current. Transverse focusing is performed by 32 quadrupoles, and the beam orbit is guided by 19 dipole correctors and measured by 29 BPMs. The bunch length is measured in a single location by a Bunch Shape Monitor (BSM). This paper presents a three-step reconstruction of the machine optics. First, the transverse and longitudinal Twiss parameters at the start of the SCL section are determined using quadrupole scans and BSM measurements at different settings of an upstream cavity. Second, the quadrupole calibrations are adjusted based on differential-trajectory measurements. Finally, the beam is propagated along the SCL linac using the code TraceWin. A comparison between TraceWin simulations and the beam envelope measured by the 12 wire scanners of the SCL linac was performed. Transverse and longitudinal beam parameters at the entrance of the transition section will be reported.</description>

      <title>Measuring Orbit Responses with Oscillating Trajectories in the Fermilab Linac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recording changes in beam transverse positions re-ported by Beam Position Monitors (BPMs) in response to a beam deflection by an upstream dipole corrector (orbit response) is a powerful tool for analysis of accelerator optics and assisting with machine tuning. In the Fermilab Linac, orbit responses are recorded by oscillating the currents of up to 19 correctors, providing faster, drift-resistant measurements through frequency-domain analysis. This report describes the technique, including error estimations and consistency checks and shows an example of the measurements.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition Dynamics Induced by Strong Radio-Frequency Fields in ReBCO High Temperature Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing the dynamics of superconductor phase transitions induced by strong electromagnetic fields is vital to designing high power devices leveraging these materials. The development of high temperature superconductors (HTS) is particularly interesting due to critical temperatures ($T_c$) approaching 90 K, the ability to support high current densities, and their ability to operate in strong static magnetic fields. This work aims to determine the transition dynamics of these materials at radio-frequencies (rf) in the microwave range where they have enormous potential for new applications ranging from particle accelerators to dark matter searches. We have tested two types of coatings formed from rare earth barium copper oxide (REBCO): a film deposited by electron-beam physical vapor deposition, and HTS conductor tapes soldered to a copper substrate with exposed REBCO surfaces. Testing was performed via a hemispherical transverse-electric mode cavity that maximizes the surface rf magnetic field and minimizes the surface electric field on a 2-inch diameter sample. We report on steady-state measurements at low rf power, as well as fully time-resolved transition dynamics on the microsecond timescale seen for the first time with strong surface rf fields.</description>

      <title>Generating 10 GW-class isolated zeptosecond x-ray bursts through bootstrapping two plasma-based accelerator stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is proposed to generate coherent, intense zeptosecond x-ray pulses by using the electron beam produced by a laser wakefield accelerator (LWFA) stage as the driver for a beam driven plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) stage. The LWFA injector stage requires a readily available 100 TW laser driver to produce a GeV class self-injected electron beam. This beam is focused and used as the driver in a PWFA stage that utilizes a solid-density plasma with a modulated density downramp. The concept is shown to be capable of producing an ultra-short electron beam with unprecedented density ($10^{26}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) and brightness ($ 10^{24}~\ampere/\meter^2/\radian ^2$), that is also pre-bunched on 0.1 Angstrom scales. By colliding this pre-bunched extreme beam with an optical undulator, an intense zeptosecond pulse can be emitted if the spatially focusing region is matched with the lasing region of the beam. Multi-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are performed of the entire concept to demonstrate that an isolated 10 GW-class zeptosecond pulse with a full-width-half-maximum duration of 700 zs can be generated in a tapered laser pulse. Such an intense zeptosecond pulse generation scheme may provide an essential probe for nuclear physics and quantum electrodynamics processes.</description>

      <title>Time-of-flight Energy Measurements with BPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy of a bunched non-relativistic ion beam can be deduced from measuring the beam phases in neighbouring Beam Position Monitors (BPMs). This report discusses implementation of such a procedure at the PIP-II H- linac being constructed at Fermilab. The case when the flight time between BPMs is longer than the period of BPM frequency is considered in more detail. When absolute BPM phase calibration is not available, the BPM phase information can be used to track deviations of the beam energy from the de-sired value. Such "energy deviation" parameter is operationally implemented at the transfer line between 400 MeV Linac and the Booster, and its analog is expected to be used in the transfer line from PIP-II as well.</description>

      <title>A Computational Picture of Hydride Formation and Dissipation In Nb SRF Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research linking surface hydrides to Q-disease, and the subsequent development of methods to eliminate surface hydrides, is one of the great successes of SRF cavity R&amp;D. We use time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau to extend the theory of hydride dissipation to sub-surface hydrides. Just as surface hydrides cause Q-disease behavior, we show that sub-surface hydrides cause high-field Q-slope (HFQS) behavior. We find that the abrupt onset of HFQS is due to a transition from a vortex-free state to a vortex-penetration state. We show that controlling hydride size and depth through impurity doping can eliminate HFQS.</description>
