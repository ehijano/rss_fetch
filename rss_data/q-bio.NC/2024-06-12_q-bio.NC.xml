      <title>The Price of Cognition and Replicator Equations in Parallel Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are aiming to propose a novel mathematical model that studies the dynamics of synaptic damage in terms of concentrations of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters during neurotransmission processes. Our primary objective is to employ Wardrop's first and second principles within a neural network of the brain. In order to comprehensively incorporate Wardrop's first and second principles into the neural network of the brain, we introduce two novel concepts: \textit{neuropeptide's (neurotransmitter's) equilibrium} and \textit{synapses optimum}. The \textit{neuropeptide/neurotransmitter equilibrium} refers to \textit{a distribution of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters that leads to uniform damage across all synaptic links}. Meanwhile, \textit{synapses optimum} is \textit{the most desirable distribution of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters that minimizes the cumulative damage experienced by all synapses}. In the context of a neural network within the brain, an analogue of the price of anarchy is \textit{the price of cognition} which is \textit{the most unfavorable ratio between the overall impairment caused by toxic neuropeptide's (neurotransmitter's) equilibrium in comparison to the optimal state of synapses (synapses optimum)}. To put it differently, \textit{the price of cognition} measures \textit{the loss of cognitive ability resulting from increased concentrations of toxic neuropeptides/neurotransmitters}. Additionally, a replicator equation is proposed within this framework that leads to the establishment of the synapses optimum during the neurotransmission process.</description>

      <title>The Imaging Database for Epilepsy And Surgery (IDEAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool to identify brain abnormalities in a wide range of neurological disorders. In focal epilepsy MRI is used to identify structural cerebral abnormalities. For covert lesions, machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms may improve lesion detection if abnormalities are not evident on visual inspection. The success of this approach depends on the volume and quality of training data.
  Herein, we release an open-source dataset of preprocessed MRI scans from 442 individuals with drug-refractory focal epilepsy who had neurosurgical resections, and detailed demographic information. The MRI scan data includes the preoperative 3D T1 and where available 3D FLAIR, as well as a manually inspected complete surface reconstruction and volumetric parcellations. Demographic information includes age, sex, age of onset of epilepsy, location of surgery, histopathology of resected specimen, occurrence and frequency of focal seizures with and without impairment of awareness, focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, number of anti-seizure medications (ASMs) at time of surgery, and a total of 1764 patient years of post-surgical follow up. Crucially, we also include resection masks delineated from post-surgical imaging.
  To demonstrate the veracity of our data, we successfully replicated previous studies showing long-term outcomes of seizure freedom in the range of around 50%. Our imaging data replicates findings of group level atrophy in patients compared to controls. Resection locations in the cohort were predominantly in the temporal and frontal lobes.
  We envisage our dataset, shared openly with the community, will catalyse the development and application of computational methods in clinical neurology.</description>

      <title>Astrocytic NMDA Receptors Modulate the Dynamics of Continuous Attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuronal networking supports complex brain functions, with neurotransmitters facilitating communication through chemical synapses. The release probability of neurotransmitters varies and is influenced by pre-synaptic neuronal activity. Recent findings suggest that blocking astrocytic N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptors reduces this variation. However, the theoretical implications of this reduction on neuronal dynamics have not been thoroughly investigated. Utilizing continuous attractor neural network (CANN) models with short-term synaptic depression (STD), we explore the effects of reduced release probability variation. Our results show that blocking astrocytic NMDA receptors stabilizes attractor states and diminishes their mobility. These insights enhance our understanding of NMDA receptors' role in astrocytes and their broader impact on neural computation and memory, with potential implications for neurological conditions involving NMDA receptor antagonists.</description>

      <title>The geometry of efficient codes: how rate-distortion trade-offs distort the latent representations of generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Living organisms rely on internal models of the world to act adaptively. These models cannot encode every detail and hence need to compress information. From a cognitive standpoint, information compression can manifest as a distortion of latent representations, resulting in the emergence of representations that may not accurately reflect the external world or its geometry. Rate-distortion theory formalizes the optimal way to compress information, by considering factors such as capacity limitations, the frequency and the utility of stimuli. However, while this theory explains why the above factors distort latent representations, it does not specify which specific distortions they produce. To address this question, here we systematically explore the geometry of the latent representations that emerge in generative models that operate under the principles of rate-distortion theory ($\beta$-VAEs). Our results highlight that three main classes of distortions of internal representations -- prototypization, specialization, orthogonalization -- emerge as signatures of information compression, under constraints on capacity, data distributions and tasks. These distortions can coexist, giving rise to a rich landscape of latent spaces, whose geometry could differ significantly across generative models subject to different constraints. Our findings contribute to explain how the normative constraints of rate-distortion theory distort the geometry of latent representations of generative models of artificial systems and living organisms.</description>

      <title>Metastability in networks of nonlinear stochastic integrate-and-fire neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neurons in the brain continuously process the barrage of sensory inputs they receive from the environment. A wide array of experimental work has shown that the collective activity of neural populations encodes and processes this constant bombardment of information. How these collective patterns of activity depend on single neuron properties is often unclear. Single-neuron recordings have shown that individual neural responses to inputs are nonlinear, which prevents a straightforward extrapolation from single neuron features to emergent collective states. In this work, we use a field theoretic formulation of a stochastic leaky integrate-and-fire model to study the impact of nonlinear intensity functions on macroscopic network activity. We show that the interplay between nonlinear spike emission and membrane potential resets can i) give rise to metastable transitions between active firing rate states, and ii) can enhance or suppress mean firing rates and membrane potentials in opposite directions.</description>

      <title>Processing, evaluating and understanding FMRI data with afni_proc.py</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FMRI data are noisy, complicated to acquire, and typically go through many steps of processing before they are used in a study or clinical practice. Being able to visualize and understand the data from the start through the completion of processing, while being confident that each intermediate step was successful, is challenging. AFNI's "afni_proc.py" is a tool to create and run a processing pipeline for FMRI data. With its flexible features, "afni_proc.py" allows users to both control and evaluate their processing at a detailed level. It has been designed to keep users informed about all processing steps: it does not just process the data, but first outputs a fully commented processing script that the users can read, query, interpret and refer back to. Having this full provenance is important for being able to understand each step of processing; it also promotes transparency and reproducibility by keeping the record of individual-level processing and modeling specifics in a single, shareable place. Additionally, "afni_proc.py" creates pipelines that contain several automatic self-checks for potential problems during runtime. The output directory contains a dictionary of relevant quantities that can be programmatically queried for potential issues and a systematic, interactive quality control (QC) HTML. All of these features help users evaluate and understand their data and processing in detail. We describe these and other aspects of "afni_proc.py" here using a set of task-based and resting state FMRI example commands.</description>

      <title>The Multiscale Surface Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surface meshes are a favoured domain for representing structural and functional information on the human cortex, but their complex topology and geometry pose significant challenges for deep learning analysis. While Transformers have excelled as domain-agnostic architectures for sequence-to-sequence learning, the quadratic cost of the self-attention operation remains an obstacle for many dense prediction tasks. Inspired by some of the latest advances in hierarchical modelling with vision transformers, we introduce the Multiscale Surface Vision Transformer (MS-SiT) as a backbone architecture for surface deep learning. The self-attention mechanism is applied within local-mesh-windows to allow for high-resolution sampling of the underlying data, while a shifted-window strategy improves the sharing of information between windows. Neighbouring patches are successively merged, allowing the MS-SiT to learn hierarchical representations suitable for any prediction task. Results demonstrate that the MS-SiT outperforms existing surface deep learning methods for neonatal phenotyping prediction tasks using the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) dataset. Furthermore, building the MS-SiT backbone into a U-shaped architecture for surface segmentation demonstrates competitive results on cortical parcellation using the UK Biobank (UKB) and manually-annotated MindBoggle datasets. Code and trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-vision-transformers.</description>

      <title>Saddle avoidance of noise-induced transitions in multiscale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multistable dynamical systems driven by weak Gaussian noise, transitions between competing states are often assumed to pass via a saddle on the separating basin boundary. Instead, we show that timescale separation can cause saddle avoidance in non-gradient systems. Using toy models from neuroscience and ecology, we study cases where sample transitions deviate strongly from the instanton predicted by Freidlin-Wentzell theory, even for weak finite noise. We attribute this to a flat quasipotential and present an approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action to aptly predict transition paths.</description>

      <title>Optical signal recording of cellular activity in optogenetic stimulation of human pulp dental cells using a twin-core fiber-based Mach-Zehnder interferometer biosensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative two-core fiber (TCF) optic sensor employing a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) to monitor the optogenetic response of light-sensitive human dental pulp stem cells (hDPSCs). The in-fiber MZI, formed using a segment of TCF optic, detects refractive index (RI) changes in the surrounding medium. The sensor utilizes the evanescent wave of one core as the sensing arm, necessitating a thin cladding achieved through one-sided chemical etching. This design allows the sensor to detect subtle alterations in the RI of the environment by observing displacements in the interference spectrum. The optogenetic stimulation of light-sensitive cells induces variations in ion concentrations, leading to a corresponding change in refractive index. The fabricated sensor, with a peak sensitivity of 675.74 nm/RIU within the RI range of 1.39-1.43, can detect these changes. A computer simulation validated the sensitivity and optimized fabrication parameters, exhibiting satisfactory agreement with experimental results. Spectrum displacements were recorded for both light-sensitive hDPSCs and regular hDPSCs (as a control test). Results from the experiment, analyzed and compared using data analysis software, revealed that 473 nm blue light effectively stimulated light-sensitive hDPSCs. Notably, the proposed sensor, a novel structure, demonstrated its capability to detect RI changes in the cell medium during optogenetic applications.</description>
