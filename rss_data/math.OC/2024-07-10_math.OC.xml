      <title>Robust Routing and Scheduling of Home Healthcare Workers: A Nested Branch-and-Price Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global home healthcare market is growing rapidly due to aging populations, advancements in healthcare technology, and patient preference for home-based care. In this paper, we study the multi-day planning problem of simultaneously deciding patient acceptance, assignment, routing, and scheduling under uncertain travel and service times. Our approach ensures cardinality-constrained robustness with respect to timely patient care and the prevention of overtime. We take into account a wide range of criteria including patient time windows, caregiver availability and compatibility, a minimum time interval between two visits of a patient, the total number of required visits, continuity of care, and profit. We use a novel systematic modeling scheme that prioritizes health-related criteria as hard constraints and optimizes cost and preference-related criteria as part of the objective function. We present a mixed-integer linear program formulation, along with a nested branch-and-price technique. Results from a case study in Austin, Texas demonstrate that instances of realistic size can be solved to optimality within reasonable runtimes. The price of robustness primarily results from reduced patient load per caregiver. Interestingly, the criterion of geographical proximity appears to be of secondary priority when selecting new patients and assigning them to caregivers.</description>

      <title>Verification theorem related to a zero sum stochastic differential game via Fukushima-Dirichlet decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a verification theorem, inspired by those existing in stochastic control, to demonstrate how a pair of progressively measurable controls can form a Nash equilibrium in a stochastic zero-sum differential game. Specifically, we suppose that a pathwise-type Isaacs condition is satisfied together with the existence of what is termed a quasi-strong solution to the Bellman-Isaacs (BI)equations. In that case we are able to show that the value of the game is achieved and corresponds exactly to the unique solution of the BI equations. Those have also been applied for improving a well-known verification theorem in stochastic control theory. In so doing, we have implemented new techniques of stochastic calculus via regularizations, developing specific chain rules.</description>

      <title>An elementary algorithm for classifying digital objects based on the variational principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When using the maximin principle to solve the problem of classifying digital objects according to histograms, generated by this objects, it becomes necessary to take into account all the vertices of the polyhedron, generated by inequalities - restrictions in which the objective function takes maximum values or values close to maximum, if the data is noisy. In the proposed work, to obtain coordinates of all vertices mentioned polyhedron, a modification of H.Uzawa's method is used, which is obtained by replacing vectors and matrices with functions defined on finite sets of a special type.</description>

      <title>Projection, Degeneracy, and Singularity Degree for Spectrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial reduction, FR, is a regularization technique for convex programs where the strict feasibility constraint qualification, CQ, fails. Though this CQ holds generically, failure is pervasive in applications such as semidefinite relaxations of hard discrete optimization problems. In this paper we relate FR to the analysis of the convergence behaviour of a semi-smooth Newton root finding method for the projection onto a spectrahedron, i.e., onto the intersection of a linear manifold and the semidefinite cone. In the process, we derive and use an elegant formula for the projection onto a face of the semidefinite cone. We show further that the ill-conditioning of the Jacobian of the Newton method near optimality characterizes the degeneracy of the nearest point in the spectrahedron. We apply the results, both theoretically and empirically, to the problem of finding nearest points to the sets of: (i) correlation matrices or the elliptope; and (ii) semidefinite relaxations of permutation matrices or the vontope, i.e., the feasible sets for the semidefinite relaxations of the max-cut and quadratic assignment problems, respectively.</description>

      <title>System stabilization with policy optimization on unstable latent manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability is a basic requirement when studying the behavior of dynamical systems. However, stabilizing dynamical systems via reinforcement learning is challenging because only little data can be collected over short time horizons before instabilities are triggered and data become meaningless. This work introduces a reinforcement learning approach that is formulated over latent manifolds of unstable dynamics so that stabilizing policies can be trained from few data samples. The unstable manifolds are minimal in the sense that they contain the lowest dimensional dynamics that are necessary for learning policies that guarantee stabilization. This is in stark contrast to generic latent manifolds that aim to approximate all -- stable and unstable -- system dynamics and thus are higher dimensional and often require higher amounts of data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach stabilizes even complex physical systems from few data samples for which other methods that operate either directly in the system state space or on generic latent manifolds fail.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Electric Carsharing System Operations and Battery Management: Integrating V2G, B2G and Battery Swapping Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared electric vehicles (SEVs) have emerged as a promising solution to contribute to sustainable urban mobility. However, ensuring the efficient operation and effective battery management of SEV systems remains a complex challenge. This challenge stems from factors such as slow plug-in charging, the potential role of SEVs in balancing grid load pressure, and the optimization of SEV operations to ensure their economic viability. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces an integrated strategy for optimizing various aspects of SEV systems, encompassing strategies like Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G), Battery-to-Grid (B2G), and battery swapping. This approach is built on a space-time-energy network model that facilitates the optimization of battery charging and discharging scheduling, SEV operations like relocations and battery swapping, battery swapping station selection and the number of batteries. The objective of this approach is to maximize profits while addressing operational constraints and the complexities of energy management within SEV systems. Given the substantial complexity that arises with large-problem scales, the paper introduces a column generation-based heuristic algorithm. Extensive experimental validation is conducted, including sensitivity analysis on different charging speeds and fleet sizes. The results illuminate the impact of varying charging rates and fleet sizes on performance indicators. Notably, it is observed that battery swapping is particularly effective as an auxiliary charging method when the number of vehicles is limited. Conversely, in scenarios with a large fleet, the necessity for battery swapping diminishes. Moreover, results show the effectiveness of V2G and B2G technologies in grid load balancing.</description>

      <title>A feedback control strategy for optimizing irrigation in a Richards' Equation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an approach for the optimization of irrigation in a Richards' equation framework. We introduce a proper cost functional, aimed at minimizing the amount of water provided by irrigation, at the same time maximizing the root water uptake, which is modeled by a sink term in the continuity equation. The control is acting on the boundary of the dynamics and due to the nature of the mathematical problem we use a State-Dependent Riccati approach which provides suboptimal control in feedback form, applied to the system of ODEs resulting from the Richards' equation semidiscretization in space. The problem is tested with existing hydraulic parameters, also considering proper root water uptake functions. The numerical simulations also consider the presence of noise in the model to further validate the use of a feedback control approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we generalize the classical optimal partial transport (OPT) problem by modifying the mass destruction/creation term to function-based terms, introducing what we term ``generalized optimal partial transport'' problems. We then discuss the dual formulation of these problems and the associated Sinkhorn solver. Finally, we explore how these new OPT problems relate to classical optimal transport (OT) problems and introduce a linear programming solver tailored for these generalized scenarios.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic aspects of semistability of quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding maximizers of King's criterion, and finding the Harder-Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we call King cones. We demonstrate that the King cones for rank-one representations can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, allowing us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability of rank-one representations in strongly polynomial time. Our argument employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication in Multi-team Dynamic Games: A Mean Field Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating communication and control is a key component in the stability and performance of networked multi-agent systems. While single user networked control systems have gained a lot of attention within this domain, in this work, we address the more challenging problem of large population multi-team dynamic games. In particular, each team constitutes two decision makers (namely, the sensor and the controller) who coordinate over a shared network to control a dynamically evolving state of interest under costs on both actuation and sensing/communication. Due to the shared nature of the wireless channel, the overall cost of each team depends on other teams' policies, thereby leading to a noncooperative game setup. Due to the presence of a large number of teams, we compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium policies for each team using the paradigm of (extended) mean-field games, which is governed by (1) the mean traffic flowing over the channel, and (2) the value of information at the sensor, which highlights the semantic nature of the ensuing communication. In the process, we compute optimal controller policies and approximately optimal sensor policies for each representative team of the mean-field system to alleviate the problem of general non-contractivity of the mean-field fixed point operator associated with the finite cardinality of the sensor action space. Consequently, we also prove the $\epsilon$--Nash property of the mean-field equilibrium solution which essentially characterizes how well the solution derived using mean-field analysis performs on the finite-team system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate the theoretical findings and lead to additional insights on the properties of the results presented.</description>

      <title>First and second-order Cucker-Smale models with non-universal interaction, time delay and communication failures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with first and second-order alignment models with non-universal interaction, time delay and possible lack of connection between the agents. More precisely, we analyze the situation in which the system's agents do not transmit information to all the other agents and also agents that are linked to each other can suspend their interaction at certain times. Moreover, we take into account of possible time lags in the interactions. To deal with the considered "non-universal" connection, a graph topology over the structure of the model has to be considered. Under a so-called Persistence Excitation Condition, we establish the exponential convergence to consensus for both models whenever the digraph that describes the interaction between the agents is strongly connected.</description>

      <title>Piecewise regression via mixed-integer programming for MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piecewise regression is a versatile approach used in various disciplines to approximate complex functions from limited, potentially noisy data points. In control, piecewise regression is, e.g., used to approximate the optimal control law of model predictive control (MPC), the optimal value function, or unknown system dynamics. Neural networks are a common choice to solve the piecewise regression problem. However, due to their nonlinear structure, training is often based on gradient-based methods, which may fail to find a global optimum or even a solution that leads to a small approximation error. To overcome this problem and to find a global optimal solution, methods based on mixed-integer programming (MIP) can be used. However, the known MIP-based methods are either limited to a special class of functions, e.g., convex piecewise affine functions, or they lead to complex approximations in terms of the number of regions of the piecewise defined function. Both complicate a usage in the framework of control. We propose a new MIP-based method that is not restricted to a particular class of piecewise defined functions and leads to functions that are fast to evaluate and can be used within an optimization problem, making them well suited for use in control.</description>

      <title>Optimal control of a non-smooth elliptic PDE with non-linear term acting on the control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper continues the investigations from [7] and it is concerned with the derivation of first-order conditions for a control constrained optimization problem governed by a nonsmooth elliptic PDE. The control appears in the state equation as the argument of a regularization of the Heaviside function, while the nonsmoothness is locally Lipschitz-continuous and directionally differentiable. Because of the lack of G\^ateaux-differentiability, the application of standard adjoint calculus is excluded. We derive conditions under which a strong stationary optimality system can be established, i.e., a system that is equivalent to the purely primal optimality condition saying that the directional derivative of the reduced objective in feasible directions is nonnegative. For this, two assumptions are made on the unknown optimizer. These are fulfilled if the non-smoothness is locally convex around its non-differentiable points and if an estimate involving only the given data is true. The presented findings open the door to future research regarding limit optimality systems for non-smooth shape optimization problems [7].</description>

      <title>Maximum stress minimization via data-driven multifidelity topology design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum stress minimization problem is among the most important topics for structural design. The conventional gradient-based topology optimization methods require transforming the original problem into a pseudo-problem by relaxation techniques. Since their parameters significantly influence optimization, accurately solving the maximum stress minimization problem without using relaxation techniques is expected to achieve extreme performance. This paper focuses on this challenge and investigates whether designs with more avoided stress concentrations can be obtained by solving the original maximum stress minimization problem without relaxation techniques, compared to the solutions obtained by gradient-based topology optimization. We employ data-driven multifidelity topology design (MFTD), a gradient-free topology optimization based on evolutionary algorithms. The basic framework involves generating candidate solutions by solving a low-fidelity optimization problem, evaluating these solutions through high-fidelity forward analysis, and iteratively updating them using a deep generative model without sensitivity analysis. In this study, data-driven MFTD incorporates the optimized designs obtained by solving a gradient-based topology optimization problem with the p-norm stress measure in the initial solutions and solves the original maximum stress minimization problem based on a high-fidelity analysis with a body-fitted mesh. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through the benchmark of L-bracket. As a result of solving the original maximum stress minimization problem with data-driven MFTD, a volume reduction of up to 22.6% was achieved under the same maximum stress value, compared to the initial solution.</description>

      <title>Who Goes Next? Optimizing the Allocation of Adherence-Improving Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-term adherence to medication is a critical factor in preventing chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. To address poor adherence, physicians may recommend adherence-improving interventions; however, such interventions are costly and limited in their availability. Knowing which patients will stop adhering helps distribute the available resources more effectively. We developed a binary integer program (BIP) model to select patients for adherence-improving intervention under budget constraints. We further studied a long-term adherence prediction model using dynamic logistic regression (DLR) model that uses patients' claim data, medical health factors, demographics, and monitoring frequencies to predict the risk of future non-adherence. We trained and tested our predictive model to longitudinal data for cardiovascular disease in a large cohort of patients taking medication for cholesterol control seen in the national Veterans Affairs health system. Our study shows the importance of including past adherence to increase prediction accuracy. Finally, we assess the potential benefits of using the prediction model by proposing an algorithm that combines the DLR and BIP models to decrease the number of CVD events in a population.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to stabilise a solution to equations describing the interface of thin liquid films falling under gravity with a finite number of actuators and restricted observations. As for many complex systems, full observation of the system state is challenging in physical settings, so methods able to take this into account are important. The Navier-Stokes equations modelling the flow are a complex, highly nonlinear set of PDEs, so standard control theoretical results are not applicable. Instead, we chain together a hierarchy of increasingly idealised approximations, developing a control strategy for the simplified model which is shown to be successfully applied to simulations of the full system.</description>

We first use a discrete time deterministic optimal control problem interpretation of the time discretization scheme, and show that the discrete time value function is semiconcave under regularity assumptions on the dynamics and the boundary of target set. We establish a convergence rate of order $1$ in terms of time step based on this semiconcavity property. Then, we use a discrete time stochastic optimal control interpretation of the full discretization scheme, and we establish a convergence rate of order $1$ in terms of both time and spatial steps using certain interpolation operators, under further regularity assumptions. We extend our convergence results to problems with particular state constraints. We apply our results to analyze the convergence rate and computational complexity of the fast-marching method. We also consider the multi-level fast-marching method recently introduced by the authors.</description>

      <title>On the Scientific Method: The Role of Hypotheses and Involved Mathematics</title>

Abstract: Many scientific problems aim to evaluate the function fo relating variables u and y measured from a physical phenomenon. An exact knowledge of fo cannot be expected, and many methods are used for deriving approximate functions fa giving small error fo-fa. It is shown that deriving functions fa having finite error is not possible using measured data only, and hypothesis, i.e., assumptions, on the function fo and on the disturbances corrupting the measurements must be introduced. Two main classes of assumptions are used in the literature. The most widely used is the Parametric Stochastic class, where fo is assumed to be a function depending on a vector p and disturbances are stochastic variables. In last decades, assumptions belonging to Set Membership class have been investigated, where fo is assumed to a smooth function with bounded smoothness parameter and disturbances are bounded variables. At first, it is shown that SM methods achieve "theoretical" properties (e.g., finding fa with known and minimal error error, if assumptions hold) for general nonlinear assumptions on function fo, while are achieved by PS methods under very restricted assumptions on fo. Then, it is proved that no method can be found for validating PS or SM assumptions, so that at best the chosen assumptions can be falsified, i.e. recognized not true. No falsification test of PS assumptions is known, for general nonlinear assumptions on fo. A falsification test of SM assumptions is proposed. Finally, the new class of Physical Set Membership assumptions is proposed, able to integrate the information provided by a function fp obtained by a PS method, with a suitably designed SM method. It is shown that PSM methods enjoy the strong results of SM methods on theoretical properties and assumption falsification, and that, making use of the information provided by fp, may be more accurate than using only SM assumptions.</description>

      <title>Discounted Pseudocosts in MILP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the concept of discounted pseudocosts, inspired by discounted total reward in reinforcement learning, and explore their application in mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Traditional pseudocosts estimate changes in the objective function due to variable bound changes during the branch-and-bound process. By integrating reinforcement learning concepts, we propose a novel approach incorporating a forward-looking perspective into pseudocost estimation. We present the motivation behind discounted pseudocosts and discuss how they represent the anticipated reward for branching after one level of exploration in the MILP problem space. Initial experiments on MIPLIB 2017 benchmark instances demonstrate the potential of discounted pseudocosts to enhance branching strategies and accelerate the solution process for challenging MILP problems.</description>

      <title>Limits and Powers of Koopman Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems provide a comprehensive way to study complex and changing behaviors across various sciences. Many modern systems are too complicated to analyze directly or we do not have access to models, driving significant interest in learning methods. Koopman operators have emerged as a dominant approach because they allow the study of nonlinear dynamics using linear techniques by solving an infinite-dimensional spectral problem. However, current algorithms face challenges such as lack of convergence, hindering practical progress. This paper addresses a fundamental open question: \textit{When can we robustly learn the spectral properties of Koopman operators from trajectory data of dynamical systems, and when can we not?} Understanding these boundaries is crucial for analysis, applications, and designing algorithms. We establish a foundational approach that combines computational analysis and ergodic theory, revealing the first fundamental barriers -- universal for any algorithm -- associated with system geometry and complexity, regardless of data quality and quantity. For instance, we demonstrate well-behaved smooth dynamical systems on tori where non-trivial eigenfunctions of the Koopman operator cannot be determined by any sequence of (even randomized) algorithms, even with unlimited training data. Additionally, we identify when learning is possible and introduce optimal algorithms with verification that overcome issues in standard methods. These results pave the way for a sharp classification theory of data-driven dynamical systems based on how many limits are needed to solve a problem. These limits characterize all previous methods, presenting a unified view. Our framework systematically determines when and how Koopman spectral properties can be learned.</description>

      <title>CONGO: Compressive Online Gradient Optimization with Application to Microservices Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of online convex optimization where the objective function's gradient exhibits sparsity, indicating that only a small number of dimensions possess non-zero gradients. Our aim is to leverage this sparsity to obtain useful estimates of the objective function's gradient even when the only information available is a limited number of function samples. Our motivation stems from distributed queueing systems like microservices-based applications, characterized by request-response workloads. Here, each request type proceeds through a sequence of microservices to produce a response, and the resource allocation across the collection of microservices is controlled to balance end-to-end latency with resource costs. While the number of microservices is substantial, the latency function primarily reacts to resource changes in a few, rendering the gradient sparse. Our proposed method, CONGO (Compressive Online Gradient Optimization), combines simultaneous perturbation with compressive sensing to estimate gradients. We establish analytical bounds on the requisite number of compressive sensing samples per iteration to maintain bounded bias of gradient estimates, ensuring sub-linear regret. By exploiting sparsity, we reduce the samples required per iteration to match the gradient's sparsity, rather than the problem's original dimensionality. Numerical experiments and real-world microservices benchmarks demonstrate CONGO's superiority over multiple stochastic gradient descent approaches, as it quickly converges to performance comparable to policies pre-trained with workload awareness.</description>

      <title>Fast Distributed Optimization over Directed Graphs under Malicious Attacks using Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Resilient Projected Push-Pull (RP3) algorithm designed for distributed optimization in multi-agent cyber-physical systems with directed communication graphs and the presence of malicious agents. Our algorithm leverages stochastic inter-agent trust values and gradient tracking to achieve geometric convergence rates in expectation even in adversarial environments. We introduce growing constraint sets to limit the impact of the malicious agents without compromising the geometric convergence rate of the algorithm. We prove that RP3 converges to the nominal optimal solution almost surely and in the $r$-th mean for any $r\geq 1$, provided the step sizes are sufficiently small and the constraint sets are appropriately chosen. We validate our approach with numerical studies on average consensus and multi-robot target tracking problems, demonstrating that RP3 effectively mitigates the impact of malicious agents and achieves the desired geometric convergence.</description>

      <title>Multilevel quadrature formulae for the optimal control of random PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a framework for using multilevel quadrature formulae to compute the solution of optimal control problems constrained by random partial differential equations. Our approach consists in solving a sequence of optimal control problems discretized with different levels of accuracy of the physical and probability discretizations. The final approximation of the control is then obtained in a postprocessing step, by suitably combining the adjoint variables computed on the different levels. We present a convergence analysis for an unconstrained linear quadratic problem, and detail our framework for the specific case of a Multilevel Monte Carlo quadrature formula. Numerical experiments confirm the better computational complexity of our MLMC approach compared to a standard Monte Carlo sample average approximation, even beyond the theoretical assumptions.</description>

Abstract: Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a common mathematical model for sequential decision-making problems. In this paper, we present a new geometric interpretation of MDP, which is useful for analyzing the dynamics of main MDP algorithms. Based on this interpretation, we demonstrate that MDPs can be split into equivalence classes with indistinguishable algorithm dynamics. The related normalization procedure allows for the design of a new class of MDP-solving algorithms that find optimal policies without computing policy values.</description>

      <title>Efficient nonlocal linear image denoising: Bilevel optimization with Nonequispaced Fast Fourier Transform and matrix-free preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach for nonlocal image denoising, based around the application of an unnormalized extended Gaussian ANOVA kernel within a bilevel optimization algorithm. A critical bottleneck when solving such problems for finely-resolved images is the solution of huge-scale, dense linear systems arising from the minimization of an energy term. We tackle this using a Krylov subspace approach, with a Nonequispaced Fast Fourier Transform utilized to approximate matrix-vector products in a matrix-free manner. We accelerate the algorithm using a novel change of basis approach to account for the (known) smallest eigenvalue-eigenvector pair of the matrices involved, coupled with a simple but frequently very effective diagonal preconditioning approach. We present a number of theoretical results concerning the eigenvalues and predicted convergence behavior, and a range of numerical experiments which validate our solvers and use them to tackle parameter learning problems. These demonstrate that very large problems may be effectively and rapidly denoised with very low storage requirements on a computer.</description>

      <title>A Complete Set of Quadratic Constraints For Repeated ReLU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper derives a complete set of quadratic constraints (QCs) for the repeated ReLU. The complete set of QCs is described by a collection of $2^{n_v}$ matrix copositivity conditions where $n_v$ is the dimension of the repeated ReLU. We also show that only two functions satisfy all QCs in our complete set: the repeated ReLU and a repeated "flipped" ReLU. Thus our complete set of QCs bounds the repeated ReLU as tight as possible up to the sign invariance inherent in quadratic forms. We derive a similar complete set of incremental QCs for repeated ReLU, which can potentially lead to less conservative Lipschitz bounds for ReLU networks than the standard LipSDP approach. Finally, we illustrate the use of the complete set of QCs to assess stability and performance for recurrent neural networks with ReLU activation functions. The stability/performance condition combines Lyapunov/dissipativity theory with the QCs for repeated ReLU. A numerical implementation is given and demonstrated via a simple example.</description>

      <title>Chance-Constrained Energy Storage Pricing for Social Welfare Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework to price energy storage in economic dispatch with a social welfare maximization objective. This framework can be utilized by power system operators to generate default bids for storage or to benchmark market power in bids submitted by storage participants. We derive a theoretical framework based on a two-stage chance-constrained formulation which systematically incorporates system balance constraints and uncertainty considerations. We present tractable reformulations for the joint chance constraints. Analytical results show that the storage opportunity cost is convex and increases with greater net load uncertainty. We also show that the storage opportunity prices are bounded and are linearly coupled with future energy and reserve prices. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on an ISO-NE test system and compare it with a price-taker storage profit-maximizing bidding model. Simulation results show that the proposed market design reduces electricity payments by an average of 17.4% and system costs by 3.9% while reducing storage's profit margins, and these reductions scale up with the renewable and storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Stabilized Proximal-Point Methods for Federated Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In developing efficient optimization algorithms, it is crucial to account for communication constraints -- a significant challenge in modern federated learning settings. The best-known communication complexity among non-accelerated algorithms is achieved by DANE, a distributed proximal-point algorithm that solves local subproblems in each iteration and that can exploit second-order similarity among individual functions. However, to achieve such communication efficiency, the accuracy requirement for solving the local subproblems is slightly sub-optimal. Inspired by the hybrid projection-proximal point method, in this work, we i) propose a novel distributed algorithm S-DANE. This method adopts a more stabilized prox-center in the proximal step compared with DANE, and matches its deterministic communication complexity. Moreover, the accuracy condition of the subproblem is milder, leading to enhanced local computation efficiency. Furthermore, it supports partial client participation and arbitrary stochastic local solvers, making it more attractive in practice. We further ii) accelerate S-DANE, and show that the resulting algorithm achieves the best-known communication complexity among all existing methods for distributed convex optimization, with the same improved local computation efficiency as S-DANE.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Level Fast-Marching Method For The Minimum Time Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new numerical method to approximate the solutions of a class of stationary Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equations arising from minimum time optimal control problems. We rely on nested grid approximations, and look for the optimal trajectories by using the coarse grid approximations to reduce the search space in fine grids. This provides an infinitesimal version of the ``highway hierarchy'' method which has been developed to solve shortest path problems (with discrete time and discrete state). We obtain, for each level, an approximate value function on a sub-domain of the state space. We show that the sequence obtained in this way does converge to the viscosity solution of the HJ equation. Moreover, for our multi-level algorithm, if $0&lt;\gamma \leq 1$ is the convergence rate of the classical numerical scheme, then the number of arithmetic operations needed to obtain an error in $O(\varepsilon)$ is in $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-\theta })$, with $\theta&lt; \frac{d}{\gamma}$, to be compared with $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-d/ \gamma})$ for ordinary grid-based methods. Here $d$ is the dimension of the problem, $\theta $ depends on $d,\gamma$ and on the ``stiffness" of the value function around optimal trajectories, and the notation $\widetilde{O}$ ignores logarithmic factors. In particular, in typical smooth cases, one has $\gamma=1$ and $\theta=(d+1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Anytime Solvers for Variational Inequalities: the (Recursive) Safe Monotone Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper synthesizes anytime algorithms, in the form of continuous-time dynamical systems, to solve monotone variational inequalities. We introduce three algorithms that solve this problem: the projected monotone flow, the safe monotone flow, and the recursive safe monotone flow. The first two systems admit dual interpretations: either as projected dynamical systems or as dynamical systems controlled with a feedback controller synthesized using techniques from safety-critical control. The third flow bypasses the need to solve quadratic programs along the trajectories by incorporating a dynamics whose equilibria precisely correspond to such solutions, and interconnecting the dynamical systems on different time scales. We perform a thorough analysis of the dynamical properties of all three systems. For the safe monotone flow, we show that equilibria correspond exactly with critical points of the original problem, and the constraint set is forward invariant and asymptotically stable. The additional assumption of convexity and monotonicity allows us to derive global stability guarantees, as well as establish the system is contracting when the constraint set is polyhedral. For the recursive safe monotone flow, we use tools from singular perturbation theory for contracting systems to show KKT points are locally exponentially stable and globally attracting, and obtain practical safety guarantees. We illustrate the performance of the flows on a two-player game example and also demonstrate the versatility for interconnection and regulation of dynamical processes of the safe monotone flow in an example of a receding horizon linear quadratic dynamic game.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Chambolle-Pock Algorithm in the Absence of Monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chambolle-Pock algorithm (CPA), also known as the primal-dual hybrid gradient method, has gained popularity over the last decade due to its success in solving large-scale convex structured problems. This work extends its convergence analysis for problems with varying degrees of (non)monotonicity, quantified through a so-called oblique weak Minty condition on the associated primal-dual operator. Our results reveal novel stepsize and relaxation parameter ranges which do not only depend on the norm of the linear mapping, but also on its other singular values. In particular, in nonmonotone settings, in addition to the classical stepsize conditions, extra bounds on the stepsizes and relaxation parameters are required. On the other hand, in the strongly monotone setting, the relaxation parameter is allowed to exceed the classical upper bound of two. Moreover, we build upon the recently introduced class of semimonotone operators, providing sufficient convergence conditions for CPA when the individual operators are semimonotone. Since this class of operators encompasses traditional operator classes including (hypo)- and co(hypo)-monotone operators, this analysis recovers and extends existing results for CPA. Tightness of the proposed stepsize ranges is demonstrated through several examples.</description>

      <title>Cuts and semidefinite liftings for the complex cut polytope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the complex cut polytope: the convex hull of Hermitian rank 1 matrices $xx^{\mathrm{H}}$, where the elements of $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ are $m$th unit roots. These polytopes have applications in ${\text{MAX-3-CUT}}$, digital communication technology, angular synchronization and more generally, complex quadratic programming. For ${m=2}$, the complex cut polytope corresponds to the well-known cut polytope. We generalize valid cuts for this polytope to cuts for any complex cut polytope with finite $m&gt;2$ and provide a framework to compare them. Further, we consider a second semidefinite lifting of the complex cut polytope for $m=\infty$. This lifting is proven to be equivalent to other complex Lasserre-type liftings of the same order proposed in the literature, while being of smaller size. We also prove that a second semidefinite lifting of the complex cut polytope for $n = m=3$ is exact. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments on various optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: We present in this paper novel accelerated fully first-order methods in \emph{Bilevel Optimization} (BLO). Firstly, for BLO under the assumption that the lower-level functions admit the typical strong convexity assumption, the \emph{(Perturbed) Restarted Accelerated Fully First-order methods for Bilevel Approximation} (\texttt{PRAF${}^2$BA}) algorithm leveraging \emph{fully} first-order oracles is proposed, whereas the algorithm for finding approximate first-order and second-order stationary points with state-of-the-art oracle query complexities in solving complex optimization tasks. Secondly, applying as a special case of BLO the \emph{nonconvex-strongly-convex} (NCSC) minimax optimization, \texttt{PRAF${}^2$BA} rediscovers \emph{perturbed restarted accelerated gradient descent ascent} (\texttt{PRAGDA}) that achieves the state-of-the-art complexity for finding approximate second-order stationary points. Additionally, we investigate the challenge of finding stationary points of the hyper-objective function in BLO when lower-level functions lack the typical strong convexity assumption, where we identify several regularity conditions of the lower-level problems that ensure tractability and present hardness results indicating the intractability of BLO for general convex lower-level functions. Under these regularity conditions we propose the \emph{Inexact Gradient-Free Method} (\texttt{IGFM}), utilizing the \emph{Switching Gradient Method} (\texttt{SGM}) as an efficient sub-routine to find an approximate stationary point of the hyper-objective in polynomial time. Empirical studies for real-world problems are provided to further validate the outperformance of our proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Bucketized Active Sampling for Learning ACOPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07497v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers optimization proxies for Optimal Power Flow (OPF), i.e., machine-learning models that approximate the input/output relationship of OPF. Recent work has focused on showing that such proxies can be of high fidelity. However, their training requires significant data, each instance necessitating the (offline) solving of an OPF. To meet the requirements of market-clearing applications, this paper proposes Bucketized Active Sampling (BAS), a novel active learning framework that aims at training the best possible OPF proxy within a time limit. BAS partitions the input domain into buckets and uses an acquisition function to determine where to sample next. By applying the same partitioning to the validation set, BAS leverages labeled validation samples in the selection of unlabeled samples. BAS also relies on an adaptive learning rate that increases and decreases over time. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of BAS.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Stochastic Optimisation for Large-Scale Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06342</link>

Abstract: Stochastic optimisation algorithms are the de facto standard for machine learning with large amounts of data. Handling only a subset of available data in each optimisation step dramatically reduces the per-iteration computational costs, while still ensuring significant progress towards the solution. Driven by the need to solve large-scale optimisation problems as efficiently as possible, the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in this area. Leveraging the parallels between machine learning and inverse problems has allowed harnessing the power of this research wave for solving inverse problems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in stochastic optimisation from the viewpoint of inverse problems. We present algorithms with diverse modalities of problem randomisation and discuss the roles of variance reduction, acceleration, higher-order methods, and other algorithmic modifications, and compare theoretical results with practical behaviour. We focus on the potential and the challenges for stochastic optimisation that are unique to inverse imaging problems and are not commonly encountered in machine learning. We conclude the survey with illustrative examples from imaging problems to examine the advantages and disadvantages that this new generation of algorithms bring to the field of inverse problems.</description>
