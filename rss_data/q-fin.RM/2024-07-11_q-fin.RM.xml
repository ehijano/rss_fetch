      <title>Multiple split approach -- multidimensional probabilistic forecasting of electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a multiple split method is proposed that enables construction of multidimensional probabilistic forecasts of a selected set of variables. The method uses repeated resampling to estimate uncertainty of simultaneous multivariate predictions. This nonparametric approach links the gap between point and probabilistic predictions and can be combined with different point forecasting methods. The performance of the method is evaluated with data describing the German short-term electricity market. The results show that the proposed approach provides highly accurate predictions. The gains from multidimensional forecasting are the largest when functions of variables, such as price spread or residual load, are considered.
  Finally, the method is used to support a decision process of a moderate generation utility that produces electricity from wind energy and sells it on either a day-ahead or an intraday market. The company makes decisions under high uncertainty because it knows neither the future production level nor the prices. We show that joint forecasting of both market prices and fundamentals can be used to predict the distribution of a profit, and hence helps to design a strategy that balances a level of income and a trading risk.</description>

      <title>Interbank network reconstruction enforcing density and reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of financial exposures are the key propagators of risk and distress among banks, but their empirical structure is not publicly available because of confidentiality. This limitation has triggered the development of methods of network reconstruction from partial, aggregate information. Unfortunately, even the best methods available fail in replicating the number of directed cycles, which on the other hand play a crucial role in determining graph spectra and hence the degree of network stability and systemic risk. Here we address this challenge by exploiting the hypothesis that the statistics of higher-order cycles is strongly constrained by that of the shortest ones, i.e. by the amount of dyads with reciprocated links. First, we provide a detailed analysis of link reciprocity on the e-MID dataset of Italian banks, finding that correlations between reciprocal links systematically increase with the temporal resolution, typically changing from negative to positive around a timescale of up to 50 days. Then, we propose a new network reconstruction method capable of enforcing, only from the knowledge of aggregate interbank assets and liabilities, both a desired sparsity and a desired link reciprocity. We confirm that the addition of reciprocity dramatically improves the prediction of several structural and spectral network properties, including the largest real eigenvalue and the eccentricity of the elliptical distribution of the other eigenvalues in the complex plane. These results illustrate the importance of correctly addressing the temporal resolution and the resulting level of reciprocity in the reconstruction of financial networks.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model in Financial Regulatory Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the innovative use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as analytical tools for interpreting complex financial regulations. The primary objective is to design effective prompts that guide LLMs in distilling verbose and intricate regulatory texts, such as the Basel III capital requirement regulations, into a concise mathematical framework that can be subsequently translated into actionable code. This novel approach aims to streamline the implementation of regulatory mandates within the financial reporting and risk management systems of global banking institutions. A case study was conducted to assess the performance of various LLMs, demonstrating that GPT-4 outperforms other models in processing and collecting necessary information, as well as executing mathematical calculations. The case study utilized numerical simulations with asset holdings -- including fixed income, equities, currency pairs, and commodities -- to demonstrate how LLMs can effectively implement the Basel III capital adequacy requirements.
