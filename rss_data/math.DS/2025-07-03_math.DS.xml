      <title>Investigations of Complex Systems' Dynamics Based on a Reduced Amount of Information -- Part 3: Dynamical Phenomena Indicator -- The Fastest and Most Universal Approach for Analyzing the Dynamics of Networks of Coupled Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we have demonstrated that our approach is a highly effective tool while analysing complex phenomena existing in networks of coupled nonlinear systems. In the present article we present the results of our investigations into a specific aspect of the presented method. We prove its effectiveness while applying for fast investigations of complex systems and easy detection of different uncommon dynamical phenomena states. We also extend our method introducing new Dynamical Phenomena Indicator (DPI), designed especially for effective detection of complex dynamical phenomena states in the wide range of the parameters of complex networks of coupled nonlinear systems.
  Contrary to commonly applied methods, the proposed approach allows for identification of complex dynamical phenomena long before stabilization of the system. The method bases on early signalized tendency of the system to split its dynamics to separately synchronized subsystems. The most important fact is that proposed approach is highly universal and can be applied for both, symmetrical and non-symmetrical topologies of coupling as well as networks of identical and non-identical oscillators. Moreover, since DPI values are obtained from the current state of dynamical system given by values of the system variables, proposed method of fast searching has a huge potential for experimental application. Following this reasoning the presented results can be treated both as exemplary numerical investigations and analysis of experimentally obtained results.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Closed Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper generalizes the classical notion of turbulence from dynamical systems generated by continuous functions to those defined by closed relations on compact metric spaces. Using the Mahavier product and the associated shift map, we introduce and explore CR-turbulence and reverse CR-turbulence, analyzing their relationship to topological entropy. A key focus is understanding when turbulence implies entropy and vice versa, with results showing that for finite closed relations, these properties are equivalent. However, examples are provided to demonstrate that this equivalence can fail for more general relations.
  We also construct a large class of explicit turbulent closed relations on the unit interval that are dynamically rich yet structurally simple. Additionally, since homeomorphisms cannot admit turbulence, we investigate a weakened notion of turbulence: separated, continuum-wise semi-turbulence for homeomorphisms, and then prove that smooth fans cannot support even this weaker form of turbulent dynamics. The paper includes new examples, counterexamples, and open questions that deepen the understanding of turbulence in non-classical settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of dynamical systems involves analyzing how functions behave under iteration in different mathematical spaces. In the context of complex dynamics, tools such as Julia sets and filled Julia sets are used to understand the long-term behavior of functions in the complex Euclidean field. In this paper, we will present a review of Julia sets and filled Julia sets, provide an overview of the mathematical formulation of the alternate Julia set introduced in the work of Danca-Romera-Pastor, extend it to the $p$-adic setting, and propose a tool that can potentially be used to study the arithmetic dynamics of various types of functions. Additionally, we will summarize key results on connectivity properties and visualization techniques as discussed in the work of Danca-Bourke-Romera and provide a visualization algorithm and pseudocode that enable the visualization of alternate Julia sets with various connectivity properties.</description>

      <title>Curvature Rigidity Through Level Sets of Lyapunov Exponents in Geodesic Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish new geometric rigidity results through the study of Lyapunov exponent level sets via invariant measures. First, we prove that for a manifold $M$ without focal points, if the zero Lyapunov exponent level set has full measure with respect to a fully supported invariant measure, then $M$ must be flat. This result recovers and extends a result of Freire and Ma\~n\'e (cf. [9]). Second, we prove that if the level set of the Lyapunov exponents has full measure with respect to some fully supported measure, then the sectional curvature must be constant. This advances the resolution of Conjecture 1 in [17]. Furthermore, we establish curvature relationships between manifolds with $1$-equivalent geodesic flows, yielding a new criterion to obstruct smooth conjugacy for flows on manifolds without conjugate points. Our techniques provide unified proofs for all rigidity results in [17] as corollaries, and additionally yield rigidity theorems for totally geodesic submanifolds in settings without conjugate points. Notably, several key results hold without compactness assumptions.</description>

      <title>XPPLORE: Import, visualize, and analyze XPPAUT data in MATLAB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of ordinary differential equation (ODE) dynamical systems, particularly in applied disciplines such as mathematical biology and neuroscience, often requires flexible computational workflows tailored to model-specific questions. XPPAUT is a widely used tool combining numerical integration and continuation methods. Various XPPAUT toolboxes have emerged to customize analyses, however, they typically rely on summary '.dat' files and cannot parse the more informative '.auto' files, which contain detailed continuation data, e.g. periodic orbits and boundary value problem solutions. We present XPPLORE, a user-friendly and structured MATLAB toolbox overcoming this limitation through the handling of '.auto' files. This free software enables post-processing of continuation results, facilitates analyses such as manifold reconstruction and averaging, and it supports the creation of high-quality visualizations suitable for scientific publications. This paper introduces the core data structures of XPPLORE and demonstrates the software's exploration capabilities, highlighting its value as a customizable and accessible extension for researchers working with ODE-based dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an aperiodic subshift of finite type Y and for a subshift X with topological entropy less than the topological entropy of Y, it was proved in Krieger: On the subsystems of topological Markov chains, Ergodic theory and dynamical systems 1982, 2, 195-202, that the necessary condition on the periodic points of X and Y for the existence of an embedding of X int Y is also sufficient for the existence of an embedding of X into Y. In this note we extend this theorem to a certain class of almost Markov shifts as target shifts.</description>

      <title>Coexistence and Extinction in Flow-Kick Systems: An invasion growth rate approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Populations experience a complex interplay of continuous and discrete processes: continuous growth and interactions are punctuated by discrete reproduction events, dispersal, and external disturbances. These dynamics can be modeled by impulsive or flow-kick systems, where continuous flows alternate with instantaneous discrete changes. To study species persistence in these systems, an invasion growth rate theory is developed for flow-kick models with state-dependent timing of kicks and auxiliary variables. The invasion growth rates are Lyapunov exponents characterizing the average per-capita growth of species when rare. Two theorems are proven to characterize permanence i.e. the extinction set is a repellor. The first theorem uses Morse decompositions of the extinction set and requires that there exists a species with a positive invasion growth rate for every invariant measure supported on a component of the Morse decomposition. The second theorem uses invasion growth rates to define invasion graphs whose vertices correspond to communities and directed edges to potential invasions. Provided the invasion graph is acyclic, permanence is fully characterized by the signs of the invasion growth rates. Invasion growth rates are also used to identify the existence of extinction-bound trajectories and attractors that lie on the extinction set. The results are illustrated with three applications: (i) a microbial serial transfer model, (ii) a spatially structured consumer-resource model, and (iii) an empirically parameterized Lotka-Volterra model. Mathematical challenges and promising biological applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Operator-Theoretic Methods for Differential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential game theory offers an approach for modeling interactions between two or more agents that occur in continuous time. The goal of each agent is to optimize its objective cost functional. In this paper, we present two different methods, based on the Koopman Operator (KO), to solve a zero-sum differential game. The first approach uses the resolvent of the KO to calculate a continuous-time global feedback solution over the entire domain. The second approach uses a discrete-time, data-driven KO representation with control to calculate open-loop control policies one trajectory at a time. We demonstrate these methods on a turret defense game from the literature, and we find that the methods' solutions replicate the behavior of the analytical solution provided in the literature.. Following that demonstration, we highlight the relative advantages and disadvantages of each method and discuss potential future work for this line of research.</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems for McKean--Vlasov SDEs via rough path theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of random dynamical systems for McKean--Vlasov SDEs is established. This is approached by considering the joint dynamics of the corresponding nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation governing the law of the system and the underlying stochastic differential equation (SDE) as a dynamical system on the product space $\RR^d \times \mathcal{P}(\RR^d)$.
  The proof relies on two main ingredients: At the level of the SDE, a pathwise rough path-based solution theory for SDEs with time-dependent coefficients is implemented, while at the level of the PDE a well-posedness theory is developed, for measurable solutions and allowing for degenerate diffusion coefficients.
  The results apply in particular to the so-called ensemble Kalman sampler (EKS), proving the existence of an associated RDS under some assumptions on the posterior, as well as to the Lagrangian formulation of the Landau equation with Maxwell molecules. As a by-product of the main results, the uniqueness of solutions non-linear Fokker--Planck equations associated to the EKS is shown.</description>

      <title>Maximal stretch and Lipschitz maps on Riemannian manifolds of negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his seminal work on Teichm\"uller spaces (\cite{Th98}), Thurston introduced the maximal stretch for a pair of hyperbolic metrics on a closed surface of genus $\geq 2$ and showed that the logarithm of this quantity induces an asymmetric metric in the Teichm\"uller space. He also showed that the subset of the surface on which the maximal stretch is attained is a geodesic lamination. In this paper, we define the maximal stretch analogously for closed manifolds equipped with Riemannian metrics of variable negative curvature and investigate the structure of the related Mather set on the unit tangent bundle. In contrast to the Teichm\"uller space, the Mather set may not be lifts of geodesic laminations in this broader setting. However, in our paper, we will discuss similar features shared by the Mather set with geodesic laminations. We also connect the study of the Mather set with the theory of best Lipschitz maps.</description>

Abstract: We consider families of coded systems that contain the Dyck shifts and that are closed under topological conjugacy. We introduce a notion of hyposynchronization of subshifts. We introduce a notion of restricted complexity of hyposynchronizing subshifts. Restricted complexity of hyyposynchronizing subshift is not invariant under topological conjugacy. We construct explicitly a family of hyposynchronizing subshifts of restricted complexity that extends the family of Dyck shifts. The subshifts in this family are characterized by their restricted complexity in conjunction with a certain set of invariants of topological conjugacy that inclufdes the Artin-Mazur zeta function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tricorn, the connectedness locus of the anti-holomorphic quadratic family, is known to be non-locally connected. The boundary of every hyperbolic component of odd period contains arcs that are inaccessible from the complement of the tricorn. As the period increases, the decorations become more and more complicated, and it seems natural to think that every hyperbolic component of sufficiently large and odd period is inaccessible. Contrary to this expectation, we show that the tricorn contains infinitely many hyperbolic components that are accessible from the complement.</description>

      <title>Directional Expansiveness for Rd-Actions and for Penrose Tilings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study two kinds of directional expansiveness, weak and strong, for an action T of \mathbb{R}^d on a compact metric space X. We show that for \mathbb{R}^2 finite local complexity (FLC) tiling dynamical systems, weak and strong expansiveness are the same, and are both equivalent to a simple coding property. Then we show for the Penrose tiling dynamical system, which is FLC, there are exactly five non expansive directions, the directions perpendicular to the 5th roots of unity. We also study Raphael Robinson's set of 24 Penrose Wang tiles and show the corresponding Penrose Wang tile dynamical system is strictly ergodic. Finally, we study two deformations of the Penrose Wang tile system, one where the square Wang tiles are all deformed into a 2\pi/5 rhombus, and another where they are deformed into a set of eleven tetragon tiles. We show both of these are topologically conjugate to the Penrose tiling dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Asymptotic Robustness in Biochemical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems maintain stable internal states despite environmental fluctuations. Absolute concentration robustness (ACR) is a striking homeostatic phenomenon in which the steady-state concentration of a molecular species remains invariant to changes in total molecular supply. Although experimental studies have reported approximate-but not exact-robustness in steady-state concentrations, such behavior has often been attributed to exact ACR motifs perturbed by measurement noise or minor side reactions, rather than recognized as a structural property of the network itself. In this work, we highlight a previously underappreciated phenomenon, which we term asymptotic ACR (aACR): approximate robustness can emerge solely from the architecture of the reaction network, without requiring parameters being negligible or the presence of an exact ACR motif. We find that aACR is far more common than classical ACR, as demonstrated in systems such as the Escherichia coli EnvZ-OmpR system and MAPK signaling cascade. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that such ubiquity stems solely from network structure. Finally, we reveal a counterintuitive feature of aACR in systems with multiple conserved quantities, revealing subtle distinctions in how robustness manifests in complex biochemical networks.</description>

      <title>FitzHugh-Nagumo equation: from global dynamics to slow-fast system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We concentrate our attention on the qualitative study of the phase portraits of the three-parameter FitzHugh-Nagumo family and its compactification. We divide the study into three scenarios based on the parameters. One of the scenarios is characterised by the existence of a double-zero bifurcation with Z2 symmetry (a singularity of codimension two). In this case, we explicitly exhibit the pitchfork, Hopf, Belyakov, and double homoclinic bifurcation/transition curves unfolding the singularity of codimension two and plot the bifurcation diagrams. We bridge this analysis with the theory on the associated slow-fast family and the existence of canards. We complete our study with the global compactification of the phase portraits for the family under consideration. This study complements the work summarised in Georgescu, Rocsoreanu and Giurgic Teanu, "Global Bifurcations in FitzHugh-Nagumo Model", Trends in Mathematics: Bifurcations, Symmetry and Patterns (2003).</description>

Abstract: Model-free forecasting of the temporal evolution of chaotic systems is crucial but challenging. Existing solutions require hyperparameter tuning, significantly hindering their wider adoption. In this work, we introduce a tree-based approach not requiring hyperparameter tuning: TreeDOX. It uses time delay overembedding as explicit short-term memory and Extra-Trees Regressors to perform feature reduction and forecasting. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TreeDOX using the Henon map, Lorenz and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems, and the real-world Southern Oscillation Index.</description>

      <title>A $q$-weighted analogue of the Trollope-Delange formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $s(n)$ denote the number of "$1$"s in the dyadic representation of a positive integer $n$ and sequence $S(n) = s(1)+s(2)+\dots+s(n-1)$. The Trollope-Delange formula is a classic result that represents the sequence $S$ in terms of the Takagi function. This work extends the result by introducing a $q$-weighted analog of $s(n)$, deriving a variant of the Trollope-Delange formula for this generalization. We show that for $1/2&lt;|q|&lt; 1$, nondifferentiable Takagi-Landsberg functions appear, whereas for $|q|&gt;1$, the resulting functions are differentiable almost everywhere. We further show how the result can be used to find limiting curves describing fluctuations in the ergodic theorem for the dyadic odometer.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously structured compartmental models of epidemiological systems: from individual-level processes to population-scale dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general modelling framework for compartmental epidemiological systems structured by continuous variables which are linked to the levels of expression of compartment-specific traits. We start by formulating an individual-based model that describes the dynamics of single individuals in terms of stochastic processes. Then we formally derive: (i) the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which is formulated as a system of integro-differential equations for the distributions of individuals over the structuring-variable domains of the different compartments; (ii) the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a system of ordinary differential equations for the fractions of individuals in the different compartments and the mean levels of expression of the traits represented by the structuring variables. We employ a reduced version of the macroscopic model to obtain a general formula for the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, in terms of key parameters and functions of the underlying microscopic model, so as to illustrate how such a modelling framework makes it possible to draw connections between fundamental individual-level processes and population-scale dynamics. Finally we apply the modelling framework to case studies based on classical compartmental epidemiological systems, for each of which we report on Monte Carlo simulations of the individual-based model as well as on analytical results and numerical solutions of the macroscopic model.</description>
