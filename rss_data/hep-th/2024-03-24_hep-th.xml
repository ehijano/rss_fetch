      <title>Gravitational Duals from Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holography relates gravitational theories in five dimensions to four-dimensional quantum field theories in flat space. Under this map, the equation of state of the field theory is encoded in the black hole solutions of the gravitational theory. Solving the five-dimensional Einstein's equations to determine the equation of state is an algorithmic, direct problem. Determining the gravitational theory that gives rise to a prescribed equation of state is a much more challenging, inverse problem. We present a novel approach to solve this problem based on physics-informed neural networks. The resulting algorithm is not only data-driven but also informed by the physics of the Einstein's equations. We successfully apply it to theories with crossovers, first- and second-order phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Baby skyrmion crystals stabilized by vector mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter we study soliton crystals in the $(2+1)$-dimensional analogue model of the $(3+1)$-dimensional Adkins--Nappi model of nuclear physics. The baby $\omega$-Skyrme model studied here is an $O(3)$ nonlinear $\sigma$ model coupled to a massive vector meson, the $\omega$-meson. Using recently developed methods in the $(3+1)$-dimensional $\omega$-Skyrme model we are able to construct soliton crystals in this $(2+1)$-dimensional baby $\omega$-Skyrme model. The resulting crystals form a hexagonal lattice structure and are qualitatively and quantitatively similar to crystals observed in the standard baby Skyrme model.</description>

      <title>Non-holomorphic modular forms from zeta generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-holomorphic modular forms built from iterated integrals of holomorphic modular forms for SL$(2,\mathbb Z)$ known as equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals. A special subclass of them furnishes an equivalent description of the modular graph forms appearing in the low-energy expansion of string amplitudes at genus one. Notably the Fourier expansion of modular graph forms contains single-valued multiple zeta values. We deduce the appearance of products and higher-depth instances of multiple zeta values in equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals, and ultimately modular graph forms, from the appearance of simpler odd Riemann zeta values. This analysis relies on so-called zeta generators which act on certain non-commutative variables in the generating series of the iterated integrals. From an extension of these non-commutative variables we incorporate iterated integrals involving holomorphic cusp forms into our setup and use them to construct the modular completion of triple Eisenstein integrals. Our work represents a fully explicit realisation of the modular graph forms within Brown's framework of equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals and reveals structural analogies between single-valued period functions appearing in genus zero and one string amplitudes.</description>

      <title>de Sitter Connectivity from Holographic Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering two antipodal observers in de Sitter space, we illustrate how spacetime connectivity between the holographic screens located on the (stretched) horizons emerges from holographic entanglement. To do so, we construct a covariant holographic entanglement entropy prescription in de Sitter space, including quantum corrections. While this prescription is inspired by the bilayer proposal, we argue that the monolayer proposal appears to be inconsistent. Entanglement wedge reconstruction implies an extension of static patch holography where the exterior region connecting the static patches is included, and reconstructible from the two screens. A phase transition occurs where there is an exchange of dominance between two competing quantum extremal surfaces, leading to a transfer of the encoding of the exterior region from one screen to the other. The effects in the bulk of integrating out degrees of freedom from the screens are discussed.</description>

      <title>3d Modularity Revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The three-manifold topological invariants $\hat Z$ capture the half-index of the three-dimensional theory with ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetry obtained by compactifying the M5 brane theory on the closed three-manifold. In 2019, surprising general relations between the $\hat Z$-invariants, quantum modular forms, and vertex algebras, have been proposed. In the meanwhile, an extensive array of examples have been studied, but several general important structural questions remain. First, for many three-manifolds it was observed that the different $\hat Z$-invariants for the same three-manifolds are quantum modular forms that span a subspace of a Weil representation for the modular group $SL_2(Z)$, corresponding to the structure of vector-valued quantum modular forms. We elucidate the meaning of this vector-valued quantum modular form strcuture by first proposing the analogue $\hat Z$-invariants with supersymmetric defects, and subsequently showing that the full vector-valued quantum modular form is precisely the object capturing all the $\hat Z$-invariants, with and without defects, of a given three-manifold. Second, it was expected that matching radial limits is a key feature of $\hat Z$-invariants when changing the orientation of the plumbed three-manifold, suggesting the relevance of mock modularity. We substantiate the conjecture by providing explicit proposals for such $\hat Z$-invariants for an infinite family of three-manifolds and verify their mock modularity and limits. Third, we initiate the study of the vertex algebra structure of the mock type invariants by showcasing a systematic way to construct cone vertex operator algebras associated to these invariants, which can be viewed as the partner of logarithmic vertex operator algebras in this context.</description>

      <title>Dualities among Neveu-Schwarz sector branes in string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture dualities among branes that consist of Neveu-Schwarz sector fields, such as NS5-branes. Two branes are dual after compactifications on spheres with gauge fluxes. The conjecture follows from simple considerations on string worldsheet theories. For some NS5-branes, we get level-rank dualities of Chern-Simons theories. Application of the dualities to a newly found brane in heterotic string theory reveals surprising properties of the worldvolume theory on it, for which we give evidence from anomaly inflow.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the one-loop structure of some ghost and tachyon-free vector theories to illustrate the role of structural constraints in their interactions, even in the absence of gauge symmetries. While the presence of explicit soft-breaking terms might suggest otherwise, we illustrate how the hopes of casting a model within the predictive frame of effective field methods require a gauge-like treatment of their interactions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-parameter families of $\mathcal{N}=0$ Type IIA and Type IIB AdS$_5$ solutions are presented, promoting to $\mathcal{N}=1$ in some special cases. The G-Structure description of each $\mathcal{N}=1$ solution is given, requiring an Abelian T-Duality of the G-Structure conditions and Pure Spinors. Investigations at the boundaries are performed for a two-parameter family of Type IIA and a three-parameter family of type IIB solutions, finding the presence of orbifold singularities in some backgrounds. All parameters drop out of the Holographic Central Charge calculation, pointing to marginal deformations in the dual CFT description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory that preserves spin-summed scattering and decay rates at tree level while affecting particle spins. This is achieved by breaking the Lorentz group in a non-local way that tries avoiding stringent constraints, for example leaving unbroken the maximal sub-group SIM(2). As a phenomenological application, this new physics can alter the spins of top-antitop pairs (and consequently their entanglement) produced in $pp$ collisions without impacting their rates. Some observables affected by loops involving top quarks with modified entanglement receive corrections.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Hamiltonian for inhomogeneous free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the entanglement Hamiltonian for the ground state of one-dimensional free fermions in the presence of an inhomogeneous chemical potential. In particular, we consider a lattice with a linear, as well as a continuum system with a quadratic potential. It is shown that, for both models, conformal field theory predicts a Bisognano-Wichmann form for the entangement Hamiltonian of a half-infinite system. Furthermore, despite being nonrelativistic, this result is inherited by our models in the form of operators that commute exactly with the entanglement Hamiltonian. After appropriate rescaling, they also yield an excellent approximation of the entanglement spectra, which becomes asymptotically exact in the bulk of the trapped Fermi gas. For the gradient chain, however, the conformal result is recovered only after taking a proper continuum limit.</description>

      <title>Closed-channel parameters of Feshbach resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the work of Phys. Rev. A 100, 042710 (2019), it was argued that the general description of two-body Feshbach resonances requires "closed-channel parameters" related to the bare bound state causing the resonance. The present work shows that once the resonance theory is renormalised (i.e. its parameters are expressed in terms of physical observables) the dependence of two-body observables on the closed-channel parameters disappears when the inter-channel coupling is localised in a region where the wave functions are energy independent. In such a regime, the resulting quantum defect theory is surprisingly independent of the bare bound state energy. This result highlights a qualitative difference between resonances in this regime, such as magnetic resonances in ultracold atoms, and other kinds of resonances, such as hadron resonances. Although the closed-channel parameters of magnetic resonances do not affect two-body observables, it is suggested that they could be evidenced experimentally from short-distance probing and three-body observables.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Collapse of Pressureless Matter in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an early matter phase of the Universe existed after inflation with the proper power spectrum, enhanced density perturbations can decouple from the Hubble flow, turn around and collapse. In contrast to what happens in a radiation dominated Universe where pressure nullifies deviations from sphericity in these perturbations, in a matter dominated Universe, the lack of pressure although on the one hand facilitates the gravitational collapse, it allows small deviations from sphericity to grow substantially as the collapse takes place. The subsequent collapse is complicated: initially as non-spherical deviations grow, the collapsing cloud takes the form of a ``Zel'dovich pancake". After that, the more chaotic and nonlinear stage of violent relaxation begins where shells of the cloud cross and the matter is redistributed within a factor of a few of the free fall timescale, reaching a spherical virialized state. During the whole process, strong gravitational waves are emitted due to the anisotropy of the collapse and the small time interval that the effect takes place. The emission of gravitational waves during the stage of the violent relaxation cannot be easily estimated with an analytical model. We perform an $N$-body simulation to capture the behaviour of matter during this stage in order to estimate the precise spectrum of gravitational waves produced in this scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have for the first time considered the consequences of thermal fluctuations to the Casimir effect on a traversable wormhole. This was done by using finite temperature generalization of the Casimir effect as a source of a hot traversable wormhole. Thus, we have considered a more physical scenario, where the effects of thermal fluctuations are also considered as a source of a traversable wormhole. To obtain a dependence on such a thermal Casimir effect, consider the plates positioned at a distance either parametrically fixed or radially varying. In both cases, the temperature effects are investigated. We demonstrate that thermal fluctuations modify the throat of the wormhole. Such results have been obtained in both regimes, i.e. high temperature and low temperature. We explicitly investigate the effect of such finite temperature effects on the size of a wormhole.</description>

      <title>Delicate curvature bounces in the no-boundary wave function and in the late universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical considerations motivate us to consider vacuum energy to be able to decay and to assume that the spatial geometry of the universe is closed. Combining both aspects leads to the possibility that the universe, or certain regions thereof, can collapse and subsequently undergo a curvature bounce. This may have occurred in the very early universe, in a pre-inflationary phase. We discuss the construction of the corresponding no-boundary instantons and show that they indeed reproduce a bouncing history of the universe, interestingly with a small and potentially observable departure from classicality during the contracting phase. Such an early bouncing history receives a large weighting and provides competition for a more standard inflationary branch of the wave function. Curvature bounces may also occur in the future. We discuss the conditions under which they may take place, allowing for density fluctuations in the matter distribution in the universe. Overall, we find that curvature bounces require a delicate combination of matter content and initial conditions to occur, though with significant consequences if these conditions are met.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Sachdev-Ye Models with Read-Saleur Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an SU(M)-symmetric disordered bipartite spin model with unusual characteristics. Although superficially similar to the Sachdev-Ye model, it has several markedly different properties for M&gt;2. In particular, it has a large non-trivial nullspace whose dimension grows exponentially with system size. The states in this nullspace are frustration-free, and are ground states when the interactions are ferromagnetic. The exponential growth of the nullspace leads to Hilbert-space fragmentation and a violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We demonstrate that the commutant algebra responsible for this fragmentation is a non-trivial subalgebra of the Read-Saleur commutant algebra of certain nearest-neighbour models such as the spin-1 biquadratic spin chain. We also discuss the low-energy behaviour of correlations for the disordered version of this model in the limit of a large number of spins and large M, using techniques similar to those applied to the SY model. We conclude by generalizing the Shiraishi-Mori embedding formalism to non-local models, and apply it to turn some of our nullspace states into quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitary operators are employed to investigate the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality. The ensuing modifications affecting both classical and quantum bounds are elucidated. The relevance of a particular class of unitary operators whose expectation values are real is pointed out. For these operators, the classical and quantum bounds remain unaltered, being given, respectively, by $2$ and $2\sqrt{2}$. As an example, the Weyl unitary operators for a real scalar field in relativistic Quantum Field Theory are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We consider the ensemble average of two dimensional symmetric product orbifold CFTs $\text{Sym}^N(\mathbb{T}^D)$ over the Narain moduli space. We argue for a bulk dual given by $N$ copies of an abelian Chern-Simons theory coupled to topological gravity, endowed with a discrete gauge symmetry exchanging the $N$ copies. As a check of this proposal, we calculate the ensemble average of various partition and correlation functions of the symmetric product orbifold theory and compare the resulting expressions to gauge theory quantities in the bulk. We comment on the ensemble average of the tensionless string partition function on $\text{AdS}_3 \times \text{S}^3 \times \mathbb T^4$ by considering the specific case of $D=4$ with the addition of supersymmetry.</description>

Abstract: Moduli stabilisation is key to obtaining phenomenologically viable string models. Non-geometric compactifications, like T-duality orbifolds (T-folds), are capable of freezing many moduli. However, in this Letter we emphasise that T-folds, admitting free fermionic descriptions, can be associated with a large number of different T-folds with varying number of moduli, since the fermion pairings for bosonisation are far from unique. Consequently, in one description a fermionic construction might appear to be asymmetric, and hence non-geometric, while in another it admits a symmetric orbifold description. We introduce the notion of intrinsically asymmetric T-folds for fermionic constructions that do not admit any symmetric orbifold description after bosonisation. Finally, we argue that fermion symmetries induce mappings in the bosonised description that extend the T-duality group.</description>

Abstract: The quantization of Yang-Mills field theories requires the introduction of a gauge fixing which leads to a violation of the Local Gauss Law described by the so-called Gauss operator. We discuss the local quantizations of Yang-Mills theories in terms of the possible Gauss operators, which are argued to have a more physical meaning than the gauge fixings. We focus the attention on the local quantizations which leave the global gauge group and a subgroup of local gauge transformations unbroken, as the Feynman quantization of quantum Electrodynamics, and show that in the non-abelian case such properties cannot be realized together with Lorentz covariance; thus, quite generally, one cannot have the structural properties of the Feynman quantization of Quantum Electrodynamics. By relaxing the condition of Lorentz covariance, we obtain a classification of Gauss operators, which satisfy gauge covariant conservation laws and generate non-trivial residual subgroups of local gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>String Thermodynamics In and Out of Equilibrium: Boltzmann Equations and Random Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the study of string theory close to the Hagedorn temperature with the aim towards cosmological applications. We consider interactions of open and closed strings in a gas of D$p-$branes, and/or one isolated D$p$-brane, in an arbitrary number $d$ of flat non-compact dimensions and general compact dimensions. Leading order string perturbation theory is used to obtain the basic interaction rates in a flat background, which are shown to be consistent with the random walk picture of highly excited strings that should apply in more general backgrounds. Using the random walk interpretation we infer the structure of more general semi-inclusive string scattering rates and then write down the corresponding Boltzmann equations describing ensembles of highly excited closed and open strings. We organise the interaction terms in Boltzmann equations so that detailed balance becomes manifest. We obtain the equilibrium solutions and show that they reduce to previously computed solutions for $d=0$. We further study the behaviour of non-equlibrium fluctuations and find explicit analytic expressions for the equilibration rates (and for the number of open strings in $d=0$). Potential implications for an early universe with strings at high temperatures are outlined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the perturbative stability of Euclidean axion-dilaton wormholes that asymptotically approach flat space, both with a massless and a massive dilaton, and focussing on homogeneous perturbations. We find massless wormholes to always be perturbatively stable. The phenomenologically more relevant case of a massive dilaton presents us with a wide variety of wormhole solutions, depending on the dilaton coupling and mass, and on the axion charge. We find that the solutions with the smallest dilaton potential are perturbatively stable and dominant, even in cases where the wormhole solutions are not continuously connected to the massless case by decreasing the mass. For branches of solutions emanating from a bifurcation point, one side of the branch always contains a negative mode in its spectrum, rendering such solutions unstable. The existence of classes of perturbatively stable wormhole solutions with massive dilaton sharpens the puzzles associated with Euclidean wormholes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral problem in deformed supersymmetric quantum mechanics with polynomial superpotential by using the exact WKB method and the TBA equations. We apply the ODE/IM correspondence to the Schr\"odinger equation with an effective potential deformed by integrating out the fermions, which admits a continuous deformation parameter. We find that the TBA equations are described by the ${\mathbb Z}_4$-extended ones. For cubic superpotential corresponding to the symmetric double-well potential, the TBA system splits into the two $D_3$-type TBA equations. We investigate in detail this example based on the TBA equations and their analytic continuation as well as the massless limit. We find that the energy spectrum obtained from the exact quantization condition is in good agreement with the diagonalization approach of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Effective mass and symmetry breaking in the IKKT matrix model from compactification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16401v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The IKKT model is a promising candidate for a non-perturbative description of Type IIB superstring theory. It is known from analytic approaches and numerical simulations that the IKKT matrix model with a mass term admits interesting cosmological solutions. However, this mass term is often introduced by hand, and serves as a regulator in the theory. In the present paper, we show that an effective mass matrix can arise naturally in the IKKT model by imposing a toroidal compactification where the space-time fermions acquire anti-periodic boundary conditions. When six spatial dimensions are chosen to be compact, the effective mass matrix breaks the SO(1,9) space-time symmetry of the IKKT model to SO(1,3) $\times$ SO(6). This paves the way for space-time solutions of the IKKT model where SO(1,9) symmetry is naturally broken to SO(1,3) $\times$ SO(6).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal structure of world-volume theories of half-BPS branes in string and M-theory in terms of exceptional generalised geometry is observed. Previous constructions are extended in two ways: from internal $d$-dimensional space to full 11- or 10-dimensional spacetimes, by coupling to the tensor hierarchy gauge fields, and from $E_{d(d)}$ with $d\leq 6$ to $E_{7(7)}$ and $E_{8(8)}$. This is done by a clarification of the role of the tensor hierarchy and its end in the context of brane world-volume theories. The exceptional structure of the gauged $\sigma$-model of the Kaluza-Klein monopole is provided as a new example.</description>

Abstract: We show that crossing symmetry of S-matrices is modified in certain theories with non-invertible symmetries or anomalies. Focusing on integrable flows to gapped phases in two dimensions, we find that S-matrices derived previously from the bootstrap approach are incompatible with non-invertible symmetries along the flow. We present consistent alternatives, which however violate standard crossing symmetry and obey modified rules dictated by fusion categories. We extend these rules to theories with discrete anomalies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous work has given proof and evidence that BPS states in local Calabi-Yau 3-folds can be described and counted by exponential networks on the punctured plane, with the help of a suitable non-abelianization map to the mirror curve. This provides an appealing elementary depiction of moduli of special Lagrangian submanifolds, but so far only a handful of examples have been successfully worked out in detail. In this note, we exhibit an explicit correspondence between torus fixed points of the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb C^2\subset\mathbb C^3$ and anomaly free exponential networks attached to the quadratically framed pair of pants. This description realizes an interesting, and seemingly novel, "age decomposition" of linear partitions. We also provide further details about the networks' perspective on the full D-brane moduli space.</description>

Abstract: The speed limit of information propagation is one of the most fundamental features in non-equilibrium physics. The region of information propagation by finite-time dynamics is approximately restricted inside the effective light cone that is formulated by the Lieb-Robinson bound. To date, extensive studies have been conducted to identify the shape of effective light cones in most experimentally relevant many-body systems. However, the Lieb-Robinson bound in the interacting boson systems, one of the most ubiquitous quantum systems in nature, has remained a critical open problem for a long time. This study reveals a tight effective light cone to limit the information propagation in interacting bosons, where the shape of the effective light cone depends on the spatial dimension. To achieve it, we prove that the speed for bosons to clump together is finite, which in turn leads to the error guarantee of the boson number truncation at each site. Furthermore, we applied the method to provide a provably efficient algorithm for simulating the interacting boson systems. The results of this study settle the notoriously challenging problem and provide the foundation for elucidating the complexity of many-body boson systems.</description>

      <title>A Generic Topological Criterion for Flat Bands in Two Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the continuum limit of moir\'e graphene is described by a $(2+1)$-dimensional field theory of Dirac fermions coupled to two classical vector fields: a periodic gauge and spin field. We further show that the existence of a flat band implies an effective dimensional reduction, where the time dimension is ``removed.'' The resulting two-dimensional Euclidean theory contains the chiral anomaly. The associated Atiyah-Singer index theorem provides a self-consistency condition for flat bands. In the Abelian limit, where the spin field is disregarded, we reproduce a periodic series of quantized magic angles known to exist in twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral limit. However, the results are not exact. If the Abelian field has zero total flux, perfectly flat bands can not exist, because of the leakage of edge states into neighboring triangular patches with opposite field orientations. We demonstrate that the non-Abelian spin component can correct this and completely flatten the bands via an effective renormalization of the Abelian component into a configuration with a non-zero total flux. We present the Abelianization of the theory where the Abelianized flat band can be mapped to that of the lowest Landau level. We show that the Abelianization corrects the values of the magic angles consistent with numerical results. We also use this criterion to prove that an external magnetic field splits the series into pairs of magnetic field-dependent magic angles associated with flat moir\'e-Landau bands. The topological criterion and the Abelianization procedure provide a generic practical method for finding flat bands in a variety of material systems including but not limited to moir\'e bilayers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first-principle numerical simulations of the lattice SU(3) gauge theory, we calculate the isothermal moment of inertia of the rigidly rotating gluon plasma. We find that the moment of inertia unexpectedly takes a negative value below the "supervortical temperature" $T_s = 1.50(10) T_c$, vanishes at $T = T_s$, and becomes a positive quantity at higher temperatures. The negative moment of inertia indicates a thermodynamic instability of rigid rotation. We derive the condition of thermodynamic stability of the vortical plasma and show how it relates to the scale anomaly and the magnetic gluon condensate. The rotational instability of gluon plasma shares a striking similarity with the rotational instabilities of spinning Kerr and Myers-Perry black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the origin of Majorana masses within the majoron model and how this can lead to the generation of a distinguishable primordial stochastic background of gravitational waves. We first show how in the simplest majoron model only a contribution from cosmic string can be within the reach of planned experiments. We then consider extensions containing multiple complex scalars, demonstrating how in this case a spectrum comprising contributions from both a strong first order phase transition and cosmic strings can naturally emerge. We show that the interplay between multiple scalar fields can amplify the phase transition signal, potentially leading to double peaks over the wideband sloped spectrum from cosmic strings. We also underscore the possibility of observing such a gravitational wave background to provide insights into the reheating temperature of the universe. We conclude highlighting how the model can be naturally combined with scenarios addressing the origin of matter of the universe, where baryogenesis occurs via leptogenesis and a right-handed neutrino plays the role of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Supercooling in Radiative Symmetry Breaking: Theory Extensions, Gravitational Wave Detection and Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order phase transitions, which take place when the symmetries are predominantly broken (and masses are then generated) through radiative corrections, produce observable gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We provide a model-independent approach that is valid for large-enough supercooling to quantitatively describe these phenomena in terms of few parameters, which are computable once the model is specified. The validity of a previously-proposed approach of this sort is extended here to a larger class of theories. Among other things, we identify regions of the parameter space that correspond to the background of gravitational waves recently detected by pulsar timing arrays (NANOGrav, CPTA, EPTA, PPTA) and others that are either excluded by the observing runs of LIGO and Virgo or within the reach of future gravitational wave detectors. Furthermore, we find regions of the parameter space where primordial black holes produced by large over-densities due to such phase transitions can account for dark matter. Finally, it is shown how this model-independent approach can be applied to specific cases, including a phenomenological completion of the Standard Model with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ undergoing radiative symmetry breaking.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new family of commuting Baxter operators in the Ruijsenaars hyperbolic system, different from that considered by us earlier. Using a degeneration of Rains integral identity we verify the commutativity between the two families of Baxter operators and explore this fact for the proof of the coupling constant symmetry of the wave function. We also establish a connection between new Baxter operators and Noumi-Sano difference operators.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Axion-Gauge Couplings and Non-Invertible Higher Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive model-independent quantization conditions on the axion couplings (sometimes known as the anomaly coefficients) to the Standard Model gauge group $[SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)_Y]/\mathbb{Z}_q$ with $q=1,2,3,6$. Using these quantization conditions, we prove that any QCD axion model to the right of the $E/N=8/3$ line on the $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}|$-$m_a$ plot must necessarily face the axion domain wall problem in a post-inflationary scenario. We further demonstrate the higher-group and non-invertible global symmetries in the Standard Model coupled to a single axion. These generalized global symmetries lead to universal bounds on the axion string tension and the monopole mass. If the axion were discovered in the future, our quantization conditions could be used to constrain the global form of the Standard Model gauge group.</description>

      <title>Ambient temperature versus ambient acceleration in the circular motion Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05700v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the experience of a linearly accelerated observer with acceleration $a$, interacting with a massless scalar field in its vacuum state in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime, is identical to that of a static observer interacting with a massless scalar field in a thermal state of temperature $a/2\pi$ in $3+1$ Minkowski spacetime. We study the robustness of this duality by comparing an observer undergoing circular motion in a thermal bath with an observer that undergoes circular motion around a linearly accelerated trajectory. We find that in most regimes, observers in these two cases experience the field in different ways, and are generally able to tell the difference between the two cases by measuring observables localized along their trajectories.</description>

      <title>Generalised Gaussian states in group field theory and $\mathfrak{su(1,1)}$ quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08667v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define generalised Gaussian states for quantum cosmological models based on the $\mathfrak{su(1,1)}$ algebra, with particular emphasis on its realisation in group field theory for a single field mode, and study their semiclassical properties. These states are generalisations of coherent, squeezed and thermal states considered previously. As two possible characterisations of semiclassicality, we contrast the requirement of small relative fluctuations in volume and energy with the saturation of the Robertson--Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle. We find that for the most general class of states the appearance of small relative fluctuations, which we take as the main criterion relevant for the emergence of cosmology, is mostly determined by the amount of displacement used to define the state. We also observe that defining such generalised Gaussian states is less straightforward in the algebraic approach to canonical quantisation of group field theory, and discuss special cases.</description>

      <title>Topological Data Analysis of Monopoles in $U(1)$ Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In $4$-dimensional pure compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory, we analyse topological aspects of the dynamics of monopoles across the deconfinement phase transition. We do this using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA). We demonstrate that observables constructed from the zeroth and first homology groups of monopole current networks may be used to quantitatively and robustly locate the critical inverse coupling $\beta_{c}$ through finite-size scaling. Our method provides a mathematically robust framework for the characterisation of topological invariants related to monopole currents, putting on firmer ground earlier investigations. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to the study of Abelian monopoles in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>A Noisy Approach to Intrinsically Mixed-State Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for studying two-dimensional (2D) topologically ordered states subject to local correlated errors and show that the resulting mixed-state can display intrinsically mixed-state topological order (imTO) -- topological order which is not expected to occur in the ground state of 2D local gapped Hamiltonians. Specifically, we show that decoherence, previously interpreted as anyon condensation in a doubled Hilbert space, is more naturally phrased as, and provides a physical mechanism for, "gauging out" anyons in the original Hilbert space. We find that gauging out anyons generically results in imTO, with the decohered mixed-state strongly symmetric under certain anomalous 1-form symmetries. This framework lays bare a striking connection between the decohered density matrix and topological subsystem codes, which can appear as anomalous surface states of 3D topological orders. Through a series of examples, we show that the decohered state can display a classical memory, encode logical qubits (i.e., exhibit a quantum memory), and even host chiral or non-modular topological order. We argue that the decohered states represent genuine mixed-state quantum phases of matter and that a partial classification of imTO is given in terms of braided fusion categories.</description>
