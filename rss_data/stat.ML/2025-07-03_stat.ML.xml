      <title>Adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm with the Median Absolute Deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adaptive Iterative Soft-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) has been a popular algorithm for finding a desirable solution to the LASSO problem without explicitly tuning the regularization parameter $\lambda$. Despite that the adaptive ISTA is a successful practical algorithm, few theoretical results exist. In this paper, we present the theoretical analysis on the adaptive ISTA with the thresholding strategy of estimating noise level by median absolute deviation. We show properties of the fixed points of the algorithm, including scale equivariance, non-uniqueness, and local stability, prove the local linear convergence guarantee, and show its global convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>Hybrid least squares for learning functions from highly noisy data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the need for efficient estimation of conditional expectations, we consider a least-squares function approximation problem with heavily polluted data. Existing methods that are powerful in the small noise regime are suboptimal when large noise is present. We propose a hybrid approach that combines Christoffel sampling with certain types of optimal experimental design to address this issue. We show that the proposed algorithm enjoys appropriate optimality properties for both sample point generation and noise mollification, leading to improved computational efficiency and sample complexity compared to existing methods. We also extend the algorithm to convex-constrained settings with similar theoretical guarantees. When the target function is defined as the expectation of a random field, we extend our approach to leverage adaptive random subspaces and establish results on the approximation capacity of the adaptive procedure. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical studies on both synthetic data and on a more challenging stochastic simulation problem in computational finance.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Matrix Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the knowledge transfer under the setting of matrix completion, which aims to enhance the estimation of a low-rank target matrix with auxiliary data available. We propose a transfer learning procedure given prior information on which source datasets are favorable. We study its convergence rates and prove its minimax optimality. Our analysis reveals that with the source matrices close enough to the target matrix, out method outperforms the traditional method using the single target data. In particular, we leverage the advanced sharp concentration inequalities introduced in \cite{brailovskaya2024universality} to eliminate a logarithmic factor in the convergence rate, which is crucial for proving the minimax optimality. When the relevance of source datasets is unknown, we develop an efficient detection procedure to identify informative sources and establish its selection consistency. Simulations and real data analysis are conducted to support the validity of our methodology.</description>

      <title>It's Hard to Be Normal: The Impact of Noise on Structure-agnostic Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure-agnostic causal inference studies how well one can estimate a treatment effect given black-box machine learning estimates of nuisance functions (like the impact of confounders on treatment and outcomes). Here, we find that the answer depends in a surprising way on the distribution of the treatment noise. Focusing on the partially linear model of \citet{robinson1988root}, we first show that the widely adopted double machine learning (DML) estimator is minimax rate-optimal for Gaussian treatment noise, resolving an open problem of \citet{mackey2018orthogonal}. Meanwhile, for independent non-Gaussian treatment noise, we show that DML is always suboptimal by constructing new practical procedures with higher-order robustness to nuisance errors. These \emph{ACE} procedures use structure-agnostic cumulant estimators to achieve $r$-th order insensitivity to nuisance errors whenever the $(r+1)$-st treatment cumulant is non-zero. We complement these core results with novel minimax guarantees for binary treatments in the partially linear model. Finally, using synthetic demand estimation experiments, we demonstrate the practical benefits of our higher-order robust estimators.</description>

      <title>Sparse Gaussian Processes: Structured Approximations and Power-EP Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inducing-point-based sparse variational Gaussian processes have become the standard workhorse for scaling up GP models. Recent advances show that these methods can be improved by introducing a diagonal scaling matrix to the conditional posterior density given the inducing points. This paper first considers an extension that employs a block-diagonal structure for the scaling matrix, provably tightening the variational lower bound. We then revisit the unifying framework of sparse GPs based on Power Expectation Propagation (PEP) and show that it can leverage and benefit from the new structured approximate posteriors. Through extensive regression experiments, we show that the proposed block-diagonal approximation consistently performs similarly to or better than existing diagonal approximations while maintaining comparable computational costs. Furthermore, the new PEP framework with structured posteriors provides competitive performance across various power hyperparameter settings, offering practitioners flexible alternatives to standard variational approaches.</description>

      <title>Detecting Fraud in Financial Networks: A Semi-Supervised GNN Approach with Granger-Causal Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually. Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning (ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and (2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points. To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++), with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without any prior assumption on the network structure.</description>

      <title>ManifoldMind: Dynamic Hyperbolic Reasoning for Trustworthy Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce ManifoldMind, a probabilistic geometric recommender system for exploratory reasoning over semantic hierarchies in hyperbolic space. Unlike prior methods with fixed curvature and rigid embeddings, ManifoldMind represents users, items, and tags as adaptive-curvature probabilistic spheres, enabling personalised uncertainty modeling and geometry-aware semantic exploration. A curvature-aware semantic kernel supports soft, multi-hop inference, allowing the model to explore diverse conceptual paths instead of overfitting to shallow or direct interactions. Experiments on four public benchmarks show superior NDCG, calibration, and diversity compared to strong baselines. ManifoldMind produces explicit reasoning traces, enabling transparent, trustworthy, and exploration-driven recommendations in sparse or abstract domains.</description>

      <title>Neural simulation-based inference of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling via off-shell Higgs production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the forthcoming major challenges in particle physics is the experimental determination of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling. While efforts have largely focused on on-shell double- and single-Higgs production in proton-proton collisions, off-shell Higgs production has also been proposed as a valuable complementary probe. In this article, we design a hybrid neural simulation-based inference (NSBI) approach to construct a likelihood of the Higgs signal incorporating modifications from the Standard Model effective field theory (SMEFT), relevant background processes, and quantum interference effects. It leverages the training efficiency of matrix-element-enhanced techniques, which are vital for robust SMEFT applications, while also incorporating the practical advantages of classification-based methods for effective background estimates. We demonstrate that our NSBI approach achieves sensitivity close to the theoretical optimum and provide expected constraints for the high-luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider. While we primarily concentrate on the Higgs trilinear self-coupling, we also consider constraints on other SMEFT operators that affect off-shell Higgs production.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Bounds for Linear Constrained MDPs with a Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider infinite-horizon $\gamma$-discounted (linear) constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs) where the objective is to find a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward subject to expected cumulative constraints. Given access to a generative model, we propose to solve CMDPs with a primal-dual framework that can leverage any black-box unconstrained MDP solver. For linear CMDPs with feature dimension $d$, we instantiate the framework by using mirror descent value iteration (\texttt{MDVI})~\citep{kitamura2023regularization} an example MDP solver. We provide sample complexity bounds for the resulting CMDP algorithm in two cases: (i) relaxed feasibility, where small constraint violations are allowed, and (ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy is required to exactly satisfy the constraint. For (i), we prove that the algorithm can return an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with high probability by using $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^4\epsilon^2}\right)$ samples. We note that these results exhibit a near-optimal dependence on both $d$ and $\epsilon$. For (ii), we show that the algorithm requires $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d^2}{(1-\gamma)^6\epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ samples, where $\zeta$ is the problem-dependent Slater constant that characterizes the size of the feasible region. Finally, we instantiate our framework for tabular CMDPs and show that it can be used to recover near-optimal sample complexities in this setting.</description>

      <title>Improving Constrained Generation in Language Models via Self-Distilled Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has framed constrained text generation with autoregressive language models as a probabilistic inference problem. Among these, Zhao et al. (2024) introduced a promising approach based on twisted Sequential Monte Carlo, which incorporates learned twist functions and twist-induced proposals to guide the generation process. However, in constrained generation settings where the target distribution concentrates on outputs that are unlikely under the base model, learning becomes challenging due to sparse and uninformative reward signals. We show that iteratively refining the base model through self-distillation alleviates this issue by making the model progressively more aligned with the target, leading to substantial gains in generation quality.</description>

      <title>The Gauss-Markov Adjunction: Categorical Semantics of Residuals in Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing the intelligibility and interpretability of machine learning is a crucial task in responding to the demand for Explicability as an AI principle, and in promoting the better social implementation of AI. The aim of our research is to contribute to this improvement by reformulating machine learning models through the lens of category theory, thereby developing a semantic framework for structuring and understanding AI systems. Our categorical modeling in this paper clarifies and formalizes the structural interplay between residuals and parameters in supervised learning. The present paper focuses on the multiple linear regression model, which represents the most basic form of supervised learning. By defining two concrete categories corresponding to parameters and data, along with an adjoint pair of functors between them, we introduce our categorical formulation of supervised learning. We show that the essential structure of this framework is captured by what we call the Gauss-Markov Adjunction. Within this setting, the dual flow of information can be explicitly described as a correspondence between variations in parameters and residuals. The ordinary least squares estimator for the parameters and the minimum residual are related via the preservation of limits by the right adjoint functor. Furthermore, we position this formulation as an instance of extended denotational semantics for supervised learning, and propose applying a semantic perspective developed in theoretical computer science as a formal foundation for Explicability in AI.</description>

      <title>Online Conformal Prediction with Efficiency Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of conformal prediction in a novel online framework that directly optimizes efficiency. In our problem, we are given a target miscoverage rate $\alpha &gt; 0$, and a time horizon $T$. On each day $t \le T$ an algorithm must output an interval $I_t \subseteq [0, 1]$, then a point $y_t \in [0, 1]$ is revealed. The goal of the algorithm is to achieve coverage, that is, $y_t \in I_t$ on (close to) a $(1 - \alpha)$-fraction of days, while maintaining efficiency, that is, minimizing the average volume (length) of the intervals played. This problem is an online analogue to the problem of constructing efficient confidence intervals.
  We study this problem over arbitrary and exchangeable (random order) input sequences. For exchangeable sequences, we show that it is possible to construct intervals that achieve coverage $(1 - \alpha) - o(1)$, while having length upper bounded by the best fixed interval that achieves coverage in hindsight. For arbitrary sequences however, we show that any algorithm that achieves a $\mu$-approximation in average length compared to the best fixed interval achieving coverage in hindsight, must make a multiplicative factor more mistakes than $\alpha T$, where the multiplicative factor depends on $\mu$ and the aspect ratio of the problem. Our main algorithmic result is a matching algorithm that can recover all Pareto-optimal settings of $\mu$ and number of mistakes. Furthermore, our algorithm is deterministic and therefore robust to an adaptive adversary.
  This gap between the exchangeable and arbitrary settings is in contrast to the classical online learning problem. In fact, we show that no single algorithm can simultaneously be Pareto-optimal for arbitrary sequences and optimal for exchangeable sequences. On the algorithmic side, we give an algorithm that achieves the near-optimal tradeoff between the two cases.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Active Learning under (Human) Label Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to high-quality labeled data remains a limiting factor in applied supervised learning. While label variation (LV), i.e., differing labels for the same instance, is common, especially in natural language processing, annotation frameworks often still rest on the assumption of a single ground truth. This overlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences in annotations, as an informative signal. Similarly, active learning (AL), a popular approach to optimizing the use of limited annotation budgets in training ML models, often relies on at least one of several simplifying assumptions, which rarely hold in practice when acknowledging HLV. In this paper, we examine foundational assumptions about truth and label nature, highlighting the need to decompose observed LV into signal (e.g., HLV) and noise (e.g., annotation error). We survey how the AL and (H)LV communities have addressed -- or neglected -- these distinctions and propose a conceptual framework for incorporating HLV throughout the AL loop, including instance selection, annotator choice, and label representation. We further discuss the integration of large language models (LLM) as annotators. Our work aims to lay a conceptual foundation for HLV-aware active learning, better reflecting the complexities of real-world annotation.</description>

      <title>Classification by Separating Hypersurfaces: An Entropic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the following classification problem: Given a population of individuals characterized by a set of attributes represented as a vector in ${\mathbb R}^N$, the goal is to find a hyperplane in ${\mathbb R}^N$ that separates two sets of points corresponding to two distinct classes. This problem, with a history dating back to the perceptron model, remains central to machine learning. In this paper we propose a novel approach by searching for a vector of parameters in a bounded $N$-dimensional hypercube centered at the origin and a positive vector in ${\mathbb R}^M$, obtained through the minimization of an entropy-based function defined over the space of unknown variables. The method extends to polynomial surfaces, allowing the separation of data points by more complex decision boundaries. This provides a robust alternative to traditional linear or quadratic optimization techniques, such as support vector machines and gradient descent. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of the method in handling diverse classification tasks, including linear and non-linear separability.</description>

      <title>Contextual Online Pricing with (Biased) Offline Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study contextual online pricing with biased offline data. For the scalar price elasticity case, we identify the instance-dependent quantity $\delta^2$ that measures how far the offline data lies from the (unknown) online optimum. We show that the time length $T$, bias bound $V$, size $N$ and dispersion $\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})$ of the offline data, and $\delta^2$ jointly determine the statistical complexity. An Optimism-in-the-Face-of-Uncertainty (OFU) policy achieves a minimax-optimal, instance-dependent regret bound $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT}{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma}) + (N \wedge T) \delta^2})\big)$. For general price elasticity, we establish a worst-case, minimax-optimal rate $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(d\sqrt{T} \wedge (V^2T + \frac{dT }{\lambda_{\min}(\hat{\Sigma})})\big)$ and provide a generalized OFU algorithm that attains it. When the bias bound $V$ is unknown, we design a robust variant that always guarantees sub-linear regret and strictly improves on purely online methods whenever the exact bias is small. These results deliver the first tight regret guarantees for contextual pricing in the presence of biased offline data. Our techniques also transfer verbatim to stochastic linear bandits with biased offline data, yielding analogous bounds.</description>

      <title>Non-negative matrix factorization algorithms generally improve topic model fits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the potential for using algorithms for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to improve parameter estimation in topic models. While several papers have studied connections between NMF and topic models, none have suggested leveraging these connections to develop new algorithms for fitting topic models. NMF avoids the "sum-to-one" constraints on the topic model parameters, resulting in an optimization problem with simpler structure and more efficient computations. Building on recent advances in optimization algorithms for NMF, we show that first solving the NMF problem then recovering the topic model fit can produce remarkably better fits, and in less time, than standard algorithms for topic models. While we focus primarily on maximum likelihood estimation, we show that this approach also has the potential to improve variational inference for topic models. Our methods are implemented in the R package fastTopics.</description>

      <title>Generalization vs. Specialization under Concept Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning models are often brittle under distribution shift, i.e., when data distributions at test time differ from those during training. Understanding this failure mode is central to identifying and mitigating safety risks of mass adoption of machine learning. Here we analyze ridge regression under concept shift -- a form of distribution shift in which the input-label relationship changes at test time. We derive an exact expression for prediction risk in the thermodynamic limit. Our results reveal nontrivial effects of concept shift on generalization performance, including a phase transition between weak and strong concept shift regimes and nonmonotonic data dependence of test performance even when double descent is absent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with experiments based on transformers pretrained to solve linear regression; under concept shift, too long context length can be detrimental to generalization performance of next token prediction. Finally, our experiments on MNIST and FashionMNIST suggest that this intriguing behavior is present also in classification problems.</description>

      <title>Learning Massive-scale Partial Correlation Networks in Clinical Multi-omics Studies with HP-ACCORD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graphical model estimation from multi-omics data requires a balance between statistical estimation performance and computational scalability. We introduce a novel pseudolikelihood-based graphical model framework that reparameterizes the target precision matrix while preserving the sparsity pattern and estimates it by minimizing an $\ell_1$-penalized empirical risk based on a new loss function. The proposed estimator maintains estimation and selection consistency in various metrics under high-dimensional assumptions. The associated optimization problem allows for a provably fast computation algorithm using a novel operator-splitting approach and communication-avoiding distributed matrix multiplication. A high-performance computing implementation of our framework was tested using simulated data with up to one million variables, demonstrating complex dependency structures similar to those found in biological networks. Leveraging this scalability, we estimated a partial correlation network from a dual-omic liver cancer data set. The co-expression network estimated from the ultrahigh-dimensional data demonstrated superior specificity in prioritizing key transcription factors and co-activators by excluding the impact of epigenetic regulation, thereby highlighting the value of computational scalability in multi-omic data analysis.</description>

      <title>The Choice of Normalization Influences Shrinkage in Regularized Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the data and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and scale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different ways to normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on the resulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on this topic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying normalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We focus on binary features and show that their class balances (proportions of ones) directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effect depends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. We demonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features with their variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of ridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance of the coefficient estimates. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty weights, rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we also tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and provide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a powerful neural network architecture capable of tackling a wide range of learning tasks. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of their ability to automatically extract structure from data in an unsupervised setting. In particular, we demonstrate their suitability for clustering when the input data is generated from a Gaussian mixture model. To this end, we study a simplified two-head attention layer and define a population risk whose minimization with unlabeled data drives the head parameters to align with the true mixture centroids. This phenomenon highlights the ability of attention-based layers to capture underlying distributional structure. We further examine an attention layer with key, query, and value matrices fixed to the identity, and show that, even without any trainable parameters, it can perform in-context quantization, revealing the surprising capacity of transformer-based methods to adapt dynamically to input-specific distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the OmniMatch algorithm for seeded multiple graph matching. In the setting of $d$-dimensional Random Dot Product Graphs (RDPG), we prove that under mild assumptions, OmniMatch with $s$ seeds asymptotically and efficiently perfectly aligns $O(s^{\alpha})$ unseeded vertices -- for $\alpha&lt;2\wedge d/4$ -- across multiple networks even in the presence of no edge correlation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across numerous simulations and in the context of shuffled graph hypothesis testing. In the shuffled testing setting, testing power is lost due to the misalignment/shuffling of vertices across graphs, and we demonstrate the capacity of OmniMatch to correct for misaligned vertices prior to testing and hence recover the lost testing power. We further demonstrate the algorithm on a pair of data examples from connectomics and machine translation.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Singular-Value Derivatives of Rectangular Real Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03764v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for deriving the general $n$-th order Fr\'echet derivatives of singular values in real rectangular matrices, by leveraging reduced resolvent operators from Kato's analytic perturbation theory for self-adjoint operators. Deriving closed-form expressions for higher-order derivatives of singular values is notoriously challenging through standard matrix-analysis techniques. To overcome this, we treat a real rectangular matrix as a compact operator on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space, and embed the rectangular matrix into a block self-adjoint operator so that non-symmetric perturbations are captured. Applying Kato's asymptotic eigenvalue expansion to this construction, we obtain a general, closed-form expression for the infinitesimal $n$-th order spectral variations. Specializing to $n=2$ and deploying on a Kronecker-product representation with matrix convention yield the Hessian of a singular value, not found in literature. By bridging abstract operator-theoretic perturbation theory with matrices, our framework equips researchers with a practical toolkit for higher-order spectral sensitivity studies in random matrix applications (e.g., adversarial perturbation in deep learning).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Invariance Modeling of Multi-Environment Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Invariant prediction [Peters et al., 2016] analyzes feature/outcome data from multiple environments to identify invariant features - those with a stable predictive relationship to the outcome. Such features support generalization to new environments and help reveal causal mechanisms. Previous methods have primarily tackled this problem through hypothesis testing or regularized optimization. Here we develop Bayesian Invariant Prediction (BIP), a probabilistic model for invariant prediction. BIP encodes the indices of invariant features as a latent variable and recover them by posterior inference. Under the assumptions of Peters et al. [2016], the BIP posterior targets the true invariant features. We prove that the posterior is consistent and that greater environment heterogeneity leads to faster posterior contraction. To handle many features, we design an efficient variational approximation called VI-BIP. In simulations and real data, we find that BIP and VI-BIP are more accurate and scalable than existing methods for invariant prediction.</description>

      <title>Benign Overfitting without Linearity: Neural Network Classifiers Trained by Gradient Descent for Noisy Linear Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05928v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benign overfitting, the phenomenon where interpolating models generalize well in the presence of noisy data, was first observed in neural network models trained with gradient descent. To better understand this empirical observation, we consider the generalization error of two-layer neural networks trained to interpolation by gradient descent on the logistic loss following random initialization. We assume the data comes from well-separated class-conditional log-concave distributions and allow for a constant fraction of the training labels to be corrupted by an adversary. We show that in this setting, neural networks exhibit benign overfitting: they can be driven to zero training error, perfectly fitting any noisy training labels, and simultaneously achieve minimax optimal test error. In contrast to previous work on benign overfitting that require linear or kernel-based predictors, our analysis holds in a setting where both the model and learning dynamics are fundamentally nonlinear.</description>

Abstract: Model-free forecasting of the temporal evolution of chaotic systems is crucial but challenging. Existing solutions require hyperparameter tuning, significantly hindering their wider adoption. In this work, we introduce a tree-based approach not requiring hyperparameter tuning: TreeDOX. It uses time delay overembedding as explicit short-term memory and Extra-Trees Regressors to perform feature reduction and forecasting. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TreeDOX using the Henon map, Lorenz and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems, and the real-world Southern Oscillation Index.</description>

Abstract: Distributed learning has many computational benefits but is vulnerable to attacks from a subset of devices transmitting incorrect information. This paper investigates Byzantine-resilient algorithms in a decentralized setting, where devices communicate directly in a peer-to-peer manner within a communication network. We leverage the so-called dual approach for decentralized optimization and propose a Byzantine-robust algorithm. We provide convergence guarantees in the average consensus subcase, discuss the potential of the dual approach beyond this subcase, and re-interpret existing algorithms using the dual framework. Lastly, we experimentally show the soundness of our method.</description>

      <title>Bypass Back-propagation: Optimization-based Structural Pruning for Large Language Models via Policy Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent Large-Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods typically operate at the post-training phase without the expensive weight finetuning, however, their pruning criteria often rely on heuristically hand-crafted metrics, potentially leading to suboptimal performance. We instead propose a novel optimization-based structural pruning that learns the pruning masks in a probabilistic space directly by optimizing the loss of the pruned model. To preserve efficiency, our method eliminates the back-propagation through the LLM per se during optimization, requiring only the forward pass of the LLM. We achieve this by learning an underlying Bernoulli distribution to sample binary pruning masks, where we decouple the Bernoulli parameters from LLM loss, facilitating efficient optimization via policy gradient estimator without back-propagation. Thus, our method can 1) support global and heterogeneous pruning (i.e., automatically determine different redundancy for different layers), and 2) optionally initialize with a metric-based method (for our Bernoulli distributions). Extensive experiments conducted on LLaMA, LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, Vicuna, and Mistral models using the C4 and WikiText2 datasets demonstrate the promising performance of our method in efficiency and effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/ethanygao/backprop-free_LLM_pruning.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Cross-sectoral Intersecting Discrepancies within Multiple Groups Using Latent Class Analysis Towards Fairness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03133v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing interest in fair AI development is evident. The ''Leave No One Behind'' initiative urges us to address multiple and intersecting forms of inequality in accessing services, resources, and opportunities, emphasising the significance of fairness in AI. This is particularly relevant as an increasing number of AI tools are applied to decision-making processes, such as resource allocation and service scheme development, across various sectors such as health, energy, and housing. Therefore, exploring joint inequalities in these sectors is significant and valuable for thoroughly understanding overall inequality and unfairness. This research introduces an innovative approach to quantify cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among user-defined groups using latent class analysis. These discrepancies can be used to approximate inequality and provide valuable insights to fairness issues. We validate our approach using both proprietary and public datasets, including both EVENS and Census 2021 (England &amp; Wales) datasets, to examine cross-sectoral intersecting discrepancies among different ethnic groups. We also verify the reliability of the quantified discrepancy by conducting a correlation analysis with a government public metric. Our findings reveal significant discrepancies both among minority ethnic groups and between minority ethnic groups and non-minority ethnic groups, emphasising the need for targeted interventions in policy-making processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the proposed approach can provide valuable insights into ensuring fairness in machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Probabilistic ODE Solvers Without Adaptive Memory Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite substantial progress in recent years, probabilistic solvers with adaptive step sizes can still not solve memory-demanding differential equations -- unless we care only about a single point in time (which is far too restrictive; we want the whole time series). Counterintuitively, the culprit is the adaptivity itself: Its unpredictable memory demands easily exceed our machine's capabilities, making our simulations fail unexpectedly and without warning. Still, dropping adaptivity would abandon years of progress, which can't be the answer. In this work, we solve this conundrum. We develop an adaptive probabilistic solver with fixed memory demands building on recent developments in robust state estimation. Switching to our method (i) eliminates memory issues for long time series, (ii) accelerates simulations by orders of magnitude through unlocking just-in-time compilation, and (iii) makes adaptive probabilistic solvers compatible with scientific computing in JAX.</description>

      <title>TAROT: Targeted Data Selection via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose TAROT, a targeted data selection framework grounded in optimal transport theory. Previous targeted data selection methods primarily rely on influence-based greedy heuristics to enhance domain-specific performance. While effective on limited, unimodal data (i.e., data following a single pattern), these methods struggle as target data complexity increases. Specifically, in multimodal distributions, these heuristics fail to account for multiple inherent patterns, leading to suboptimal data selection. This work identifies two primary factors contributing to this limitation: (i) the disproportionate impact of dominant feature components in high-dimensional influence estimation, and (ii) the restrictive linear additive assumptions inherent in greedy selection strategies. To address these challenges, TAROT incorporates whitened feature distance to mitigate dominant feature bias, providing a more reliable measure of data influence. Building on this, TAROT uses whitened feature distance to quantify and minimize the optimal transport distance between the selected data and target domains. Notably, this minimization also facilitates the estimation of optimal selection ratios. We evaluate TAROT across multiple tasks, including semantic segmentation, motion prediction, and instruction tuning. Results consistently show that TAROT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its versatility across various deep learning tasks.

      <title>On Characterizations for Language Generation: Interplay of Hallucinations, Breadth, and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study language generation in the limit - introduced by Kleinberg and Mullainathan [KM24] - building on classical works of Gold [Gol67] and Angluin [Ang79]. [KM24]'s main result is an algorithm for generating from any countable language collection in the limit. While their algorithm eventually generates unseen strings from the target language $K$, it sacrifices coverage or breadth, i.e., its ability to generate a rich set of strings. Recent work introduces different notions of breadth and explores when generation with breadth is possible, leaving a full characterization of these notions open. Our first set of results settles this by characterizing generation for existing notions of breadth and their natural extensions. Interestingly, our lower bounds are very flexible and hold for many performance metrics beyond breadth - for instance, showing that, in general, it is impossible to train generators which achieve a higher perplexity or lower hallucination rate for $K$ compared to other languages. Next, we study language generation with breadth and stable generators - algorithms that eventually stop changing after seeing an arbitrary but finite number of strings - and prove unconditional lower bounds for such generators, strengthening the results of [KMV25] and demonstrating that generation with many existing notions of breadth becomes equally hard, when stability is required. This gives a separation for generation with approximate breadth, between stable and unstable generators, highlighting the rich interplay between breadth, stability, and consistency in language generation.</description>

      <title>Generalized coarsened confounding for causal effects: a large-sample framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been widespread use of causal inference methods for the rigorous analysis of observational studies and to identify policy evaluations. In this article, we consider a class of generalized coarsened procedures for confounding. At a high level, these procedures can be viewed as performing a clustering of confounding variables, followed by treatment effect and attendant variance estimation using the confounder strata. In addition, we propose two new algorithms for generalized coarsened confounding. While Iacus et al. (2011) developed some statistical properties for one special case in our class of procedures, we instead develop a general asymptotic framework. We provide asymptotic results for the average causal effect estimator as well as providing conditions for consistency. In addition, we provide an asymptotic justification for the variance formulae in Iacus et al. (2011). A bias correction technique is proposed, and we apply the proposed methodology to data from two well-known observational studies.</description>

      <title>Reliable algorithm selection for machine learning-guided design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for machine learning-guided design, or design algorithms, use machine learning-based predictions to propose novel objects with desired property values. Given a new design task -- for example, to design novel proteins with high binding affinity to a therapeutic target -- one must choose a design algorithm and specify any hyperparameters and predictive and/or generative models involved. How can these decisions be made such that the resulting designs are successful? This paper proposes a method for design algorithm selection, which aims to select design algorithms that will produce a distribution of design labels satisfying a user-specified success criterion -- for example, that at least ten percent of designs' labels exceed a threshold. It does so by combining designs' predicted property values with held-out labeled data to reliably forecast characteristics of the label distributions produced by different design algorithms, building upon techniques from prediction-powered inference. The method is guaranteed with high probability to return design algorithms that yield successful label distributions (or the null set if none exist), if the density ratios between the design and labeled data distributions are known. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness in simulated protein and RNA design tasks, in settings with either known or estimated density ratios.</description>

      <title>Significativity Indices for Agreement Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agreement measures, such as Cohen's kappa or intraclass correlation, gauge the matching between two or more classifiers. They are used in a wide range of contexts from medicine, where they evaluate the effectiveness of medical treatments and clinical trials, to artificial intelligence, where they can quantify the approximation due to the reduction of a classifier. The consistency of different classifiers to a golden standard can be compared simply by using the order induced by their agreement measure with respect to the golden standard itself. Nevertheless, labelling an approach as good or bad exclusively by using the value of an agreement measure requires a scale or a significativity index. Some quality scales have been proposed in the literature for Cohen's kappa, but they are mainly na\"ive, and their boundaries are arbitrary. This work proposes a general approach to evaluate the significativity of any agreement value between two classifiers and introduces two significativity indices: one dealing with finite data sets, the other one handling classification probability distributions. Moreover, this manuscript addresses the computational challenges of evaluating such indices and proposes some efficient algorithms for their evaluation.</description>

      <title>Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic, state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable insights into neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Adjusted Prioritized Experience Replay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Experience replay enables data-efficient learning from past experiences in online reinforcement learning agents. Traditionally, experiences were sampled uniformly from a replay buffer, regardless of differences in experience-specific learning potential. In an effort to sample more efficiently, researchers introduced Prioritized Experience Replay (PER). In this paper, we propose an extension to PER by introducing a novel measure of temporal difference error reliability. We theoretically show that the resulting transition selection algorithm, Reliability-adjusted Prioritized Experience Replay (ReaPER), enables more efficient learning than PER. We further present empirical results showing that ReaPER outperforms PER across various environment types, including the Atari-10 benchmark.</description>

      <title>Ordinality in Discrete-level Question Difficulty Estimation: Introducing Balanced DRPS and OrderedLogitNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen growing interest in Question Difficulty Estimation (QDE) using natural language processing techniques. Question difficulty is often represented using discrete levels, framing the task as ordinal regression due to the inherent ordering from easiest to hardest. However, the literature has neglected the ordinal nature of the task, relying on classification or discretized regression models, with specialized ordinal regression methods remaining unexplored. Furthermore, evaluation metrics are tightly coupled to the modeling paradigm, hindering cross-study comparability. While some metrics fail to account for the ordinal structure of difficulty levels, none adequately address class imbalance, resulting in biased performance assessments. This study addresses these limitations by benchmarking three types of model outputs -- discretized regression, classification, and ordinal regression -- using the balanced Discrete Ranked Probability Score (DRPS), a novel metric that jointly captures ordinality and class imbalance. In addition to using popular ordinal regression methods, we propose OrderedLogitNN, extending the ordered logit model from econometrics to neural networks. We fine-tune BERT on the RACE++ and ARC datasets and find that OrderedLogitNN performs considerably better on complex tasks. The balanced DRPS offers a robust and fair evaluation metric for discrete-level QDE, providing a principled foundation for future research.</description>
