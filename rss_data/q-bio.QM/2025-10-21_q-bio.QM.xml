      <title>Hallucinations in AlphaFold3 for Intrinsically Disordered Proteins with disorder in Biological Process Residues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein structure prediction has advanced significantly with the introduction of AlphaFold3, a diffusion-based model capable of predicting complex biomolecular interactions across proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and ions. While AlphaFold3 demonstrates high accuracy in folded proteins, its performance on intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which comprise 30 to 40 percent of the human proteome and play critical roles in transcription, signaling, and disease, remains less explored. This study evaluated AlphaFold3's predictions of IDPs with a focus on intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) using 72 proteins curated from the DisProt database. Predictions were generated across multiple random seeds and ensemble outputs, and residue-level pLDDT scores were compared with experimental disorder annotations. Our analysis reveals that 32 percent of residues are misaligned with DisProt, with percent representing hallucinations where AlphaFold3 incorrectly predicts order in disordered regions or vice versa. Additionally, 10 percent of residues exhibited context-driven misalignment, suggesting that AlphaFold3 implicitly incorporates stable structural assumptions. Importantly, 18 percent of residues associated with biological processes showed hallucinations, raising concerns about downstream implications in drug discovery and disease research. These findings highlight the limitations of AlphaFold3 in modeling IDRs, the need for refined hallucination metrics beyond the pLDDT, and the importance of integrating experimental disorder data to improve prediction reliability.</description>

      <title>TriAgent: Automated Biomarker Discovery with Deep Research Grounding for Triage in Acute Care by LLM-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergency departments worldwide face rising patient volumes, workforce shortages, and variability in triage decisions that threaten the delivery of timely and accurate care. Current triage methods rely primarily on vital signs, routine laboratory values, and clinicians' judgment, which, while effective, often miss emerging biological signals that could improve risk prediction for infection typing or antibiotic administration in acute conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce TriAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent framework that couples automated biomarker discovery with deep research for literature-grounded validation and novelty assessment. TriAgent employs a supervisor research agent to generate research topics and delegate targeted queries to specialized sub-agents for evidence retrieval from various data sources. Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either grounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering transparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care risk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine clinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data analysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and expand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a user's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic adherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over 10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more than 50%. Across experiments, TriAgent consistently outperformed state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic frameworks in biomarker justification and literature-grounded novelty assessment.

      <title>Interpretable RNA-Seq Clustering with an LLM-Based Agentic Evidence-Grounded Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose CITE V.1, an agentic, evidence-grounded framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide transparent and reproducible interpretations of RNA-seq clusters. Unlike existing enrichment-based approaches that reduce results to broad statistical associations and LLM-only models that risk unsupported claims or fabricated citations, CITE V.1 transforms cluster interpretation by producing biologically coherent explanations explicitly anchored in the biomedical literature. The framework orchestrates three specialized agents: a Retriever that gathers domain knowledge from PubMed and UniProt, an Interpreter that formulates functional hypotheses, and Critics that evaluate claims, enforce evidence grounding, and qualify uncertainty through confidence and reliability indicators. Applied to Salmonella enterica RNA-seq data, CITE V.1 generated biologically meaningful insights supported by the literature, while an LLM-only Gemini baseline frequently produced speculative results with false citations. By moving RNA-seq analysis from surface-level enrichment to auditable, interpretable, and evidence-based hypothesis generation, CITE V.1 advances the transparency and reliability of AI in biomedicine.</description>

      <title>BASIN: Bayesian mAtrix variate normal model with Spatial and sparsIty priors in Non-negative deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics allows researchers to visualize and analyze gene expression within the precise location of tissues or cells. It provides spatially resolved gene expression data but often lacks cellular resolution, necessitating cell type deconvolution to infer cellular composition at each spatial location. In this paper we propose BASIN for cell type deconvolution, which models deconvolution as a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) problem incorporating graph Laplacian prior. Rather than find a deterministic optima like other recent methods, we propose a matrix variate Bayesian NMF method with nonnegativity and sparsity priors, in which the variables are maintained in their matrix form to derive a more efficient matrix normal posterior. BASIN employs a Gibbs sampler to approximate the posterior distribution of cell type proportions and other parameters, offering a distribution of possible solutions, enhancing robustness and providing inherent uncertainty quantification. The performance of BASIN is evaluated on different spatial transcriptomics datasets and outperforms other deconvolution methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The results also show the effect of the incorporated priors and reflect a truncated matrix normal distribution as we expect.</description>

      <title>Few-Label Multimodal Modeling of SNP Variants and ECG Phenotypes Using Large Language Models for Cardiovascular Risk Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk stratification remains a major challenge due to its multifactorial nature and limited availability of high-quality labeled datasets. While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions, enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.</description>

      <title>A Tractography Analysis Framework Using Diffusion Maps to Study Thalamic Connectivity in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) disrupts thalamocortical connectivity, contributing to cognitive impairment and post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This study presents a novel tractography-based framework that leverages diffusion maps to capture microstructural and organizational changes in thalamic white matter pathways. By analyzing individual streamline characteristics, we identified significant associations between diffusion map embeddings and functional outcomes (GOSE scores), highlighting potential biomarkers for injury severity and recovery trajectories. Our findings suggest that fine-grained geometric features of white matter tracts may provide a more sensitive marker for TBI-related alterations.</description>

      <title>Protein Folding with Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation. However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction frameworks.</description>

      <title>Parameter Identifiability of RNA Dynamics in PDE Transport Models of Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transport and localization of RNA molecules, crucial for cellular function and development, involve a combination of diffusion and active transport mechanisms. Here, we are motivated by understanding the dynamics of RNA in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) is an experimental technique that is widely used to investigate the dynamics of molecular movement within cells by observing the recovery of fluorescence intensity in a photobleached region over time. To advance the understanding of RNA dynamics, we develop a reaction-diffusion-advection partial differential equation (PDE) model integrating both transport and diffusion mechanisms. We propose a pipeline for identifiability analysis to assess the model's ability to uniquely determine parameter values from observed FRAP data. Based on profile likelihood analysis and reparametrization, we examine the relationship between non- identifiable parameters, which improves the robustness of parameter estimation. We find out that the identifiability of the four parameters of interest is not exactly the same in different regions of the cell. Specifically, transport velocity and diffusion coefficient are identifiable in all regions of the cell, while some combinations of binding rate and unbinding rate are found to be identifiable near the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Computer Navigated Spinal Surgery Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current spinal pain management procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and epidural steroid injection (ESI), rely on fluoroscopy for needle placement which exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we investigate a radiation-free surgical navigation system for spinal pain management procedures that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fiducial ArUco marker-based augmented reality (AR). High-resolution MRI scans of a lumbar spinal phantom were obtained and assembled as a surface mesh. Laplacian smoothing algorithms were then applied to smoothen the surface and improve the model fidelity. A commercially available stereo camera (ZED2) was used to track single or dual fiducial ArUco markers on the patient to determine the patient's real-time pose. Custom AR software was applied to overlay the MRI image onto the patient, allowing the physician to see not only the outer surface of the patient but also the complete anatomy of the patient below the surface. Needle-insertion trials on a 3D-printed 3-vertebra phantom showed that dual-ArUco marker tracking increased the accuracy of needle insertions and reduced the average needle misplacement distance compared to single-ArUco marker procedures. The average needle misplacement is comparable to the average deviation of 2 mm for conventional epidural techniques using fluoroscopy. Our radiation-free system demonstrates promise to serve as an alternative to fluoroscopy by improving image-guided spinal navigation.</description>

      <title>Simulation-free Structure Learning for Stochastic Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics -- a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins, and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains. In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.</description>

      <title>mRNA active transport in oocyte-early embryo: 3D agent-based modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axes of polarity (and primary morphogenetic gradients) are established in the oocyte - early embryo through active transport and localization of maternal factors. It is the oocyte - syncytial embryo of Drosophila (D. melanogaster) that is a model object for studying the molecular machinery of such transport systems. The attention of researchers is focused on the processes of formation, maintenance, and functioning of active transport systems of maternal mRNAs and proteins that are key for early Drosophila embryogenesis. Here we develop an approach for agent-based 3D modeling of the key components of transport by molecular motors (by elements of the cytoskeleton) of the Drosophila oocyte-syncytial embryo. The models were developed using Skeledyne software developed by Odell and Foe [Odell and Foe, 2008]. We start with the results of modeling transport along oriented microtubule (MT) bundles in the oocyte. This is a model of transport systems in the Drosophila oocyte, where three maternal mRNAs (bicoid (bcd), oskar, and gurken) that are key to embryonic polarity are transported along their oriented MT bundles. Then we consider models of oriented MT networks in the volume of a cell (oocyte) generated by a single microtubule organization center (or a pair of the centers). This model reproduces the formation of bcd mRNA intrusions deep into the cytoplasm in the head half of the early syncytial embryo. Finally, we consider models for the active transport of bcd mRNA in a syncytial embryo along a randomized network of many short MT strands. In conclusion, we consider the prospects for the implementation of cytoplasmic fountain flows in the active transport model.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Based Hematological Malignancy Prediction from Peripheral Blood Smears in a Real-World Cohort</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20402v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peripheral blood smears remain a cornerstone in the diagnosis of hematological neoplasms, offering rapid and valuable insights that inform subsequent diagnostic steps. However, since neoplastic transformations typically arise in the bone marrow, they may not manifest as detectable aberrations in peripheral blood, presenting a diagnostic challenge. In this paper, we introduce cAItomorph, an explainable transformer-based AI model, trained to classify hematological malignancies based on peripheral blood cytomorphology. Our data comprises peripheral blood single-cell images from 6115 patients with diagnoses confirmed by cytomorphology, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, and immunophenotyping from bone marrow samples, and 495 healthy controls, eight coarse classes. cAItomorph leverages the DinoBloom hematology foundation model and aggregates image encodings via a transformer-based architecture into a single vector. It achieves an overall accuracy of 0.72 in eight disease classification, with F1 scores of 0.76 for acute leukemia, 0.80 for myeloproliferative neoplasms and 0.94 for healthy cases. The overall accuracy increases to 0.87 in top-2 predictions. cAItomorph achieves high sensitivity for acute leukemia cases in external test sets. By analyzing attention heads, we demonstrate clinically relevant cell-level attentions in both internal and external test sets. Moreover, our model's calibrated prediction probabilities reduce the false discovery rate from 13.5% to 8.7% without missing any acute leukemia cases, thereby decreasing the number of unnecessary bone marrow aspirations based on peripheral blood smears. This study highlights the potential of AI-assisted diagnostics in hematological malignancies, illustrating how models trained on real-world data could enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce invasive procedures.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the distributions of protein structure classes (or folding types) of experimentally determined structures from a legacy dataset and a comprehensive database (SCOP) are modeled precisely with geometric constructs such as convex polytopes in high-dimensional amino acid composition space. This is a follow-up of a previous non-statistical, geometry-motivated modeling of protein classes with ellipsoidal models, which is superseded presently in three important respects: (1) as a paradigm shift a descriptive 'distribution model' of experimental data is de-coupled from, and serves as the basis for, a possible future predictive 'domain model' generalizable to proteins in the same class for which 3D structures have yet to be determined experimentally, (2) the geometric and analytic characteristics of class distributions are obtained via exact computational geometry calculations, and (3) the full data from a comprehensive database are included in such calculations, eschewing training set selection and biases. In contrast to statistical and machine-learning approaches, the analytical, non-statistical geometry models of protein class distributions demonstrated in this study furnish complete and precise information on their size and relative disposition in the high-dimensional space (vis-\`a-vis any overlaps leading to ambiguity and classification limits). Intended primarily as an accurate and summary description of the complex relationships between amino acid composition and protein classes, and suitably as a basis for predictive modeling where possible, the results suggest that pen-ultimately they may be useful adjuncts for validating sequence-based protein structure predictions and contribute to theoretical and fundamental understanding of secondary structure formation and protein folding, demonstrating the role of high dimensional amino acid composition space in protein studies.</description>

      <title>FGBench: A Dataset and Benchmark for Molecular Property Reasoning at Functional Group-Level in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in chemistry. However, most existing datasets center on molecular-level property prediction and overlook the role of fine-grained functional group (FG) information. Incorporating FG-level data can provide valuable prior knowledge that links molecular structures with textual descriptions, which can be used to build more interpretable, structure-aware LLMs for reasoning on molecule-related tasks. Moreover, LLMs can learn from such fine-grained information to uncover hidden relationships between specific functional groups and molecular properties, thereby advancing molecular design and drug discovery. Here, we introduce FGBench, a dataset comprising 625K molecular property reasoning problems with functional group information. Functional groups are precisely annotated and localized within the molecule, which ensures the dataset's interoperability thereby facilitating further multimodal applications. FGBench includes both regression and classification tasks on 245 different functional groups across three categories for molecular property reasoning: (1) single functional group impacts, (2) multiple functional group interactions, and (3) direct molecular comparisons. In the benchmark of state-of-the-art LLMs on 7K curated data, the results indicate that current LLMs struggle with FG-level property reasoning, highlighting the need to enhance reasoning capabilities in LLMs for chemistry tasks. We anticipate that the methodology employed in FGBench to construct datasets with functional group-level information will serve as a foundational framework for generating new question-answer pairs, enabling LLMs to better understand fine-grained molecular structure-property relationships. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/xuanliugit/FGBench.</description>

      <title>Canonicalization of the E value from BLAST similarity search -- dissimilarity measure and distance function for a metric space of protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric space, the canonical E value is also reflexive and meets the condition of triangle inequality, thus itself an appropriate distance function for a metric space of protein sequences.</description>
