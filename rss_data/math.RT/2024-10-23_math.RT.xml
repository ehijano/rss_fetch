      <title>Delooping levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [8] V. G\'elinas introduced a homological invariant, called {\it delooping level} (dell), that bounds the finitistic dimension. In this article, we introduce another homological invariant (Dell) related to the delooping level for an Artin algebra. We compare this new tool with other dimensions as the finitistic dimension or the $\phi$-dimension (where $\phi$ is the first Igusa-Todorov function), and we also generalize Theorem 4.3. from [9] to truncated path algebras (Theorem 4.18). Finally, we show that for a monomial algebra $A$ the difference dell($A$) - Findim($A$) can be arbitrarily large (Example 4.22).</description>

      <title>The relatively universal cover of the natural embedding of the long root geometry for the group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long root geometry $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ for the special linear group $\mathrm{SL}(n+1,\mathbb{K})$ admits an embedding in the (projective space of) the vector space of the traceless square matrices of order $n+1$ with entries in the field $\mathbb{K}$, usually regarded as the {\em natural} embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$. S. Smith and H. V\"{o}lklein (A geometric presentation for the adjoint module of $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{K})$, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127) have proved that the natural embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ is relatively universal if and only if $\mathbb{K}$ is either algebraic over its minimal subfield or perfect with positive characteristic. They also give some information on the relatively universal embedding of $A_{2,\{1,2\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one, but that information is not sufficient to exhaustively describe it. The ``if" part of Smith-V\"{o}lklein's result also holds true for any $n$, as proved by V\"{o}lklein in his investigation of the adjoint modules of Chevalley groups (H. V\"{o}lklein, On the geometry of the adjoint representation of a Chevalley group, {\em J. Algebra}, vol. 127). In this paper we give an explicit description of the relatively universal embedding of $A_{n,\{1,n\}}(\mathbb{K})$ which covers the natural one. In particular, we prove that this relatively universal embedding has (vector) dimension equal to $\mathfrak{d}+n^2+2n$ where $\mathfrak{d}$ is the transcendence degree of $\mathbb{K}$ over its minimal subfield (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = 0$) or the generating rank of $\mathbb{K}$ over ${\mathbb K}^p$ (if $\mathrm{char}(\mathbb{K}) = p &gt; 0$). Accordingly, both the ``if" and the ``only if" part of Smith-V\"{o}lklein's result hold true for every $n \geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Construction of irreducible $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})^{G'}$-modules and discretely decomposable restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the irreducibility of $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})^{G'}$-modules on the spaces of intertwining operators in the branching problem of reductive Lie algebras, and construct a family of finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})^{G'}$-modules using the Zuckerman derived functors. We provide criteria for the irreducibility of $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})^{G'}$-modules in the cases of generalized Verma modules, cohomologically induced modules, and discrete series representations. We treat only discrete decomposable restrictions with certain dominance conditions (quasi-abelian and in the good range). To describe the $\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})^{G'}$-modules, we give branching laws of cohomologically induced modules using ones of generalized Verma modules when $K'$ acts on $K/L_K$ transitively.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for circle compactified 4d $A_1$ class-$S$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a 4d mirror symmetry for the class-$\mathcal{S}$ theories which relates the representation theory of the chiral quantization of the Higgs branch and the geometry of the Coulomb branch. We study the representation theory by using the 4d/VOA correspondence, (defect) Schur indices and (flavor) modular differential equations, and match the data with the fixed manifolds of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This correspondence extends the connection between Higgs and Coulomb branch of Argyres-Douglas theories, and can provide systematic guidance for the study of the representation theory of vertex operator algebras by exploiting results from Hitchin systems.</description>

      <title>Inner and Outer Twisted Derivations of Cyclic Group Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study twisted derivations of cyclic group rings. Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity, $G$ be a finite cyclic group, and ($\sigma, \tau$) be a pair of $R$-algebra endomorphisms of the group algebra $RG$, which are $R$-linear extensions of the group endomorphisms of $G$. In this article, we give two characterizations concerning $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of the group ring $RG$. First, we develop a necessary and sufficient condition for a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation of $RG$ to be inner. Second, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for an $R$-linear map $D: RG \rightarrow RG$ with $D(1) = 0$ to be a $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivation. We also illustrate our theorems with the help of examples. As a consequence of these two characterizations, we answer the well-known twisted derivation problem for $RG$: Under what conditions are all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of $RG$ inner? Or is the space of outer $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations trivial? More precisely, we give a sufficient condition under which all $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations of $RG$ are inner and a sufficient condition under which $RG$ has non-trivial outer $(\sigma, \tau)$-derivations. Our result helps in generating several examples of non-trivial outer derivations.</description>

      <title>Conductors and local newforms for the metaplectic group of rank 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an earlier paper of W. Casselman, the theory of local newforms and conductors was initiated. Later, Roberts and Schmidt studied local newforms for the metaplectic group of rank 1. In this paper we define and calculate conductors of irreducible genuine representations of the metaplectic group of rank 1 over non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero and of odd residual characteristic. Moreover, we shall give an explicit formulae for dimensions of spaces of local newforms, and show a compatibility with the local theta correspondence.</description>

      <title>Ore Extensions of Abelian Groups with Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set $A$ and an abelian group $B$ with operators in $A$, we introduce the Ore group extension $B[x ; \delta_B , \sigma_B]$ as the additive group $B[x]$, with $A[x]$ as a set of operators, the action of $A[x]$ on $B[x]$ being defined by mimicking the multiplication used in the classical case where $A$ and $B$ are the same ring. We derive generalizations of Vandermonde's and Leibniz's identities for this construction, and they are then used to establish associativity criteria. Additionally, we prove a version of Hilbert's basis theorem for this structure, under the assumption that the action of $A$ on $B$ is what we call weakly $s$-unital. Finally, we apply these results to the case where $B$ is a left module over a ring $A$, and specifically to the case where $A$ and $B$ coincide with a non-associative ring which is left distributive but not necessarily right distributive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a non-negative integer. Combining algebraic and combinatorial techniques, we investigate for which pairs $(G,\rho)$ of a subgroup $G$ of the symmetric group $S_n$ and an irreducible character $\rho$ of $G$ the induced character $\rho\!\uparrow^{S_n}$ is multiplicity-free. As a result, for $n\geq 66$, we classify all subgroups $G\leq S_n$ which give rise to such a pair. Moreover, for the majority of these groups $G$ we identify all the possible choices of the irreducible character $\rho$, assuming $n\geq 73$.</description>

Abstract: We present the triangular prism equations for fusion categories, demonstrating their equivalence to the pentagon equations in the spherical case, modulo a change of basis. These equations offer valuable insights for managing complexity through localization. Additionally, we establish an enhanced version of Z. Wang's conjecture regarding the second Frobenius-Schur indicator in pivotal fusion categories. As applications, we introduce new categorification criteria and complete the classification of unitary 1-Frobenius simple integral fusion categories up to rank 8 and up to FPdim 20000.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Cohomological Automorphic Representations on Unitary Groups via the Endoscopic Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.12138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the family of automorphic representations on a unitary group with cohomological factor $\pi_0$ at infinity and given split level. We compute statistics of this family as the level goes to infinity. For unramified unitary groups and a large class of $\pi_0$, we use the endoscopic classification of representations to compute the exact leading term for counts of representations and averages of Satake parameters. The bounds on our error terms are similar to previous work by Shin-Templier who studied the case of discrete series at infinity. We also prove new upper bounds for all cohomological representations.
  This has many corollaries: new exact asymptotics on the growth of cohomology in certain towers of locally symmetric spaces, an averaged Sato-Tate equidistribution law for spectral families with specific non-tempered cohomological components at infinity, and the Sarnak-Xue density hypothesis for cohomological representations at infinity on all unitary groups of rank $\geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Filtrations on quantum cohomology from the Floer theory of $\mathbb{C}^*$-actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13026v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. In particular, we obtain a family of filtrations on singular cohomology for any Conical Symplectic Resolution, that is sensitive to the choice of $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. The symplectic form is rarely exact at infinity for these spaces, so substantial foundational work is carried out to rigorously define Floer theory, in particular symplectic cohomology. Using Floer theory, we construct a periodic persistence module, giving rise to a graded periodic barcode associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This encodes birth-death phenomena of Floer invariants. Our filtrations can be viewed as a Floer-theoretic analogue of Atiyah-Bott filtrations, arising from stratifying a manifold by gradient flowlines of a Morse-Bott function, but they are distinct from those and they can detect non-topological properties of the quantum product.</description>

Abstract: Using Morse-Bott-Floer spectral sequences, we describe a filtration by ideals on quantum cohomology for symplectic manifolds with a Hamiltonian $S^1$-action that extends to a pseudoholomorphic $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. These spaces include all Conical Symplectic Resolutions, in particular all Quiver Varieties. Our Morse-Bott-Floer spectral sequences give explicit descriptions of birth-death phenomena of the barcode of the persistence module associated to the $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, defined in our earlier paper. This paper contains the foundational work to rigorously construct a filtration on Floer complexes, announced in that earlier paper. We also include a substantial appendix on Morse-Bott-Floer theory, where a large part of the technical difficulties of the paper are dealt with. We compute a plethora of explicit examples, each highlighting various features, for Springer resolutions, ADE resolutions, and several Slodowy varieties of type A. We also consider certain Higgs moduli spaces, for which we compare our filtration with the well-known P=W filtration.</description>

      <title>General Capelli-type identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Capelli identity is an important determinantal identity of a matrix with noncommutative entries that determines the center of the enveloping algebra of the general linear Lie algebra, and was used by Weyl as a main tool to study irreducible representations in his famous book on classical groups.
  In 1996 Okounkov found higher Capelli identities involving immanants of the generating matrix of $U(gl(n))$ which correspond to arbitrary orthogonal idempotent of the symmetric group. It turns out that Williamson also discovered a general Capelli identity of immanants for $U(gl(n))$ in 1981. In this paper, we use a new method to derive a family of even more general Capelli identities that include the aforementioned Capelli identities as special cases as well as many other Capelli-type identities as corollaries. In particular, we obtain generalized Turnbull's identities for both symmetric and antisymmetric matrices, as well as the generalized Howe-Umeda-Kostant-Sahi identities for antisymmetric matrices which confirm the conjecture of Caracciolo, Sokal, and Sportiello.</description>
