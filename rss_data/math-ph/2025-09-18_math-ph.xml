      <title>Is a Dissipative System Always a Gradient System or a Gradient Like System?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find that to the dynamics of a given dissipative system a $p=1$ differential form can be associated with a general decomposition into a potential term and a non-potential residual part. If the residual part is absent the form is closed and the system is gradient system or gradient like. If it is non-closed, in the differential form approach, it remains non-closed under a variable change of coordinates, i.e., the system is not a gradient one or a gradient like in any coordinate system. On the other hand, there are claims that a potential should always exists, i.e., the class of dissipative systems and the the class of gradient systems should coincide. We fix this conundrum by introducing a generalized change of coordinates that aims a transformation to a gradient system or a gradient like system. The condition of being closed in the new coordinates of a certain, through the generalized change of coordinates defined differential form, results in a nonlinear differential equation together with a consistency condition. We give examples of physical systems where an analytical solution for the transformation can be found, and hitherto, the potential, but even when the potential is not accessible analytically, we find that it always exist, and therefore we give in principle an affirmative answer to the defining question of this work. Our findings removes loopholes in the question if a potential may exist but it is not known.</description>

      <title>Distances between pure quantum states induced by a distance matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the help of a given distance matrix of size $n$, we construct an infinite family of distances $d_p$ (where $p \geq 2$) on the the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}(\mathbb{C}^n)$, modelling the space of pure states of an $n$-dimensional quantum system. The construction can be seen as providing a natural way to isometrically embed any given finite metric space into the space of pure quantum states 'spanned' upon it. In order to show that the maps $d_p$ are indeed distance functions -- in particular, that they satisfy the triangle inequality -- we employ methods of analysis, multilinear algebra and convex geometry, obtaining a non-trivial convexity result in the process. The paper significantly extends earlier work, resolving an important question about the geometry of quantum state space imposed by the quantum Wasserstein distances and solidifying the foundation for applications of distances $d_p$ in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Twist fields in many-body physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of twist fields has played a fundamental role in many-body physics. It is used to construct the so-called disorder parameter for the study of phase transitions in the classical Ising model of statistical mechanics, it is involved in the Jordan-Wigner transformation in quantum chains and bosonisation in quantum field theory, and it is related to measures of entanglement in many-body quantum systems. I provide a pedagogical introduction to the notion of twist field and the concepts at its roots, and review some of its applications, focussing on 1+1 dimension. This includes: locality and extensivity, internal symmetries, semi-locality, the standard exponential form and height fields, path integral defects and Riemann surfaces, topological invariance, and twist families. Additional topics touched upon include renormalisation and form factors in relativistic quantum field theory, tau functions of integrable PDEs, thermodynamic and hydrodynamic principles, and branch-point twist fields for entanglement entropy. One-dimensional quantum systems such as chains (e.g. quantum Heisenberg model) and field theory (e.g. quantum sine-Gordon model) are the main focus, but I also explain how the notion applies to equilibrium statistical mechanics (e.g. classical Ising lattice model), and how some aspects can be adapted to one-dimensional classical dynamical systems (e.g. classical Toda chain).</description>

      <title>$\hat{Z}$-TQFT, Surgery Formulas, and New Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\hat{Z}$ invariants of three-manifolds introduced by Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa have influenced many areas of mathematics and physics. However, their TQFT structure remains poorly understood. In this work, we develop a framework of decorated $\mathrm{Spin}$-TQFTs and construct one based on Atiyah-Segal-like axioms that computes the $\hat{Z}$ invariants. Central to our approach is a novel quantization of $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory and a $\mathbb{Q}$-extension of the algebra of observables on the torus, from which we obtain the torus state space of the $\hat{Z}$-TQFT. Using the torus state space and topological invariance, we uniquely determine the $\hat{Z}$ invariants for negative-definite plumbed manifolds. Within this TQFT framework, we establish gluing, rational surgery, partial surgery, satellite, and cabling formulas, as well as explicit closed-form expressions for Seifert manifolds and torus link complements. We also generalize these constructions to higher-rank gauge groups.</description>

      <title>Anyonic membranes and Pontryagin statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anyons, unique to two spatial dimensions, underlie extraordinary phenomena such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, but their generalization to higher dimensions has remained elusive. The topology of Eilenberg-MacLane spaces constrains the loop statistics to be only bosonic or fermionic in any dimension. In this work, we introduce the novel anyonic statistics for membrane excitations in four dimensions. Analogous to the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-particle exhibiting $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(2,N)}$ anyonic statistics in two dimensions, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_N$-membrane possesses $\mathbb{Z}_{N\times \gcd(3,N)}$ anyonic statistics in four dimensions. Given unitary volume operators that create membrane excitations on the boundary, we propose an explicit 56-step unitary sequence that detects the membrane statistics. We further analyze the boundary theory of $(5\!+\!1)$D 1-form $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry-protected topological phases and demonstrate that their domain walls realize all possible anyonic membrane statistics. We then show that the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ subgroup persists in all higher dimensions. In addition to the standard fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ membrane statistics arising from Stiefel-Whitney classes, membranes also exhibit $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics associated with Pontryagin classes. We explicitly verify that the 56-step process detects the nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_3$ statistics in 5, 6, and 7 spatial dimensions. Moreover, in 7 and higher dimensions, the statistics of membrane excitations stabilize to $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{3}$, with the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ sector consistently captured by this process.</description>

      <title>A no-go theorem for large $N$ closed universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under conservative assumptions, it is established at a mathematical level of rigor that if correlation functions of single trace operators in a sequence of states of $O(N^0)$ energy of a two-sided holographic conformal field theory admit a large $N$ limit, then they must be described a pure state in the large $N$ Hilbert space of free field theory on two copies of vacuum AdS. This result clarifies recent discussions concerning the possible emergence of a semiclassical baby universe in the large $N$ limit of a low-energy partially entangled thermal state. The proof heavily relies on dominated convergence arguments from mathematical analysis. Some comments are also offered on the relationship between various recently proposed ways of restoring the emergence of the baby universe and the relaxation of different assumptions of the theorem.</description>

      <title>Finite-size secret-key rates of discrete modulation CV QKD under passive attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum conditional entropies play a fundamental role in quantum information theory. In quantum key distribution, they are exploited to obtain reliable lower bounds on the secret-key rates in the finite-size regime, against collective attacks and coherent attacks under suitable assumptions. We consider continuous-variable communication protocols, where the sender Alice encodes information using a discrete modulation of phase-shifted coherent states, and the receiver Bob decodes by homodyne or heterodyne detection. We compute the Petz-R\'enyi and sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropies associated with these setups, under the assumption of a passive eavesdropper who collects the quantum information leaked through a lossy communication line of known or bounded transmissivity. Whereas our results do not directly provide reliable key-rate estimates, they do represent useful ball-park figures. We obtain analytical or semi-analytical expressions that do not require intensive numerical calculations. These expressions serve as bounds on the key rates that may be tight in certain scenarios. We compare different estimates, including known bounds that have already appeared in the literature and new bounds. The latter are found to be tighter for very short block sizes.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demand to know the structure of functionally independent invariants of tensor fields arises in many problems of theoretical and mathematical physics, for instance for the construction of interacting higher-order tensor field actions. In mathematical terms the problem can be formulated as follows. Given a semi-simple finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ and a $\mathfrak g$-module $V$, one may ask about the structure of the sub-ring of $\mathfrak g$-invariants inside the ring freely generated by the module. We point out how some information about the ring of invariants may be obtained by studying an extended Lie algebra. Numerous examples are given, with particular focus on the difficult problem of classifying invariants of a self-dual 5-form in 10 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Hitchin fibrations and Langlands duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify pairs of (twisted) multiplicative Hitchin fibrations which are "dual" in the sense that their bases are identified and their generic fibres are dual Beilinson $1$-motives. More precisely, we match the following: (1) an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with a simply-laced semisimple group $G$ with an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with the Langlands dual group $G^\vee$; (2) a twisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with a simply-laced and simply-connected semisimple group $G$, without factors of type $\mathsf{A}_{2\ell}$, and a diagram automorphism $\theta \in \mathrm{Aut}(G)$ with an untwisted multiplicative Hitchin fibration associated with the Langlands dual group $H^\vee$ of the invariant group $H=G^\theta$; (3) two twisted multiplicative Hitchin fibrations associated with $G=\mathrm{SL}_{2\ell +1}$ and two special automophisms of order $2$ and $4$, respectively. These results are consistent with a conjecture of Elliott and Pestun (arXiv:1812.05516).</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamical systems of non-minimally coupled fluids and scalar fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics of non-minimally coupled matter models using the Brown's variational approach to relativistic fluids in General Relativity. After decomposing the Ricci scalar into a bulk and a boundary term, we construct new models by coupling the bulk term to the fluid variables and an external scalar field. Using dynamical systems techniques, we study models of this type and find that they can give rise to both early-time inflationary behaviour and late-time accelerated expansion. Moreover, these models also contain very interesting features that are rarely seen in this context. For example, we find dark energy models which exhibit phantom crossing in the recent past. Other possibilities include models that give a viable past evolution but terminate in a matter-dominated universe. The dynamical systems themselves display an array of mathematically interesting phenomena, including spirals, centres, and non-trivial bifurcations depending on the chosen parameter values.</description>

      <title>Mixed order phase transition in a locally constrained exclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel variant of the exclusion process in which particles perform asymmetric nearest-neighbor jumps across a bond \((k, k+1)\) only if the preceding site \((k-1)\) is unoccupied. This next-nearest-neighbor constraint significantly enriches the system's dynamics, giving rise to long-range correlations and a mixed-order transition controlled by the asymmetry parameter. We focus on the critical case of half filling, where the system splits into two ergodic components, each associated with an invariant reversible measure. The combinatorial structure of this equilibrium distribution is intimately connected to the \(q\)-Catalan numbers, enabling us to derive rigorously the asymptotic behavior of key thermodynamic quantities in the strongly asymmetric regime and to conjecture their behavior in the weakly asymmetric limit. Even though the system is one-dimensional and has short-range interactions, an equilibrium phase transition occurs between a clustered phase -- characterized by slow dynamics, long-range correlations with thermodynamic additivity, and spontaneous breaking of translational symmetry -- and a fluid phase where the correlations are short-range and which is thermodynamically additive. This equilibrium phase transition features characteristics of a first-order transition, such as a discontinuous order parameter as well as characteristics of a second-order transition, namely a divergent susceptibility at the transition point. We also briefly discuss density higher than one half where ergodicity is broken.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the beam problem: Connection to multi-component Camassa-Holm dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Euler-Bernoulli beam problem, formulated as a matrix string equation with a matrix-valued density, to a setting where the density takes values in a Clifford algebra, and we analyze its isospectral deformations. For discrete densities, we prove that the associated matrix Weyl function admits a Stieltjes-type continued fraction expansion with Clifford-valued coefficients. By mapping the problem from the finite interval to the real line, we uncover a direct link to a multi-component generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation. This yields a vectorized form of the Camassa-Holm equation invariant under arbitrary orthogonal group actions. As an illustration, we examine the dynamics of a two-atom (two-peakon) matrix measure in the special case of a Clifford algebra with two generators and Minkowski signature. Our analysis shows that, even when peakon waves remain spatially separated, they can engage in long-range, synchronized energy exchange.</description>

      <title>Unified Framework for Geodesic Dynamics with Conservative, Dissipative, and GUP Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive generalized geodesic equations in curved spacetime that include conservative forces, dissipative effects, and quantum-gravity-motivated minimal-length corrections. Conservative interactions are incorporated through external vector potentials, while dissipative dynamics arise from an exponential rescaling of the particle Lagrangian. Quantum-gravity effects are introduced via Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) deformed Poisson brackets in the Hamiltonian framework. We show that free-particle geodesics remain unaffected at leading order, but external potentials induce velocity-dependent corrections, implying possible violations of the equivalence principle. As an application, we analyze modified trajectories in Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universes dominated by dust, radiation, stiff matter, and dark energy. Our results establish a unified approach to conservative, dissipative, and GUP-corrected geodesics, providing a framework to probe the interplay between external forces, spacetime curvature, and Planck-scale physics.</description>

      <title>Understanding Modal Interactions in Non-classically Damped Linear Oscillators with Closely Spaced Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses non-classically damped coupled oscillators with closely spaced modes focusing on the physics of modal interactions. Considering the simplest representative example in the form of an impulsively excited two-degree-of-freedom (two-DOF) system, we show that there is a single parameter defined as a coupling versus damping non-proportionality ratio, that separates two different dynamical regimes. Based on complexification-averaging analysis, we show that, below the critical value of this parameter, the system response possesses two distinct dissipation rates but only one frequency of oscillation; as a result, energy is slowly exchanged between modes in a single beat phenomenon. However, above the critical parameter value, the response has a single dissipation rate but two distinct oscillation frequencies; this yields an infinity of beat phenomena as energy is interchanged at a faster rate between modes. Our analytical predictions are fully validated by experimental measurements. Our findings highlight the physics of modal interactions in coupled oscillators and provide a framework for system identification and reduced-order modeling of systems with closely spaced modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kulikov, Nazarov, and Sodin recently introduced the notion of criticality to analyze when discrete subsets of the real line form uniqueness pairs for the Fourier transform, relying crucially on estimates derived from the Wirtinger-Poincar\'{e} inequality. In this work, drawing analogies from quantum mechanics, we propose an alternative approach to studying uniqueness sets in a Fourier-symmetric Sobolev space. Our method is based on eigenvalue estimates and offers a simplified perspective on the problem.</description>

      <title>Fourier heuristic PINNs to solve the biharmonic equations based on its coupled scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have been widely utilized for solving a range of partial differential equations (PDEs) in various scientific and engineering disciplines. This paper presents a Fourier heuristic-enhanced PINN (termed FCPINN) designed to address a specific class of biharmonic equations with Dirichlet and Navier boundary conditions. The method achieves this by decomposing the high-order equations into two Poisson equations. FCPINN integrates Fourier spectral theory with a reduced-order formulation for high-order PDEs, significantly improving approximation accuracy and reducing computational complexity. This approach is especially beneficial for problems with intricate boundary constraints and high-dimensional inputs. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of the FCPINN algorithm, we conducted several numerical experiments on both linear and nonlinear biharmonic problems across different Euclidean spaces. The results show that FCPINN provides an optimal trade-off between speed and accuracy for high-order PDEs, surpassing the performance of conventional PINN and deep mixed residual method (MIM) approaches, while also maintaining stability and robustness with varying numbers of hidden layer nodes.</description>

      <title>An Intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-Algebra on the Khovanov-Sano Complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reinterprets the symmetries of equivariant Khovanov homology, discovered by Khovanov and Sano, within the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We identify the Shumakovitch operator $\hat{\nu}$ as a BV Laplacian whose nilpotency, a consequence of the algebra's defining relations, induces an $L_{\infty}$-algebra on homology. We prove this structure is non-trivial through explicit computations of higher brackets. Furthermore, we construct a dual $L_{\infty}$-structure, suggesting a unifying homotopy $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ symmetry. The main result of this paper is to lift this structure from homology to the chain level. Applying the Homotopy Transfer Theorem, we construct an intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-algebra on the Khovanov-Sano complex, whose $\infty$-quasi-isomorphism class is a canonical link invariant. This provides a new algebraic framework in which we conjecture the origin of Steenrod operations in knot homology.</description>

      <title>Domain Wall Skyrmions in Holographic Quantum Chromodynamics: Topological Phases and Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the domain wall skyrmions phase in the framework of holographic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) using the Sakai-Sugimoto model. Building on previous work regarding chiral soliton lattices (CSLs) in strong magnetic fields, we study the emergence of localized skyrmions a top domain walls formed by CSLs. These skyrmions, realized as undissolved D4-branes embedded in the D8-branes, carry baryon number two and exhibit complex topological and energetic features. We explore the interplay between magnetic field strength, pion mass, and baryon chemical potential in stabilizing these configurations and demonstrate the existence of a mixed CSL-skyrmions phase. Through systematic energy analysis, we establish that the domain wall skyrmions become energetically favorable when $\mu_B |B| \gtrsim \Lambda \cdot m_\pi f_\pi^2$, with the transition occurring around $\mu_B |B| \sim 4.5$ in our holographic framework. Our phase diagram reveals three distinct regions: the CSL phase at low chemical potential and magnetic field, the domain wall skyrmions phase at intermediate scales, and a conjectured skyrmions crystal phase at the highest densities. The instanton density profiles $\text{Tr}(F \wedge F)$ show sharp localization in the domain wall skyrmions phase, contrasting with the smooth, extended distribution characteristic of the pure CSL configuration. These findings provide non-perturbative insights into baryonic matter in the dense QCD and offer a geometrical picture of topological phase transitions via string theory duality, with potential applications to neutron star physics and the broader QCD phase diagram under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometric optimization for quantum communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the ultimate limits of quantum communication, such as the quantum capacity of a channel and the distillable entanglement of a shared state, remains a central challenge in quantum information theory, primarily due to the phenomenon of superadditivity. This work develops Riemannian optimization methods to establish significantly tighter, computable two-sided bounds on these fundamental quantities. For upper bounds, our method systematically searches for state and channel extensions that minimize known information-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of all possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that overcomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved upper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined continuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new state-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing channel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the previously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian optimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish lower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum instruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by parameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical results for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our methods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results. Together, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and powerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication limits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel coherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity lower bounds in general.</description>

      <title>Recovering elastic subdomains with strain-gradient elastic interfaces from force measurements: the antiplane shear setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new inverse problem for antiplane shear in elastic bodies with strain-gradient interfaces. The setting is a homogeneous isotropic elastic body containing an inclusion separated by a thin interface endowed with higher-order surface energy. Using displacement-stress measurements on the exterior boundary, expressed through a certain Dirichlet-to-Neumann map, we show uniqueness in recovering both the shear and interface parameters, as well as the shape of the inclusion. To address the inverse shape problem, we adapt the factorization method to account for the complications introduced by the higher-order boundary operator and its nontrivial null space. Numerical experiments illustrate the feasibility of the approach, indicating that the framework potentially provides a practical tool for nondestructive detection of interior inhomogeneities, including damaged subvolumes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Delocalization for Non--Hermitian Eigenvectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an optimal order delocalization estimate for the eigenvectors of general $N \times N$ non-Hermitian matrices $X$: $\| {\bf v } \|_\infty \leq C \sqrt{\frac{\log N}{N}}$ with very high probability, for any right or left eigenvector ${\bf v}$ of $X$. This improves upon the previous tightest bound of Rudelson and Vershynin [arXiv:1306.2887] of $\mathcal{O}( ( \log N)^{9/2}N^{-1/2})$, and holds under weaker assumptions on the tail of the matrix elements. In addition to the coordinate basis, our bound holds for the $\ell^\infty$ norm in any deterministic orthonormal basis. Our result is proven via a dynamical method, by studying the flow of the resolvent of the Hermitization of $X$ and proving local laws on short scales.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of positive, non-CP linear maps is a central problem in operator algebras and quantum information theory, where such maps serve as entanglement witnesses. This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the classical cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the well-studied theory of copositive forms and the structure of positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC. As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of symmetric states, such as the Dicke states. We prove that the sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy. Leveraging this duality, we provide an explicit construction of bipartite (mixture of) Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $\mathcal{K}_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we first recall the definition of the relative distance zeta function in [42, 43, 44, 46, 47] and slightly generalize this notion from sets to probability measures, and then move on to propose a novel definition a relative distance (and tube) zeta functional for a class of states over a C* algebra. With such an extension, we look into the chance to define relative Minkowski dimensions in this context, and explore the notion of fractality for this class of states. Relative complex dimensions as poles of this newly proposed relative distance zeta functional, as well as its geometric and transformation properties, decomposition rules and properties that respects tensor products are discussed. We then explore some examples that possess fractal properties with this new zeta functional and propose functional equations similar to [11,35,36,42].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of Dirac fields under the influence of external electromagnetic fields is studied. For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism which can be unitarily implemented in the GNS representations of KMS states, a result long known for the Fock representation. For time-independent perturbations, however, the time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution, and approach to equilibrium, a possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can be investigated. As a byproduct, we find an explicit formula for the relative entropy of gauge invariant quasi-free states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish asymptotic formulae for general joint moments of characteristic polynomials and their higher-order derivatives associated with matrices drawn randomly from the groups $\mathrm{USp}(2N)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(2N)$ in the limit as $N\to\infty$. This relates the leading-order asymptotic contribution in each case to averages over the Laguerre ensemble of random matrices. We uncover an exact connection between these joint moments and a solution of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'{e} V equation, valid for finite matrix size, as well as a connection between the leading-order asymptotic term and a solution of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'{e} III$'$ equation in the limit as $N \rightarrow \infty$. These connections enable us to derive exact formulae for joint moments for finite matrix size and for the joint moments of certain random variables arising from the Bessel point process in a recursive way. As an application, we provide a positive answer to a question proposed by Altu\u{g} et al.</description>

Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended here to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of such stochastic geometric representations are presented in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions-- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.</description>

Abstract: The fundamental notion of non-abelian generalized cohomology gained recognition in algebraic topology as the non-abelian Poincar\'e-dual to "factorization homology", and in theoretical physics as providing flux-quantization for non-linear Gauss laws. However, already the archetypical example -- unstable Cohomotopy, first studied almost a century ago by Pontrjagin -- has remained underappreciated as a cohomology theory and has only recently received attention as a flux-quantizaton law ("Hypothesis H").
  Here we lay out a general construction of the analogue of the Chern character map on twisted equivariant non-abelian cohomology theories (with equivariantly simply-connected classifying spaces) and illustrate the construction by spelling out a twisted equivariant form of Cohomotopy as an archetypical and intriguing running example, essentially by computing its equivariant Sullivan model.
  We close with an outlook on the application of this result to the rigorous deduction of anyonic quantum states on M5-branes wrapped over Seifert 3-orbifolds.</description>

      <title>Gauged compact Q-balls and Q-shells in a multi-component $CP^N$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multicomponent $CP^N$ model's scalar electrodynamics. The model contains Q-balls/shells, which are non-topological compact solitons with time dependency $e^{i\omega t}$. Two coupled $CP^N$ models can decouple locally if one of their $CP^N$ fields takes the vacuum value. Because of the compacton nature of solutions, Q-shells can shelter another compact Q-ball or Q-shell within their hollow region. Even if compactons do not overlap, they can interact through the electromagnetic field. We investigate how the size of multi-compacton formations is affected by electric charge. We are interested in structures with non-zero or zero total net charge.</description>

      <title>Quasi-local spin-angular momentum and the construction of axial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel procedure is presented which allows the construction of all axial vector fields on Riemannian two-spheres. Using these axial vector fields and the centre-of-mass unit sphere reference systems, a constructive definition of quasi-local spin-angular momentum is introduced. Balance relations are also derived, with respect to arbitrary Lie-propagated unit sphere reference systems, to characterize the angular momentum transports in spacetimes without symmetries.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-real quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of pseudo-reality for complex numbers. We show that this concept, applied to quantum fields, provides a unifying framework for two distinct approaches to pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories. The first approach stems from analytically continuing Hermitian theories into the complex plane, while the second is based on constructing them from first principles. The pseudo-reality condition for bosonic fields resolves a long-standing problem with the formulation of gauge theories involving pseudo-Hermitian currents, sheds new light on the resolution of the so-called Hermiticity Puzzle, and may allow a consistent minimal coupling of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories to gravity. We focus on the $i\phi^3$ cubic scalar theory, obtaining the relevant pseudo-reality conditions up to quadratic order in the coupling; a theory of two complex scalar fields with non-Hermitian mass mixing; and the latter's coupling to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The general principle of pseudo-reality, however, is expected to contribute to the ongoing development of the first-principles construction of pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, including their formulation in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Benford's Law from Turing Ensembles and Integer Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16314v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop two complementary generative mechanisms that explain when and why Benford's first-digit law arises. First, a probabilistic Turing machine (PTM) ensemble induces a geometric law for code length. Maximizing its entropy under a constraint on halting length yields Benford statistics. This model shows a phase transition with respect to the halt probability. Second, a constrained partition model (Einstein-solid combinatorics) recovers the same logarithmic profile as the maximum-entropy solution under a coarse-grained entropy-rate constraint, clarifying the role of non-ergodicity (ensemble vs.\ trajectory averages). We also perform numerical experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of Even-Valent Graphs on Riemann Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using connections to random matrix theory and orthogonal polynomials, we develop a framework for obtaining explicit closed-form formulae for the number, $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$, of connected $2\nu$-valent labeled graphs with $j$ vertices that can be embedded on a compact Riemann surface of minimal genus $g$. We also derive formulae for their two-legged counterparts $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$. Our method recovers the known explicit results for graphs embedded on the plane and the torus, and extends them to all genera $g \geq 2$. In earlier work, Ercolani, Lega, and Tippings (2023) showed that $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ and $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ admit structural expressions as linear combinations of, respectively, $3g-2$ and $3g$ Gauss hypergeometric functions ${}_2F_1$, but with coefficients left undetermined. The framework developed here provides a systematic procedure to compute these coefficients, thereby turning the structural expressions into fully explicit formulae for $\mathscr{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ and $\mathcal{N}_{g}(2\nu,j)$ as functions of both $j$ and $\nu$. Detailed results are given for $g=2,3,$ and $4$, and the framework extends naturally to all $g \geq 5$ with increasing computational effort. This closes the fixed genus combinatorics for even-valent graphs.</description>

      <title>Critical point search and linear response theory for computing electronic excitation energies of molecular systems. Part I: General framework, application to Hartree-Fock and DFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing excited states of many-body quantum Hamiltonians is a fundamental challenge in computational physics and chemistry, with state-of-the-art methods broadly classified into variational (critical point search) and linear response approaches. The K\"ahler manifold formalism provides a uniform framework which naturally accommodates both strategies for a wide range of variational models, including Hartree-Fock, CASSCF, Full CI, and adiabatic TDDFT. In particular, this formalism leads to a systematic and straightforward way to obtain the final equations of linear response theory for nonlinear models, which provides, in the case of mean-field models (Hartree-Fock and DFT), a simple alternative to Casida's derivation. We detail the mathematical structure of Hamiltonian dynamics on K\"ahler manifolds, establish connections to standard quantum chemistry equations, and provide theoretical and numerical comparisons of excitation energy computation schemes at the Hartree-Fock level.</description>

      <title>Quantum ergodicity for contact metric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the proof of a Quantum Ergodicity (QE) theorem for the eigenfunctions of subLaplacians on contact metric manifolds, under the assumption that the Reeb flow is ergodic. To do so, we rely on a semiclassical pseudodifferential calculus developed for general filtered manifolds that we specialize to the setting of contact manifolds. Our strategy is then reminiscent of an implementation of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation as we rely on the construction of microlocal projectors in our calculus which commute with the subLaplacian, called Landau projectors. The subLaplacian is then shown to act effectively on the range of each Landau projector as the Reeb vector field does. The remainder of the proof follows the classical path towards QE, once microlocal Weyl laws have been established.</description>

      <title>Non-universal Thermal Hall Responses in Fractional Quantum Hall Droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically compute the thermal Hall conductance (THC) of fractional quantum Hall droplets under realistic conditions that go beyond the idealized linear edge theory with conformal symmetry. Specifically, we consider finite-size effects at low temperature, nonzero self-energies of quasiholes, and general edge dispersions. We derive measurable corrections in THC that align well with the experimental observables. Although the quantized THC is commonly regarded as a topological invariant that is independent of edge confinement, our results show that this quantization remains robust only for arbitrary edge dispersion in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, the THC contributed by Abelian modes can become extremely sensitive to finite-size effects and irregular confining potentials in any realistic experimental system. In contrast, non-Abelian modes show robust THC signatures under perturbations, indicating an intrinsic stability of non-Abelian anyons.</description>
