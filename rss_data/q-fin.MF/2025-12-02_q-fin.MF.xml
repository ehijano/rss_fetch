      <title>Stochastic Dominance Constrained Optimization with S-shaped Utilities: Poor-Performance-Region Algorithm and Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the static portfolio selection problem of S-shaped and non-concave utility maximization under first-order and second-order stochastic dominance (SD) constraints. In many S-shaped utility optimization problems, one should require a liquidation boundary to guarantee the existence of a finite concave envelope function. A first-order SD (FSD) constraint can replace this requirement and provide an alternative for risk management. We explicitly solve the optimal solution under a general S-shaped utility function with a first-order stochastic dominance constraint. However, the second-order SD (SSD) constrained problem under non-concave utilities is difficult to solve analytically due to the invalidity of Sion's maxmin theorem. For this sake, we propose a numerical algorithm to obtain a plausible and sub-optimal solution for general non-concave utilities. The key idea is to detect the poor performance region with respect to the SSD constraints, characterize its structure and modify the distribution on that region to obtain (sub-)optimality. A key financial insight is that the decision maker should follow the SD constraint on the poor performance scenario while conducting the unconstrained optimal strategy otherwise. We provide numerical experiments to show that our algorithm effectively finds a sub-optimal solution in many cases. Finally, we develop an algorithm-guided piecewise-neural-network framework to learn the solution of the SSD problem, which demonstrates accelerated convergence compared to standard neural network approaches.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Investment with Random Risk Aversion: (Non-)uniqueness, Optimality, and Comparative Statics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates infinite-dimensional portfolio selection problem under a general distribution of the risk aversion parameter. We provide a complete characterization of all deterministic equilibrium investment strategies. Our results reveal that the solution structure depends critically on the distribution of risk aversion: the equilibrium is unique whenever it exists in the case of finite expected risk aversion, whereas an infinite expectation can lead to infinitely many equilibria or to a unique trivial one (pi equals 0). To address this multiplicity, we introduce three optimality criteria-optimal, uniformly optimal, and uniformly strictly optimal-and explicitly characterize the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding equilibria. Under the same necessary and sufficient condition, the optimal and uniformly optimal equilibria exist uniquely and coincide. Furthermore, by additionally assuming that the market price of risk is non-zero near the terminal time, we show that the optimal (and hence uniformly optimal) equilibrium is also uniformly strictly optimal. Finally, we perform comparative statics to demonstrate that a risk aversion distribution dominating another in the reverse hazard rate order leads to a less aggressive equilibrium strategy.</description>

      <title>Arbitrage-Free Option Price Surfaces via Chebyshev Tensor Bases and a Hamiltonian Fog Post-Fit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the construction of arbitrage-free option price surfaces from noisy bid-ask quotes across strike and maturity. Our starting point is a Chebyshev representation of the call price surface on a warped log-moneyness/maturity rectangle, together with linear sampling and no-arbitrage operators acting on a collocation grid. Static no-arbitrage requirements are enforced as linear inequalities, while the surface is fitted directly to prices via a coverage-seeking quadratic objective that trades off squared band misfit against spectral and transport-inspired regularisation of the Chebyshev coefficients. This yields a strictly convex quadratic program in the modal coefficients, solvable at practical scales with off-the-shelf solvers (OSQP).
  On top of the global backbone, we introduce a local post-fit layer based on a discrete fog of risk-neutral densities on a three-dimensional lattice (m,t,u) and an associated Hamiltonian-type energy. On each patch of the (m,t) plane, the fog variables are coupled to a nodal price field obtained from the baseline surface, yielding a joint convex optimisation problem that reweights noisy quotes and applies noise-aware local corrections while preserving global static no-arbitrage and locality.
  The method is designed such that for equity options panels, the combined procedure achieves high inside-spread coverage in stable regimes (in calm years, 98-99% of quotes are priced inside the bid-ask intervals) and low rates of static no-arbitrage violations (below 1%). In stressed periods, the fog layer provides a mechanism for controlled leakage outside the band: when local quotes are mutually inconsistent or unusually noisy, the optimiser allocates fog mass outside the bid-ask tube and justifies small out-of-band deviations of the post-fit surface, while preserving a globally arbitrage-free and well-regularised description of the option surface.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Distributionally Robust Merton Problem with Nonlinear Wasserstein Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit Merton's continuous-time portfolio selection through a data-driven, distributionally robust lens. Our aim is to tap the benefits of frequent trading over short horizons while acknowledging that drift is hard to pin down, whereas volatility can be screened using realized or implied measures for appropriately selected assets. Rather than time-rectangular distributional robust control -- which replenishes adversarial power at every instant and induces over-pessimism -- we place a single ambiguity set on the drift prior within a Bayesian Merton model. This prior-level ambiguity preserves learning and tractability: a minimax swap reduces the robust control to optimizing a nonlinear functional of the prior, enabling Karatzas and Zhao \cite{KZ98}-type's closed-form evaluation for each candidate prior. We then characterize small-radius worst-case priors under Wasserstein uncertainty via an explicit asymptotically optimal pushforward of the nominal prior, and we calibrate the ambiguity radius through a nonlinear Wasserstein projection tailored to the Merton functional. Synthetic and real-data studies demonstrate reduced pessimism relative to DRC and improved performance over myopic DRO-Markowitz under frequent rebalancing.</description>

      <title>DeFi Arbitrage in Hedged Liquidity Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11339v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirically, the prevailing market prices for liquidity tokens of the constant product market maker (CPMM) -- as offered in practice by companies such as Uniswap -- readily permit arbitrage opportunities by delta hedging the risk of the position. Herein, we investigate this arbitrage opportunity by treating the liquidity token as a derivative position in the prices of the underlying assets for the CPMM. In doing so, not dissimilar to the Black-Scholes result, we deduce risk-neutral pricing and hedging formulas for these liquidity tokens. Furthermore, with our novel pricing formula, we construct a method to calibrate a volatility to data which provides an updated (non-market) price which would not permit arbitrage if quoted by the CPMM. We conclude with a discussion of novel AMM designs which would bring the pricing of liquidity tokens into the modern financial era.</description>

      <title>In-Sample and Out-of-Sample Sharpe Ratios for Linear Predictive Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how much the in-sample performance of trading strategies based on linear predictive models is reduced out-of-sample due to overfitting. More specifically, we compute the in- and out-of-sample means and variances of the corresponding PnLs and use these to derive a closed-form approximation for the corresponding Sharpe ratios. We find that the out-of-sample "replication ratio" diminishes for complex strategies with many assets based on many weak rather than a few strong trading signals, and increases when more training data is used. The substantial quantitative importance of these effects is illustrated with a simulation case study for commodity futures following the methodology of G\^arleanu and Pedersen, and an empirical case study using the dataset compiled by Goyal, Welch and Zafirov.</description>
