      <title>The Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko model in the continuous setting: PDE derivation and long-time behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we develop and analyze a continuous version of the well-known Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko (BDY) dollar-exchange discrete model. Starting from the conservative BDY exchange mechanism, we rely on kinetic theory for multi-agent systems in order to propose an analogue continuous dynamics, which does not belong to the class of other popular kinetic models for wealth exchange. We employ the quasi-invariant limit procedure to rigorously derive a nonlinear PDE on the half-line, which is a Fokker-Planck equation featuring the boundary value in the drift term. The PDE is supplemented with a nonlinear Robin-type boundary condition encoding conservation of total agents and wealth. We prove existence and uniqueness of the solution, which converges in relative entropy to the unique stationary state that is the Boltzmann-Gibbs (exponential) distribution. We determine the $L^1$ convergence (up to subsequences) of the solution toward this equilibrium: this requires us to make a step forward with respect to established arguments of entropy decay for Fokker-Planck equations. Thus, our results, which bridge the discrete stochastic dynamics with a continuous deterministic evolution equation, provide a novel and influential wealth exchange model in a PDE framework, which opens up many new applicative scenarios and methodological analytical challenges.</description>

      <title>Blow-up criterion for the compressible Navier--Stokes system with inflow-outflow boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Navier-Stokes system in three dimensions with general inflow-outflow boundary conditions, meaning that we prescribe a boundary velocity which has non-zero normal component and accordingly the density is prescribed on the inflow part of the boundary. We establish a blow-up criterion in a class of strong solutions in the $L^p-L^q$ framework. In particular assuming the boundedness of the quantities $(\varrho^{-1}, \bu)$ and of a suitable norm of $\nabla_x \varrho$ the solution remains regular and the blow-up does not occur. We develop the condition on $\nabla_x \varrho$ because we need a new approach in order to accommodate the inhomogeneous boundary conditions, as the standard estimates on the material time derivative works when the normal component of the boundary velocity is zero.</description>

      <title>A geophysical free-boundary system modeling an ice-sheet interacting with an ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a free-boundary model for the ice-sheet interacting with an ocean. The model captures the coupling between a viscous geophysical fluid and an elastic interface through kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions that account for hydrodynamic loading. Using the ALE formulation, we derive a system on a fixed reference domain and establish local-in-time a priori estimates for strong solutions with initial data in $H^2$. The main analytical difficulties arise from the nonlinear terms involving vertical derivatives and from high-order pressure contributions on the interface.</description>

      <title>A Front Fixing Crank-Nicolson Finite Deference for the American Put Options Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving the American put options pricing model by hugely relying on a front-fixing Crank-Nicolson finite difference method. Since the American put option pricing model is a widely used financial model for valuing an option with the right to sell an underlying asset at a fated price which generally decided in advance. The method we proposed here, solves the problem of early exercise by introducing a front-fixing technique that permits for efficient and accurate valuation of an American put option. As in the comparison to other approaches in the existing literature, we can assert that this method is stable, accurate, consistent, and efficient. The results that we obtained here from the numerical experiments demonstrate not only the efficacy of the proposed method but also in consistently and accurately pricing American put options with a stable scheme. Under some appropriate conditions on the step size discretization, we also show the positivity and monotonicity of the coefficient involved in the numerical scheme used.</description>

      <title>Gevrey well-posedness of the hydrostatic MHD-wave system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the well-posedness of the hydrostatic MHD-wave system. Unlike the standard hydrostatic MHD equations, the tangential magnetic field equation in this system is degenerate hyperbolic rather than parabolic, which leads to substantial mathematical difficulties. Using the boundary decomposition method, we establish local well-posedness in Gevrey $\frac{7}{6}$ space for convex initial data.</description>

      <title>Existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for $L^2$-supercritical Schr\"odinger equations on noncompact metric graphs with nonlinear point defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions for the following $L^2$-supercritical Schr\"odinger equation on noncompact metric graph $\G=(\V,\E)$ with nonlinear point defects \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases} u'' = \lambda u &amp; \text{on every }\e \in \E, \\ \|u\|_{L^2(\mathcal{G})}^2 = \mu &amp; \\ \displaystyle\sum_{\e \succ \vv} u'_\e(\vv) = -|u(\vv)|^{p-2}u(\vv) &amp; \text{at every }\vv \in \V, \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $p&gt;4$, $\G$ has finitely many edges, $\mu&gt;0$ is a given constant, the parameter $\lambda$ is a part of the unknown which arises as a Lagrange multiplier, $\e \succ \vv$ means that the edge $\e$ is incident at $\vv$, and the notation $u'_\e(\vv)$ stands for $u'_\e(0)$ or $-u'_\e(\ell_\e)$, according to whether the vertex $\vv$ is identified with $0$ or $\ell_\e$. This work complements the study initiated by Boni, Dovetta, and Serra [J. Funct. Anal. 288 (2025), 110760], which addressed only the existence of normalized solutions for the $L^2$-subcritical ($2&lt;p&lt;4$) Schr\"{o}dinger equation on metric graphs with nonlinear point defects.</description>

Abstract: In this paper conditions, under which an integro-differential operator is a linear automorphism, are provided. Alternatively, the problem can be considered in terms of existence of a unique formal power series solution for a linear Cauchy problem, where the coefficients of the solution are of a certain Gevrey order on progressively shrinking domains.</description>

      <title>Thermoelastic plates with type I heat conduction with second gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the qualitative properties of thermoelastic plates modeled by the second-gradient theory with a Type I heat equation. We establish the exponential stability of the solutions. Our main contribution is to prove that the semigroup is non-differentiable when the bi-Laplacian operator appears in the heat equation. Additionally, we analyze the case where the elastic parameter is negative, demonstrating the uniqueness and instability of the solutions. Finally, in the one-dimensional quasi-static case, we demonstrate the existence and exponential decay of the solutions under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>On the regularity for thermoelastic systems of phase-lag parabolic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the maximal smoothness (infinite differentiability) of solutions to thermoelastic models, specifically those where the heat equation is of the ``phase-lag'' or ``parabolic'' type. We derive optimal regularity results for two distinct models. The first model addresses the transverse oscillations of a fully thermoelastic plate, for which we prove that the associated semigroup is analytic. The second model considers a partially thermoelastic plate composed of two components: a thermoelastic component with nonzero temperature differences and an elastic component unaffected by temperature variations. For this model, we demonstrate that the semigroup \( S(t) \) belongs to the Gevrey class of order 4, provided the solutions are radial and symmetric. Both analyticity and Gevrey class membership are qualitative properties that intricately link regularity and stability, driven by robust dissipative mechanisms. These properties are significantly stronger than standard regularity conditions, such as belonging to the class \( C^k \) or a Sobolev space \( H^s \).</description>

      <title>Boundary regularity of weakly coupled vectorial almost-minimizers for Alt-Caffarelli functionals with non-standard growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a fixed constant $\lambda &gt; 0$ and a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n \geq 2$, we establish that almost-minimizers (functions satisfying a sort of variational inequality) of the Alt-Caffarelli type functional \[ \mathcal{J}_G({\bf v};\Omega) \coloneqq \int_\Omega \left(\sum_{i=1}^mG\big(|\nabla v_i(x)|\big) + \lambda \chi_{\{|{\bf v}|&gt;0\}}(x)\right) dx , \] where ${\bf v} = (v_1, \dots, v_m)$ and $m \in \mathbb{N}$, exhibit optimal (up-to-the boundary) Lipschitz continuity, where $G$ is a $\mathcal{N}$-function satisfying specific growth conditions. Our work extends the recent regularity results for weakly coupled vectorial almost-minimizers for the $p$-Laplacian addressed in \cite{BFS24}, thereby providing new insights and approaches applicable to a wide class of non-linear one or two-phase free boundary problems with non-standard growth. Our findings remain novel and significant even in the scalar setting and for minimizers of the type considered by Mart\'{i}nez--Wolanski \cite{MW08} and da Silva \textit{et al.} \cite{daSSV2024}.</description>

      <title>Determining Modes, State Reconstruction, and Intertwinement: Existence of Self-Synchronizing Intertwinements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the companion paper of the authors, a general synchronization framework was developed in the paradigmatic context of the 2D Navier-Stokes equations that allows one to precisely study the relation between the determining modes property of the corresponding dynamical system and the ability of certain continuous data assimilation algorithms to reconstruct unobserved state variables from sufficiently many observed state variables in this system, i.e., the reconstruction property. In this framework, the determining modes property and the reconstruction property can be viewed in a unified way as the ability of certain couplings of the Navier-Stokes equations to self-synchronize; due to the bi-directionality of coupling, the coupled system is referred to as an "intertwinement." A central achievement of this framework is to deduce a conceptual equivalence between the determining modes property and the reconstruction property of continuous data assimilation algorithms. In this paper, we prove that there are at least two non-trivial classes of intertwinements to which this framework applies. Moreover, these intertwinements encompass the continuous data assimilation algorithms studied in (Olson, Titi 2003) and (Azouani, Olson, Titi 2014) as special cases. Specifically, we show that there exist two types of intertwinements that are globally well-posed and we identify conditions under which these intertwinements self-synchronize. We emphasize that the intertwinements studied here can be induced by nonlinear perturbations of the underlying system, which are subsequently coupled bi-directionally to a copy of itself. Thus, establishing global well-posedness and suitable global-in-time uniform bounds, which are crucial to proving the claimed synchronization phenomenon, requires careful consideration.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of parabolic KWC-systems with variable-dependent mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the parabolic KWC system, associated with the mathematical model of grain boundary motion. The goal of this paper is to guarantee the well-posedness of the parabolic KWC system. However, such results have not been reported under the setting where the mobility of grain boundary motion depends on the unknown. To overcome this difficulty, results for the pseudo-parabolic type KWC system in [Antil et al., SIAM J. Math. Anal. \textbf{56}(5), 6422--6445](2024) suggest that the $H^1$-regularity of the time-derivative of the solution plays an essential role in verifying the uniqueness of the solution. In this light, we consider the pseudo-parabolic KWC system as an approximating system of the parabolic one, and focus on the improvements of regularity of solution to the parabolic system. By virtue of this regularity result, we establish the well-posedness theory on the parabolic KWC system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the semilinear damped wave equation with nonlinearities of derivative type $|u_t|^p$. We observe that this problem admits a unique global (in time) solution with small initial data for all $p &gt; 1$ in low spatial dimensions $n=1,2$. This result provides new insights into semilinear damped wave equations and complements the existing literature.</description>

      <title>A Volterra equation approach to the local limit of nonlocal traffic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlocal conservation laws modeling traffic flow, given by $ \partial_t u_\varepsilon + \partial_x(V(u_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon)\, u_\varepsilon) = 0 $ with $ \gamma_\varepsilon(\cdot) := \varepsilon^{-1}\gamma(\cdot/\varepsilon) $ for a suitable convex convolution kernel $\gamma$. Since the work of Colombo et al. (Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal., 2023), thanks to uniform $ \mathrm{L}^\infty $- and TV-estimates, it is known that $ w_\varepsilon := u_\varepsilon \ast \gamma_\varepsilon $ converges to the entropy solution of the local scalar conservation law $ \partial_t u + \partial_x(V(u)\, u) = 0 $ as $\varepsilon \searrow 0$. However, the convergence of $ \{u_\varepsilon\}_{\varepsilon &gt; 0} $ itself has not been fully addressed so far. In this direction, a known result applies specifically to the case of an exponential kernel, where the identity $ \varepsilon \partial_x w_\varepsilon = w_\varepsilon - u_\varepsilon $ is fundamental. In this work, we address this gap in the literature and prove that $ \{u_\varepsilon\}_{\varepsilon &gt; 0} $ converges to the same limit $u$ under the mild additional assumption that the initial datum belongs to $\mathrm L^1(\mathbb{R})$. Our analysis exploits, through a Fourier approach, the stability properties of the more general Volterra-type equation $\partial_xw_\varepsilon=\gamma'_\varepsilon\ast u_\varepsilon-\gamma_\varepsilon(0)u_\varepsilon$, thereby deducing the convergence of $u_\varepsilon$ from that of $w_\varepsilon$.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the large-time behavior of solutions for the compressible Navier-Stokes system with degenerate heat-conductivity describing the one-dimensional motion of a viscous heat-conducting perfect polytropic gas. We proved that for the one-dimensional compressible system with temperature-dependent heat conductivity, the combination of viscous contact wave with rarefaction waves for the non-isentropic polytropic gas is asymptotically stable under large initial perturbation, provided the strength of the combination waves is suitably small.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate solutions with prescribed $L^{2}$-norm (i.e., prescribed mass) for the planar Schr\"{o}dinger-Poisson (SP) equation% \begin{equation*} -\Delta u+\lambda u+\alpha \left( \log |\cdot |\ast |u|^{2}\right) u=|u|^{p-2}u,\ \text{in}\ \Omega_{R} , \end{equation*}% where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$ is unknown, $\alpha &lt;0,p&gt;4$ and $\Omega_{R} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{2}$ is a domain. First, we prove that the energy functional $J$ corresponding to the SP equation in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ is unbounded both above and below on the Pohozaev manifold $\mathcal{P}$; this explains the reason why the minimax level of $J$ is difficult to determine, as referenced in [Cingolani and Jeanjean, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 2019]. Second, we establish the existence of a ground state and a high-energy solution, both with positive energy in a large bounded domain $\Omega_{R} $, which is a substantial advancement in addressing an open problem proposed in [Cingolani and Jeanjean, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 2019]. Finally, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of solutions as the domain $\Omega_{R} $ is extended to the entire space $\mathbb{R}^{2}$.</description>

      <title>A duality approach to gradient H\"older estimates for linear divergence form elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sparse bound in the context of Schauder theory for divergence form elliptic partial differential equations. In addition, we show how an iteration argument inspired by sparse domination bounds can be used to deduce gradient reverse H\"older inequalities for equations with non-constant coefficients from the theory for constant coefficient equations. We deal with coefficient matrices whose entries are either H\"older continuous or just uniformly continuous, leading to different results. The purpose of the approach is to highlight the connection between Schauder theory and duality of local Hardy spaces and local H\"older spaces.</description>

      <title>Modulation approximation for the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a formal approximation, the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger (NLS) equation can be derived to describe the evolution of the envelopes of small oscillating wave packets-like solutions to the Euler-Poisson system. In this paper we rigorously justify that the wave packets for the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system can be approximated by solutions of the NLS equation over a physically relevant $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ time scale. Besides the difficulties such as resonances at $k=0$ and $k=\pm k_0$ and loss of derivatives arising in the modulation approximation problem in the isentropic Euler-Poisson system, new difficulties arise in the non-isentropic case. In the non-isentropic Euler-Poisson system, new resonances at wave number $k=\pm 2k_0$ appear which necessitate rescaling the correction to the modulation approximation differently for different wave numbers. In addition, it is more difficult to obtain the uniform estimates for the error $(R_{0},R_{1},R_{-1})$ between the real solutions and the approximate solutions, due to the extra interactions with the temperature. To overcome the difficulties aroused by resonances and loss of derivatives, we find several important structural identities between the diagonalized unknowns and apply a series of normal-form transforms, to obtain uniform estimates for the error over the desired $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ long time scale.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz stability for an inverse problem of a fully-discrete stochastic hyperbolic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a discrete inverse problem of determining three unknowns, i.e. initial displacement, initial velocity and random source term, in a fully discrete approximation of one-dimensional stochastic hyperbolic equation. We firstly prove a new Carleman estimate for the fully-discrete stochastic hyperbolic equation. Based on this Carleman estimate, we then establish a Lipschitz stability for this discrete inverse problem by the discrete spatial derivative data at the left endpoint and the measurements of the solution and its time derivative at the final time. Owing to the discrete setting, an extra term with respect to mesh size arises in the right-hand side of the stability estimate.</description>

      <title>Incompressible 2D Euler equations with non-decaying random initial vorticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a random initial vorticity $\omega_0(x) = \sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}^2} a_n \phi(x-n)$, where $\phi$ is bounded and compactly supported and $\{a_n\}$ are independent, uniformly bounded, mean $0$, variance $1$ random variables (i.e. $\omega_0$ is an array of randomly weighted vortex blobs). We prove global well-posedness of weak solutions to the Euler equations in $\mathbf{R}^2$ for almost every such initial vorticity. The main contribution of our work is the construction of a corresponding initial velocity field that grows slowly at infinity, which enables us to apply a recent well-posedness result of Cobb and Koch.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the compactness of extremal functions for a critical singular anisotropic Trudinger-Moser inequality established by Lu-Shen-Xue-Zhu\cite{ref1}. We prove by means of blow-up analysis that the extremals $u_{\beta}$ converge in $W_{0}^{1,n}(\Omega)\cap C^{1}(\overline{\Omega})$ to some function $u_{0}$ which achieves the supremum
  \begin{equation}
  \sup\limits_{u\in W_{0}^{1,n}(\Omega),\Vert u\Vert_{F(\Omega)}\leq1}\int_{\Omega}^{}e^{\tau_{n}\vert u\vert^{\frac{n}{n-1}}}dx,\notag
  \end{equation} as $\beta\to 0$, where $\tau_{n}=n^{\frac{n}{n-1}}\kappa_{n}^{\frac{1}{n-1}}$, $\kappa_{n}$ denotes the volume of the unit Wulff ball in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ and $\Vert u\Vert_{F(\Omega)}$ is the anisotropic norm of $u$.</description>

      <title>A revisit on the critical blow-up for semilinear wave equations in low space dimensions with slicing method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this reviewing paper, we are interested in the proof of estimating the lifespan of classical solutions of semilinear wave equations with the critical exponent from above especially in low space dimensions. There are a few ways to show the result by comparison argument with ODE via point-wise estimates, or by functional method via a weak form with a special choice of test functions. But in order to make a good much with the numerical analysis, we show a simple proof by iteration argument of a point-wise estimate of the solution with a slicing technique.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New Strichartz estimates for the modulated cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation are proved. These Strichartz estimates allow us to show that this equation is pathwise locally well-posed. We also show that improved Strichartz estimates are available in the case where the modulation is white noise. Additionally, we comment on a few basic properties of the modulated cubic nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation such as conservation of mass and convergence of its linear flow as time tends to zero.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the asymptotic behavior at infinity of solution $u$ to Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation $\det(D^2u)=f$ in $\rn$, where $f$ is a perturbation of a periodic function and is only assumed to be H\"{o}lder continuous, compared to the previous work that $f$ is at least $C^{1,\az}$. The consequence established in this paper, by a nonlocal method, is that the difference between $u$ and a quadratic polynomial is asymptotically close to a periodic function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantitative unique continuation property of the second-order elliptic operators under the vanishing Neumann boundary condition over $C^{1,\alpha}$ or convex domains in two dimensions. We establish the optimal estimates of the number of critical points, doubling index and the total length of level curves. The key idea is to reduce the Neumann problem to the Dirichlet problem, which has been understood better, by a classical duality between an $A$-harmonic function and its stream function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a singular diffusive prey-predator system with nonlocal dispersal for which the carrying capacity of the predator is proportional to the density of prey. We show the existence of positive one-dimensional traveling waves connecting the predator-free state and the constant co-existence state. The set of admissible wave speeds is proved to be equal to the semi-infinite interval $[s^*,\infty)$, for some $s^*&gt;0$ which is characterized by a variational formula.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study time harmonic scattering problems in linear elasticity in $\mathbb{R}^{2}$. We show that certain penetrable scatterers with rectangular corners scatter every incident wave nontrivially. Even though these scatterers have interior transmission eigenvalues, the far field operator has a trivial kernel at every real frequency. Our approach relies on a special decomposition of the elastic Lam\'e operator and also provides an alternative idea for treating inverse elastic medium problems with a general polygonal support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the local $C^{1, \alpha}$ regularity of minimizers for functionals of the form $$w\to \int_{\Omega}(|\nabla w|^p-fw) dx + \int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{|w(x)-w(y)|^q}{|x-y|^{n+sq}}dx\, dy,$$ where $s \in (0, 1)$, $1 &lt; p \leq sq$, and $f \in L^\infty(\Omega)$. This result complements the work of De Filippis and Minigione in \cite{DFM}, thereby completing the proof of $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity for all $p, q \in (1, \infty)$ and $s \in (0, 1)$ with locally bounded source term.</description>

      <title>Compressible Euler equations with time-dependent damping in the critical regularity setting: global well-posedness and strong relaxation limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relaxation problem and the diffusion phenomenon for the compressible Euler system with a time-dependent damping coefficient of the form $\tfrac{\mu}{(1+t)^{\lambda}}$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d \geq 1)$. We establish uniform regularity estimates with respect to the relaxation parameter $\varepsilon$ and prove the global well-posedness of classical solutions to the Cauchy problem. In addition, we justify the global-in-time strong convergence of the solutions towards those of a general porous medium-type diffusion system, with an explicit rate of convergence, and for ill-prepared initial data. The core of our proof relies on a refined hypocoercivity framework combined with a new time-dependent frequency decomposition, both adapted to handle damping terms with time-dependent coefficients. This enables us to treat the overdamped regime $\lambda \in (-\infty,0)$ and the underdamped regime $\lambda \in (0,1)$ for any $\mu&gt;0$, and also the borderline critical case $\lambda=1$ under the improved condition $\mu&gt;2\varepsilon^2$.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the 3-D compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosities in exterior domains with far-field vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with density-dependent viscosities in exterior domains. When both the shear and bulk viscosity coefficients depend on the density in a power law ($\rho^{\delta}$ with $0&lt;\delta&lt;1$) and Navier-slip boundary condition on the velocity is imposed, base on a reformulation of the problem using new variables to handle the degeneracy near vacuum, we establish the local well-posedness of regular solutions with far-field vacuum in inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces. Compared to the Cauchy problem, the initial-boundary value problem requires establishing non-standard weighted estimates and handling the unavailability of boundary conditions for higher-order terms. Our approach addresses these challenges via the conormal space technique.</description>

      <title>Long- and short-time behavior of hypocoercive evolution equations with higher index via modal decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypocoercivity emerged in kinetic transport theory, allowing to derive exponential long-time estimates for evolution equations. Recently, the short-time asymptotics for equations with dissipative generators were obtained using the hypocoercivity index that is in finite dimensions surprisingly given by a Kalman-type rank condition well-known in control theory. However, the situation for unbounded generators is only understood for index one if modal decompositions are available. Here, we prove long- and short-time estimates for unbounded generators with higher index admitting a modal decomposition. Additionally, an explicit Lyapunov functional is constructed. The result is applied to a class of port-Hamiltonian systems with distributed dissipation.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the previously obtained Kru\v{z}kov-type uniqueness result for the initial-boundary value problem for the chemical flood conservation law system to the case of an almost arbitrary flow function, not restricted by the S-shaped condition or the monotonicity with respect to the chemical agent concentration. The result is applied to the analysis of the Riemann problem solutions for an S-shaped flow function changing monotonicity with respect to the chemical concentration exactly once. All possible Riemann problem solution structures are classified, including certain unique structures that have not been described in earlier studies.

      <title>Bifurcation from the Kurth solution in galactic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It will be shown that there exists an infinite-dimensional continuum ${\cal C}$ of weak static solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson system that bifurcates from the Kurth solution. Each $f_\ast\in {\cal C}$ has the charge density $\rho_{f_\ast}=\rho_{{\rm Kurth}}$, and (like the Kurth solution itself) each $f_\ast$ is surrounded by time-periodic weak solutions.</description>

Abstract: We review progress on questions related to front propagation into unstable states and point out open problems in the area. We strive to highlight different theoretical perspectives and challenges while also addressing more practical questions with examples and guides to computational methods. Throughout we take a dynamical systems point of view that focuses on the ability of invasion processes to act as a selection mechanism in complex systems.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove a sharp large derivation principle (LDP) for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with Gaussian random initial data in Fourier Lebesgue spaces.

      <title>Isoperiodic deformations of Abelian differentials of the second kind over elliptic curves and the Boussinesq equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study deformations of a genus one Riemann surface and of a second order Abelian differential on the surface which preserve the periods of the differential with respect to a chosen canonical homology basis of the surface. We call these deformations isoperiodic. We derive a second order ordinary differential equation with rational coefficients governing the variations of the position of the unique pole of the differential under the isoperiodic deformations. The obtained equation depends on the order of the pole of the differential. We characterize the solutions of the obtained ordinary differential equations that correspond to the isoperiodic deformations. We apply these results to the theory of genus one solutions to the Boussinesq equation.</description>

      <title>Deformations of the Hill curves and isoperiodicity in the KdV and the sine-Gordon equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of genus $g$ hyperelliptic curves as double ramified coverings over the Riemann sphere with the set of branch points of the form $\{0, \infty, x_1, \dots, x_g, u_1, \dots, u_g\}$. The branch point at infinity $P_\infty$ is selected to be a marked point on the Riemann surfaces. A meromorphic differential $\Omega$ with a unique pole being of order two at $P_\infty$, is completely defined by the values of half of its periods, the $a$-periods. Fixing values of $a$-periods of $\Omega$, we then find a continuous subfamily in the considered family of hyperelliptic curves along which all the periods of $\Omega$ are constant. This subfamily is defined by the functions $u_j(x_1, \dots, x_g)$, while $x_1, \dots, x_g$ are independent parameters. We derive a system of differential equations for the functions $u_j(x_1, \dots, x_g)$, which, remarkably, has rational coefficients. We call this subfamily the isoperiodic deformations of the hyperelliptic curves relative to the given differential of the second kind $\Omega.$ We deduce necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of isoperiodic deformations. We discuss reality conditions as well. Using the obtained results, we solve the following problem for the Korteweg-de Vries and sine-Gordon equations: starting from an algebro-geometric data which generate a real periodic solution of a period $T$, how to deform the data, so that the associated solutions remain periodic with the same period $T$.</description>

      <title>Riesz potential estimates under co-canceling constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inequalities for Riesz potentials are well-known to be equivalent to Sobolev inequalities of the same order for domain norms ``far" from $L^1$, but to be weaker otherwise. Recent contributions by Van Schaftingen, by Hernandez, Rai\c{t}\u{a} and Spector, and by Stolyarov proved that this gap can be filled in Riesz potential inequalities for vector-valued functions in $L^1$ fulfilling a co-canceling differential condition. The present work demonstrates that such a property is not just peculiar to the space $L^1$. As a consequence, Riesz potential inequalities under the co-canceling constraint are offered for general families of rearrangement-invariant spaces, such as the Orlicz spaces and the Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Especially relevant instances of inequalities for domain spaces neighboring $L^1$ are singled out.</description>

      <title>Inverse problems for infinite-dimensional transport PDEs on Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a foundational framework for inverse problems governed by evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) on the Wasserstein space of probability measures. While the forward problems for such transport-type PDEs have been extensively and intensively studied, their corresponding inverse problems--which aim to reconstruct unknown operators, cost functions, or interaction kernels from observed solution data--remain largely unexplored at this level of generality.
  The cornerstone of our theory is a systematic approach featuring high-order calculus on the Wasserstein space and a progressive variational scheme. This methodology is specifically designed to address the challenges inherent in inverse problems for infinite-dimensional, nonlinear, and nonlocal transport PDEs.
  We demonstrate the power and versatility of our theory through two canonical examples: inverse problems for both the Mean Field Control (MFC) Dynamic Programming Equation and the Mean Field Game (MFG) Master Equation. Our work provides, for the first time, a unified foundation for identifying cost functions and interaction kernels from value function data. This establishes a new and fertile field of mathematical research with significant implications for both theory and applications in stochastic control and mean field games.</description>

      <title>A first-order formulation of f(R) gravity in spherical symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a first-order formulation of the field equations in f(R) gravity governing the global evolution of a (possibly massive) scalar field under spherical symmetry. Our formulation allows us to pose the characteristic initial value problem and to establish several properties of solutions. More precisely, we work in generalized Bondi-Sachs coordinates and prescribe initial data on an asymptotically Euclidean, future light cone with vertex at the center of symmetry, and we identify the precise regularity conditions required at the center. Following and extending Christodoulou's approach to the Einstein-massless scalar-field system, we recast the f(R) field equations as an integro-differential system of two coupled, first-order, nonlocal, nonlinear hyperbolic equations, whose principal unknowns are the scalar field and the spacetime scalar curvature. In deriving this reduced two-equation system, we identify the regularity conditions at the center of symmetry and impose natural assumptions on the scalar-field potential and on the function f(R) governing the gravitational Lagrangian density. As an application, we prove the monotonicity of the Hawking mass in this setting and formally analyze the singular limit in which the integrand f(R) of the action approaches R, corresponding to the Einstein-Hilbert action. Hence, the formulation isolates the essential evolution and constraint content on the future domain of dependence of two null hypersurfaces and is designed to facilitate subsequent advances in geometric analysis and robust numerical simulations of spherical collapse in modified gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a PDE-based approach to the min-max construction of nontrivial integer rectifiable varifolds that are stationary with respect to anisotropic surface energies on closed Riemannian manifolds, in codimension one. Specifically, we study the anisotropic analogue of the Allen-Cahn energy and establish a Modica-type gradient bound for its critical points. Using this in conjunction with certain estimates for stable solutions, we then prove that the energy densities of stable or bounded-Morse-index critical points of its rescalings concentrate along an integer rectifiable varifold that is stationary for the underlying anisotropic integrand. As a consequence, we construct a (possibly singular) anisotropic min-max hypersurface via Allen-Cahn, obtaining an analogue of the result of Hutchinson-Tonegawa in the anisotropic setting.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantitative stability associated to the adjoint Fourier restriction inequality, focusing on the paraboloid and two-dimension sphere cases. We show that these Strichartz-stability inequalities admit minimizers attaining their sharp constants, on the condition that these sharp constants are strictly smaller than the corresponding spectral-gap constants. Furthermore, for the two-dimension sphere case, we obtain the existence of minimizers.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with potential and dispersion given by arbitrary functions: Reductions and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the general form, depending on time and two spatial variables, the potential and dispersion of which are specified by one or two arbitrary functions. The equations under consideration naturally generalize a number of related nonlinear partial differential equations that occur in various areas of theoretical physics, including nonlinear optics, superconductivity, and plasma physics. Two- and one-dimensional reductions are described, which lead the studied nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations to simpler equations of lower dimension or ordinary differential equations (or systems of ordinary differential equations). Using methods of generalized and functional separation of variables, a number of new exact solutions of two-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations of the general form are found, which are expressed in quadratures or elementary functions. To analyze the equations under consideration, both Cartesian and polar coordinate systems are utilized. Special attention is paid to finding solutions with radial symmetry. The exact solutions obtained in this work can be used as test problems intended to assess the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for solving complex nonlinear PDEs of mathematical physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the validity of the Liouville property for $X$-harmonic functions, i.e. positive solution to $\Delta_{X}u=0$, where $X$ is a vector field on a complete, non-compact Riemannian manifold and $\Delta_{X}$ is the drifted Laplacian. In particular, we show that if the $X$-Bakry-\'Emery-Ricci curvature $\mathrm{Ric}_{X}$ is non-negative and the norm of $X$ decays to zero at infinity, then the manifold has the Liouville property for the $X$-Laplacian. The proof exploits a local gradient estimate for positive solutions to the semilinear equation $\Delta_{X}u+F(u)=0$, which holds when $F$ satisfies the structural conditions $tF'(t)-F(t)\le\alpha$ and $\vert F(t)\vert\le\beta t$, and the manifold has $\mathrm{Ric}_{X}\ge-(n-1)K$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Boltzmann equation with random uncertainties arising from the initial data and collision kernel in the {\it whole space}, along with their stochastic Galerkin (SG) approximations. By employing Green's function method, we show that, the higher-order derivatives of the solution with respect to the random variable exhibit polynomial decay over time. These results are then applied to analyze the SG method for the SG system and to demonstrate the polynomial decay of the numerical error over time.</description>

      <title>Caustics in the spherically symmetric Einstein-dust system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Caustics-envelopes formed by the trajectories of fluid particles-arise in proposed dynamical extensions for shell-crossing singularities occurring in the Einstein-dust system. In this study, a local existence result is established, describing the dynamics in a neighbourhood of such caustics. Specifically, we obtain spherically symmetric spacetimes $(M,g_{\mu\nu})$ containing a caustic $\mathcal{C}$, which, in the quotient $M/SO(3)$, is a timelike curve forming a singular boundary between a 2-dust region and a vacuum region. The spacetimes are constructed from solutions to a PDE problem posed with a spacelike direction of evolution. Curvature invariants and energy densities diverge as the caustic is approached. Consequently the metric has limited regularity $g\in C^{1,1/2}$ and is shown to satisfy Einstein's equation weakly. On the complement of the caustic, the metric is smooth and satisfies Einstein's equation classically. A (degenerate) coordinate system is identified in which the dynamical variables are smooth with extension to the caustic. Finally, a novel family of static, spherically symmetric spacetimes is identified, complementing the local construction above. Each spacetime contains an eternal annular 2-dust region bounded by a pair of caustics.</description>

      <title>Local uniqueness of multi-peak positive solutions to a class of fractional Kirchhoff equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has two main purposes. In the first part, combining the nondegeneracy of the ground state with the Lyapunov--Schmidt reduction method, we prove the existence of multi-peak positive solutions to the singularly perturbed problem \[\Big(\varepsilon^{2s}a+\varepsilon^{4s-N} b\int_{\mathbb{R}^{N}}|(-\Delta)^{\frac{s}{2}}u|^2\,dx\Big)(-\Delta)^s u+V(x)u=u^p\quad \text{in }\mathbb{R}^{N},\] for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon&gt; 0$, under the assumptions $2s&lt;N&lt;4s$, $1&lt;p&lt;2^*_s-1$, and some mild conditions on the potential $V$. The main difficulty comes from the interplay between the nonlocal operator $(-\Delta)^s$ and the nonlocal Kirchhoff term, which makes the corresponding limiting problem a coupled system of partial differential equations rather than a single fractional Kirchhoff equation. In the second part, under additional assumptions on $V$, we establish the local uniqueness of positive multi-peak solutions by means of a local Pohoz\v{a}ev identity.</description>

      <title>On well-posedness of a mildly dissipative family of active scalar equations in borderline Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a family of active scalar equations which modify the generalized surface quasi-geostrophic (gSQG) equations through its constitutive law and a dissipative perturbation. These modifications are characteristically mild in the sense that they are logarithmic. The problem of well posedness, in the sense of Hadamard, is then studied in a borderline setting of regularity in analogy to the scaling-critical spaces of the gSQG equations. A novelty of the system considered is the nuanced form of smoothing provided by the proposed mild form of dissipation, which is able to support global well-posedness at the Euler endpoint, but in a setting where the inviscid counterpart is known to be ill-posed. A novelty of the analysis lies in the simultaneous treatment of modifications in the constitutive law, dissipative mechanism, and functional setting, which the existing literature has typically treated separately. A putatively sharp relation is identified between each of the distinct system-modifiers that is consistent with previous studies that considered these modifications in isolation. This unified perspective is afforded by the introduction of a linear model equation, referred to as the protean system, that successfully incorporates the more delicate commutator structure collectively possessed by the gSQG family and upon which each facet of well-posedness can effectively be reduced to its study.</description>

      <title>Linear and nonlinear instability of vortex columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider vortex column solutions $v = V(r) e_\theta + W(r) e_z$ to the $3$D Euler equations. We give a mathematically rigorous construction of the countable family of unstable modes discovered by Liebovich and Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech. 126, 1983) via formal asymptotic analysis. The unstable modes exhibit $O(1)$ growth rates and concentrate on a ring $r= r_0$ asymptotically as the azimuthal and axial wavenumbers $n, \alpha \to \infty$ with a fixed ratio. We construct these so-called ring modes with an inner-outer gluing procedure. Finally, we prove that each linear instability implies nonlinear instability for vortex columns. In particular, our analysis yields nonlinear instability for the Batchelor trailing line vortex $V(r) :=\frac{q}{r} (1-\mathrm{e}^{-r^2})$ and $W(r) :=\mathrm{e}^{-r^2}$ when $0&lt;q &lt;\log 2 / \sqrt{1-\log 2} \approx 1.251$.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of critical points of the second Neumann eigenfunctions on triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the second Neumann eigenfunction $u$ of a planar triangle $T$. In a recent paper by Judge and Mondal [Ann. Math., 2022], it was shown that $u$ has no critical points in the interior of $T$. In this paper, we show that $u$ has at most one non-vertex critical point and that $u$ is monotone in a certain direction in $T$. More precisely, when $T$ is not equilateral, we show that $u$ vanishes at some vertex if and only if $T$ is superequilateral, and that $u$ has a non-vertex critical point if and only if $T$ is acute and not superequilateral. These results confirm both the original theorem and Conjecture 13.6 of Judge and Mondal [Ann. Math., 2020]. We also resolve the objective of Polymath 7 (research thread 1), namely, that the extrema of $u$ are attained only at the endpoints of the longest side. In addition, we settle a conjecture of Siudeja [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 2016] on the ordering of mixed Dirichlet--Neumann Laplacian eigenvalues for triangles. Our proofs combine the continuity method, eigenvalue inequalities, the maximum principle, and the moving plane method.</description>

      <title>Weak solutions to the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation with $p&gt;2$ in a moving domain under a Neumann type boundary condition corresponding to the total mass conservation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution by the Galerkin method in evolving Bochner spaces and a monotonicity argument. The main difficulty is in characterizing the weak limit of the nonlinear gradient term, where we need to deal with a term which comes from the boundary condition and cannot be absorbed into a monotone operator. To overcome this difficulty, we prove a uniform-in-time Friedrichs type inequality on a moving domain with time-dependent basis functions and make use of it to get the strong convergence of approximate solutions. We also show that the time derivative exists in the $L^2$ sense when given data have a better regularity.</description>

      <title>On low regularity well-posedness of the binormal flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on a class of solutions of the binormal flow, model of the evolution of vortex filaments, that generate several corner singularities in finite time. This phenomenon has been studied earlier in the regular case, which in this context is in terms of the summability of the angles of the corners generated. Our goal here is to investigate the lower regularity case, using further the Hasimoto approach that allows to use the 1D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger to study the binormal flow. We first obtain a deterministic result by proving an existence result for general binormal flow solutions at low regularity. Then we obtain improved results on the above class of solutions by a suitable randomization of the curvature and torsion of the vortex filament. To do so, we prove a scattering result for a quasi-invariance measure associated with a suitable 1D cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that we consider of independent interest. An interesting feature of this result is that we are able to identify a limit measure, which is usually not possible when working on quasi-invariant Gaussian measures for Hamiltonian PDEs on bounded domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the focusing energy-subcritical Schr\"odinger equations. In earlier works by Holmer-Roudenko \cite{holmer}, Duyckaerts-Holmer-Roudenko \cite{duyckaerts2}, Akahori-Nawa \cite{akahori}, Fang-Xie-Cazenave \cite{fang}, Guevara \cite{guevara} and later by Dodson-Murphy \cite{dodson1,dodson2} and Arora-Dodson-Murphy \cite{arora}, they proved that scattering is the only dynamical behavior if the $H^1$ initial data satisfies $M(u_0)^{(1-s_c)/s_c}E(u_0)&lt;M(Q)^{(1-s_c)/s_c}E(Q)$ and $\| u\|^{(1-s_c)/s_c}_{L^2}\| u\|_{\dot{H}^1}&lt;\| Q\|^{(1-s_c)/s_c}_{L^2}\|Q\|_{\dot{H}^1}$, where $Q$ is the ground state. In this paper, we establish asymptotic estimates for the upper bound of the scattering norms as $M(u_0)^{(1-s_c)/s_c}E(u_0)$ approaches the threshold mass-energy threshold $M(Q)^{(1-s_c)/s_c}E(Q)$, which generalizes the work of Duyckaerts-Merle \cite{duyckaerts} on the energy-critical Schr\"odinger equation($s_c=1$).</description>

Abstract: We prove a multiplicity result for non-constant weak solutions $u \in H^1(\Omega)$ for the quasilinear elliptic equation \[ \begin{cases} \displaystyle-\text{div}(A(x,u)\nabla u) + \frac{1}{2} D_sA(x,u)\nabla u \cdot \nabla u = g(x,u) - \lambda u &amp; \text{in } \Omega \\ A(x,u)\nabla u \cdot \eta = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial \Omega \end{cases} \] where $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, $ \Omega$ is a bounded lipschitz domain, $ \eta $ is the outward normal to the boundary $ \partial \Omega $, and $g(x,u)$ is a Carath\'eodory function that satisfies a general subcritical (and superlinear) growth condition. We also prove that any weak solution is bounded under a stronger growth assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Fisher-KPP equation with spatially periodic diffusion and reaction terms. We identify a class of periodic media for which the equation admits an explicit, closed-form solution. Through a nonlinear change of variables, the problem is reduced to the homogeneous Fisher-KPP equation, allowing us to construct an exact pulsating traveling front that connects the positive periodic stationary state to 0. We also derive an explicit expression for the asymptotic spreading speed and establish new asymptotic and comparison results. Finally, combining our change of variables and eigenvalue transform with existing results on KPP fronts in periodic media, we extend Bramson-type logarithmic delay results to the case of heterogeneous periodic diffusion.</description>

Abstract: Suppose that either (i) $N = 2$, $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ and $p &gt; 2$ or (ii) $N = 3$, $\alpha &lt; 0$ and $2 &lt; p &lt; 3$. We prove that there exists an explicitly computable $\mu_0 = \mu_0 (N, \alpha, p) &gt; 0$ such that if $0 &lt; \mu &lt; \mu_0$, then the following normalized semilinear elliptic problem with a point interaction admits ground states: \[ \begin{cases} - \Delta_\alpha u + \omega u + u |u|^{p - 2} = 0 &amp;\text{in} ~ \mathbb{R}^N; \\ \|u\|_{\mathscr{L}^2}^2 = \mu, \end{cases} \] where $- \Delta_\alpha$ denotes the Laplacian of point interaction (centered at the origin) with inverse scattering length $- 2 (N - 1) \pi \alpha$ and we want to solve for $\omega \in \mathbb{R}$, $u \colon \mathbb{R}^N \to \mathbb{R}$. We remark that this kind of solutions does not exist in the framework of the defocusing NLSE without a point interaction.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the $p$-Laplacian equation
  $$
  -\Delta_p u + V(x)|u|^{p-2}u = f(x,u)
  $$
  on the lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^N$ with nonnegative potentials, where $\Delta_p$ is the discrete $p$-Laplacian and $p\in(1,\infty)$. By employing the Nehari manifold method, we establish the existence of ground state solutions under suitable growth conditions on the nonlinearity $f(x,u)$, provided that the potential $V(x)$ is either periodic or bounded. Moreover, we prove that if $f$ is odd in $u$ and $p\geq2$, then the above equation admits infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions. Finally, we extend these results from $\mathbb{Z}^N$ to the more general setting of Cayley graphs.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend the Nehari manifold method from the variational setting to the nonvariational framework of fixed point equations. This is achieved by constructing a radial energy functional that generalizes the standard one from the variational case. Furthermore, the solutions obtained through our method are localized in conical annular sets, which leads to the existence of multiple solutions. The abstract results are illustrated by two representative applications.</description>

Abstract: We determine the range of Hurst parameters that provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability, in $L^2(\Omega)$, of the stochastic wave equation: $ \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2}u(t,x) =\Delta u(t,x)+\dot{W}(t,x)$, where $\{ W(t,x),\ t\geq 0, x\in \mathbb{R}^d\} $ is a fractional Brownian field with temporal Hurst parameter $H_0\in[\tfrac12,1]$ and spatial Hurst parameters $H_i\in(0,1)$ for $i=1,\cdots,d$. {In particular, the solvability condition exhibits a phase transition at $H_0 = 1$.} We also obtain the sharp growth rate and the sharp H\"older continuity of the solution on the real line in the case $H_0=1/2$.</description>

      <title>Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a $\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in an $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in $N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions.
  It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\gamma$ dimensional measure is $P_j \propto 2^{-j\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, $N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space.
  Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from $\gamma = 1.7$ for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to $\gamma = 2.5$ for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fully-implicit time discretization (i.e. the backward Euler formula) is applied to compressible nonlinear dynamical models of thermo-viscoelastic solids in the Eulerian description, i.e. in the actual deforming configuration, formulated in terms of rates. The Kelvin-Voigt rheology or also, in the deviatoric part, the Jeffreys rheology (which covers creep or plasticity) are considered, using the additive Green-Naghdi decomposition of total strain into the elastic and the inelastic strains formulated in terms of (objective) rates exploiting the Zaremba-Jaumann time derivative. A linearized convective model at large displacements is considered, focusing on the case where the internal energy additively splits the (convex) mechanical and the thermal parts.A fully implicit time-discrete scheme is devised. Considering the multipolar 2nd-grade viscosity, the numerical stability and convergence towards weak solutions are proven by exploiting, in particular, the convexity of the kinetic energy when written in terms of linear momentum instead of velocity and by estimating the temperature gradient from the entropy-like inequality.</description>

Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.</description>

      <title>Classification of fractional, singular Yamabe metrics on a twice punctured sphere I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Delaunay metrics form a family of conformally flat, constant fractional Q-curvature metrics on a twice-punctured sphere. They are all (after a M\"obius transformation) rotationally symmetric and periodic, and admit several elegant variational descriptions. We prove that, when s is close to but less than 1, any complete, conformally flat constant Q-curvature metric on a twice-punctured sphere is a Delaunay metric. Along the way, we prove a sharp a priori bound for the conformal factor of these metrics, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of non-divergence form operators in i.i.d. random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study random walks in a balanced, i.i.d. random environment in $\mathbb Z^d$ for $d\geq 3$. We establish improved convergence rates for the homogenization of the Dirichlet problem associated with the corresponding non-divergence form difference operators, surpassing the $O(R^{-1})$ rate, which is expected to be optimal for environments with a finite range of dependence. In particular, the improved rates are $O(R^{-3/2})$ when $d=3$, and $O(R^{-2}\log R)$ when $d\geq 4$.</description>
