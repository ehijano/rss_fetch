      <description>arXiv:2512.21556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the weakly nilpotent hypergroups with giving some new properties, and then establish several structural characterizations of these hypergroups. Some results obtained in this paper answer the two questions raised by the first author and W. Guo.</description>

      <title>On automorphism groups of half-arc-transitive tetravalent graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize connected tetravalent graphs $\Gamma$ which admit groups $M&lt;H$ of automorphisms such that $\Gamma$ is $M$-half-arc-transitive and $H$-arc-transitive. Examples for each case are constructed, including a counter-example to a question asked by A. R. Rivera and P. \v{S}parl in 2019 as well as the first example of tetravalent normal-edge-transitive non-normal Cayley graph on a nonabelian simple group.</description>

      <title>Acylindricity in Higher Rank, Part I : Fundamentals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new notion of non-positively curved groups: the collection of discrete countable groups acting (AU-)acylindrically on finite products of $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with general type factors and associated subdirect products. This work is inspired by the classical theory of $S$-arithmetic lattices and the flourishing theory of acylindrically hyperbolic groups. In this paper - the first of three - we develop various fundamental results, explore elementary subgroups in higher rank, and exhibit a free vs abelian Tits Alternative. Along the way we give representation-theoretic proofs of various results about acylindricity -- some methods are new even in the rank-one setting.
  The vastness of this class of groups is exhibited by recognizing that it contains $S$-arithmetic lattices with rank-one factors, acylindrically hyperbolic groups, colorable HHGs, groups with property (QT), and enjoys robust stability properties.</description>

      <title>The asphericity of locally finite infinite configuration spaces and Weierstrass entire coverings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ and $C^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ denote the locally finite infinite ordered and unordered configuration spaces of the complex plane. We prove that both $Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ and $C^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ are aspherical. We further obtain a locally finite analogue of the braid exact sequence, \[ 1\longrightarrow H^{lf}(\infty)\longrightarrow B^{lf}(\infty)\longrightarrow \Aut(\N)\longrightarrow 1, \] where $H^{lf}(\infty)=\pi_1(Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C))$ and $B^{lf}(\infty)=\pi_1(Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)//\Aut(\N))$, the fundamental group of the homotopy quotient of $Conf^{lf}_{\infty}(\C)$ by $\Aut(\N)$. Building on this, we classify connected countably infinite--sheeted covering spaces and give a criterion for when such a covering can be realized from the zero set of a family of entire functions $F:X\times\C\to\C$. In particular, if $\pi_1(X)$ is free and $H^2(X;\Z)=0$, then every countably infinite--sheeted covering space over $X$ is realizable.</description>

      <title>Representing in Low Rank I: conjugacy, topological and homological aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this series of papers, we investigate properties of a finite group which are determined by its low degree irreducible representations over a number field $F$, i.e. its representations on matrix rings $\operatorname{M}_n(D)$ with $n \leq 2$. In particular we focus on representations on $\operatorname{M}_2(D)$ where $D$ is a division algebra having an order $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\mathcal{O}$ has finitely many units, i.e. such that $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ has arithmetic rank $1$. In this first part, the focus is on two aspects.
  One aspect concerns characterisations of such representing spaces in terms of Serre's homological goodness property, small virtual cohomological dimension and higher Kleinian-type embeddings. As an application, we obtain several characterisations of the finite groups $G$ whose irreducible representations are of the mentioned form. In particular, such groups $G$ are precisely those such that $\mathcal{U}(R G)$, with $R$ the ring of integers of $F$, can be constructed from groups which virtually map onto a non-abelian free group. Along the way we investigate the latter property for congruence subgroups of higher modular groups and its implications for the congruence kernel. This is used to obtain new information on the congruence kernel of the unit group of a group ring.
  The second aspect concerns the conjugacy classes of the images of finite subgroups of $\mathcal{U}(R G)$ under the irreducible representations of $G$. More precisely, we initiate the study of a blockwise variant of the Zassenhaus conjectures and the subgroup isomorphism problem. Moreover, we contribute to them for the low rank representations above.</description>

      <title>A Short Note on Disjointness Conditions for Triples of Group Subsets Satisfying the Triple Product Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3671</link>
      <description>arXiv:0908.3671v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract:   We deduce some elementary pairwise disjointness and semi-disjointness conditions on triples of subsets in arbitrary groups satisfying the so-called triple product property (TPP) as originally defined by H. Cohn and C. Umans in 2003. This property TPP for a triple of group subsets, called a TPP triple, allows the group to "realize" matrix multiplication of dimensions the sizes of the subsets, with the subsets acting as indexing sets for input matrices which are embedded into the regular algebra of the group. We derive nine different disjointness casetypes for an arbitrary TPP triple, and classify these into four different disjointness classes based on an integer measure of the degree of pairwise disjointness among the subsets. Finally, we derive lower and upper bounds for the sum of sizes of the subsets forming a TPP triple, which is the additive equivalent of the multiplicative bounds originally derived by Cohn and Umans for the product of sizes of subsets forming a TPP triple.</description>

      <title>The dual approach to the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual presentations of Coxeter groups have recently led to breakthroughs in our understanding of affine Artin groups. In particular, they led to the proof of the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture and to the solution of the word problem. Will the "dual approach" extend to more general classes of Coxeter and Artin groups? In this paper, we describe the techniques used to prove the $K(\pi, 1)$ conjecture for affine Artin groups and we ask a series of questions that are mostly open beyond the spherical and affine cases.</description>

Abstract: We describe injective endomorphisms of the semigroup $\boldsymbol{B}_{Z\mathbb{}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$ with the two-element family $\mathscr{F}^2$ of inductive nonempty subsets of $\omega$. In particular we show that every injective endomorphism $\mathfrak{e}$ of $\boldsymbol{B}_{Z\mathbb{}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$ is presented in the form $\mathfrak{e}=\mathfrak{e}_0\mathfrak{a}$, where $\mathfrak{e}_0$ is an injective $(0,0,[0))$-endomorphism of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$ and $\mathfrak{a}$ is an automorphism $\mathfrak{a}$ of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$. Also we describe all injective $(0,0,[0))$-endomorphisms $\mathfrak{e}_0$ of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\mathbb{Z}}^{\mathscr{F}^2}$, i.e., such that $(0,0,[0))\mathfrak{e}_0=(0,0,[0))$.</description>

In particular we find endomorphisms $\varpi_3$ and $\lambda$ of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\omega}^{\mathscr{F}^3}$ such that for every injective endomorphism $\varepsilon$ of the semigroup $\boldsymbol{B}_{\omega}^{\mathscr{F}^3}$ there exists an injective endomorphism $\iota\in\left\langle\lambda,\varpi_3\right\rangle$ such that $\varepsilon=\alpha_{[k]}\circ\iota$ for some positive integer $k$, where $\alpha_{[k]}$ is an injective monoid endomorphism of $\boldsymbol{B}_{\omega}^{\mathscr{F}^3}$.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>
