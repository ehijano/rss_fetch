      <title>Statistical Shape Modelling of the Nasosinusal Anatomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human nose exhibits a huge variation in shape among individuals. All these variants alter the airflow through the nasal cavity and can impact how we smell odors. To acquire a better understanding of physiological and pathological functioning, it is important to study the effects of these modifications. SSM, or Statistical Shape Modelling, is a widely used methodology for considering morphological differences within a population. In the literature, only a few studies analyze nasal anatomy in its entirety, including paranasal sinuses, whose segmentation is particularly challenging due to their complexity and variability. This work aims at creating a highly accurate SSM for the nasosinusal complex. A traditional, greyscale thresholding-based segmentation approach was chosen, relying on Mimics software (Leuven, Belgium). 40 computed tomography (CT) datasets were considered. After segmentation, post-processing was performed to obtain watertight meshes using 3-Matic software (Leuven, Belgium), which was also used for the SSM generation. The generated model shows all relevant landmarks that typically characterize a nasosinual complex. 32 different modes are needed to explain 95% of the total variance. As a preliminary output, this study showed the feasibility and consistency of a statistical model of the nasosinusal anatomy. However, additional studies involving a larger sample size and a more robust validation process could be conducted.</description>

      <title>Stochastic numerical head phantoms to enable virtual imaging studies of transcranial photoacoustic computed tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcranial photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is an emerging neuroimaging modality, but skull-induced aberrations can result in severe image artifacts if not compensated for during image reconstruction. The development of advanced image reconstruction methods for transcranial PACT is hindered by the lack of well-characterized, clinically relevant evaluation frameworks. Virtual imaging studies offer a solution, but require realistic numerical phantoms. To address this need, this study introduces a framework for generating ensembles of realistic 3D numerical head phantoms for virtual imaging studies. The framework uses adjunct CT data to create anatomical phantoms, which are then enhanced with stochastically synthesized vasculature and assigned realistic optical and acoustic-elastic properties. The utility of the framework is demonstrated through a case study on the impact of skull modeling errors on transcranial PACT image quality. By allowing researchers to assess and refine reconstruction methods meaningfully, the presented framework is expected to accelerate the development of transcranial PACT.</description>

      <title>Tumor Obliteration by Resonant Amplification (TOR) A Nonthermal, Spectrally-Targeted Approach to Cancer Disintegration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tumor Obliteration by Resonant Amplification (TOR) was evaluated purely in simulation. Forward models in COMSOL, ANSYS, and ABAQUS used the same small-strain rheology, nonthermal/noncavitational limits, and an emulated closed loop (phase-locked actuation plus contrast/safety gating). Over &gt;= 200 Monte Carlo runs per setup, TOR produced per-focus extinction in 2.6-3.2 s at approx. 0.85-0.90 J/cm^3, with selectivity Q = 39 +/- 5, peak temperature rise dT_max &lt;= 0.2 deg C, and CEM43 &lt;&lt; 1, consistent with strictly nonthermal operation. Primary indices indicated high spectral fidelity and intrinsic safety margin: MMI = 0.92 +/- 0.03, SSR = 14.6 +/- 3.1 (circumscribed) / 11.2 +/- 2.4 (infiltrative), and ATI &lt;= 0.8 of the matrix-failure threshold. Simulated foci matched FE predictions within +/- 150 um.
  A unitless reality-adherence score comparing four observables to consolidated literature ranges yielded A = 95% +/- 2% (BCa 95%). Organ-specific estimates were 95.1% (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), 96.0% (prostatic acinar adenocarcinoma), and 94.2% (invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast). The delivery stack - tungsten micro-needle (300-500 um) with 5-25 um tip excursions, phase lock, and amplitude gating - operated in a small-strain, noncavitational regime, keeping off-target strain below safety limits by design.
  Mechanistically, mode-selective collapse implies suppression of core vesicle biogenesis and nociceptor drive; rim scanning is constrained by healthy-referenced bounds, motivating compact neuroimmune readouts in future tests. Overall, the calibrated multiphysics results support a reproducible, spectrum-locked path from modeling to benchtop: deterministic extinction at low energy, high selectivity, and strict thermal neutrality, with pre-registered experiments planned to confirm the predicted safety and efficacy envelopes.</description>

      <title>UltraScatter: Ray-Based Simulation of Ultrasound Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional ultrasound simulation methods solve wave equations numerically, achieving high accuracy but at substantial computational cost. Faster alternatives based on convolution with precomputed impulse responses remain relatively slow, often requiring several minutes to generate a full B-mode image. We introduce UltraScatter, a probabilistic ray tracing framework that models ultrasound scattering efficiently and realistically. Tissue is represented as a volumetric field of scattering probability and scattering amplitude, and ray interactions are simulated via free-flight delta tracking. Scattered rays are traced to the transducer, with phase information incorporated through a linear time-of-flight model. Integrated with plane-wave imaging and beamforming, our parallelized ray tracing architecture produces B-mode images within seconds. Validation with phantom data shows realistic speckle and inclusion patterns, positioning UltraScatter as a scalable alternative to wave-based methods.</description>

      <title>Formulation and Therapeutic Assessment of a Zinc Oxide, Silver, and Cerium Oxide Enriched Ointment for Accelerated Wound Healing in Aged Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic wounds present a major challenge in elderly individuals due to diminished regenerative capacity and impaired tissue repair mechanisms associated with aging. In this study, we formulated a topical gel composed of zinc oxide (ZnO), silver (Ag), and cerium oxide (CeO2) nanoparticles, each chosen for their respective antimicrobial, antioxidant, and tissue-regenerative properties. The nanoparticles were synthesized through precise precipitation or reduction techniques and thoroughly characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering (DLS), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and electron microscopy to confirm nanoscale structure and purity. An in vivo wound healing model utilizing aged Sprague-Dawley rats was employed, with animals divided into three groups: untreated, placebo-treated, and those receiving the nanoparticle-enriched gel. Wound dimensions were tracked for 14 days, revealing significantly improved healing in the nanoparticle-treated group, with nearly complete closure observed by day 14 (ANOVA, p less than 0.0001). Cytocompatibility was assessed via MTT assay on L929 fibroblasts, confirming greater than 80 percent viability at therapeutically relevant concentrations. These findings underscore the potential of multifunctional nanoparticle-based formulations to enhance wound healing in aged or compromised skin environments, offering a promising therapeutic avenue.</description>

      <title>Basis for a hands free blood flow measurement with automated vessel focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is one of the essential tools to ensure oxygen supply during cardiac arrest. However, the precise effects of chest compression are not quantifiable to this day. This often results in a low quality of chest compressions even if performed by health-care professionals. One solution could be provided by quantification of blood flow via ultrasonic Doppler measurements, to guide first responders in their efforts. This paper presents an approach to address the issue of limited time, anatomical know how and limitations of system configuration during emergency scenarios. An approach for automated vessel identification with three different phases was developed, featuring a new sensor probe for ultrasonic measurements with non symmetrically angled piezo ceramics. The probe was used with prototype ultrasound hardware in a laboratory setup for Pulsed Wave Doppler (PW Doppler). In an initial measurement a qualitative flow was approximated to examine valuable measurement positions on a phantom. Afterwards an iterative mode was used for depth depending frequency measurements with score calculation of flow periodicity and signal power. The configuration with the best score was used for a prolonged monitoring mode. Flow values were compared to data of an industrial flow-sensor. Flow-sensor data showed an average coefficient of determination of 0.97 with an average root mean square error of 3.84 ml/s. With the proposed hardware and software solutions a basis for future developments was made, which could lead to a fully automated vessel identification during CPR. This device could provide first responders as well as clinical staff with vital information about CPR efficiency that has yet to be included into the therapy of people during cardiac arrest.</description>

      <title>An AI dose engine for fast carbon ion treatment planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide gold-standard accuracy for carbon ion therapy dose calculations but are computationally intensive. Analytical pencil beam algorithms offer speed but reduced accuracy in heterogeneous tissues. We developed the first AI-based dose engine capable of predicting absorbed dose, the alpha and beta parameters for relative biological effectiveness (RBE)- weighted optimisation in carbon ion therapy, delivering MC-level accuracy with drastically reduced computation time. We extended the transformer-based DoTA model to predict absorbed dose (C-DoTA-d), alpha (C-DoTA-alpha), and beta (C-DoTA-beta), introducing a cross-attention mechanism for alpha and beta to combine dose and energy inputs. The training dataset consisted of ~70,000 pencil beams from 187 head-and-neck patients, with ground-truth values obtained using the GPU-accelerated MC toolkit FRED. Performance was evaluated on an independent test set using gamma pass rate (1%/1 mm), depth-dose, and isodose contour Dice coefficients. MC dropout-based uncertainty analysis was performed. Median gamma pass rates exceeded 98% for all predictions (99.76% for dose, 99.14% for alpha, and 98.74% for beta), with minima above 85% in the most heterogeneous anatomies. The Dice coefficient was 0.95 for 1% isodose contours, with slightly reduced agreement in high-gradient regions. Compared to MC FRED, inference was over 400x faster (0.032 s vs. 14 s per pencil beam) while maintaining accuracy. Uncertainty analysis showed high stability, with mean standard deviations below 0.5% for all models. C-DoTA achieves MC-quality predictions of absorbed dose and RBE model parameters in ~30 milliseconds per beam. Its speed and accuracy support online adaptive planning, paving the way for more effective carbon ion therapy workflows. Future work will expand to additional anatomical sites, beam geometries, and clinical beamlines.</description>

      <title>Understanding the interplay of collagen and myocyte adaptation in cardiac volume overload: a multi-constituent growth and remodeling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hearts subjected to volume overload (VO) are prone to detrimental anatomical and functional changes in response to elevated mechanical stretches, ultimately leading to heart failure. Experimental findings increasingly emphasize that organ-scale changes following VO cannot be explained by myocyte growth alone, as traditionally proposed in the literature. Collagen degradation, in particular, has been associated with left ventricular adaptation in both acute and chronic stages of VO. These hypotheses remain to be substantiated by comprehensive mechanistic evidence, and the contribution of each constituent to myocardial growth and remodeling (G&amp;R) processes is yet to be quantified. In this work, we establish a hybrid G&amp;R framework in which we integrate a mixture-based constitutive model with the kinematic growth formulation. This multi-constituent model enables us to mechanistically assess the relative contributions of collagen and myocyte changes to alterations in tissue properties, ventricular dimensions, and growth phenotype. Our numerical results confirm that collagen dynamics control the passive mechanical response of the myocardium, whereas myocytes predominantly impact the extent and the phenotype of eccentric hypertrophy. Importantly, collagen degradation exacerbates myocyte hypertrophy, demonstrating a synergistic interplay that accelerates left ventricular progression toward diastolic dysfunction. This work constitutes an important step towards an integrated characterization of the early compensatory stages of VO-induced cardiac G&amp;R.</description>

      <title>Electron-hole liquid in biological tissues under ultra high dose rate ionizing radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a quantitative model of ionization processes in biological tissues under Ultra High Dose Rate (UHDR) radiation. The underlying conjecture is that of electron-hole liquid (EHL) forming in water based substances of biological tissues. Unlike the earlier known EHL in semiconductor crystals, the charge carriers here are low mobile due to strong interactions with the background (solvated electrons, etc.); hence, EHL resembling ionic melts. Similar to all ionic systems, the Coulomb coupling makes that EHL energetically favorable that leads to recombination barriers suppressing subsequent structural transformations. In particular, generation of secondary reactive species in such EHL becomes limited translating into reduction of biological damages and tissue sparing effect. We show how these processes are sensitive to the tissue quality and frequency dispersion of the dielectric permittivity. Equations for dose and dose rate defining the sparing thresholds are derived.</description>

      <title>Towards polarization-enhanced PET: Study of random background in polarization-correlated Compton events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11504v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a medical imaging modality that utilizes positron-emitting isotopes, such as Ga-68 and F-18, for many diagnostic purposes. The positron annihilates with an electron from the surrounding area, creating two photons of 511 keV energy and opposite momenta, entangled in their orthogonal polarizations. When each photon undergoes a Compton scattering process, the difference of their azimuthal scattering angles reflects the initial orthogonality of their polarizations, peaking at $\pm$90$^{\circ}$. This type of correlation is not yet utilized in conventional PET scanners, but could potentially offer an energy-independent method for background reduction. Measurements of these kinds of correlations can be achieved using Compton polarimeters, built from a single layer of segmented scintillating crystals such as Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce), read out by silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). In this paper, we study the signal-to-random background ratios in measurements of these correlated annihilation photons from coincidence time spectra across clinically relevant source activities, from $\sim$200 MBq to $\sim$378 MBq. These are then compared to the standard single-pixel (photoelectric) measurements. We find that the signal-to-random background ratios (SBRs) obtained from the polarization-correlated events for Compton scattering angles $\theta_{1,2}\in[72^{\circ}, 90^{\circ}]$ and azimuthal angle difference $\Delta\phi=90^{\circ}\pm20^{\circ}$ are consistently higher than those from single-pixel events, with the ratio of their SBR values of 1.23. The SBR of the selected events also increases with the polarimetric modulation factor $\mu$, gaining $\sim$50\% in value during the experiment.</description>

Abstract: This study proposes a simple and practical approach based on in-vitro measurements and in-silico simulation using the likelihood-free Bayesian inference with the finite element method simultaneously for stochastic calibration and uncertainty quantification of the mechanical response of biological materials. We implement the approach for distal, middle, and proximal human Achilles tendon specimens obtained from diabetic patients post-amputation. A wide range of in-vitro loading conditions are considered, including one-step and two-step relaxation, as well as incremental cyclic loading tests. In-silico simulations are performed for the tendons assuming a fiber-reinforced viscoelastic response, which is modeled for the ground matrix and fiber components. Initially, the calibration of the specimen-specific parameters is predicted using Bayesian optimization and the sensitivity of each parameter is evaluated using the Sobol index and random forest. Then, these parameters are used as priors, and coupled with in-vitro data in simulation-based approximate Bayesian computation to calibrate and quantify the uncertainty parameters for three loading cases. The results demonstrate that in-silico simulations using the posterior parameters of approximate Bayesian computation can capture the uncertainty bounds of in-vitro measurements. This approach provides a useful framework for stochastic calibration of constitutive material model parameters without the need to derive a likelihood function, regardless of the specimen's geometry or loading conditions.</description>

      <title>What if each voxel were measured with a different diffusion protocol?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expansion of diffusion MRI (dMRI) both into the realm of strong gradients, and into accessible imaging with portable low-field devices, brings about the challenge of gradient nonlinearities. Spatial variations of the diffusion gradients make diffusion weightings and directions non-uniform across the field of view, and deform perfect shells in the q-space designed for isotropic directional coverage. Such imperfections hinder parameter estimation: Anisotropic shells hamper the deconvolution of fiber orientation distribution function (fODF), while brute-force retraining of a nonlinear regressor for each unique set of directions and diffusion weightings is computationally inefficient. Here we propose a protocol-independent parameter estimation (PIPE) method that enables fast parameter estimation for the most general case where the scan in each voxel is acquired with a different protocol in q-space. PIPE applies for any spherical convolution-based dMRI model, irrespective of its complexity, which makes it suitable both for white and gray matter in the brain or spinal cord, and for other tissues where fiber bundles have the same properties within a voxel (fiber response), but are distributed with an arbitrary fODF. Applied to in vivo human MRI with linear tensor encoding on a high-performance system, PIPE maps fiber response and fODF parameters for the whole brain in the presence of significant gradient nonlinearities in under 3 minutes. PIPE enables fast parameter estimation in the presence of arbitrary gradient nonlinearities, eliminating the need to arrange dMRI in shells or to retrain the estimator for different protocols in each voxel. PIPE applies for any model based on a convolution of a voxel-wise fiber response and fODF, and data from varying b-values, diffusion/echo times, and other scan parameters.</description>

Abstract: While scattered light conveys most of the information we perceive, scattering may also distort that information before it reaches our detectors. The problem is acute in many applications, such as in high-resolution microscopy of biological tissue, where scattering degrades both resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that uniting two intrinsic properties of scattered light: speckle statistics and the angular memory effect, with highly non-linear optical response yields, rather surprisingly, super-resolution, low-background, non-invasive imaging of objects completely hidden behind a strongly scattering, opaque layer. Crucially, our technique of non-invasive imaging through scatterers does not resort to wavefront shaping, adaptive optics, complicated optical setups, or iterative image reconstruction algorithms. Because the strategy relies solely on the properties of scattered light and high-order nonlinear response of the fluorophores, it can be applied to any speckle-forming propagation, from biological tissue to multicore fibres, combined with any type of phenomenon that exhibits a sufficiently high order nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: Objective: This study addresses conceptual issues around data standardisation in audiology, and outlines steps toward achieving it. It reports a survey of the computational audiology community on their current understanding, needs, and preferences concerning data standards. Based on survey findings and a panel discussion, recommendations are made concerning moving forward with standardisation in audiology.
  Design: Mixed-methods: 1) review of existing standardisation efforts; 2) a survey of the computational audiology community; 3) expert panel discussion in a dedicated session at the 2024 Virtual Conference of Computational Audiology. Sample: Survey: 82 members of the global community; Panel discussion: five experts.
  Results: A prerequisite for any global audiology database are agreed data standards. Although many are familiar with the general idea, few know of existing initiatives, or have actively participated in them. Ninety percent of respondents expressed willingness to follow or contribute to standardisation efforts. The panel discussed relevant initiatives (e.g. OMOP, openEHR, NOAH) and explored both challenges (around harmonisation) and opportunities (alignment with other medical fields and conversion among approaches).
  Conclusions: Combining conceptual discussion with stakeholder views, the study offers guidance for implementing interoperable data standards in audiology. It highlights community support, key issues to address, and suggests paths for future work.</description>

      <title>Probing arbitrary polarized photon pairs undergoing double Compton scatterings by a dedicated MC simulator validated with experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations in the polarization degrees of freedom of the two-photon system have been extensively studied and form our current understanding of the quantum nature of our world. Most of the studies are concentrated on the low-energy (optical) photon pairs, for which efficient polarization measurement devices exist. However, for high-energetic (MeV) pairs of photons, e.g. produced in the decay of positronium atoms, no polarizers are available. Partial information about the polarization degree of freedom can be extracted by exploiting the measurements of photon pairs that undergo double Compton scattering. We present a Geant4-based Monte Carlo Vienna-Warsaw model capable of simulating any initial polarization state of bipartite photons. This puts us in a position to derive the behavior of the experimental observable, the angular difference $\Delta\hat\Phi$ formed by the two scattering planes. We validate our Vienna-Warsaw simulator with the high-statistics experimental sample -- based on a total of $3 \times 10^5 $ event candidates -- of two-photon pairs measured with the J-PET Big Barrel detector. We deduce the value of the squared visibility (interference contrast) encoding the polarization in the angle difference of the two scattering planes, $\Delta\hat\Phi$. The simulated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental correlation spectra and behave as predicted by theory.</description>
