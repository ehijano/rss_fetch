      <title>Propagation of narrow and fast solitons through dispersive shock waves in hydrodynamics of simple waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of narrow solitons through various profiles of dispersive shock waves (DSW) for the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation. We consider situations in which the soliton passes through the DSW region quickly enough and does not get trapped in it. The idea is to consider the motion of such solitons through DSW as motion along some smooth effective profile. In the case of KdV and modified KdV, based on the law of conservation of momentum and the equation of motion, this idea is proven rigorously; for other cases of generalized KdV, we take this as a natural generalization. In specific cases of self-similar decays for KdV and modified KdV, a method for selecting an effective field is demonstrated. For the case of generalized KdV, a hypothesis is proposed for selecting an effective field for any wave pulse that is not very large compared to the soliton. All proposed suggestions are numerically tested and demonstrate a high accuracy of reliability.</description>

      <title>Sociohydrodynamics: data-driven modelling of social behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17627v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems display complex behaviors driven by physical forces as well as decision-making. Hydrodynamic theories hold promise for simplified universal descriptions of socially-generated collective behaviors. However, the construction of such theories is often divorced from the data they should describe. Here, we develop and apply a data-driven pipeline that links micromotives to macrobehavior by augmenting hydrodynamics with individual preferences that guide motion. We illustrate this pipeline on a case study of residential dynamics in the United States, for which census and sociological data is available. Guided by Census data, sociological surveys, and neural network analysis, we systematically assess standard hydrodynamic assumptions to construct a sociohydrodynamic model. Solving our simple hydrodynamic model, calibrated using statistical inference, qualitatively captures key features of residential dynamics at the level of individual US counties. We highlight that a social memory, akin to hysteresis in magnets, emerges in the segregation-integration transition even with memory-less agents. This suggests an explanation for the phenomenon of neighborhood tipping, whereby a small change in a neighborhood's population leads to a rapid demographic shift. Beyond residential segregation, our work paves the way for systematic investigations of decision-guided motility in real space, from micro-organisms to humans, as well as fitness-mediated motion in more abstract genomic spaces.</description>

      <title>Multi-soliton solutions and data-driven discovery of higher-order Burgers' hierarchy equations with physics informed neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07027v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Burgers hierarchy consists of nonlinear evolutionary partial differential equations (PDEs) with progressively higher-order dispersive and nonlinear terms. Notable members of this hierarchy are the Burgers equation and the Sharma-Tasso-Olver equation, which are widely applied in fields such as plasma physics, fluid mechanics, optics, and biophysics to describe nonlinear waves in inhomogeneous media. Various soliton and multi-soliton solutions to these equations have been identified and the fission and fusion of solitons have been studied using analytical and numerical techniques. Recently, deep learning methods, particularly Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), have emerged as a new approach for solving PDEs. These methods use deep neural networks to minimize PDE residuals while fitting relevant data. Although PINNs have been applied to equations like Burgers' and Korteweg-de Vries, higher-order members of the Burgers hierarchy remain unexplored in this context. In this study, we employ a PINN algorithm to approximate multi-soliton solutions of linear combinations of equations within the Burgers hierarchy. This semi-supervised approach encodes the PDE and relevant data, determining PDE parameters and resolving the linear combination to discover the PDE that describes the data. Additionally, we employ gradient-enhanced PINNs (gPINNs) and a conservation law, specific to the generic Burgers' hierarchy, to improve training accuracy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in describing multi-soliton solutions within the generic Burgers' hierarchy, their robustness to increased levels of data noise, and their limited yet measurable predictive capabilities. They also verify the potential for training refinement and accuracy improvement using enhanced approaches in certain cases, while enabling the discovery of the PDE model that describes the observed solitary structures.</description>
