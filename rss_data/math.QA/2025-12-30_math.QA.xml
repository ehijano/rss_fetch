      <title>Quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations for type $C$ flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relations of $\lambda_{y}$-classes associated to tautological bundles over the flag manifold of type $C$ in the quantum $K$-ring. These relations are called the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations. The strategy of the proof of the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations is based on the method of semi-infinite flag manifolds and the Borel-type presentation. In addition, we observe that the quantum $K$-theoretic Whitney relations give a complete set of the defining relations of the quantum $K$-ring. This gives a presentation of the quantum $K$-ring of the flag manifold of type $C$, called the Whitney-type presentation, as a quotient of a polynomial ring, different from the Borel-type presentation.</description>

      <title>On Hopf Ideals, Integrality, and Automorphisms of Quantum Groups at Roots of 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider skew-commutative subalgebras in Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups at a root of unity $\zeta$ generated by primitive power elements. We classify the centrality and commutativity of these skew-polynomial algebras depending on the Lie type and the order of $\zeta$ modulo 8. We describe Hopf ideals in the quantum group induced from ideals in these subalgebras, including the non-commutative cases.
  Among these, we construct and analyze a family of Hopf ideals that depend on the choice of an element in the Weyl group. We show that they arise naturally both in the construction of (partial) $R$-matrices and as vanishing ideals of Bruhat subgroups. Specialization to the maximal element yields a rigorous construction of restricted quantum groups as pre-triangular Hopf algebras, independent of any choices.
  Our treatment also includes even orders of $\zeta$, non-simply laced Lie types, and minimal ground rings. Consequently, we extend some results of De Concini-Kac-Procesi, whose work focuses on odd orders of $\zeta$, which forces the subalgebra to be strictly central, and complex ground fields. This includes the identification of the subalgebras for Lie types $\mathsf{A}_n$ and $\mathsf{B}_2$ with the coordinate rings of associated algebraic groups in the commutative cases, even if $\zeta$ has even order. Our descriptions are computationally explicit and do not utilize Poisson structures.
  As technical preparations, we discuss PBW bases over minimal rings, dependencies on choices of convex orderings, as well as various new constructions of, and relations among, automorphisms on quantum groups. The latter include formulae for the Garside element in the Lustzig-Artin group action and the family of Che-transformations.</description>

      <title>Torsion-Free Bimodule Connections and the Maximal Prolongation of a First-Order Differential Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an unexpectedly simple presentation of the maximal prolongation of a first-order differential calculus in terms of the bimodule map of a torsion-free bimodule connection. We then show that in the quantum homogeneous space case this simplifies even further. More explicitly, we show that the bimodule map associated to a bimodule connection, for any relative left Hopf module endowed with its canonical right module structure, admits a concise formula, given in terms of the adjont action of a Hopf algebra on a bimodule. %{\color{red} We also have the dual tangent space formula.} This is then used to derive sufficient conditions, in terms of the first-order differential forms, for the extendability of a first-order almost-complex structure. These results are applied to the quantum Grassmannian Heckenberger--Kolb calculi, yielding a simple uniform presentation of their degree two anti-holomorphic relations.</description>

      <title>Non-compact 3D TQFT and non-semisimplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a once extended non-compact 3-dimensional TQFT $\mathcal{Z}$ from the data of a (potentially) non-semisimple modular tensor category. This is in the framework of generators and relations of [Bartlett et al., arxiv:1509.06811 (2015)], having disallowed generating 2-morphisms whose source is the empty. Moreover, we show that the projective mapping class group representations this TQFT gives rise to, are dual to those of [Lyubashenko, arXiv:hep-th/9405167 (1994)] and [De Renzi et al., arXiv:2010.14852 (2020)]. We develop a method to decompose a closed 3-manifold in terms of 2-morphism generators. We use this to compute the value of $\mathcal{Z}$ on 3-manifolds, explaining why it should recover Lyubashenko's 3-manifold invariants [Lyubashenko, arXiv:hep-th/9405167 (1994)]. Finally, we explain that the value of the non-compact TQFT on the solid torus recovers the data of a modified trace [Geer et al., arXiv:0711.4229 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Resurgence and perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a point of view on resurgence theory based on the study of perverse sheaves on the complex line carrying an algebraic structure with respect to additive convolution. In particular, we lift the concept of alien derivatives introduced originally by J. \'Ecalle, to the framework of perverse sheaves and study its behavior under sheaf-theoretic convolution. The full fledged resurgence theory needs a (yet undeveloped) generalization of the concept of perverse sheaves allowing infinite, possibly dense, sets of singularities. We discuss possible approaches to defining such objects and some potential examples of them coming from Cohomological Hall Algebras, wall-crossing structures and Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Panhandle polynomials of torus links and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a decomposition of the tensor of the fundamental representation of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_N)$ and the Rosso-Jones formula to establish a peculiar ``panhandle'' shape of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial of the reverse parallel of torus knots and links. Due to their panhandle-like intrinsic properties, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial is referred to as a ``panhandle polynomial''. With the help of the $\ell$-invariant, this extends to links the Etnyre-Honda result about the arc index and maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant of torus knots. It has further geometric consequences, related to the braid index, the existence of minimal string Bennequin surfaces for banded and Whitehead doubled links, the Bennequin sharpness problem, and the equivalence of their quasipositivity and strong quasipositivity. We extend these properties to torus links, which relate to the classification of their component-wise Thurston-Bennequin invariants. Finally, we discuss the definition of the $\ell$-invariant for general links.</description>

      <title>Quantum Invariants and Fiberedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the topological significance of the knot two-variable series $F_K$, proposed by Gukov--Manolescu and defined by Park for a class of `nice' knots. We show that the leading coefficient of $F_K$ is a monomial and express its exponent in terms of the Hopf invariant for all homogeneous braid knots and fibered knots up to 12 crossings. As an application, we deduce an explicit formula for the Hopf invariant in terms of colored Jones polynomials.
  For non-fibered strongly quasipositive knots, we study a relation between $F_K$ and the stability series of the colored Jones function, and explore similarities between $F_K$ and knot Floer homology. Finally, we propose a slope conjecture for $F_K$, relating it to the boundary slopes of the knot.</description>

      <title>Canonical bases of tensor products of integrable highest weight modules arising from framed constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a quantum group, we prove that the canonical bases of the tensor products of its integrable highest weight modules can be obtained from the canonical bases of the integrable highest weight modules of a bigger quantum group. As a result, based on the positivity of the canonical bases of the integrable highest weight modules due to Lusztig, we prove that the canonical bases of the tensor products have the positivity.</description>
