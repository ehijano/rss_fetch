      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- I. Possible Infrared Excess Among White Dwarfs in NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope observations of the globular cluster NGC 6397 and use them to extend to infrared wavelengths the characterization of the cluster's entire white dwarf (WD) cooling sequence (CS). The data allows us to probe fundamental astrophysical WD properties and to search for evidence in their colors for (or against) the existence of ancient planetary systems. The existing archival Hubble Space Telescope imaging data obtained ~18 years ago reach ultra-deep optical magnitudes (V~31) and allow us to derive a near-perfect separation between field and cluster members. We detect an apparent split in the lower part of the WD CS of NGC 6397. The red part of the WD CS, containing about 25% of the total, exhibits significant IR-excess of up to Delta m_F322W2 ~ 0.5 mag. These infrared excesses require both theoretical and observational follow-ups to confirm their veracity and to ascertain their true nature.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- II. Discovery of Brown Dwarfs in NGC 6397 and Measurement of Age from the Brown Dwarf Cooling Sequence, using SANDee - a New Grid of Model Isochrones across the Hydrogen-Burning Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters contain vast repositories of metal-poor stars that represent some of the oldest stellar generations in the Universe. The archaeological footprint of early Galactic evolution may be retained in the measurable properties of globular clusters, such as their ages, mass functions and chemical abundances. Until recently, all photometric studies of globular clusters were restricted to stellar members. Now, the sensitivity of JWST can extend this analysis to the substellar regime. If detected in sufficient numbers, brown dwarf members can provide tight constraints on the properties of their parent population. We present SANDee - a new grid of stellar models that accurately represent the color-magnitude diagrams of globular clusters across the hydrogen-burning limit at a wide range of metallicities. Using JWST NIRCam photometry and the new models, we identify three brown dwarfs in the globular cluster NGC 6397 with effective temperatures of 1300-1800 K, confirmed by both proper motion and model fitting. We use the observed luminosities of discovered brown dwarfs to obtain the first age estimate of a globular cluster from its substellar cooling sequence: 13.4 +/- 3.3 Gyr. We also derive the local mass function of the cluster across the hydrogen-burning limit and find it to be top-heavy, suggesting extensive dynamical evolution. We expect that the constraints on both age and mass function of NGC 6397 derived in this work can be greatly improved by a second epoch of NIRCam imaging in the same field.</description>

      <title>$\textit{JWST}$ Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters$\,-\,$III. Multiple Populations along the low-mass Main Sequence stars of NGC$\,$6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to its exceptional near-infrared photometry, $\textit{JWST}$ can effectively contribute to the discovery, characterization, and understanding of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, especially at low masses where the $\textit{Hubble}$ $\textit{Space}$ $\textit{Telescope}$ ($\textit{HST}$) faces limitations. This paper continues the efforts of the $\textit{JWST}$ GO-1979 program in exploring the faintest members of the globular cluster NGC$\,$6397. Here we show that the combination of $\textit{HST}$ and $\textit{JWST}$ data allows us to identify two groups of MS stars (MSa, the first-generation, and MSb, the second-generation group). We measured the ratio between the two groups and combined it with measurements from the literature focused on more central fields and more massive stars compared to our study. We find that the MSa and MSb stars are present in a $\approx$30-70 ratio regardless of the distance from the centre of the cluster and the mass of the stars used so far.</description>

      <title>Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission and the Brightest Solar Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the incidence of coherent emission in solar radio bursts, using a revised catalog of 3800 solar radio bursts observed by the Nobeyama Radio Polarimeters from 1988 to 2023. We focus on the 1.0 and 2.0 GHz data, where radio fluxes of order 10 billion Jansky have been observed. Previous work has suggested that these bursts are due to electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. In at least one well studied case, the bright emission at 1 GHz consists of narrowband spikes of millisecond duration. Coherent emission at 1 GHz can be distinguished from traditional incoherent gyrosynchrotron flare emission based on the radio spectrum: gyrosynchrotron emission at 1 GHz usually has a spectrum rising with frequency, so bursts in which 1 GHz is stronger than higher frequency measurements are unlikely to be incoherent gyrosynchrotron. Based on this criterion it is found that, for bursts exceeding 100 sfu, three-quarters of all bursts at 1 GHz and half of all 2 GHz bursts have a dominant coherent emission component, assumed to be ECM. The majority of the very bright bursts at 1 GHz are highly circularly polarized, consistent with a coherent emission mechanism, but not always 100% polarized. The frequency range from 1 to 2 GHz is heavily utilized for terrestrial applications, and these results are relevant for understanding the extreme flux levels that may impact such applications. Further, they provide a reference for comparison with the study of ECM emission from other stars and potentially exoplanets.</description>

      <title>KIC 7914906: An Eclipsing Heartbeat Star with Tidally Excited Oscillations and Gamma Doradus/Delta Scuti Hybrid Pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the eclipsing Heartbeat Star KIC 9704906 with tidally excited oscillations (TEOs) and gamma Doradus/delta Scuti hybrid pulsations. The derived parameters show that it has an orbital period of $P$=8.7529108(1) days, a high eccentricity of $e$=0.467(3), and a high inclination of $i$=78$^{\circ}$.81(6). The mass ratio $q$=0.981(5), the relative radii (radius divided by semi-major axis) $r_1$=0.0639(2), and $r_2$=0.0715(4) indicate that the secondary component has a less mass and a larger radius, and may have evolved off the main sequence. The eight derived TEO candidates, $n$ = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 40, and 44 harmonics, are consistent with or close to the dominant spherical harmonic $l=2$, $m=0$, or $\pm2$, assuming that the spin and orbital axes are aligned, and the pulsations are adiabatic and standing waves. We also identify ten independent frequency candidates, but one of them, $\mathit{f_{7}}$, is more like a modulation of a quasi-periodic signal and the orbits. According to the g-mode frequencies, we find that the rotation period of one component is 11.52(29) days. Although the masses and radii cannot be further constrained due to the lack of sufficient high-precision spectra, the fascinating phenomena in the Fourier spectra are evident and valuable in this system.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Magnetized Asteroseismic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve for waves in a polytropic, stratified medium with a spatially varying background magnetic field that points along a horizontal $x$-direction, and with gravity that is directed along the vertical $z$-direction. Force balance determines the magnitude of the background magnetic field, $B_0^2 \sim z^{n+1}$, where $n$ is the polytropic index. Using numerical and asymptotic methods, we deduce an accurate and explicit dispersion relation for fast pressure-driven waves: $\Omega^2 \sim K\left(2m+n\right) \left[1 + (1/M_\mathrm{A})^2 (4-2\gamma+\cos^2\theta-3\cos^4\theta)/4 \right]$. Here, $\Omega$ is the frequency, $K$ the wavenumber, $\theta$ the angle the wave-vector makes with the background magnetic field, $M_\mathrm{A}$ the Alfv\'enic Mach number, and $m$ an integer representing the eigen state. Applications of our result are in magnetoseismology and nonlinear asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Validating Gaia DR3 Pulsating Variable Classifications with TESS: Building Reliable $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus Stars Catalogs (In Progress)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia DR3 revealed 748,058 pulsating variable stars of mixed DSCT|GDOR|SXPHE types. This project undertakes a comprehensive examination to validate and distinguish these stars using TESS data. Aiming for reliable catalogs of bona fide $\delta$ Scuti and $\gamma$ Doradus stars, I have validated 1715 $\delta$ Scuti stars, 1403 $\gamma$ Doradus stars, and identified 260 eclipsing binaries, one RR Lyrae star, and 460+ rotating variables from an initial sample of 16,690 objects. Notably, 15 of the newfound eclipsing binaries harbor pulsating $\gamma$ Doradus components.</description>

      <title>On its way to the neutron star-white dwarf binary graveyard, IGR J16194-2810, a first ascent M giant X-ray binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single-lined spectroscopic orbit for the M giant in the X-ray binary IGR J16194-2810 is determined from a time-series of optical spectra. The spectroscopic orbital period of 192.5 days is twice that of the photometric period, confirming that the M giant in the system is an ellipsoidal variable. The giant is identified as a first ascent giant approaching the red giant tip. The primary is a neutron star (NS) with its M giant companion filling its Roche lobe verifying the system classification as a Low-Mass X-ray binary (LMXB). Stellar C, N, O and Fe abundances are derived for the M giant with the C, N, O values typical for a field giant with [Fe/H] = -0.14. The system does not have a large kick velocity. Models for the evolution of the system into a binary NS-white dwarf (WD) are presented. The X-ray properties are discussed in the context of this model. This binary is a rare example of a luminous, long orbital period, LMXB early in the transient ellipsoidal phase.</description>

      <title>Approaching the conformal limit of quark matter with different chemical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the influence of different chemical potentials (baryon, charged, strange, and neutrino) on how and how fast a free gas of quarks in the zero-temperature limit reaches the conformal limit. We discuss the influence of non-zero masses, the inclusion of leptons, and different constraints, such as charge neutrality, zero-net strangeness, and fixed lepton fraction. We also investigate for the first time how the symmetry energy of the system under some of these conditions approaches the conformal limit. Finally, we briefly discuss what kind of corrections are expected from perturbative QCD as one goes away from the conformal limit.</description>

      <title>Prioritizing High-Precision Photometric Monitoring of Exoplanet and Brown Dwarf Companions with JWST -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate for the prioritization of high-precision photometric monitoring of exoplanet and brown dwarf companions to detect brightness variability arising from features in their atmospheres. Measurements of photometric variability provide not only an insight into the physical appearances of these companions, but are also a direct probe of their atmospheric structures and dynamics, and yield valuable estimates of their rotation periods. JWST is uniquely capable of monitoring faint exoplanet companions over their full rotation periods, thanks to its inherent stability and powerful high-contrast coronagraphic imaging modes. Rotation period measurements can be further combined with measurements of v sin i obtained using high-resolution spectroscopy to infer the viewing angle of a companion. Photometric monitoring over multiple rotation periods and at multiple epochs will allow both short- and long-term time evolution in variability signals to be traced. Furthermore, the differences between the layers in a companion's atmosphere can be probed by obtaining simultaneous photometric monitoring at different wavelengths through NIRCam dual-band coronagraphy. Overall, JWST will reach the highest sensitivities to variability to date and enable the light curves of substellar companions to be characterised with unprecedented cadence and precision at the sub-percent level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An attempt is made to evaluate progress of the Polish astrophysical research of stars and of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) on the basis of scientific paper citations in the ADS database. Rather modest citation levels were observed in the years before the mid-1950's. In the years 1958 - 1973, thanks to the partly opened foreign contacts and to strong support from astronomers of the older generation, work of a number of young, energetic enthusiasts reached the world science levels and formed a strong basis for the well recognized, international successes of the next generations.</description>

      <title>Multi-filter UV to NIR Data-driven Light Curve Templates for Stripped Envelope Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the spectroscopic classification scheme for Stripped envelope supernovae (SESNe) is clear, and we know that they originate from massive stars that lost some or all their envelopes of Hydrogen and Helium, the photometric evolution of classes within this family is not fully characterized. Photometric surveys, like the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, will discover tens of thousands of transients each night and spectroscopic follow-up will be limited, prompting the need for photometric classification and inference based solely on photometry. We have generated 54 data-driven photometric templates for SESNe of subtypes IIb, Ib, Ic, Ic-bl, and Ibn in U/u, B, g, V, R/r, I/i, J, H, Ks, and Swift w2, m2, w1 bands using Gaussian Processes and a multi-survey dataset composed of all well-sampled open-access light curves (165 SESNe, 29531 data points) from the Open Supernova Catalog. We use our new templates to assess the photometric diversity of SESNe by comparing final per-band subtype templates with each other and with individual, unusual and prototypical SESNe. We find that SNe Ibns and Ic-bl exhibit a distinctly faster rise and decline compared to other subtypes. We also evaluate the behavior of SESNe in the PLAsTiCC and ELAsTiCC simulations of LSST light curves highlighting differences that can bias photometric classification models trained on the simulated light curves. Finally, we investigate in detail the behavior of fast-evolving SESNe (including SNe Ibn) and the implications of the frequently observed presence of two peaks in their light curves.</description>

      <title>The Role of Acetylene in the Chemical Evolution of Carbon Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acetylene, among the multitude of organic molecules discovered in space, plays a distinct role in the genesis of organic matter. Characterized by its unique balance of stability and reactivity, acetylene is the simplest unsaturated organic molecule known to have a triple bond. In addition to its inherent chemical properties, acetylene is one of the most prevalent organic molecules found across the Universe, spanning from the icy surfaces of planets and satellites and the cold interstellar medium with low temperatures to hot circumstellar envelopes where temperatures surge to several thousand kelvins. These factors collectively position acetylene as a crucial building block in the molecular diversification of organic molecules and solids present in space. This review comprehensively discusses the formation and expansion of carbon skeletons involving acetylene, ranging from the formation of simple molecules to the origination of the first aromatic ring and ultimately to the formation of nanosized carbon particles. Mechanisms pertinent to both hot environments, such as circumstellar envelopes, and cold environments, including molecular clouds and planetary atmospheres, are explored. In addition, this review contemplates the role of acetylene in the synthesis of prebiotic molecules. A distinct focus is accorded to the recent advancements and future prospects of research into catalytic processes involving acetylene molecules, which is a significant instrument in driving the evolution of carbon complexity in the Universe. The insights garnered from this review underline the significance of acetylene in astrochemistry and potentially contribute to our understanding of the chemical evolution of the Universe.</description>

Abstract: The equation of state (EoS) of neutron matter plays a decisive role in our understanding of the properties of neutron stars as well as the generation of gravitational waves in neutron star mergers. At sufficient densities, it is known that the appearance of hyperons generally softens the EoS, thus leading to a reduction in the maximum mass of neutron stars well below the observed values of about 2 solar masses. Even though repulsive three-body forces are known to solve this so-called "hyperon puzzle", so far performing \textit{ab initio} calculations with a substantial number of hyperons has remained elusive. In this work, we address this challenge by employing simulations based on Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with up to 232 neutrons (pure neutron matter) and up to 116 $\Lambda$ hyperons (hyper-neutron matter) in a finite volume. We introduce a novel auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm, allowing us to simulate for both pure neutron matter and hyper-neutron matter systems up to 5 times the density of nuclear matter using a single auxiliary field without any sign oscillations. Also, for the first time in {\em ab initio} calculations, we not only include $N\Lambda$ two-body and $NN\Lambda$ three-body forces, but also $\Lambda\Lambda$ and $N \Lambda\Lambda$ interactions. Consequently, we determine essential astrophysical quantities such as the mass-radius relation, the speed of sound and the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Our findings also confirm the existence of the $I$-Love-$Q$ relation, which gives access to the moment of inertia of the neutron star.</description>

      <title>On the original composition of the gas forming first-generation stars in clusters: insights from HST and JWST</title>

Abstract: Globular cluster (GC) stars composed of pristine material (first-generation, 1G, stars) are not chemically homogeneous, as they exhibit extended sequences in the "Chromosome Map" (ChM). Recent studies characterized 1G stars within the center of 55 Galactic GCs, revealing metallicity variations. Despite this progress, several unanswered questions persist, particularly concerning the link between the 1G metallicity spread and factors such as the radial distance from the cluster center or the host GC parameters. Additionally, it remains unclear whether the extended 1G sequence phenomenon is exclusive to old Galactic GCs with multiple populations. This work addresses these open issues, examining 1G stars in different environments. First, we combine Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and James Webb Space Telescope photometry of the GC 47 Tucanae to study 1G stars at increasing distances from the cluster center. We find that metal-rich 1G stars are more centrally concentrated than metal-poor ones, suggesting a metallicity radial gradient. Additionally, the two groups of 1G stars share similar kinematics. Since our analysis focuses on giant stars in the cluster center and M dwarfs in external fields, we discuss the possibility that the metallicity distribution depends on stellar mass. Subsequently, we analyze HST multi-band photometry of two simple-population clusters, NGC 6791 and NGC 1783, revealing elongated sequences in the ChM associated with metallicity variations. Finally, we investigate the 1G color distribution in 51 GCs, finding no connections with the host cluster parameters. These results shed light on the complex nature of 1G stars, providing insights into the GC formation environment.</description>

      <title>A close binary lens revealed by the microlensing event Gaia20bof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the last 25 years, hundreds of binary stars and planets have been discovered towards the Galactic Bulge by microlensing surveys. Thanks to a new generation of large-sky surveys, it is now possible to regularly detect microlensing events across the entire sky. The OMEGA Key Projet at the Las Cumbres Observatory carries out automated follow-up observations of microlensing events alerted by these surveys with the aim of identifying and characterizing exoplanets as well as stellar remnants. In this study, we present the analysis of the binary lens event Gaia20bof. By automatically requesting additional observations, the OMEGA Key Project obtained dense time coverage of an anomaly near the peak of the event, allowing characterization of the lensing system. The observed anomaly in the lightcurve is due to a binary lens. However, several models can explain the observations. Spectroscopic observations indicate that the source is located at $\le2.0$ kpc, in agreement with the parallax measurements from Gaia. While the models are currently degenerate, future observations, especially the Gaia astrometric time series as well as high-resolution imaging, will provide extra constraints to distinguish between them.</description>

      <title>Estimating microlensing parameters from observables and stellar isochrones with pyLIMASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present pyLIMASS, a novel algorithm for estimating the physical properties of the lensing system in microlensing events. The main idea of pyLIMASS is to combine all available information regarding the microlensing event, defined as observables, and to estimate the parameter distributions of the system, such as the lens mass and distance. The algorithm is based on isochrones for the stars model and combine the observables using a Gaussian Mixtures approach. After describing the mathematical formalism and its implementation, we discuss the algorithm's performance on simulated and published events. Generally, the pyLIMASS estimations are in good agreement (i.e., within 1-$\sigma$) with the results of the selected published events, making it an effective tool to estimate the lens properties and their distribution. The applicability of the method was tested by using a catalog of realistically simulated events that could be observed by the future Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey of the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By solely using constraints from the Roman lightcurves and images, pyLIMASS estimates the masses of the lens of the Roman catalog with a median precision of 20% with almost no bias.</description>

      <title>Early flash-ionization lines in SN 2024ggi revealed by high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of very early high-resolution spectroscopic observations of the nearby core-collapse (CC) supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a Type II SN that ocurred in the galaxy NGC 3621, at a distance of 7.11 Mpc ($z\approx0.002435$). These observations represent the earliest high-resolution spectroscopy of a CCSN ever made. We analyze the very early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi obtained in a short interval at 26.6 and 33.8h after the SN first light. Observations were obtained with the high-resolution spectrograph MIKE ($R\approx22600-28000$) at the 6.5m Magellan Clay Telescope, located at the Las Campanas Observatory, during the night of 2024-04-12UT. We constrain emission line features in the early-phase spectroscopic evolution of SN 2024ggi. We analyze the evolution of main spectroscopic features and the occurrence of high-ionization emission lines, by estimating their full width at half maximum (FWHM), equivalent width (EW), and blueshift velocities. We then compare our results to other early-time observations of CCSNe. The spectra show strong and narrow features of Balmer emission lines and of high-ionization species of HeI, HeII, NIII, CIII, together with relatively broader emission features of NIV and CIV. Some of these features become broader or disappear in the interval of 8h, indicating the rapid changes in the early evolution of CCSNe flash-ionization features. The HeII, CIV, NIV and Balmer emission lines have asymmetric Lorentzian profiles, with the HeII $\lambda4686$ broad component showing blue wings that extends up to $\sim-1000$ km s$^{-1}$. We also measure a CSM expansion velocity of $\sim 79 \ \textrm{km} \ \textrm{s}^{-1}$ from the blueshift in the H$\alpha$ emission profile, and a total extinction in the line of sight of $E(B-V)=0.16$ mag. Finally, we note many similarities of SN 2024ggi to the early evolution of SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>Wind Roche-lobe Overflow in Low-Mass Binaries: Exploring the Origin of Rapidly Rotating Blue Lurkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wind Roche-Lobe Overflow (WRLOF) is a mass-transfer mechanism proposed by Mohamed and Podsiadlowski (2007) for stellar binaries wherein the wind acceleration zone of the donor star exceeds its Roche lobe radius, allowing stellar wind material to be transferred to the accretor at enhanced rates. WRLOF may explain characteristics observed in blue lurkers and blue stragglers. While WRLOF has been implemented in rapid population synthesis codes, it has yet to be explored thoroughly in detailed binary models such as MESA (a 1D stellar evolution code), and over a wide range of initial binary configurations. We incorporate WRLOF accretion in MESA to investigate wide low-mass binaries at solar metallicity. We perform a parameter study over the initial orbital period and stellar mass. In most of the models where we consider angular momentum transfer during accretion, the accretor is spun up to the critical (or break-up) rotation rate. Then we assume the star develops a boosted wind to efficiently reduce the angular momentum so that it could maintain a sub-critical rotation. Balanced by boosted wind loss, the accretor only gains $\sim 2\%$ of its total mass, but can maintain a near-critical rotation rate during WRLOF. Notably, the mass-transfer efficiency is significantly smaller than in previous studies in which the rotation of the accretor is ignored. We compare our results to observational data of blue lurkers in M67 and find that the WRLOF mechanism can qualitatively explain the origin of their rapid rotation, their location on the HR diagram and their orbital periods.</description>

      <title>Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observables of simulated plasmoid-mediated reconnection in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the role of magnetic reconnection in the heating and dynamics of the solar atmosphere requires detailed observational data of any observable aspect of the reconnection process, including small-scale features such as plasmoids. Here, we examine the capability of active and upcoming instruments to detect plasmoids generated by reconnection in the corona including low-density regimes. We used the Bifrost code to perform simulations of plasmoid-mediated reconnection in the corona with a 2D idealized setup: a fan-spine topology with uniform density including thermal conduction. Through a forward-modeling of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) observables, we checked whether our simulated plasmoids could be detected with the instruments of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and Solar Orbiter (SO), as well as the upcoming Multi-Slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) and Solar-C missions. Short-lived (10-20 s) small-scale (0.2-0.5 Mm) coronal plasmoids are not resolvable with the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO, but could be captured with the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) of SO. The spatial and temporal high-resolution planned for the MUSE spectrograph (SG) is adequate to obtain full spectral information of these plasmoids. Detection of 0.8 MK plasmoids in the MUSE/SG 171 {\AA} channel is possible in full-raster mode in regions with electron densities above 10^9 cm^3 whereas on sit-and-stare mode for lower-density regions. Solar-C could also capture these coronal plasmoids using the EUV High-Throughput Spectroscopic Telescope (EUVST), considering rapid changes in Doppler shift and line widths in different EUV lines caused by plasmoid motions along the current sheet. With combined spectra of MUSE/SG and Solar-C/EUVST in multiple emission lines, along with high-resolution images from SO/EUI and MUSE/CI, it should be possible to gain new insights about plasmoid formation in the corona.</description>

      <title>Floating binary planets from ejections during close stellar encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06016v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of planetary systems beyond our solar system has challenged established theories of planetary formation. Planetary orbits display a variety of unexpected architectures, and free-floating planets appear ubiquitous. The recent detection of candidate Jupiter Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has added another puzzling layer. Here, through direct few-body simulations, we demonstrate that JuMBOs could arise from the ejection of double giant planets following a close encounter with a passing star, if the two planets are nearly aligned at the closest approach. These ejected JuMBOs typically possess an average semi-major axis approximately three times the orbital separation within their original planetary system and a high eccentricity, characterized by a superthermal distribution that sets them apart from those formed primordially. We estimate the JuMBO formation rate per planetary system in typical and densely populated clusters, revealing a significant environmental dependence. In dense clusters, this formation rate can reach a few percent for wide planetary systems. Comparative analysis of JuMBO rates and properties with current and forthcoming JWST observations across various environments promises insights into the conditions under which these giant planets formed in protoplanetary disks, thereby imposing constraints on theories of giant planet formation.</description>

      <title>Earth's Alfv\'en wings driven by the April 2023 Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08091v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a rare regime of Earth's magnetosphere interaction with sub-Alfv\'enic solar wind in which the windsock-like magnetosphere transforms into one with Alfv\'en wings. In the magnetic cloud of a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on April 24, 2023, NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale mission distinguishes the following features: (1) unshocked and accelerated cold CME plasma coming directly against Earth's dayside magnetosphere; (2) dynamical wing filaments representing new channels of magnetic connection between the magnetosphere and foot points of the Sun's erupted flux rope; (3) cold CME ions observed with energized counter-streaming electrons, evidence of CME plasma captured due to reconnection between magnetic-cloud and Alfv\'en-wing field lines. The reported measurements advance our knowledge of CME interaction with planetary magnetospheres, and open new opportunities to understand how sub-Alfv\'enic plasma flows impact astrophysical bodies such as Mercury, moons of Jupiter, and exoplanets close to their host stars.</description>
