      <title>On the Dynamics of a Nutation Ring Damper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nutation triggered by external disturbances is an undesirable phenomenon for a spinning satellite. Passive decay in nutation angle must be achieved in such cases and benefits missions involving spin-stabilized satellites or mass-constrained satellites like CubeSats. Motivated by previous work of other authors, the dynamics of a general nutating satellite with an attached ring containing a viscous fluid is analyzed in a theoretical mechanics framework. The fluid in the ring is modeled as a rigid point mass and is then extended to a distributed rigid slug. The nonlinear equations of motion of the system, under the assumption of zero external torques, are studied in a body-fixed frame. Equilibrium points and system trajectories are studied on the angular momentum sphere. The settling time of the dynamical system after an initial disturbance is investigated. The energy dissipation is modeled using an approximate drag coefficient. Fluid dynamic effects are further examined through CFD simulations in the Navier-Stokes setting using the open-source software package ANSYS Fluent. Applications of the analysis and simulations to CubeSats are discussed.</description>

      <title>Photorefractive and pyroelectric photonic memory and long-term stability in thin-film lithium niobate microresonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of the integrated photonic circuits is of critical importance for many applications that require high frequency precision or robust operation over time, such as optomechanical sensing, frequency conversion, optical communication, and quantum optics. Photonic memory is useful for low-energy optical computing and interconnects. Thin film lithium niobate (TFLN), as an emerging photonic platform, exhibits complex material properties including pyroelectric (PE) and photorefractive (PR) effects which could lead to intra-device drift and excess noise under different environmental or operating conditions as well as be utilized for building photonic memory. However, the long-term stability and memory effect of its optical properties has not been explored. In this paper, we discovered a long-lived change of optical refractive index as a result of light excitation and temporal temperature variation using Z-cut TFLN microresonators and reveal a strong dependence of the instability with the crystal orientation of the thin film form. The recovery time are measured to be over 10 hours. Leveraging the photonic memory with a long relaxation time, we realize optical trimming of the cavity resonance frequencies. Our result offers insights towards understanding the fundamental noise properties and dynamic behavior of the integrated TFLN material and devices.</description>

      <title>Bayer-type Vis-NIR Routing via Inverse Design for Submicron-pixel Image Sensing Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of high-precision nanoscale lithography technology, high-resolution image sensing has experienced rapid development in recent years. Currently, mainstream commercial image sensors predominantly utilize Bayer array color filters to implement RGB colorful imaging strategies. However, as pixel sizes transition into the submicron dimensions, traditional dye filters used in image sensors have long been hampered by limited optical efficiency, suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios, and significant difficulties in miniaturization. In this work, a novel 4-channel RGB-IR color router for image sensing, distinct from the traditional absorption-transmission mechanisms, was proposed through inverse design methodologies. Utilizing genetic algorithms and DCGAN models, approximately 20,000 random color routing structures were generated and trained. From these, an optimized spectral splitting structure with a minimal periodic size of 1.6 um * 1.6 um was identified. This structure achieves peak optical efficiencies 1.7 times greater than those of dye filters, while also offering superior color imaging quality and signal intensity. This innovative design approach, leveraging deep learning integration, demonstrates an on-chip strategy for color realization in 4-channel image sensors, and holds significant promise for enhancing the development of next-generation high-performance image sensing chip systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient transmutation of long-lived fission products in a Gamma Factory beam driven advanced nuclear energy system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gamma Factory (GF) project aims to generate high-intensity $\gamma$-ray beams of tunable energy and relatively small energy spread. Such beams can be optimized to generate an intense photo-neutron source, capable of driving an advanced nuclear energy system (ANES) for nuclear waste transmutation and supplying electrical power that is necessary for the GF operation mode of the Large Hadron Collider storage ring. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of driving ANES with the GF beam which is optimized to maximize the neutron production rate. The dependence of the ANES thermal power on the distance between the positions of the ANES and the GF $\gamma$-ray source is evaluated. For the $\gamma$-ray beam reaching the intensity of $\sim$$10^{19}$ photons per second, the ANES thermal power could exceed $500\,$MWt. Under the assumption that ANES operates over $20$ years, the transmutation rate could reach $30\%$ for five typical long-lived fission products (LLFPs): $^{79}$Se, $^{99}$Tc, $^{107}$Pd, $^{129}$I, $^{137}$Cs. Our comparative studies show that although the neutron production efficiency of the GF $\gamma$-ray beam (per MW of the beam power) is approximately $14$ times lower than that of the $500\,$MeV proton beam, the overall net ANES power production efficiency for the GF beam driver scheme could be comparable to that of the proton beam driver scheme, while providing additional transmutation capacity, not available for the proton beam driven scheme. It is suggested that the GF-based ANES could provide a viable solution for the efficient transmutation of LLFPs without isotopic separation.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplication. At the moment, the main interface of software libraries for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs allowed to conclude that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the naive implementations by several times. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a naive optimized implementation.</description>

      <title>Liquid Metal Oxide-assisted Integration of High-k Dielectrics and Metal Contacts for Two-Dimensional Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals semiconductors are promising for future nanoelectronics. However, integrating high-k gate dielectrics for device applications is challenging as the inert van der Waals material surfaces hinder uniform dielectric growth. Here, we report a liquid metal oxide-assisted approach to integrate ultrathin, high-k HfO2 dielectric on 2D semiconductors with atomically smooth interfaces. Using this approach, we fabricated 2D WS2 top-gated transistors with subthreshold swings down to 74.5 mV/dec, gate leakage current density below 10-6 A/cm2, and negligible hysteresis. We further demonstrate a one-step van der Waals integration of contacts and dielectrics on graphene. This can offer a scalable approach toward integrating entire prefabricated device stack arrays with 2D materials. Our work provides a scalable solution to address the crucial dielectric engineering challenge for 2D semiconductors, paving the way for high-performance 2D electronics.</description>

      <title>Dense Suspension Inertial Microfluidic Particle Theory (DENSE-IMPACT) Model for Elucidating Outer Wall Focusing at High Cell Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inertial microfluidics have been limited to dilute particle concentrations due to defocusing at high particle concentrations. However, we observed a counterintuitive shift of focusing to the outer wall at high concentrations, which contradicts the existing particle focusing theory based on Navier-Stokes equation. We developed a multiphase model incorporating lift forces and particle-particle interactions to explain this behaviour. Numerical simulations validated by experimental data reveal the shift is governed by the ratio of the lift force strength to that of particle interaction frequencies.</description>

      <title>CoF3: a g-wave Altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase bridging ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, exhibits zero net magnetization due to its unique alternating spin arrangements, which cancel out macroscopic magnetization. This phase is characterized by robust time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-momentum locking, leading to distinct electronic properties advantageous for spintronic applications. In this study, we explore the possibility of altermagnetism in cobalt trifluoride (CoF3) using density functional theory (DFT) with Hubbard U correction combined with spin group theory. Our findings reveal that CoF3 exhibits zero net magnetization similar to a g-type antiferromagnet but with spin degeneracy breaking without spin-orbit coupling, akin to a ferromagnet. The optimized structure of CoF3, characterized by a rhombohedral lattice with centrosymmetric symmetry group R3c, shows significant spin splitting in both valence and conduction bands, reaching up to 45 meV. This spin splitting is attributed to the electric crystal potential and the anisotropy of the spin density, leading to the breaking of Kramers degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Increased resistance to photooxidation in Dion-Jacobson lead halide perovskites -- implication for perovskite device stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D metal halide perovskites have enabled significant stability improvements in perovskite devices, particularly in resistance to moisture. However, some 2D perovskites are even more susceptible to photooxidation compared to 3D perovskites. This is particularly true for more commonly investigated Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) perovskites that exhibit increased susceptibility to photoinduced degradation compared to Dion-Jacobson (DJ) perovskites. Comparisons between different RP and DJ perovskites reveal that this phenomenon cannot be explained by commonly proposed differences in superoxide ion generation, interlayer distance and lattice structural rigidity differences. Instead, the resistance to photooxidation of DJ perovskites can be attributed to decreased likelihood of double deprotonation events (compared to single deprotonation events in RP perovskites) required for the loss of organic cations and the perovskite decomposition. Consequently, DJ perovskites are less susceptible to oxidative degradation (both photo- and electrochemically induced), which leads to improved operational stability of solar cells based on these materials.</description>

      <title>Extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) with very low sheet resistance 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the realization of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. By introduction the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/Al$_{0.3}$Ga$_{0.7}$N interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only an order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggested the strain-induced 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was as high as 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a very low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). The finding of the very high-density 2D electron gas with very low sheet resistance in N-polar III-nitride heterostructures can push the power performance N-polar GaN HEMTs into a new level which is unreachable by the conventional N-polar GaN HEMTs.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric Properties of Benzothieno-Benzothiophene Self-Assembled Monolayers in Molecular Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a combined experimental (C-AFM and SThM) and theoretical (DFT) study of the thermoelectric properties of molecular junctions made of self-assembled monolayers on Au of thiolated benzothieno-benzothiophene (BTBT) and alkylated BTBT derivatives (C8-BTBT-C8). We measure the thermal conductance per molecule at 15 pW/K and 8.8 pW/K, respectively, among the lowest values for molecular junctions so far reported (10-50 pW/K). The lower thermal conductance for C8-BTBT-C8 is consistent with two interfacial thermal resistances introduced by the alkyl chains, which reduce the phononic thermal transport in the molecular junction. The Seebeck coefficients are 36 {\mu}V/K and 245 {\mu}V/K, respectively, the latter due to the weak coupling of the core BTBT with the electrodes. We deduce a thermoelectric figure of merit ZT up to ca. 1E-4 for the BTBT molecular junctions at 300K, on a par with the values reported for archetype molecular junctions (olygo(phenylene ethynylene) derivatives).</description>

      <title>Terahertz Plasmonic Transport in Topological Valley Metal-slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic devices have attracted great attentions in terahertz (THz) and optical regimes due to their robust protected transport properties. However, it remains challenging in miniaturization of the devices to get superior performance for photonic integrated circuits in optical networks. In this paper, Kagome photonic insulators constructed with ultrathin metal-slab on Polyimide substrate are proposed for THz waveguiding. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulation demonstrate that $C_{3v}$ symmetry can be broken by global rotation $\theta$ of the air holes in metallic Kagome lattice, providing topological phase transitions. The propagation of THz waves through Z-shaped domain walls with multiple sharp corners verifies the robustness of plasmonic transport. The positive/negative refraction of topological valley edge state from Zigzag interface into background space is illustrated. These results present a novel approach to manipulate THz waves and facilitate development of photonic integrated circuits with high compactness and robustness.</description>

Abstract: Solid-liquid equilibria for the binary systems of acetophenone and {N-methylformamide, or N,Ndimethylformamide, or N,N-dimethylacetamide, or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone} were determined by the cloudpoint and DSC techniques. For the same systems, excess enthalpies were measured at 293.15 K and 308.15 K by the titration calorimetry. Both types of data were correlated by the Redlich-Kister equation. The description of the solid-liquid equilibria incorporated measured excess enthalpies. The results of the prediction performed by the modified UNIFAC modelwere compared with the experimental data. The observed trends and differences between systems were discussed.</description>

      <title>GeSn 320 \times 256 Focal Plane Array for Silicon-Based Short-wave Infrared Imaging</title>

Abstract: Short-wave infrared (SWIR) imaging arrays have demonstrated great potential in applications spanning from military to civilian consumer electronics. However, the current focal plane arrays (FPAs), which are based on compound semiconductors, have limited applications in civilian circumstances due to elevated manufacturing costs and prolonged fabrication cycle time. To address this, a high-performance 320 $\times$ 256 focal plane array based on group-IV semiconductors has been designed and manufactured on a Si substrate using a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) compatible fabrication process. The optical absorption layer is composed of GeSn alloy, whose bandgap could be tailored by choosing the appropriate Sn concentration. In this work, a 10% Sn concentration was employed, yielding a response cutoff wavelength of 2308 nm for the Si-based photodetector, which was measured at 298 K. Moreover, a specific detectivity of 9.7 $\times$ 10$^{11}$ cm$\cdot$ Hz$^{1/2}$ $\cdot$ W$^{-1}$ has been achieved at 77 K, surpassing all previously reported GeSn devices, and rivals commercial extended InGaAs photodetectors. With the help of read-out circuits (ROIC), SWIR images have been successfully captured for the first time by using Si-based GeSn FPA. This work demonstrates the potential of group IV imaging arrays for various applications in the commercial SWIR imaging field.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning based high-bandwidth magnetic sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant growth of quantum technologies, and specifically quantum sensing, both in terms of the capabilities of advanced platforms and their applications. One of the leading platforms in this context is nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers in diamond, providing versatile, high-sensitivity, and high-resolution magnetic sensing. Nevertheless, current schemes for spin resonance magnetic sensing (as applied by NV quantum sensing) suffer from tradeoffs associated with sensitivity, dynamic range, and bandwidth. Here we address this issue, and implement machine learning tools to enhance NV magnetic sensing in terms of the sensitivity/bandwidth tradeoff in large dynamic range scenarios. We experimentally demonstrate this new approach, reaching an improvement in the relevant figure of merit by a factor of up to 5. Our results promote quantum machine learning protocols for sensing applications towards more feasible and efficient quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Generation of ultrashort ion pulses from ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02631v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an efficient method to produce laser-triggered proton pulses well below 500 ps pulse width at keV energies. We use femtosecond photoelectron pulses emitted from a cathode to enable ultrafast electron-stimulated desorption of adsorbates on a stainless steel plate under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. While direct photoionization of atoms to form well-timed ion pulses can suffer from a laser-focus-limited large starting volume, in our method the two-dimensional starting plane of the ions is defined with nanometer precision at a solid surface. We clearly outline how the method could be used in the future to efficiently produce ion beam pulses in the (sub)picosecond range for pump-probe experiments with ions.</description>

      <title>Photoinduced Charge Transfer in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Quantum Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.21035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have explored the charge transfer mechanism in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) quantum dots (QDs) of molybdenum disulfide ($\rm{MoS_2}$) and tungsten disulfide ($\rm{WS_2}$). Rhodamine 6G (R6G), a dye from the rhodamine family, has been employed as the fluorescent molecule, with MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ QDs acting as electron acceptors in the photo-induced charge transfer process. The TMDC QDs were synthesized using a top-down approach and characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and fluorimetry. TEM images revealed well-dispersed particles measuring 2 nm in size. These QDs exhibit strong fluorescence emission when excited with light at wavelengths below 350 nm. Under light exposure, photons generate charges in the fluorescent dye molecules, and the TMDC QDs facilitate the charge transfer process. The charge transfer phenomenon was investigated using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), a time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopic technique. The time-resolved fluorescence study indicated a change in the fluorescence (FL) lifetime of R6G molecules in the presence of QDs. The FL lifetime of R6G molecules without QDs was found to be 4.0 ns, which decreased to 1.9 ns and 3.8 ns in the presence of MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ QDs, respectively. This reduction in FL lifetime suggests that the MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$ QDs provide an additional pathway for photo-generated electrons in the excited state of R6G molecules. This research can be extended to optoelectronic devices, where charge transfer is crucial for device efficiency and performance.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Model for the Field Emission from Broad-Area Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron emission from cathodes in high field gradients is a quantum tunneling effect. The 1928 Fowler-Nordheim field emission (FE) equation and the 1956 Murphy-Good FE equation have traditionally been key in describing cold field emissions, offering estimates for emitters for almost a century. Nevertheless, applying FE theory in practice is often constrained by the lack of data on the distribution and geometry of the emission sites. Predictions become more challenging with an uneven electric field distribution at the cathode surface. Consequently, FE formulations are frequently calibrated using current-voltage data after test, limiting their efficacy as true predictive models.
  This study develops an alternative model for field emission using a data-driven predictive approach based on (1) vast experimental data, (2) electrostatic simulations of the cathode surface, and (3) detailed material and geometry properties, which together overcome these limitations. The objective of this work is to develop and harness this comprehensive dataset to train a machine learning model capable of providing precise predictions of the cathode current in order to further the understanding and application of field emission phenomena. More than 259 hours of experimental data have been processed to train and benchmark some of the well-known machine learning models. After two stages of optimization, a coefficient of determination &gt;98% is achieved in the prediction total field emission current using ensemble models.</description>

      <title>Nanomechanical crystalline AlN resonators with high quality factors for quantum optoelectromechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-\Qm{} mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high-\Qm{} mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high-\Qm{} nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work we realize nanomechanical resonators with \Qm{} up to $2.9\times 10^{7}$ made from tensile-strained \SI{290}{\nano\meter}-thick AlN, which is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. We demonstrate nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a \Qf-product approaching $10^{13}$\,\SI{}{\hertz} at room temperature. We realize a novel resonator geometry, triangline, whose shape follows the Al-N bonds and offers a central pad that we pattern with a photonic crystal. This allows us to reach an optical reflectivity above 80\% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile-strained AlN.</description>

      <title>Inductive detection of inverse spin-orbit torques in magnetic heterostructures</title>

Abstract: The manipulation of magnetization via Magnetic torques is one of the most important phenomena in spintronics. In thin films, conventionally, a charge current flowing in a heavy metal is used to generate transverse spin currents and to exert torques on the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnetic thin film layer. Here, in contrast to the typically employed heavy metals, we study spin-to-charge conversion in ferromagnetic heterostructures with large spin-orbit interaction that function as the torque-generating layers. In particular, we chose perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) multilayers [Co/Ni] and [Co/Pt] as the torque-generating layers and drive magnetization dynamics in metallic ferromagnetic thin film $\mathrm{Co_{20}Fe_{60}B_{20}}$ (CoFeB) layers with in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). We investigate the spin dynamics driven by spin-orbit torque (SOT) and the concomitant charge current generation by the inverse SOT process using an inductive technique based on a vector network analyzer. In our experimental findings, we find that the SOTs generated by our multilayers are of a magnitude comparable to those produced by Pt, consistent with first-principles calculations. Furthermore, we noted a significant correlation between the SOT and the thickness of the CoFeB layer.</description>

Abstract: We study the low-frequency noise (LFN), i.e. flicker noise, also referred to as 1/f noise, in 2D networks of molecularly functionalized gold nanoparticles (NMN: nanoparticle-molecule network). We examine the noise behaviors of the NMN hosting alkyl chains (octanethiol), fatty acid oleic acids (oleylamine), redox molecule switches (polyoxometalate derivatives) or photo-isomerizable molecules (azobenzene derivatives) and we compare their 1/f noise behaviors. These noise metrics are used to evaluate which molecules are the best candidates to build in-materio reservoir computing molecular devices based on NMNs.</description>
