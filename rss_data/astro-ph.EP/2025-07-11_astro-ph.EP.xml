      <title>JWST COMPASS: A NIRSpec G395H Transmission Spectrum of the Super-Earth GJ 357 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRSpec/G395H transmission spectroscopy observations of GJ 357 b, a warm ($T_{\mathrm{eq}} \approx 525$ K) super-Earth ($1.2\ \mathrm{R_{\oplus}} $, $1.84\ \mathrm{M_{\oplus}} $) orbiting a nearby M3-type star, with a median precision of 18 ppm and 27 ppm in NRS1 and NRS2, respectively. These precisions are obtained by binning the spectrum into 53 spectroscopic channels with a resolution of 60 pixels (around 0.02 $\mu$m) each. Our analysis of the transmission spectrum reveals no detectable atmospheric spectral features. By comparing the observed spectrum with 1D forward models, we rule out atmospheres with mean molecular weights (MMW) lower than 8 g/mol to $3 \sigma$, as well as atmospheres with metallicities less than 300x solar. The lack of a low MMW primary atmosphere is consistent with a primordial H$_2$ rich atmosphere having escaped, given the planet's $\gtrsim5$ Gyr age, relatively low surface gravity (log g = 3.09), and its likely history of substantial incident extreme ultraviolet radiation. We conclude that GJ 357 b most likely possesses either a high-MMW secondary atmosphere, perhaps rich in oxidized gases like CO$_2$, or is a bare rock with no atmosphere. Upcoming scheduled JWST thermal emission observations could help distinguish between these scenarios by detecting signatures indicative of atmospheric heat redistribution or molecular absorption.</description>

      <title>The Orbital Eccentricity-Radius Relation for Planets Orbiting M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orbital eccentricity-radius relation for small planets is indicative of the predominant dynamical sculpting processes during late-stage orbital evolution. Previous studies have shown that planets orbiting Sun-like stars exhibit an eccentricity-radius trend such that larger planets have higher orbital eccentricities, and that radius gap planets may have modestly higher orbital eccentricities than planets on either side of the radius gap. In this work, we investigate the trend for a sample of smaller M dwarf stars. For a sample of 236 single- and multi-transit confirmed planets or candidates discovered by the TESS and Kepler missions, we constrain orbital eccentricity for each planet from the transit photometry together with a stellar density prior. We investigate the binned eccentricity-planet radius relation for the combined planet sample and present evidence for a positive eccentricity-radius relationship with elevated eccentricities for planets larger than 3.5 R_earth, similar to the trend for planets orbiting Sun-like stars. We find modest evidence that single-transit M dwarf planets near the radius gap exhibit higher eccentricity, consistent with trends for Sun-like stars. However, we see no evidence for an increased eccentricity near the radius gap among multi-transit M dwarf planets. We discuss implications for these results in the context of predominant atmospheric loss mechanisms: namely, supporting evidence for photoevaporation in M dwarf planets vs. planet-planet collisions or giant impacts in FGK dwarf planets.</description>

      <title>Radius valley scaling among low mass stars with TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has been highly successful in detecting planets in close orbits around low-mass stars, particularly M dwarfs. This presents a valuable opportunity to conduct detailed population studies to understand how these planets depend on the properties of their host stars. The previously observed radius valley in Sun-like stars has not been unambiguously detected among M dwarfs, and how its properties varies when compared with more massive stars remains uncertain. We use a volume-limited sample of low mass stars with precise photometric stellar parameters from the bioverse catalog of TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs) confirmed planets and candidates within 120 pc. We detect the radius valley around M dwarfs at a location of 1.64 $\pm$ 0.03 $R_{\oplus}$ and with a depth of approximately 45${\%}$. The radius valley among GKM stars scales with stellar mass as $R_p \propto M_*^{0.15\pm 0.04}$. The slope is consistent, within 0.3$\sigma$, with those around Sun-like stars. For M dwarfs, the discrepancy is 3.6$\sigma$ with the extrapolated slope from the Kepler FGK sample, marking the point where the deviation from previous results begins. Moreover, we do not see a clear shift in the radius valley between early and mid M dwarfs. The flatter scaling of the radius valley for lower-mass stars suggests that mechanisms other than atmospheric mass loss through photoevaporation may shape the radius distribution of planets around M dwarfs. Comparison of the slope with various planet formation and evolution models matches well with pebble accretion models including waterworlds, indicating a potentially different regime of planet formation that can be probed with exoplanets around the lowest mass stars.</description>

      <title>The Roasting Marshmallows Program with IGRINS on Gemini South III: Seeing deeper into the metal depleted atmosphere of a gas-giant on the cusp of the hot to ultra-hot Jupiter transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters are a class of gas-giant exoplanets that show a peculiar combination of thermochemical properties in the form of molecular dissociation, atomic ionization, and inverted thermal structures. Atmospheric characterization of gas giants lying in the transitional regime between hot and ultra-hot Jupiters can help in understanding the physical mechanisms that cause the fundamental transition in atmospheres between the two classes of hot gas giants. Using Doppler spectroscopy with IGRINS on Gemini South (1.4 to 2.5 $\mu$m), we present the day-side high-resolution spectrum of WASP-122b (T$_{\mathrm{day}}$=2258$ \pm$ 54 K), a gas-giant situated at this transition. We detect the signal from H$_{2}$O, based on which we find that WASP-122b has a significantly metal-depleted atmosphere with metallicity log$_{10}$[Z$_{\mathrm{P}}$/Z$_{\odot}$] = $-$1.48$\pm$0.25 dex (0.033$_{-0.016}^{+0.018}$ $\times$ solar), and solar/sub-solar C/O ratio = 0.36$\pm$0.22 (3$\sigma$ upper limit 0.82). Drastically low atmospheric metallicity pushes the contribution function to higher pressures, resulting in the planetary spectral lines to originate from a narrow region around 1 bar where the thermal profile is non-inverted. This is inconsistent with solar composition radiative convective equilibrium (RCTE) which predicts an inverted atmosphere with spectral lines in emission. The sub-solar metallicity and solar/sub-solar C/O ratio is inconsistent with expectations from core-accretion. We find the planetary signal to be significantly shifted in K$_{\mathrm{P}}$ and V$_{\mathrm{sys}}$, which is in tension with the predictions from global circulation models and require further investigation. Our results highlight the detailed information content of high-resolution spectroscopy data and their ability to constrain complex atmospheric thermal structures and compositions of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>X-SHOOTER Spectrum of Comet C/2025 N1: Insights into a Distant Interstellar Visitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comets are primitive remnants of the early Solar System whose composition offers fundamental clues to their formation and evolution. High-resolution, broad-wavelength spectroscopy is crucial for identifying volatile species and constraining the physical conditions within the coma. We aim to characterize the gas composition and physical environment of the newly discovered comet C/2025 N1 through optical and near-infrared spectroscopy. We used a medium-resolution spectrum of comet C/2025 N1 with X-shooter at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), covering the 300-2500 nm wavelength range. Standard data reduction and flux calibration were applied. It corresponds to a spectral slope at least a factor of $\sim1.86$ higher than that of 2I/Borisov. Although the object clearly shows activity, only upper limits to the production rates of OH and CN can be estimated: $8.0\times10^{24}$ s$^{-1}$ and $4.9\times10^{23}$ s$^{-1}$, respectively. We obtained red spectral slopes consistent with those of typical D-type asteroids and outer Solar System objects.</description>

      <title>KMT-2024-BLG-0404L: A triple microlensing system consisting of a star, a brown dwarf, and a planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the lensing event KMT-2024-BLG-0404. The light curve of the event exhibited a complex structure with multiple distinct features, including two prominent caustic spikes, two cusp bumps, and a brief discontinuous feature between the caustic spikes. While a binary-lens model captured the general anomaly pattern, it could not account for a discontinuous anomaly feature between the two caustic spikes. To explore the origin of the unexplained feature, we conducted more advanced modeling beyond the standard binary-lens framework. This investigation demonstrated that the previously unexplained anomaly was resolved by introducing an additional lens component with planetary mass. The estimated masses of the lens components are $M_{\rm p}= 17.3^{+25.5}_{-8.8}~M_{\rm E}$ for the planet, and $M_{\rm h,A}=0.090^{+0.133}_{-0.046}~M_\odot$ and $M_{\rm h,B}=0.026^{+0.038}_{-0.013}~M_\odot$ for the binary host stars. Based on these mass estimates, the lens system is identified as a planetary system where a Uranus-mass planet orbits a binary consisting of a late M dwarf and a brown dwarf. The distance to the planetary system is estimated to be $D_{\rm L} = 7.21^{+0.93}_{-0.97}$~kpc, with an 82\% probability that it resides in the Galactic bulge. This discovery represents the ninth planetary system found through microlensing with a planet orbiting a binary host. Notably, it is the first case where the host consists of both a star and a brown dwarf.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study on radial velocity signals using ESPRESSO: Pushing precision to the 10 cm/s level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse ESPRESSO data for the stars HD10700, HD20794, HD102365, and HD304636 acquired via its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) programme. We characterise the stars' radial velocity (RV) signals down to a precision of 10 cm/s on timescales ranging from minutes to planetary periods falling within the host's habitable zone (HZ). We study the RV signature of pulsation, granulation, and stellar activity, inferring the potential presence of planets around these stars. Thus, we outline the population of planets that while undetectable remain compatible with the available data.
  A simple model of stellar pulsations successfully reproduced the intra-night RV scatter of HD10700 down to a few cm/s. For HD102365 and HD20794, an additional source of scatter at the level of several 10 cm/s remains necessary to explain the data. A kima analysis was used to evaluate the number of planets supported by the nightly averaged time series of each of HD10700, HD102365, and HD304636, under the assumption that a quasi-periodic Gaussian process (GP) regression is able to model the activity signal. While a frequency analysis of HD10700 RVs is able to identify a periodic signal at 20d, when it is modelled along with the activity signal the signal is formally non-significant. ESPRESSO data on their own do not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of planets around these three stars.
  ESPRESSO is shown to reach an on-sky RV precision of better than 10 cm/s on short timescales (&lt;1h) and of 40 cm/s over 3.5 yr. A subdivision of the datasets showcases a precision reaching 20-30 cm/s over one year. These results impose stringent constraints on the impact of granulation mechanisms on RV. In spite of no detections, our analysis of HD10700 RVs demonstrates a sensitivity to planets with a mass of 1.7M$_{\oplus}$ for periods of up to 100 d, and a mass of 2-5M$_{\oplus}$ for the star's HZ.

      <title>TOI-1259Ab: A Warm Jupiter Orbiting a K-dwarf White-Dwarf Binary is on a Well-aligned Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of one member of a stellar binary into a white dwarf has been proposed as a mechanism that triggers the formation of close-in gas giant planets. The star's asymmetric mass loss during the AGB stage gives it a "kick" that can initiate Eccentric Lidov-Kozai oscillations, potentially causing a planet around the secondary star to migrate inwards and perturbing the eccentricity and inclination of its orbit. Here we present a measurement of the stellar obliquity of TOI-1259Ab, a gas giant in a close-in orbit around a K star with a white dwarf companion about 1650 au away. By using the NEID spectrograph to detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during the planetary transit, we find the sky-projected obliquity to be $\lambda = 6^{+21}_{-22}\,^\circ$. When combined with estimates of the stellar rotation period, radius, and projected rotation velocity, we find the true 3D obliquity to be $\psi = 24^{+14}_{-12}\,^\circ$ ($\psi &lt; 48^\circ$ at 95% confidence), revealing that the orbit of TOI-1259Ab is well aligned with the star's equatorial plane. Because the planet's orbit is too wide for tidal realignment to be expected, TOI-1259Ab might have formed quiescently in this well-aligned configuration. Alternatively, as we show with dynamical simulations, Eccentric Lidov-Kozai oscillations triggered by the evolution of the binary companion are expected to lead to a low obliquity with a probability of about $\sim$14%.</description>

      <title>The JWST Weather Report: retrieving temperature variations, auroral heating, and static cloud coverage on SIMP-0136</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SIMP-0136 is a T2.5 brown dwarf whose young age ($200\pm50$~Myr) and low mass ($15\pm3$~M$_{\rm Jup}$) make it an ideal analogue for the directly imaged exoplanet population. With a 2.4 hour period, it is known to be variable in both the infrared and the radio, which has been attributed to changes in the cloud coverage and the presence of an aurora respectively. To quantify the changes in the atmospheric state that drive this variability, we obtained time-series spectra of SIMP-0136 covering one full rotation with both NIRSpec/PRISM and the MIRI/LRS on board JWST. We performed a series of time-resolved atmospheric retrievals using petitRADTRANS in order to measure changes in the temperature structure, chemistry, and cloudiness. We inferred the presence of a ~250 K thermal inversion above 10 mbar of SIMP-0136 at all phases, and propose that this inversion is due to the deposition of energy into the upper atmosphere by an aurora. Statistical tests were performed in order to determine which parameters drive the observed spectroscopic variability. The primary contribution was due to changes in the temperature profile at pressures deeper than 10 mbar, which resulted in variation of the effective temperature from 1243 K to 1248 K. This changing effective temperature was also correlated to observed changes in the abundances of CO2 and H2S, while all other chemical species were consistent with being homogeneous throughout the atmosphere. Patchy silicate clouds were required to fit the observed spectra, but the cloud properties were not found to systematically vary with longitude. This work paints a portrait of an L/T transition object where the primary variability mechanisms are magnetic and thermodynamic in nature, rather than due to inhomogeneous cloud coverage.</description>

      <title>Planets larger than Neptune have elevated eccentricities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NASA's Kepler mission identified over 4000 extrasolar planets that transit (cross in front of) their host stars. This sample has revealed detailed features in the demographics of planet sizes and orbital spacings. However, knowledge of their orbital shapes - a key tracer of planetary formation and evolution - remains far more limited. We present measurements of eccentricities for 1646 Kepler planets, 92% of which are smaller than Neptune. For all planet sizes, the eccentricity distribution peaks at e=0 and falls monotonically toward zero at e=1. As planet size increases, mean population eccentricity rises from $\langle e \rangle = 0.05 \pm 0.01$ for small planets to $\langle e \rangle = 0.20 \pm 0.03$ for planets larger than $\sim$ 3.5 Earth-radii. The overall planet occurrence rate and planet-metallicity correlation also change abruptly at this size. Taken together, these patterns indicate distinct formation channels for planets above and below $\sim$ 3.5 Earth-radii. We also find size dependent associations between eccentricity, host star metallicity, and orbital period. While smaller planets generally have low eccentricities, there are hints of a noteworthy exception: eccentricities are slightly elevated in the ``radius valley,'' a narrow band of low occurrence rate density which separates rocky ``super-Earths'' (1.0-1.5 Earth-radii) from gas-rich ``sub-Neptunes'' (2.0-3.0 Earth-radii. We detect this feature at $2.1\sigma$ significance. Planets in single- and multi-transiting systems exhibit the same size-eccentricity relationship, suggesting they are drawn from the same parent population.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Atmospheric Escape Observations with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07124</link>

Abstract: The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 highlights the importance of advancing research focused on discovering and characterizing habitable worlds. In line with this priority, our goal is to investigate how planetary systems evolve through atmospheric escape and to develop methods for identifying potentially Earth-like planets. By leveraging the ultraviolet (UV) capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), we can use transit spectroscopy to observe atmospheric escape in exoplanets and explore the processes that shape their evolution, assess the ability of small planets to retain their atmospheres, and search for signs of Earth-like atmospheres. To achieve this, we support the development of a UV spectrograph with moderate- to high-resolution capabilities for point-source observations, coverage of key spectral features in the 100-300 nm range, and detectors that can register high count rates reliably. This article is an adaptation of a science case document developed for the Characterizing Exoplanets Steering Committee within HWO's Solar Systems in Context Working Group.</description>

      <title>Assessing Ocean World Habitability with HWO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The instrument payload of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will span a wide range of wavelengths, including the ultraviolet (UV) region that cannot be easily accessed from the ground (&lt; 350 nm). Along with its primary mission to characterize the habitability of candidate exo-Earths, HWO will be well suited for observations of potentially habitable icy ocean worlds in our Solar System, in particular with an integral field spectrograph (IFS). Here, we discuss future HWO observations of ocean worlds including Ceres, Europa, Enceladus, Ariel, and Triton. We explore the observational requirements for capturing ongoing and sporadic geyser activity and for measuring the spectral signatures of astrobiologically-relevant compounds, including water, salts, organics, and other bioessential components. We consider the key observing requirements for an IFS, including wavelength coverage, resolving power (R), angular resolution, and field-of-view (FOV). We also outline some of the potential measurements that would define incremental, substantial, and breakthrough progression for characterizing habitability at ocean worlds, primarily focusing on UV and visible (VIS) wavelengths (90 - 700 nm). Our investigation concludes that a UV/VIS IFS on HWO could make some groundbreaking discoveries, in particular for detection and long-term monitoring of geyser activity and interior-surface exchange of components critical for understanding habitability at ocean worlds.</description>

      <title>OWLS I: The Olin Wilson Legacy Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present initial results from a planned 10 year survey of Ca II H &amp; K emission, using observations made with the ARC 3.5m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory. The primary goal of the survey is to investigate activity cycles in low mass stars. The sample includes stars chosen from the legacy Mount Wilson survey carried out by Olin Wilson more than 50 years ago, together with newly identified planet-host stars and a select sample of early-mid M dwarfs. This paper presents the first four years of data, comprising 1040 observations of 271 stars, with a specific focus on K and M stars. We identify a subsample of 153 stars for continuing observations over the full 10 year survey. Early results indicate that our data are consistent with the MWO cycle periods over a time span of more than 50 years; that there is a bifurcation in activity in the late K range with separate populations of low and high activity stars at lower masses; and that M dwarf planet hosts tend to be mainly found in the population of low activity stars, even in the unbiased (by activity) TESS sample, potentially indicating a link between activity and planet formation. We have also found indications of possible cyclic variability in some of the lower mass stars in the sample. Our ultimate goal is to link the activity cycle and rotation periods in a robust sample of stars spanning FGKM spectral types and to investigate the implications for the underlying magnetic dynamo.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Disks Fed By Dense Collapsing Gravo-Magneto-Sheetlets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars form from the gravitational collapse of turbulent, magnetized molecular cloud cores. Our non-ideal MHD simulations reveal that the intrinsically anisotropic magnetic resistance to gravity during the core collapse naturally generates dense gravo-magneto-sheetlets within inner protostellar envelopes -- disrupted versions of classical sheet-like pseudodisks. They are embedded in a magnetically dominant background, where less dense materials flow along the local magnetic field lines and accumulate in the dense sheetlets. The sheetlets, which feed the disk predominantly through its upper and lower surfaces, are the primary channels for mass and angular momentum transfer from the envelope to the disk. The protostellar disk inherits a small fraction (up to 10\%) of the magnetic flux from the envelope, resulting in a disk-averaged net vertical field strength of 1-10 mG and a somewhat stronger toroidal field, potentially detectable through ALMA Zeeman observations. The inherited magnetic field from the envelope plays a dominant role in disk angular momentum evolution, enabling the formation of gravitationally stable disks in cases where the disk field is relatively well-coupled to the gas. Its influence remains significant even in marginally gravitationally unstable disks formed in the more magnetically diffusive cases, removing angular momentum at a rate comparable to or greater than that caused by spiral arms. The magnetically driven disk evolution is consistent with the apparent scarcity of prominent spirals capable of driving rapid accretion in deeply embedded protostellar disks. The dense gravo-magneto-sheetlets observed in our simulations may correspond to the ``accretion streamers" increasingly detected around protostars.</description>

      <title>He awa whiria: the tidal streams of interstellar objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys are likely to discover a new sample of interstellar objects (ISOs) within the Solar System, but questions remain about the origin and distribution of this population within the Galaxy. ISOs are ejected from their host systems with a range of velocities, spreading out into tidal streams - analogous to the stellar streams routinely observed from the disruption of star clusters and dwarf galaxies. We create a simulation of ISO streams orbiting in the Galaxy, deriving a simple model for their density distribution over time. We then construct a population model to predict the properties of the streams in which the Sun is currently embedded. We find that the number of streams encountered by the Sun is quite large, ~ 10^6 or more. However, the wide range of stream properties means that for reasonable future samples of ISOs observed in the Solar System, we may see ISOs from the same star ("siblings"), and we are likely to see ISOs from the same star cluster ("cousins"). We also find that ISOs are typically not traceable to their parent star, though this may be possible for ISO siblings. Any ISOs observed with a common origin will come from younger, dynamically colder streams.</description>

      <title>Angular Momentum Drain: Despinning Embedded Planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Young and forming planetesimals experience impacts from particles present in a protostellar disk. Using crater scaling laws, we integrate ejecta distributions for oblique impacts. For impacts at 10 to 65 m/s, expected for impacts associated with a disk wind, we estimate the erosion rate and torque exerted on the planetesimal. We find that the mechanism for angular momentum drain proposed by Dobrovolskis and Burns (1984) for asteroids could operate in the low velocity regime of a disk wind. Though spin-down associated with impacts can facilitate planetesimal collapse, we find that the process is inefficient. We find that angular momentum drain via impacts operates in the gravitational focusing regime. The angular momentum transfer is most effective when the wind speed is high, the projectile density is high compared to the bulk planetesimal density, and the planetesimal is sufficiently weak that cratering is in the gravity regime. We find that angular momentum drain due to impacts within a pebble cloud may, in those specific conditions, facilitate collapse of single planetesimals.</description>

      <title>Uniform Reanalysis of JWST MIRI 15{\mu}m Exoplanet Eclipse Observations using Frame-Normalized Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST MIRI 15 micron time-series eclipse photometry presents a powerful way to probe for the presence of atmospheres on low-temperature rocky exoplanets orbiting nearby stars. Here, we introduce a novel technique, frame-normalized principal component analysis (FN-PCA) to analyze and detrend these MIRI time-series observations. Using the FN-PCA technique, we perform a uniform reanalysis of the published MIRI 15 micron observations of LHS 1478 b, TOI-1468 b, LHS 1140 c, TRAPPIST-1 b, and TRAPPIST-1 c using our new data reduction pipeline (Erebus) and compare them to different potential atmospheric and surface compositions. We also investigate additional public data sets with the sole purpose of understanding the instrument systematics affecting MIRI. We identify and categorize important detector-level systematics in the observations that are generally present across all 17 analyzed eclipse observations, which we illustrate as eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs in the FN-PCA. One of these eigenimage/eigenvalue pairs corresponds to the prominent ramp effect at the beginning of the time-series observations which has widely been reported for JWST and Spitzer photometry. For JWST/MIRI, we show that the detector settling time scales exponentially with the apparent magnitude of the target star $T_\mathrm{set} \mathrm{[hours]} = 0.063\exp^{0.427\cdot m_K} -0.657$. This uniform reanalysis and investigation of JWST/MIRI systematics is done in preparation for the 500 hour Rocky Worlds DDT survey, to demonstrate a data-driven systematic model usable across all MIRI 15 micron datasets.</description>

      <title>Snapshot of a new interstellar comet: 3I/ATLAS has a red and featureless spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS is only the third interstellar object to be discovered. Pre-perihelion measurements provide a unique opportunity to study its activity and composition, which may alter as it is heated in the coming months. We provide an initial baseline from optical spectroscopic observations obtained only two days after discovery, using the MUSE instrument on the VLT on 2025 July 3, while 3I was at 4.47 au from the Sun and 3.46 au from the Earth. These observations confirm the cometary nature of 3I, and reveal a red coma with a spectral slope of $(18\pm4)\%/1000$~\AA, redder than most Solar System comets but similar to the surface colour of some Solar System Trans-Neptunian Objects or Centaurs. We searched for but did not detect gas emission from C$_2$, NH$_2$, CN, and [OI], which is consistent with volatile non-detections for Solar System comets at this heliocentric distance. At present, the coma appears entirely dusty. Future observations of 3I as it comes closer to the Sun will provide an invaluable opportunity to witness the evolution of its activity, study its composition, test predictions of interstellar object population models, and compare 3I to Solar System comets.</description>

      <title>SHAPE -- A Spectro-Polarimeter Onboard Propulsion Module of Chandrayaan-3 Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SHAPE (Spectro-polarimetry of HAbitable Planet Earth) is an experiment onboard the Chandrayaan-3 Mission, designed to study the spectro-polarimetric signatures of the habitable planet Earth in the near-infrared (NIR) wavelength range (1.0 - 1.7 $\mu$m). The spectro-polarimeter is the only scientific payload (experimental in nature) on the Propulsion Module (PM) of the Chandrayaan-3 mission. The instrument is a compact and lightweight spectro-polarimeter with an Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter (AOTF) at its core. The AOTF operates in the frequency range of 80 MHz to 135 MHz with a power of 0.5 - 2.0 Watts. The two output beams (e-beam and o-beam) from the AOTF are focused onto two InGaAs detectors (pixelated, 1D linear array) with the help of focusing optics. The primary (aperture) optics, with a diameter of $\sim$2 mm, collects the NIR light for input to the AOTF, defining the field of view (FOV) of 2.6$^\circ$. The payload has a mass of 4.8 kg and operates at a power of 25 Watts. This manuscript highlights some of the ground-based results, including the post-launch initial performance of the payload while orbiting around the Moon to observe Earth.</description>

      <title>Symmetric instability in a Boussinesq fluid on a rotating planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetric instability has broad applications in geophysical and planetary fluid dynamics. It plays a crucial role in the formation of mesoscale rainbands at mid-latitudes on Earth, instability in the ocean's mixed layer, and slantwise convection on gas giants and icy moon oceans. Here, we apply linear instability analysis to an arbitrary zonally symmetric Boussinesq flow on a rotating spherical planet, with applicability to icy moon oceans. We divide the instabilities into three types: (1) gravitational instability, occurring when stratification is unstable along angular momentum surfaces, (2) inertial instability, occurring when angular momentum shear is unstable along buoyancy surfaces, and (3) a mixed symmetric instability, occurring when neither of the previous conditions are fulfilled, but the potential vorticity has the opposite sign to planetary rotation. We note that $N^2&lt;0$ where $N$ is the Brunt--V\"ais\"al\"a frequency -- a typical criterion used to trigger convective adjustment in global ocean models -- is neither necessary nor sufficient for instability. Instead, $b_z \sin{\theta_0}&lt;0$, where $b_z$ is the stratification along the planetary rotation axis and $\theta_0$ is the local latitude, is always sufficient for instability and also necessary in the low Rossby number limit. In this limit, relevant for deep convection in icy moon oceans, the most unstable mode is slantwise convection parallel to the planetary rotation axis. This slantwise convection differs from the parameterized convection in existing general circulation models, whose convection schemes parameterize convection in the direction of gravity. Our results suggest that convection schemes in global ocean models must be revised before being applied to icy moon oceans.</description>

      <title>Plasma refilling of the lunar wake: plasma-vacuum interactions, electrostatic shocks, and electromagnetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plasma void forms downstream of the Moon when the solar wind impacts the lunar surface. This void gradually refills as the solar wind passes by, forming the lunar wake. We investigate this refilling process using a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The early stage of refilling follows plasma-vacuum interaction theory, characterized by exponential decay of plasma density into the wake, along with ion acceleration and cooling in the expansion direction. Our PIC simulation confirms these theoretical predictions. In the next stage of the refilling process, the counter-streaming supersonic ion beams collide, generating Debye-scale electrostatic shocks at the wake's center. These shocks decelerate and thermalize the ion beams while heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions along magnetic field lines. Additionally, fast magnetosonic waves undergo convective growth via anomalous cyclotron resonance as they co-propagate with temperature-anisotropic ion beams toward the wake's center. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves may also be excited through normal cyclotron resonance, counter-propagating with these anisotropic ion beams. Our findings provide new insights into the kinetic aspects of lunar wake refilling and may enhance interpretation of spacecraft observations.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. II. Unravelling lithium depletion and stellar motion: Intrinsic stellar properties drive depletion, not kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Paper I, we classified a stellar sample from the thin disc with a broad range in metallicity as being churned outward or inward, or blurred/undisturbed. In this paper (Paper II), we delve deeper by analysing our entire metallicity-stratified sample along with their dynamic properties, focusing on the connection between radial migration and Li depletion. We analyse the chemo-dynamics of a set of 1188 thin disc dwarf stars observed by the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey, previously classified into six metallicity-stratified groups via Hierarchical Clustering (HC). We examine several features, such as effective temperatures, masses, and dynamic properties. We also implement a parametric survival analysis using penalised splines (logistic distribution) to quantify how stellar properties and motion (or migration) direction jointly influence Li depletion patterns. We find that stars in our sample that appear to have churned outward are predominantly Li-depleted, regardless of their metallicities. These stars are also the oldest, coldest, and least massive compared to those in the same HC group that have either churned inward or kept their orbital radii. Our survival analysis confirms temperature as the primary driver of Li depletion, followed by metallicity and age, while migration direction shows negligible influence. The increasing proportion of outward-churned stars with higher metallicity (and older ages) indicates their dominant influence on the overall trend observed in the [Fe/H]-A(Li) space for stellar groups with [Fe/H]&gt;0. The survival model reinforces that the observed Li depletion stems primarily from intrinsic stellar properties (cool temperatures, higher metallicity, old ages) rather than migration history. This suggests the metallicity-dependent depletion pattern emerges through stellar evolution rather than Galactic dynamical processes.</description>
