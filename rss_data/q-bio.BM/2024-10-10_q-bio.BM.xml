      <title>Dumpling GNN: Hybrid GNN Enables Better ADC Payload Activity Prediction Based on Chemical Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have emerged as a promising class of targeted cancer therapeutics, but the design and optimization of their cytotoxic payloads remain challenging. This study introduces DumplingGNN, a novel hybrid Graph Neural Network architecture specifically designed for predicting ADC payload activity based on chemical structure. By integrating Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and GraphSAGE layers, DumplingGNN effectively captures multi-scale molecular features and leverages both 2D topological and 3D structural information. We evaluate DumplingGNN on a comprehensive ADC payload dataset focusing on DNA Topoisomerase I inhibitors, as well as on multiple public benchmarks from MoleculeNet. DumplingGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including BBBP (96.4\% ROC-AUC), ToxCast (78.2\% ROC-AUC), and PCBA (88.87\% ROC-AUC). On our specialized ADC payload dataset, it demonstrates exceptional accuracy (91.48\%), sensitivity (95.08\%), and specificity (97.54\%). Ablation studies confirm the synergistic effects of the hybrid architecture and the critical role of 3D structural information in enhancing predictive accuracy. The model's strong interpretability, enabled by attention mechanisms, provides valuable insights into structure-activity relationships. DumplingGNN represents a significant advancement in molecular property prediction, with particular promise for accelerating the design and optimization of ADC payloads in targeted cancer therapy development.</description>

      <title>E3STO: Orbital Inspired SE(3)-Equivariant Molecular Representation for Electron Density Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron density prediction stands as a cornerstone challenge in molecular systems, pivotal for various applications such as understanding molecular interactions and conducting precise quantum mechanical calculations. However, the scaling of density functional theory (DFT) calculations is prohibitively expensive. Machine learning methods provide an alternative, offering efficiency and accuracy. We introduce a novel SE(3)-equivariant architecture, drawing inspiration from Slater-Type Orbitals (STO), to learn representations of molecular electronic structures. Our approach offers an alternative functional form for learned orbital-like molecular representation. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by achieving SOTA prediction accuracy of molecular electron density with 30-70\% improvement over other work on Molecular Dynamics data.</description>

      <title>Full-Atom Peptide Design with Geometric Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Peptide design plays a pivotal role in therapeutics, allowing brand new possibility to leverage target binding sites that are previously undruggable. Most existing methods are either inefficient or only concerned with the target-agnostic design of 1D sequences. In this paper, we propose a generative model for full-atom \textbf{Pep}tide design with \textbf{G}eometric \textbf{LA}tent \textbf{D}iffusion (PepGLAD) given the binding site. We first establish a benchmark consisting of both 1D sequences and 3D structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB) and literature for systematic evaluation. We then identify two major challenges of leveraging current diffusion-based models for peptide design: the full-atom geometry and the variable binding geometry. To tackle the first challenge, PepGLAD derives a variational autoencoder that first encodes full-atom residues of variable size into fixed-dimensional latent representations, and then decodes back to the residue space after conducting the diffusion process in the latent space. For the second issue, PepGLAD explores a receptor-specific affine transformation to convert the 3D coordinates into a shared standard space, enabling better generalization ability across different binding shapes. Experimental Results show that our method not only improves diversity and binding affinity significantly in the task of sequence-structure co-design, but also excels at recovering reference structures for binding conformation generation.</description>

      <title>FusionDTI: Fine-grained Binding Discovery with Token-level Fusion for Drug-Target Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug-target interaction (DTI) is critical in the drug discovery process. Despite remarkable advances in recent DTI models through the integration of representations from diverse drug and target encoders, such models often struggle to capture the fine-grained interactions between drugs and protein, i.e. the binding of specific drug atoms (or substructures) and key amino acids of proteins, which is crucial for understanding the binding mechanisms and optimising drug design. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel model, called FusionDTI, which uses a token-level Fusion module to effectively learn fine-grained information for Drug-Target Interaction. In particular, our FusionDTI model uses the SELFIES representation of drugs to mitigate sequence fragment invalidation and incorporates the structure-aware (SA) vocabulary of target proteins to address the limitation of amino acid sequences in structural information, additionally leveraging pre-trained language models extensively trained on large-scale biomedical datasets as encoders to capture the complex information of drugs and targets. Experiments on three well-known benchmark datasets show that our proposed FusionDTI model achieves the best performance in DTI prediction compared with seven existing state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, our case study indicates that FusionDTI could highlight the potential binding sites, enhancing the explainability of the DTI prediction.</description>

      <title>Structure-Enhanced Protein Instruction Tuning: Towards General-Purpose Protein Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proteins, as essential biomolecules, play a central role in biological processes, including metabolic reactions and DNA replication. Accurate prediction of their properties and functions is crucial in biological applications. Recent development of protein language models (pLMs) with supervised fine tuning provides a promising solution to this problem. However, the fine-tuned model is tailored for particular downstream prediction task, and achieving general-purpose protein understanding remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Structure-Enhanced Protein Instruction Tuning (SEPIT) framework to bridge this gap. Our approach integrates a noval structure-aware module into pLMs to inform them with structural knowledge, and then connects these enhanced pLMs to large language models (LLMs) to generate understanding of proteins. In this framework, we propose a novel two-stage instruction tuning pipeline that first establishes a basic understanding of proteins through caption-based instructions and then refines this understanding using a mixture of experts (MoEs) to learn more complex properties and functional information with the same amount of activated parameters. Moreover, we construct the largest and most comprehensive protein instruction dataset to date, which allows us to train and evaluate the general-purpose protein understanding model. Extensive experimental results on open-ended generation and closed-set answer tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SEPIT over both closed-source general LLMs and open-source LLMs trained with protein knowledge.</description>
