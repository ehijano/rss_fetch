      <title>Oscillation Quenching Induced By Time-Varying Coupling Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oscillatory dynamics of natural and man-made systems can be disrupted by their time-varying interactions, leading to oscillation quenching phenomena in which the oscillations are suppressed. We introduce a framework for analyzing, assessing, and controlling oscillation quenching using coupling functions. Specifically, by observing limit-cycle oscillators we investigate the bifurcations and dynamical transitions induced by time-varying diffusive and periodic coupling functions. We studied the transitions between oscillation quenching states induced by the time-varying form of the coupling function while the coupling strength is kept invariant. The time-varying periodic coupling function allowed us to identify novel, non-trivial inhomogeneous states that have not been reported previously. Furthermore, by using dynamical Bayesian inference we have also developed a Proportional Integral (PI) controller that maintains the oscillations and \red{prevents oscillation quenching from occurring}. In addition to the present implementation and its generalizations, the framework carries broader implications for identification and control of oscillation quenching in a wide range of systems subjected to time-varying interactions.</description>

      <title>Universal Routing of Light via Optical Thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: Understanding and exploiting the dynamics of complex nonlinear systems is nowadays at the core of a broad range of scientific and technological endeavors. Within the optical domain, light evolution in a nonlinear multimode environment presents a formidable problem, as its chaotic evolution often hinders predictive insights. Recently, an optical thermodynamic framework has been put forward that, in a systematic manner, can not only predict but also harness the intricate behavior of these systems. In this work, by deploying entropic principles, we demonstrate a counterintuitive optical process in which light, launched into any input port of a judiciously designed nonlinear array, universally channels into a tightly localized ground state, a response that is completely unattainable in linear conservative arrangements. This phenomenon arises from the interplay between lattice structure and the way the kinetic and nonlinear Hamiltonian components unfold, leading to two optical thermal processes: a Joule-Thomson-like expansion followed by mode thermalization. Experimentally, this effect is demonstrated in properly configured nonlinear time-synthetic mesh lattices, where the optical temperature approaches near zero, causing light to condense at a single spot, regardless of the initial excitation position. The effect demonstrated here opens new avenues for applying the principles of optical thermodynamics in realizing novel optical functionalities, such as all-optical beam steering, multiplexing, and nonlinear beam shaping in high-power regimes, while also offering a greater understanding of the remarkable physics of light-matter interactions in multimode nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>ReLaX-Net: Reusing Layers for Parameter-Efficient Physical Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical Neural Networks (PNN) are promising platforms for next-generation computing systems. However, recent advances in digital neural network performance are largely driven by the rapid growth in the number of trainable parameters and, so far, demonstrated PNNs are lagging behind by several orders of magnitude in terms of scale. This mirrors size and performance constraints found in early digital neural networks. In that period, efficient reuse of parameters contributed to the development of parameter-efficient architectures such as convolutional neural networks.
  In this work, we numerically investigate hardware-friendly weight-tying for PNNs. Crucially, with many PNN systems, there is a time-scale separation between the fast dynamic active elements of the forward pass and the only slowly trainable elements implementing weights and biases. With this in mind,we propose the Reuse of Layers for eXpanding a Neural Network (ReLaX-Net) architecture, which employs a simple layer-by-layer time-multiplexing scheme to increase the effective network depth and efficiently use the number of parameters. We only require the addition of fast switches for existing PNNs. We validate ReLaX-Nets via numerical experiments on image classification and natural language processing tasks. Our results show that ReLaX-Net improves computational performance with only minor modifications to a conventional PNN. We observe a favorable scaling, where ReLaX-Nets exceed the performance of equivalent traditional RNNs or DNNs with the same number of parameters.</description>
