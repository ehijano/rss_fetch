      <title>Dirac-Schwinger Quantization for Emergent Magnetic Monopoles?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Refs.[1-4] Dirac and Schwinger showed the existence of a magnetic monopole required a charge quantization condition which we write following Dirac as $\frac{eg}{4\pi\hbar}=\frac{n}{2},\; n=0,\pm 1,\; \pm 2, \ldots$. Here, $g$ is the magnetic monopole charge and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron. Recently, in Refs. [5,6], it has been shown experimentally that frustrated spin-ice systems exhibit 'emergent' magnetic monopoles. We show that, within the experimental errors, the respective magnetic charges obey the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition. Possible implications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Rotational magnetoelastic interactions in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya magnet Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetoelastic properties of a Ba$_2$CuGe$_2$O$_7$ single crystal at low temperatures under a magnetic field applied along the crystallographic [001] axis. Our results extend to low temperature the $H-T$ phase diagram determined for this compound by neutron scattering. Furthermore, we observe that specific elastic modes are better sensitive to the various magnetic transitions. In particular, we observe an unusual coupling between the in-plane transverse acoustic mode and the cycloidal order at low field, which suggests a novel spin-strain mechanism originating from Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in this compound.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz transition and triplet $p$-wave pairing from the induced ferromagnetic plaquette via spin differentiated nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional extended Hubbard model on a square lattice and incorporate spin-differentiated nearest neighbor (NN) interactions where the equal-spin ($V_{uu}$) and unequal-spin ($V_{ud}$) terms are independently tuned parameters. We compute single-particle excitations as well as static spin and pairing susceptibilities perturbatively up to the fourth order within the thermodynamic limit and at a finite fixed temperature. By explicitly encoding a ferromagnetic-like NN interaction ($V_{uu} &lt; V_{ud}$), we induce a competition among the uniform $q = (0,0)$, collinear $q = (\pi,0)$, and staggered $q = (\pi,\pi)$ spin excitations. This results in the formation of short-ranged $2\times 2$ ferromagnetic plaquettes arranged in staggered or striped patterns. Kinetic frustration in hopping, both within and between these plaquettes, manifests in single-particle properties, resulting in a reduction of bandwidth and ultimately triggering a Lifshitz transition to quasi-one-dimensional bands. Furthermore, an attractive effective interaction within the localized ferromagnetic plaquette results in the emergence of equal-spin triplet $p$-wave pairing. We demonstrate that sufficiently strong magnetic fluctuations, even at finite length scales, can significantly influence single-particle and pairing properties without breaking translational symmetry. Our approach provides a novel pathway to realize a variety of rich magnetic phases and Fermi surface reconstruction driven by interactions in the absence of explicit geometric frustration.</description>

      <title>Time-domain study of coupled collective excitations in quantum materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that are often traced to a complex interplay among different microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulating the dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper, we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>Polymorphism and Magnetism in a Kitaev Honeycomb Cobaltate KCoAsO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetic properties of a new Kitaev honeycomb cobaltate, KCoAsO$_4$, which crystallizes in two distinct forms: $P2/c$ and $R\bar{3}$ space groups. Magnetic measurements reveal ordering temperatures of $\sim$14 K for the $P2/c$ structure and $\sim$10.5 K for the $R\bar{3}$ structure. The $P2/c$-type KCoAsO$_4$ sample exhibits a complex temperature-field phase diagram, including a field-induced phase, while the $R\bar{3}$-type KCoAsO$_4$ shows a simpler phase diagram with a single magnetically ordered phase. The observed differences in magnetic properties are attributed to subtle structural variations, strongly suggesting that local structural changes play a crucial role in determining the magnetism of cobaltate-based Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Magnetism and electronic dynamics in $CuCr_{2-x}Sn_xS_4$ spinels studied by transferred hyperfine fields at $^{119}Sn$ and muon spin rotation and relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated magnetization, muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR), and $^{119}Sn$ M\"{o}ssbauer spectroscopy on Sn substituted $CuCr_{2-x}Sn_xS_4$ (x=0.03 and 0.08) spinel compounds. The magnetization and $\mu$SR results reveal similar additional low-temperature magnetic transitions around 80 K and 40 K as found for the undoped material, indicating a magnetic ground state deviating from a simple collinear ferromagnet. The observed changes in the M\"{o}ssbauer hyperfine spectra are less pronounced and are discussed in view of the different positions of the local probes $\mu^+$ and $^{119}Sn$ and their different magnetic coupling to the magnetic Cr lattice. Above 80 K, both $\mu$SR and M\"{o}ssbauer spectra show temperature-dependent inhomogeneous broadening either due to structural or charge disorder and changing spin dynamics that can be related to a precursor magnetic phase above the well-defined static low-temperature phase.</description>

      <title>Correlation between Complex Spin Textures and the Magnetocaloric and Hall Effects in Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ ($x$ = 0.9, 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the electronic phase diagram of a quantum material as a function of temperature (T) and applied magnetic field (H) forms the basis for understanding the microscopic origin of transport properties, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and topological Hall effect (THE). For many magnetic quantum materials, including EuAl$_4$, a THE arises from a topologically protected magnetic skyrmion lattice with a non-zero scalar spin chirality. We identified a square skyrmion lattice (sSkL) peak in Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ ($x$ = 0.9) identical to the peak previously observed in EuAl$_4$ by performing neutron scattering measurements throughout the phase diagram. Comparing these neutron results with transport measurements, we found that in both compounds the maximal THE does not correspond to the sSkL area. Instead of the maximal THE, the maximal magnetocaloric effect (MCE) boundaries better identify the sSkL lattice phase observed by neutron scattering measurements. The maximal THE therefore arises from interactions of itinerant electrons with frustrated spin fluctuations in a topologically trivial magnetic state.</description>

      <title>Evidences for local non-centrosymmetricity and strong phonon anomaly in EuCu2As2: A Raman spectroscopy and lattice dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon modes and their association with the electronic states have been investigated for the metallic EuCu$_{2}$As$_{2}$ system. In this work, we present the Raman spectra of this pnictide system which clearly shows the presence of seven well defined peaks above $100$~cm$^{-1}$ that is consistent with the locally non-centrosymmetric {\it P4/nmm} crystal structure, contrary to that what is expected from the accepted symmorphic {\it I4/mmm} structure. Lattice dynamics calculations using the {\it P4/nmm} symmetry attest that there is a commendable agreement between the calculated phonon spectra at the $\Gamma$ point and the observed Raman mode frequencies, with the most intense peak at $\sim 232$~cm$^{-1}$ being ascribed to the A$_{1g}$ mode. Temperature dependent Raman measurements show that there is a significant deviation from the expected anharmonic behaviour around $165$~K for the A$_{1g}$ mode, with anomalies being observed for several other modes as well, although to a lesser extent. Attempts are made to rationalize the observed anomalous behavior related to the hardening of the phonon modes, with parallels being drawn from metal dichalcogenide and allied systems. Similarities in the evolution of the Raman peak frequencies with temperature seem to suggest a strong signature of a subtle electronic density wave instability below $165$~K in this compound.</description>

      <title>Real-frequency TPSC+DMFT investigation of the square-lattice Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional Hubbard model using a real-frequency implementation of the TPSC+DMFT approach. This hybrid method combines the nonlocal correlations captured by the Two-Particle Self-Consistent (TPSC) approach with the local dynamical correlations of Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). The results demonstrate that TPSC+DMFT effectively describes pseudogap physics and nonlocal fluctuations in the moderately correlated regime, while also reproducing the Mott insulating state at larger interaction strengths. For doped Mott insulators, we find that TPSC+DMFT captures the evolution of Fermi pockets into Fermi arcs, consistent with the results from cluster DMFT and photoemission studies. These findings highlight the capability of TPSC+DMFT to bridge the gap between weak and strong coupling physics in Hubbard models, providing insights into spin and charge fluctuations, as well as their role in the pseudogap formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf insulators represent an exceptional class of topological matter unanticipated by the periodic table of topological invariants. These systems point to the existence of previously unexplored states of matter with unconventional topology. In this work, we take a step toward exploring this direction by investigating correlation-driven instabilities of Hopf insulators. Organizing our analysis around the topological quantum critical point that separates the Hopf insulating phase from a trivial insulator, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional Weyl semimetallic and topological insulating states. Notably, the Weyl semimetal supports non-reciprocal superconductivity and a Bogoliubov-Fermi surface, potentially providing a novel framework for realizing the superconducting diode effect. Finally, we highlight the interconnectedness of the effective descriptions of correlated Hopf insulators, two-dimensional quadratic band-touching semimetals, and Luttinger semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manipulation of electronic structure through periodic electric fields enables the reversible control of effective interactions in extended antiferromagnetic Mott insulators on ultrafast timescales. A careful analytical examination of the modulated effective interactions is conducted, accurately characterising it through the use of exact summation formulas and Bessel functions. As a result, time reversals are analytically determined in terms of Bessel zeroes. We discuss the half-filled Hubbard model, as well as multi-orbital models, various characteristics of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, and the emergence of chiral spin terms.</description>

      <title>Twisted times, the Schwarzian and its deformations in DSSYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14238v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The IR dynamics of SYK is that of the Schwarzian theory, the effective theory of broken reparametrization invariance. In the double scaling limit, SYK is completely solvable by chord diagrams, whose generating functional is a bilocal Liouville theory. At low temperatures a set of modes in this description becomes soft. We interpret them as reparametrization of some twisted time coordinates, and show explicitly that they lead to the nonlinear Schwarzian theory. We further consider deformations of the theory in the double scaling limit, giving rise to diagrams with multiple species of chords, and show that the generating functional is now a Liouville theory with multiple fields. These deformations can be tracked to the IR and we discuss how they affect the Schwarzian.</description>

      <title>Topological Responses of the Standard Model Gauge Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Built upon the previous work on the 4d anomalies and 5d cobordism invariants (namely, 5d invertible field theory [iTFT] or symmetry-protected topological state [SPTs]) of the Standard Model [SM] gauge theory with compatible (SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1))/$\mathbb{Z}_q$ gauge group for $q=1,2,3,6$, we further enumerate lower-dimensional iTFT / SPTs in 4d, 3d, 2d, and 1d. While the 4d SPTs are interesting gapped phases attachable to the SM, those integer classes of SPTs (either the torsion or the free cobordism class) are not universal and are difficult to detect. However, fractional SPTs are more universal and can be detected by a topological response similar to the Hall conductance under an appropriate symmetry twist background field. We find a nontrivial symmetry-extension from a magnetic 1-symmetry U(1)$_{[1]}^m$ by an electric 1-symmetry $\mathbb{Z}_{6/q,[1]}^e$ introducing the $k \in \mathbb{Z}_{6/q}$ fractionalization class. While we also introduce the background fields for Baryon minus Lepton number $({\bf B}-{\bf L})$ like 0-symmetries of U(1)$_{{\bf Q} - N_c {\bf L}}$, U(1)$_X$, and $\mathbb{Z}_{4,X}$, that introduces two more data $\alpha \in 1,3$ and $\beta \in 1,5$ for the SMs. We present their Hall conductance response data (denoted as $\sigma, \sigma'$, and $\sigma''$ respectively), between 0-symmetry and 1-symmetry background fields, and show their fractional dependence on the SM data $(q,\alpha,\beta, k)$.</description>

      <title>Topological Leptogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the standard lore, the baryon asymmetry of the present universe is attributed to the leptogenesis from the sterile right-handed neutrino with heavy Majorana mass decaying into the Standard Model's leptons at the very early universe -- called the Majorana fermion's leptogenesis; while the electroweak sphaleron causes baryogenesis at a later time. In this work, we propose a new mechanism, named topological leptogenesis, to explain the lepton asymmetry. Topological leptogenesis replaces some of the sterile neutrinos by introducing a new gapped topological order sector (whose low-energy exhibits topological quantum field theory with long-range entanglement) that can cancel the baryon minus lepton $({\bf B} - {\bf L})$ mixed gauge-gravitational anomaly of the Standard Model. Then the Beyond-the-Standard-Model dark matter consists of topological quantum matter, such that the gapped non-particle excitations of extended line and surface defect with fractionalization and anyon charges can decay into the Standard Model particles. In addition, gravitational leptogenesis can be regarded as an intermediate step (between Majorana particle leptogenesis and topological non-particle leptogenesis) to mediate such decaying processes from the highly entangled gapped topological order excitations.</description>

      <title>Topological quantized edge-pumping-spin flip in Rice-Mele model with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantized Thouless pumping charge in a spinless Rice-Mele (RM) model originates from a degeneracy point in the parameter space and cannot be detected when open boundary conditions are applied. In this work, we investigate the topological features of a spinful Rice-Mele (RM) model. We demonstrate that spin-orbit coupling facilitates the transition of a single degenerate point into a degenerate loop, which is anticipated to be the source of the topological characteristics. When periodic boundary conditions are considered, we find that the pumping spin is zero for an adiabatic loop within the nodal loop and is 2 (in units of $\hbar /2$) for an adiabatic passage enclosing the nodal loop. When open boundary conditions are considered, the boundary-bulk correspondence is demonstrated by quantized pumping-spin flips at the edges, which can be obtained by completing double periods of a closed passage, rather than a single cycle. Our findings reveal an alternative dynamic manifestation of the boundary-bulk correspondence.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of the Fractal Hofstadter Energy Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hofstadter's butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter's butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter's butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants, such as those with moir\'e superlattices. Yet to-date, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy (STM / STS) to probe the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene near the predicted second magic angle, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter's spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moir\'e bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, displaying phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter's original model due to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions, and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Quasi-Periodically Driven Quantum Critical Systems: Analytical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study analytically the phase transitions in quasi-periodically driven one dimensional quantum critical systems that are described by conformal field theories (CFTs). The phase diagrams and phase transitions can be analytically obtained by using Avila's global theory in one-frequency quasiperiodic cocycles. Compared to the previous works where the quasiperiodicity was introduced in the driving time and no phase transitions were observed [1], here we propose a setup where the quasiperiodicity is introduced in the driving Hamiltonians. In our setup, one can observe the heating phases, non-heating phases, and the phase transitions. The phase diagram as well as the Lyapunov exponents that determine the entanglement entropy evolution can be analytically obtained. In addition, based on Avila's theory, we prove there is no phase transition in the previously proposed setup of quasi-periodically driven CFTs [1]. We verify our field theory results by studying the time evolution of entanglement entropy on lattice models.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the longitudinal exciton dispersion in hBN by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on the prototypical hexagonal boron nitride hBN layered compound. The RIXS results at the B and N K edges have been combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiments and ab initio calculations within the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation of many-body perturbation theory. By means of this tight interplay of different spectroscopies, the lowest longitudinal exciton of hBN has been identified. Moreover, its qualitatively different dispersions along the $\Gamma$K and the $\Gamma$M directions of the Brillouin zone have been determined. Our study advocates soft X-ray RIXS and EELS to be a promising combination to investigate electronic excitations in materials.</description>

      <title>Competition of superconducting pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Various theoretical approaches have been applied to the study of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7, but lead to a number of contradicting results. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and at the same time particularly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as changes of the electronic structure through pressure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. Our work paves the way to understanding seemingly contradictory theoretical results within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Interacting Systems with Fermionic Gaussian Circuits: Application to Quantum Impurity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor network quantum states are powerful tools for strongly correlated systems, tailored to capture local correlations such as in ground states with entanglement area laws. When applying tensor network states to interacting fermionic systems, a proper choice of the basis or orbitals can reduce the bond dimension of tensors and provide physically relevant orbitals. We introduce such a change of basis with unitary gates obtained from compressing fermionic Gaussian states into quantum circuits corresponding to various tensor networks. These circuits can reduce the ground state entanglement entropy and improve the performance of algorithms such as the density matrix renormalization group. We study the Anderson impurity model with one and two impurities to show the potential of the method for improving computational efficiency and interpreting impurity physics. Furthermore, fermionic Gaussian circuits can also suppress entanglement during the time evolution out of low-energy state. Last, we consider Gaussian multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (GMERA) circuits which compress fermionic Gaussian states hierarchically. The emergent coarse-grained physical models from these GMERA circuits are studied in terms of their entanglement properties and suitability for performing time evolution.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties and enhanced magnetocaloric effect in EuAl$_3$Si single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents systematic investigations into the growth and physical properties of EuAl$_3$Si single crystals, encompassing magnetic, transport, and thermodynamic analyses. EuAl$_3$Si undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at $T_C$ = 15 K. A significant reversible magnetocaloric effect was observed around $T_C$. Strikingly, with a small change of magnetic field 2 T, the maximum values of magnetic entropy change (13.4 J/kg K), refrigerant capacity (166 J/kg) and adiabatic temperature change (7.2 K) are found. These parameters respectively are 60%, 148% and 64% larger than those of the parent compound EuAl$_4$, and suggest EuAl$_3$Si as an excellent candidate for magnetic refrigeration applications near the temperature of liquid hydrogen. The possible mechanism for this enhancement is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01904v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of CrTe$_2$ within the density functional theory (DFT) approach in ferromagnetic phase and combination of DFT and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in paramagnetic phase. We show that few layer CrTe$_2$ possesses well formed local magnetic moments. In the single layer CrTe$_2$ we find antiferromagnetic exchange with 120\degree antiferromagnetic structure most preferable. In the bilayer and trilayer systems electronic correlations in DFT+DMFT approach yield ferromagnetic exchange interaction within each layer, but the interaction between the layers is antiferromagnetic, such that alternation of the direction of magnetization of the layers is expected. In bulk CrTe$_2$ we find the tendency to ferromagnetic order at low temperature, but with increase of temperature antiferromagnetic correlations between the layers dominate. Determination of the critical number of layers at which the interlayer antiferromagnetic order changes to the ferromagnetic one, likely requires consideration of the non-local Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful ansatz for variational quantum Monte Carlo studies of strongly-correlated systems. Here, we apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and autoregressive transformer neural networks to the Fermi-Hubbard and the (non-Hermitian) Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard models in one and two dimensions. In both cases, we observe that the convergence of the RNN ansatz is challenged when increasing the interaction strength. We present a physically-motivated and easy-to-implement strategy for improving the optimization, namely, by ramping of the model parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the autoregressive sampling property of both network architectures. For the Hatano-Nelson-Hubbard model, we identify convergence issues that stem from the autoregressive sampling scheme in combination with the non-Hermitian nature of the model. Our findings provide insights into the challenges of the NQS approach and make the first step towards exploring strongly-correlated electrons using this ansatz.</description>

      <title>Spin caloritronics as a probe of nonunitary superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconducting spintronics explores the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, sparking significant interest in nonunitary superconductors as a platform for novel magneto-superconducting phenomena. However, identifying nonunitary superconductors remains challenging. We demonstrate that spin current driven by thermal gradients sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. Spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space induces the superconducting spin Seebeck effect, where a spin current is generated along thermal gradients without a thermoelectric charge current. Notably, the nonvanishing superconducting spin Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity because it reflects the spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. At the same time, the spin-chirality of the condensate induces the spin-Nernst effect, where a spin current is generated perpendicular to thermal gradients in nonunitary superconductors. These spin caloritronics phenomena offer a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.</description>

      <title>Unbounded entropy production and violent fragmentation for repulsive-to-attractive interaction quench in long-range interacting systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of a one-dimensional Bose gas with long-range interactions that decay as $(\frac{1}{r^{\alpha}})$ $(0.5 &lt; \alpha &lt;4.0$). We investigate exotic dynamics when the interactions are suddenly switched from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive, a procedure known to generate super-Tonks-Girardeau gases in systems with contact interactions. We find that relaxation is achieved through a complex intermediate dynamics demonstrated by violent fragmentation and chaotic delocalization. We establish that the relaxed state exhibits classical gaseous characteristics and an asymptotic state associated with unbounded entropy production. The phase diagram shows an exponential boundary between the coherent (quantum) gas and the chaotic (classical) gas. We show the universality of the dynamics by also presenting analogous results for spinless fermions. Weaker quench protocols give a certain degree of control over the relaxation process and induce a slower initial entropy growth. Our study showcases the complex relaxation behavior of tunable long-range interacting systems that could be engineered in state-of-the-art experiments, e.g. in trapped ions or Rydberg atoms.</description>

Abstract: We present a JT gravity setup coupled with $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills fields in two dimensions that reveals the onset of a small black hole to large black hole phase transition at finite chemical potential(s). We identify these black hole solutions as topological defects in the thermodynamic phase space and calculate the associated topological numbers following the standard procedure. We confirm the robustness of our model by estimating perturbative corrections to the bulk free energy at an arbitrary order in the Yang-Mills coupling. We also construct the Schwarzian for the boundary theory using the 2D gravitational action in the bulk and comment on the dual SYK like model where similar observations can be made.</description>

Abstract: Conductor materials with good mechanical performance as well as high electrical- and thermal-conductivities are particularly important to break through the current bottle-neck limit ($\sim 100$ T) of pulsed magnets. Here we perform systematic studies on the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires, a promising candidate material for the new-generation pulsed magnets, by employing two independent ultrasonic techniques - resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and ultrasound pulse-echo experiments. Our RUS measurements manifest that the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires can be improved by an electroplastic drawing procedure as compared with the conventional cold drawing. We also take this chance to test the availability of our newly-built ultrasound pulse-echo facility at Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC, China), and the results suggest that the elastic performance of the electroplastically-drawn Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wire remains excellent without anomalous softening under extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-high magnetic field up to 50 T, nitrogen / helium cryogenic liquids.</description>

      <title>Statistics of systemwide correlations in the random-field XXZ chain: Importance of rare events in the many-body localized phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10325</link>

Abstract: Motivated by recent debates around the many-body localization (MBL) problem, and in particular its stability against systemwide resonances, we investigate long-distance spin-spin correlations across the phase diagram of the random-field XXZ model, with a particular focus on the strong disorder regime. Building on state-of-the-art shift-invert diagonalization techniques, we study the high-energy behavior of transverse and longitudinal correlation functions, computed at the largest possible distance, for a broad range of disorder and interaction strengths. Our results show that while transverse correlations display a fairly stable exponential decay over the entire XXZ phase diagram, longitudinal correlations exhibit markedly different behavior, revealing distinct physical regimes. More precisely, we identify an intermediate disorder region where standard observables show well-converged MBL behavior [J. Colbois et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 116502 (2024)] while the distributions of longitudinal correlations reveal unexpected fat-tails towards large values. These rare events strongly influence the average decay of longitudinal correlations, which we find to be algebraic in a broad region inside the supposed MBL phase, whereas the typical decay remains mostly exponential. At stronger disorder and weaker interactions, this intermediate regime is replaced by a more conventional exponential decay with short correlation lengths for both typical and average correlators, as expected for standard localization. Our findings shed light on the systemwide instabilities and raise important questions about the impact of such rare but large long-range correlations on the stability of the MBL phase. Finally, we discuss the possible fate of the intermediate region in the context of recent perspectives in the field.</description>

      <title>Theory of the spin Seebeck effect influenced by crystal-field excitations in Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is a phenomenon of thermoelectric generation that occurs within a device consisting of a bilayer of a metal and a ferromagnet. When Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) is substituted for the ferromagnet, the effect goes to zero at low temperatures, yet it increases to positive values with the application of a magnetic field. This is opposite to the expectation that the SSE should be suppressed by a magnetic field due to the increase in the magnon gap. In this paper, the crystal-field excitations (CFE) in TbIG are calculated within a mean field theory exploiting the parameters of Terbium Gallium Garnet Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (TGG) from the neutron-scattering experimental literature. Like TGG, the primitive cell of TbIG hosts twelve Tb sites with six inequivalent magnetic sublattices, but due to the net $[111]$-molecular field from the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe ions, these can be classified into two distinct groups, the $\mathbf{C}$ and the $\mathbf{C'}$ sites, which account for the `double umbrella' magnetic structure. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied along the [111] direction of the crystal, the lowest CFE of the $\mathbf{C}$ sublattices decreases. As a consequence of the magnetic field dependence of the lowest CFE, we find that at low temperatures the SSE in TbIG can result enhanced by an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}&lt;1 all the way to {\nu}&gt;6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</description>
