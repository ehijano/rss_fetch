      <title>Protein aggregation in Huntington's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of an expanded polyglutamine produces a toxic gain of function in huntingtin. Protein aggregation resulting from this gain of function is likely to be the cause of neuronal death. Two main mechanisms of aggregation have been proposed: hydrogen bonding by polar-zipper formation and covalent bonding by transglutaminase-catalyzed cross-linking. In cell culture models of Huntington's disease, aggregates are mostly stabilized by hydrogen bonds, but covalent bonds are also likely to occur. Nothing is known about the nature of the bonds that stabilize the aggregates in the brain of patients with Huntington's disease. It seems that the nature of the bond stabilizing the aggregates is one of the most important questions, as the answer would condition the therapeutic approach to Huntington's disease.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multimodal Protein Function Prediction Through Dual-Branch Dynamic Selection with Reconstructive Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal protein features play a crucial role in protein function prediction. However, these features encompass a wide range of information, ranging from structural data and sequence features to protein attributes and interaction networks, making it challenging to decipher their complex interconnections. In this work, we propose a multimodal protein function prediction method (DSRPGO) by utilizing dynamic selection and reconstructive pre-training mechanisms. To acquire complex protein information, we introduce reconstructive pre-training to mine more fine-grained information with low semantic levels. Moreover, we put forward the Bidirectional Interaction Module (BInM) to facilitate interactive learning among multimodal features. Additionally, to address the difficulty of hierarchical multi-label classification in this task, a Dynamic Selection Module (DSM) is designed to select the feature representation that is most conducive to current protein function prediction. Our proposed DSRPGO model improves significantly in BPO, MFO, and CCO on human datasets, thereby outperforming other benchmark models.</description>

      <title>FLOWR.root: A flow matching based foundation model for joint multi-purpose structure-aware 3D ligand generation and affinity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02578v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present FLOWR:root, an equivariant flow-matching model for pocket-aware 3D ligand generation with joint binding affinity prediction and confidence estimation. The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50, pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific adaptation. FLOWR:root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, FLOWR:root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2$\alpha$ ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ER$\alpha$, TYK2 and BACE1 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling, FLOWR:root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design spanning hit identification through lead optimization.</description>
