      <title>Curiosity Over Hype: Modeling Motivation Language to Understand Early Outcomes in a Selective Quantum Track</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether latent motivation signals in short Spanish admission responses predict engagement and performance in an early quantum computing pathway run by QuantumHub Peru. We analyze N=241 applicants' open responses and link them to outcomes from two selective modules: Module 1 (secondary; mathematics and computing foundations; n=23) and Module 2 (secondary + early undergraduate; quantum fundamentals; n=36, including M1 continuers). To ensure baseline comparability, the M2 university entrance exam matched the difficulty of the M1 final. Final grades followed the program's official cohort-specific weightings (attendance/assignments/exam), which we retain to preserve ecological validity. Methodologically, we model text with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA, k=8) and, for robustness, with sentence embeddings from a small multilingual language model, EmbeddingGemma-300M, projected via UMAP and clustered with HDBSCAN. This combination leverages the transparency of bag-of-words topics and the semantic richness of small language model embeddings. Descriptively, curiosity/learning topics show higher grades and attendance than technology/career-oriented topics; inferential tests are underpowered (e.g., linear R2 ~ 0.03; logistic pseudo-R2 ~ 0.04) so effect-size estimates should be viewed as preliminary rather than confirmatory. Embedding-based clustering yields seven clusters with 11.2% noise and modest agreement with LDA (ARI=0.068; NMI=0.163). Results suggest that brief motivation responses encode promising signals that could support early mentoring in rigorous STEM pipelines, while highlighting the need for larger, pre-registered studies.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>
