      <title>Types of Size-Dependent Melting in Fe Nanoclusters: a Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metallic nanoclusters are of interest in many fields because of their size-dependent catalytic activity. This activity can, in part, be influenced by their melting properties. In this work, the melting phase transitions of $Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $n \leq 100$ atoms were investigated using classical many-body molecular dynamics simulations. Adding a single atom to many cluster sizes induced strong variations in surface and core melting points, and cluster energetics. Clusters with size-dependent melting behavior were classified into 3 distinct cluster types: closed-shell, near-closed-shell, and far-from-closed-shell clusters. For small clusters, near-closed-shell clusters had very low surface melting points and very high melting points (heat capacity maximum). Cluster sizes with symmetric closed shells and near-closed shells almost always had first-order-like phase transitions. For intermediate cluster sizes, far-from-closed-shell clusters often exhibited second-order-like phase transitions due to geometric factors. Larger cluster sizes began to favor bcc lattice structures. Variations in the surface and core melting behavior of neighboring cluster sizes may have implications for catalytic systems such as the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>All-Electron Molecular Tunnel Ionization Based on the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory in the Integral Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunnel ionization (TI) underlies many important ultrafast processes, such as high-harmonic generation and strong-field ionization. Among the existing theories for TI, many-electron weak-field asymptotic theory (ME-WFAT) is by design capable of accurately treating many-electron effects in TI. An earlier version of ME-WFAT relied on an accurate representation of the asymptotic tail of the orbitals, which hindered its implementation in Gaussian-basis-set-based quantum chemistry programs. In this work, we reformulate ME-WFAT in the integral representation, which makes the quality of the asymptotic tail much less critical, hence greatly facilitating its implementation in standard quantum chemistry packages. The integral reformulation introduced here is therefore much more robust when applied to molecules with arbitrary geometry. We present several case studies, among which is the CO molecule where some earlier theories disagree with experiments. Here, we find that ME-WFAT produces the largest ionization probability when the field points from C to O, as experiments suggest. An attractive feature of ME-WFAT is that it can be used with various types of multielectron methods whether of density functional [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052211 (2022)] or multiconfiguration types, this in turn facilitates tunnel ionization calculation in systems exhibiting a strong multireference character.</description>
