      <title>First observation of the $\gamma$-ray beam production by the backward Compton scattering of extreme ultraviolet light emitted from an undulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compton scattering of photons off high-energy electrons is a fundamental quantum mechanical process widely utilized to produce a $\gamma$-ray beam for scientific research. Instead of injecting laser light into a storage ring as a conventional way, we have developed an innovative method to achieve drastically higher energies approaching the ring energy by the backward Compton scattering of extreme ultraviolet light. In this method, $92$ $\mathrm{eV}$ photons obtained from an undulator in a storage ring were reflected back to the original ring using a Mo/Si multilayer mirror. Consequently, $\gamma$-ray beam production through the extreme ultraviolet light Compton scattering was observed for the first time in a demonstration experiment at the $1$ $\mathrm{GeV}$ ring, NewSUBARU. The measured energy spectrum was well reproduced by a theoretical calculation with the maximum energy of $0.543$ $\mathrm{GeV}$. The production rate was $1.4 \pm 0.1$ kcps for the energies above $0.160$ $\mathrm{GeV}$. This rate was quantitatively explained by the luminosity and the scattering cross section. The present work paved the way to create a new $\gamma$-ray beam source for future applications such as hadron photoproduction experiments.</description>

      <title>Laboratory Tests of Laser Control of Electron Beams for Future Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven Compton backscattering (CBS) has been proposed as method for controlling the intensity of colliding bunches in the FCC-ee so as to avoid the flip-flop instability caused by intensity asymmetry in colliding bunches. Laser-based collimation has also been proposed as an indestructible collimator for high-intensity electron beams. We have initiated a laboratory-based test program of these concepts with the E344 experiment at FACET-II. In this paper, we describe simulations of laser-beam interactions at FACET-II and the relevant scaling for FCC-ee. We also describe the experimental setup and diagnostics that will be used to make the measurements at FACET-II.</description>

      <title>Beamstrahlung monitoring at SuperKEKB upgrade 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Beam monitoring is crucial for particle accelerators to achieve high luminosity. We describe an upgrade of the LABM, a beam monitoring device utilizing observation of the beamstrahlung, radiation emitted by a beam of charged particles when it accelerates in the electromagnetic field of another beam of charged particles.</description>

      <title>Bunch-by-Bunch Prediction of Beam Transverse Position, Phase, and Length in a Storage Ring Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time, bunch-by-bunch monitoring of transverse position, longitudinal phase, and bunch length is crucial for beam control in diffraction-limited storage rings, where complex collective dynamics pose unprecedented diagnostic challenges. This study presents a neural network framework that simultaneously predicts these parameters directly from beam position monitor waveforms. The hybrid architecture integrates specialized Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory with Attention (LSTM-Attention) sub-networks, overcoming key limitations of traditional methods such as serial processing chains and batch-mode operation. Validated on experimental data from the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility and Hefei Light Source, the model achieves high prediction accuracy with a sub-millisecond latency of 0.042 ms per bunch. This performance demonstrates its potential as a core tool for real-time, multi-parameter diagnostics and active feedback in next-generation light sources.</description>
