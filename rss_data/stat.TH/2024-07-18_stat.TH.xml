      <title>Parameter estimation in hyperbolic linear SPDEs from multiple measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coefficients of elastic and dissipative operators in a linear hyperbolic SPDE are jointly estimated using multiple spatially localised measurements. As the resolution level of the observations tends to zero, we establish the asymptotic normality of an augmented maximum likelihood estimator. The rate of convergence for the dissipative coefficients matches rates in related parabolic problems, whereas the rate for the elastic parameters also depends on the magnitude of the damping. The analysis of the observed Fisher information matrix relies upon the asymptotic behaviour of rescaled $M, N$-functions generalising the operator sine and cosine families appearing in the undamped wave equation. In contrast to the energetically stable undamped wave equation, the $M, N$-functions emerging within the covariance structure of the local measurements have additional smoothing properties similar to the heat kernel, and their asymptotic behaviour is analysed using functional calculus.</description>

      <title>Optimal rates for estimating the covariance kernel from synchronously sampled functional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain minimax-optimal convergence rates in the supremum norm, including infor-mation-theoretic lower bounds, for estimating the covariance kernel of a stochastic process which is repeatedly observed at discrete, synchronous design points. In particular, for dense design we obtain the $\sqrt n$-rate of convergence in the supremum norm without additional logarithmic factors which typically occur in the results in the literature. Surprisingly, in the transition from dense to sparse design the rates do not reflect the two-dimensional nature of the covariance kernel but correspond to those for univariate mean function estimation. Our estimation method can make use of higher-order smoothness of the covariance kernel away from the diagonal, and does not require the same smoothness on the diagonal itself. Hence, as in Mohammadi and Panaretos (2024) we can cover covariance kernels of processes with rough sample paths. Moreover, the estimator does not use mean function estimation to form residuals, and no smoothness assumptions on the mean have to be imposed. In the dense case we also obtain a central limit theorem in the supremum norm, which can be used as the basis for the construction of uniform confidence sets. Simulations and real-data applications illustrate the practical usefulness of the methods.</description>

      <title>Concentration and moment inequalities for heavy-tailed random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Fuk-Nagaev and Rosenthal-type inequalities for the sums of independent random matrices, focusing on the situation when the norms of the matrices possess finite moments of only low orders. Our bounds depend on the "intrinsic" dimensional characteristics such as the effective rank, as opposed to the dimension of the ambient space. We illustrate the advantages of such results in several applications, including new moment inequalities for sample covariance matrices and the corresponding eigenvectors of heavy-tailed random vectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that our techniques yield sharpened versions of the moment inequalities for empirical processes.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi-infinity constrained sampling with $d^3$ membership queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uniform sampling over a convex body is a fundamental algorithmic problem, yet the convergence in KL or R\'enyi divergence of most samplers remains poorly understood. In this work, we propose a constrained proximal sampler, a principled and simple algorithm that possesses elegant convergence guarantees. Leveraging the uniform ergodicity of this sampler, we show that it converges in the R\'enyi-infinity divergence ($\mathcal R_\infty$) with no query complexity overhead when starting from a warm start. This is the strongest of commonly considered performance metrics, implying rates in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$ convergence as special cases.
  By applying this sampler within an annealing scheme, we propose an algorithm which can approximately sample $\varepsilon$-close to the uniform distribution on convex bodies in $\mathcal R_\infty$-divergence with $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^3\, \text{polylog} \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ query complexity. This improves on all prior results in $\{\mathcal R_q, \mathsf{KL}\}$-divergences, without resorting to any algorithmic modifications or post-processing of the sample. It also matches the prior best known complexity in total variation distance.</description>

      <title>Regularisation for the approximation of functions by mollified discretisation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some prominent discretisation methods such as finite elements provide a way to approximate a function of $d$ variables from $n$ values it takes on the nodes $x_i$ of the corresponding mesh.  The accuracy is $n^{-s_a/d}$ in $L^2$-norm, where $s_a$ is the order of the underlying method. When the data are measured or computed with systematical experimental noise, some statistical regularisation might be desirable, with a smoothing method of order $s_r$ (like the number of vanishing moments of a kernel). This idea is behind the use of some regularised discretisation methods, whose approximation properties are the subject of this paper. We decipher the interplay of $s_a$ and $s_r$ for reconstructing a smooth function on regular bounded domains from $n$ measurements with noise of order $\sigma$. We establish that for certain regimes with small noise $\sigma$ depending on $n$, when $s_a &gt; s_r$, statistical smoothing is not necessarily the best option and {\it not regularising} is more beneficial than {\it statistical regularising}. We precisely quantify this phenomenon and show that the gain can achieve a multiplicative order $n^{(s_a-s_r)/(2s_r+d)}$. We illustrate our estimates by numerical experiments conducted in dimension $d=1$ with $\mathbb P_1$ and $\mathbb P_2$ finite elements.</description>

      <title>Movement-based models for abundance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop two statistical models for space-time abundance data based on the modelling of an underlying continuous movement. Different from other models for abundance in the current statistical ecology literature, our models focus especially on an explicit connection between the movement of the individuals and the count, and on the space-time auto-correlation thus induced. Our first model (Snapshot) describes the count of free individuals with a false-negative detection error. Our second model (Capture) describes the capture and retention in traps of moving individuals, and it is constructed using an axiomatic approach establishing three simple principles, from which it is deduced that the density of the capture time is the solution of a Volterra integral equation of the second kind. We make explicit the space-time mean and covariance structures of the abundance fields thus generated, and we develop simulation methods for both models. The joint distribution of the space-time counts is an instance of a new multivariate distribution, here baptised the Evolving-Categories Multinomial distribution, for which we establish some key properties. Since a general expression of the likelihood remains intractable, we propose an approximated MLE fitting method by replacing it by a multivariate Gaussian one, which is justified by central limit theorem and respects mean and covariance structures. We apply this method to experimental data of fruit flies released in a meadow and repeatedly captured and counted in an array of traps. We estimate spread and advection parameters, compare our models to an Ecological Diffusion model, and conduct simulation studies to validate our analysis. Asymptotic consistency is experimentally verified. We conclude that we can estimate movement parameters using only abundance data, but must be aware of the necessary conditions to avoid underestimation of spread parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is proposed to use stochastic differential equations with state-dependent switching rates (SDEwS) for sampling from finite mixture distributions. An Euler scheme with constant time step for SDEwS is considered. It is shown that the scheme converges with order one in weak sense and also in the ergodic limit. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of SDEwS for sampling from mixture distributions and confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Nonconvex landscapes for $\mathbf{Z}_2$ synchronization and graph clustering are benign near exact recovery thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the optimization landscape of a smooth nonconvex program arising from synchronization over the two-element group $\mathbf{Z}_2$, that is, recovering $z_1, \dots, z_n \in \{\pm 1\}$ from (noisy) relative measurements $R_{ij} \approx z_i z_j$. Starting from a max-cut--like combinatorial problem, for integer parameter $r \geq 2$, the nonconvex problem we study can be viewed both as a rank-$r$ Burer--Monteiro factorization of the standard max-cut semidefinite relaxation and as a relaxation of $\{ \pm 1 \}$ to the unit sphere in $\mathbf{R}^r$. First, we present deterministic, non-asymptotic conditions on the measurement graph and noise under which every second-order critical point of the nonconvex problem yields exact recovery of the ground truth. Then, via probabilistic analysis, we obtain asymptotic guarantees for three benchmark problems: (1) synchronization with a complete graph and Gaussian noise, (2) synchronization with an Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph and Bernoulli noise, and (3) graph clustering under the binary symmetric stochastic block model. In each case, we have, asymptotically as the problem size goes to infinity, a benign nonconvex landscape near a previously-established optimal threshold for exact recovery; we can approach this threshold to arbitrary precision with large enough (but finite) rank parameter $r$. In addition, our results are robust to monotone adversaries.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization with Heterogeneous Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study decision problems under uncertainty, where the decision-maker has access to $K$ data sources that carry {\em biased} information about the underlying risk factors. The biases are measured by the mismatch between the risk factor distribution and the $K$ data-generating distributions with respect to an optimal transport (OT) distance. In this situation the decision-maker can exploit the information contained in the biased samples by solving a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problem, where the ambiguity set is defined as the intersection of $K$ OT neighborhoods, each of which is centered at the empirical distribution on the samples generated by a biased data source. We show that if the decision-maker has a prior belief about the biases, then the out-of-sample performance of the DRO solution can improve with $K$ -- irrespective of the magnitude of the biases. We also show that, under standard convexity assumptions, the proposed DRO problem is computationally tractable if either $K$ or the dimension of the risk factors is kept constant.</description>

      <title>Maximum likelihood estimation for spinal-structured trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.05099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate some aspects of the problem of the estimation of birth distributions (BD) in multi-type Galton-Watson trees (MGW) with unobserved types. More precisely, we consider two-type MGW called spinal-structured trees. This kind of tree is characterized by a spine of special individuals whose BD $\nu$ is different from the other individuals in the tree (called normal whose BD is denoted $\mu$). In this work, we show that even in such a very structured two-type population, our ability to distinguish the two types and estimate $\mu$ and $\nu$ is constrained by a trade-off between the growth-rate of the population and the similarity of $\mu$ and $\nu$. Indeed, if the growth-rate is too large, large deviations events are likely to be observed in the sampling of the normal individuals preventing us to distinguish them from special ones. Roughly speaking, our approach succeeds if $r&lt;\mathfrak{D}(\mu,\nu)$ where $r$ is the exponential growth-rate of the population and $\mathfrak{D}$ is a divergence measuring the dissimilarity between $\mu$ and $\nu$.</description>

      <title>Parametric and nonparametric probability distribution estimators of sample maximum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.03765v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme value theory has constructed asymptotic properties of the sample maximum. This study concerns probability distribution estimation of the sample maximum. The traditional approach is parametric fitting to the limiting distribution -- the generalized extreme value distribution; however, the model in non-limiting cases is misspecified to a certain extent. We propose a plug-in type of nonparametric estimator that does not need model specification. Asymptotic properties of the distribution estimator are derived. The simulation study numerically investigates the relative performance in finite-sample cases.
  This study assumes that the underlying distribution of the original sample belongs to one of the Hall class, the Weibull class or the bounded class, whose types of the limiting distributions are all different: the Frechet, Gumbel or Weibull. It is proven that the convergence rate of the parametric fitting estimator depends on both the extreme value index and the second-order parameter and gets slower as the extreme value index tends to zero. On the other hand, the rate of the nonparametric estimator is proven to be independent of the extreme value index under certain conditions. The numerical performances of the parametric fitting estimator and the nonparametric estimator are compared, which shows that the nonparametric estimator performs better, especially for the extreme value index close to zero. Finally, we report two real case studies: the Potomac River peak stream flow (cfs) data and the Danish Fire Insurance data.</description>

      <title>Bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian: convergence to manifold Laplacian and robustness to outlier noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.11386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bi-stochastic normalization provides an alternative normalization of graph Laplacians in graph-based data analysis and can be computed efficiently by Sinkhorn-Knopp (SK) iterations. This paper proves the convergence of bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to manifold (weighted-)Laplacian with rates, when $n$ data points are i.i.d. sampled from a general $d$-dimensional manifold embedded in a possibly high-dimensional space. Under certain joint limit of $n \to \infty$ and kernel bandwidth $\epsilon \to 0$, the point-wise convergence rate of the graph Laplacian operator (under 2-norm) is proved to be $ O( n^{-1/(d/2+3)})$ at finite large $n$ up to log factors, achieved at the scaling of $\epsilon \sim n^{-1/(d/2+3)} $. When the manifold data are corrupted by outlier noise, we theoretically prove the graph Laplacian point-wise consistency which matches the rate for clean manifold data plus an additional term proportional to the boundedness of the inner-products of the noise vectors among themselves and with data vectors. Motivated by our analysis, which suggests that not exact bi-stochastic normalization but an approximate one will achieve the same consistency rate, we propose an approximate and constrained matrix scaling problem that can be solved by SK iterations with early termination. Numerical experiments support our theoretical results and show the robustness of bi-stochastically normalized graph Laplacian to high-dimensional outlier noise.</description>

      <title>A simple extension of Azadkia &amp; Chatterjee's rank correlation to multi-response vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.01621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Chatterjee (2023) recognized the lack of a direct generalization of his rank correlation $\xi$ in Azadkia and Chatterjee (2021) to a multi-dimensional response vector. As a natural solution to this problem, we here propose an extension of $\xi$ that is applicable to a set of $q \geq 1$ response variables, where our approach builds upon converting the original vector-valued problem into a univariate problem and then applying the rank correlation $\xi$ to it. Our novel measure $T$ quantifies the scale-invariant extent of functional dependence of a response vector $\mathbf{Y} = (Y_1,\dots,Y_q)$ on predictor variables $\mathbf{X} = (X_1, \dots,X_p)$, characterizes independence of $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{Y}$ as well as perfect dependence of $\mathbf{Y}$ on $\mathbf{X}$ and hence fulfills all the characteristics of a measure of predictability. Aiming at maximum interpretability, we provide various invariance results for $T$ as well as a closed-form expression in multivariate normal models. Building upon the graph-based estimator for $\xi$ in Azadkia and Chatterjee (2021), we obtain a non-parametric, strongly consistent estimator for $T$ and show its asymptotic normality. Based on this estimator, we develop a model-free and dependence-based feature ranking and forward feature selection for multiple-outcome data. Simulation results and real case studies illustrate $T$'s broad applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the scope of a recently introduced dependence coefficient between a scalar response $Y$ and a multivariate covariate $X$ to the case where $X$ takes values in a general metric space. Particular attention is paid to the case where $X$ is a curve. While on the population level, this extension is straight forward, the asymptotic behavior of the estimator we consider is delicate. It crucially depends on the nearest neighbor structure of the infinite-dimensional covariate sample, where deterministic bounds on the degrees of the nearest neighbor graphs available in multivariate settings do no longer exist. The main contribution of this paper is to give some insight into this matter and to advise a way how to overcome the problem for our purposes. As an important application of our results, we consider an independence test.</description>

      <title>Persistence Diagram Estimation : Beyond Plug-in Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a tool from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) used to summarize the topology underlying data. It can be conveniently represented through persistence diagrams. Observing a noisy signal, common strategies to infer its persistence diagram involve plug-in estimators, and convergence properties are then derived from sup-norm stability. This dependence on the sup-norm convergence of the preliminary estimator is restrictive, as it essentially imposes to consider regular classes of signals. Departing from these approaches, we design an estimator based on image persistence. In the context of the Gaussian white noise model, and for large classes of piecewise-H\"older signals, we prove that the proposed estimator is consistent and achieves minimax rates. Notably, these rates coincide with the well known minimax rates for H\"older continuous signals.</description>

Abstract: Tensor time series, which is a time series consisting of tensorial observations, has become ubiquitous. It typically exhibits high dimensionality. One approach for dimension reduction is to use a factor model structure, in a form similar to Tucker tensor decomposition, except that the time dimension is treated as a dynamic process with a time dependent structure. In this paper we introduce two approaches to estimate such a tensor factor model by using iterative orthogonal projections of the original tensor time series. These approaches extend the existing estimation procedures and improve the estimation accuracy and convergence rate significantly as proven in our theoretical investigation. Our algorithms are similar to the higher order orthogonal projection method for tensor decomposition, but with significant differences due to the need to unfold tensors in the iterations and the use of autocorrelation. Consequently, our analysis is significantly different from the existing ones. Computational and statistical lower bounds are derived to prove the optimality of the sample size requirement and convergence rate for the proposed methods. Simulation study is conducted to further illustrate the statistical properties of these estimators.</description>
