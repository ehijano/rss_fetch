      <title>Equilateral dimension of the planar Banach--Mazur compactum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that there are arbitrarily large equilateral sets of planar and symmetric convex bodies in the Banach--Mazur distance. The order of the size of these $d$-equilateral sets asymptotically matches the bounds of the size of maximum-size $d$-separated sets (determined by Bronstein in 1978), showing that our construction is essentially optimal.</description>

      <title>Inequalities for sections and projections of log-concave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide extensions of geometric inequalities about sections and projections of convex bodies to the setting of integrable log-concave functions. Namely, we consider suitable generalizations of the affine and dual affine quermassintegrals of a log-concave function $f$ and obtain upper and lower estimates for them in terms of the integral $\|f\|_1$ of $f$, we give estimates for sections and projections of log-concave functions in the spirit of the lower dimensional Busemann-Petty and Shephard problem, and we extend to log-concave functions the affirmative answer to a variant of the Busemann-Petty and Shephard problems, proposed by V. Milman. The main goal of this article is to show that the assumption of log-concavity leads to inequalities in which the constants are of the same order as that of the constants in the original corresponding geometric inequalities.</description>

      <title>Weak Morse properties in spaces with bounded combings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We relate two notions of non-positive curvature: bounded combings and the Morse local-to-global (MLTG) property (in its weak and strong version). The latter is a property of a space that has been shown to eliminate pathological behavior of Morse geodesics. We showcase its importance in a survey in the appendix. We show that having a bounded combing implies the weak MLTG property. If the Morse boundary of a group is sigma-compact, we show that the weak MLTG property is upgraded to the (strong) MLTG property.</description>

      <title>Functions of bounded variation and Lipschitz algebras in metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a unital algebra $\mathscr A$ of locally Lipschitz functions defined over a metric measure space $({\mathrm X},{\mathsf d},\mathfrak m)$, we study two associated notions of function of bounded variation and their relations: the space ${\mathrm BV}_{\mathrm H}({\mathrm X};\mathscr A)$, obtained by approximating in energy with elements of $\mathscr A$, and the space ${\mathrm BV}_{\mathrm W}({\mathrm X};\mathscr A)$, defined through an integration-by-parts formula that involves derivations acting in duality with $\mathscr A$. Our main result provides a sufficient condition on the algebra $\mathscr A$ under which ${\mathrm BV}_{\mathrm H}({\mathrm X};\mathscr A)$ coincides with the standard metric BV space ${\mathrm BV}_{\mathrm H}({\mathrm X})$, which corresponds to taking as $\mathscr A$ the collection of all locally Lipschitz functions. Our result applies to several cases of interest, for example to Euclidean spaces and Riemannian manifolds equipped with the algebra of smooth functions, or to Banach and Wasserstein spaces equipped with the algebra of cylinder functions. Analogous results for metric Sobolev spaces ${\mathrm H}^{1,p}$ of exponent $p\in(1,\infty)$ were previously obtained by several different authors.</description>

      <title>Gibbs measures for geodesic flow on CAT(-1) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03297v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a proper geodesically complete CAT(-1) space equipped with a discrete non-elementary action, and a bounded continuous potential with the Bowen property, we construct weighted quasi-conformal Patterson densities and use them to build a Gibbs measure on the space of geodesic lines. Our construction yields a Gibbs measure with local product structure for any potential in this class, which includes bounded H\"older continuous potentials. Furthermore, if the Gibbs measure is finite, then we prove that it is the unique equilibrium state. In contrast to previous results in this direction, we do not require any condition that the potential must take the same value on two geodesic lines which share a common segment.</description>

      <title>The fractional chromatic number of the plane is at least 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10069v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the fractional chromatic number $\chi_f(\mathbb R^2)$ of the unit distance graph of the Euclidean plane is greater than or equal to $4$. Interestingly, however, we cannot present a finite subgraph $G$ of the plane such that $\chi_f(G)\ge 4$. Instead, we utilize the concept of the geometric fractional chromatic number $\chi_{gf}(G)$, which was introduced recently in connection with density bounds for 1-avoiding sets.
  First, as $G$ ranges over finite subgraphs of the plane, we establish that the supremum of $\chi_f(G)$ is the same as that of $\chi_{gf}(G)$. The proof exploits the amenability of the group of Euclidean transformations in dimension 2 and, as such, we do not know whether the analogous statement holds in higher dimensions. We then present a specific planar unit distance graph $G$ on 27 vertices such that $\chi_{gf}(G)=4$, and conclude $\chi_f(\mathbb R^2)\ge 4$ as a corollary.
  As another main result we show that the finitary fractional chromatic number and the Hall ratio of the plane are equal. As a consequence, we conclude that there exist finite unit distance graphs with independence ratio $\frac{1}{4}+\varepsilon$, while we conjecture that the value $\frac{1}{4}$ cannot be reached.</description>

      <title>Entropic curvature not comparable to other curvatures -- or is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider global $\theta$-curvatures of finite Markov chains with associated means $\theta$ in the spirit of the entropic curvature (based on the logarithmic mean) by Erbar-Maas and Mielke. As in the case of Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we also allow for a finite dimension parameter by making use of an adapted $\Gamma$ calculus for $\theta$-curvatures. We prove explicit positive lower curvature bounds (both finite- and infinite-dimensional) for finite abelian Cayley graphs. In the case of cycles, we provide also an upper curvature bound which shows that our lower bounds are asymptotically sharp (up to a logarithmic factor). Moreover, we prove new universal lower curvature bounds for finite Markov chains as well as curvature perturbation results (allowing, in particular, to compare entropic and Bakry-\'Emery curvatures). Finally, we present examples where entropic curvature differs significantly from other curvature notions like Bakry-\'Emery curvature or Ollivier Ricci and sectional curvatures.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Variable Quantum MacWilliams Identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive bounds on general quantum error correcting codes against the displacement noise channel. The bounds limit the distances attainable by codes and also apply in an approximate setting. Our main result is a quantum analogue of the classical Cohn-Elkies bound on sphere packing densities attainable in Euclidean space. We further derive a quantum version of Levenshtein's sphere packing bound and argue that Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) codes based on the $E_8$ and Leech lattices achieve optimal distances. The main technical tool is a continuous-variable version of the quantum MacWilliams identities, which we introduce. The identities relate a pair of weight distributions which can be obtained for any two trace-class operators. General properties of these weight distributions are discussed, along with several examples.</description>
