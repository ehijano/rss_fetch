      <title>FEBio FINESSE: An open-source finite element simulation approach to estimate in vivo heart valve strains using shape enforcement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite element simulations are an enticing tool to evaluate heart valve function in healthy and diseased patients; however, patient-specific simulations derived from 3D echocardiography are hampered by several technical challenges. In this work, we present an open-source method to enforce matching between finite element simulations and in vivo image-derived heart valve geometry in the absence of patient-specific material properties, leaflet thickness, and chordae tendineae structures. We evaluate FEBio Finite Element Simulations with Shape Enforcement (FINESSE) using three synthetic test cases covering a wide range of model complexity. Our results suggest that FINESSE can be used to not only enforce finite element simulations to match an image-derived surface, but to also estimate the first principal leaflet strains within +/- 0.03 strain. Key FINESSE considerations include: (i) appropriately defining the user-defined penalty, (ii) omitting the leaflet commissures to improve simulation convergence, and (iii) emulating the chordae tendineae behavior via prescribed leaflet free edge motion or a chordae emulating force. We then use FINESSE to estimate the in vivo valve behavior and leaflet strains for three pediatric patients. In all three cases, FINESSE successfully matched the target surface with median errors similar to or less than the smallest voxel dimension. Further analysis revealed valve-specific findings, such as the tricuspid valve leaflet strains of a 2-day old patient with HLHS being larger than those of two 13-year old patients. The development of this open source pipeline will enable future studies to begin linking in vivo leaflet mechanics with patient outcomes</description>

      <title>Characterization of a Biosensor Based on Graphene Field Effect Transistors for Body Fluid Analytes: Channel Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field-Effect Transistors with graphene channels or GFETs are an interesting alternative for the detection of analytes in biological fluids since the electrical behavior of the channel changes when exposed to a sample (among other detection strategies). In this work a preliminary characterization is made in terms of the resistance of the channel for a commercial device that has GFETs of 1 and 3 channels for cases of dry and wet gate at atmospheric pressure. The channel resistance was obtained by sweeping the drain-source voltage from -1 to +1V and measuring the drain current in a test station developed for this purpose, for gate cases with and without a PBS 0.001X reference solution. The ohmic response of the channel is linear current with respect to voltage, being greater resistance in the case of wet gate. An increase in resistance with respect to voltage was observed that it is important to review. It was possible to make the ohmic characterization of the channel and a series of recommendations are suggested to continue this research.</description>

      <title>Real and imaginary part symmetries (RIPS) and artifacts removal in 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy without water suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Proton MR spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) without water suppression (WS) possess some distinct advantages over the conventionally used 1H MRSI with WS. However, the sideband artifacts in the non-water suppressed spectra hinder the applications of the 1H MRSI without WS. Although many hardware or software techniques to tackle the sidebands have been developed, they suffer from various shortcomings, such as the prolonged data acquisition time, insufficient elimination of the sidebands, or loss of some spectral information. Here, we present a software method that allows the elimination of sideband artifacts from 1H MRSI data acquired without WS. Methods The presented method is based on the following observations: (1) the real part of the sidebands is anti-symmetric, and the imaginary part of sidebands is symmetric about the unsuppressed water signal, which is at the center of the spectrum, and (2) there is no observable metabolite resonances in the downfield region spectrum acquired with conventional MRSI pulse sequences. We model the complex sidebands in the downfield region using a singular value decomposition-based method, reconstruct from them the upfield sidebands according to the symmetry features of the sidebands, and subtract the sidebands from the spectrum. We demonstrate the method using phantom and in vivo data. Results The method can remarkably reduce sideband artifacts in both the real and the imaginary parts of the spectrum. In both phantom data and high-quality in vivo data, the residual sidebands are smaller than those in the WS spectra. Conclusion The method allows to remove sideband artifacts in both the real and the imaginary parts of the spectrum. The performance of the method on phantom data and high-quality in vivo data outperforms on poor quality in vivo data.</description>

      <title>Parameterization of dose profiles of therapeutic minibeams of protons, $^{4}$He, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single minibeams of protons, $^{4}$He, $^{12}$C and $^{16}$O in water were modeled with Geant4, and their dose distributions were parameterized with double-Gauss-Rutherford (DGR) functions. Dose distributions from arrays of 16 parallel minibeams centered on a rectangular or hexagonal grid were constructed from the parameterized minibeam profiles to simulate the lateral convergence of the minibeams resulting in a homogeneous dose field in the target tumor volume. Peak-to-valley dose ratios (PVDR) and dose-volume histograms (DVH) were calculated for the parameterized dose distributions and compared with those obtained directly from Geant4 modeling of minibeam arrays. The similarity of the results obtained by these two methods suggests that the fast calculation of dose profiles of minibeam arrays based on the DGR parameterizations proposed for the first time in this work can replace the time-consuming MC modeling in future preclinical studies and also in the development of treatment planning systems for minibeam therapy.</description>

      <title>Separation of Sodium Signals Between Mono- and Bi-Exponential T2 Decays via Multi-TE Single-Quantum Sodium (23Na) MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose. It is a long standing pursuit in sodium (23Na) MRI to separate signals between mono and bi exponential T2 decays in the human brain, due to lack of clinically translational solutions under the restriction of intrinsically low signal to noise ratio (SNR). Here we propose a new technique called multi TE single quantum (MSQ) sodium MRI to address the challenge. Methods. We exploit an intrinsic difference in T2 decay between mono and bi exponential sodium signals by acquiring SQ images at multiple TEs and performing voxel based matrix inversions on these SQ images. The MSQ method was then investigated on numerical models, agar phantoms, and human brains for the feasibility on clinical scanners at 3T. Results. The whole brain T2* spectrum of FID signals from the study subjects showed sparse peaks (2 to 4 peaks), suggesting a global set of T2* values (T2*fr, T2*bs, T2*bl) applicable to the separation. The simulations indicated a small impact (3.9 to 5.6 percent) of T2* variation on accuracy of the separation, and the phantom experiments showed a high accuracy of the separation, 95.8 percent for mono T2 sodium and 72.5 to 80.4 percent for biT2 sodium. The human studies demonstrated feasibility of the separation and potentials of highlighting abnormal brain regions in the biT2 sodium images. Conclusion. The MSQ technique has been shown, via the numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and human brain studies, to be able to separate mono and bi T2 sodium signals using a two TE sampling scheme and a global set of T2* values. However, MSQ has limitations and requires cautions in practice. Keywords. sodium MRI, single quantum MRI, triple quantum MRI, neuroimaging, neurodegeneration</description>

      <title>Thyroidiomics: An Automated Pipeline for Segmentation and Classification of Thyroid Pathologies from Scintigraphy Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The objective of this study was to develop an automated pipeline that enhances thyroid disease classification using thyroid scintigraphy images, aiming to decrease assessment time and increase diagnostic accuracy. Anterior thyroid scintigraphy images from 2,643 patients were collected and categorized into diffuse goiter (DG), multinodal goiter (MNG), and thyroiditis (TH) based on clinical reports, and then segmented by an expert. A ResUNet model was trained to perform auto-segmentation. Radiomic features were extracted from both physician (scenario 1) and ResUNet segmentations (scenario 2), followed by omitting highly correlated features using Spearman's correlation, and feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with XGBoost as the core. All models were trained under leave-one-center-out cross-validation (LOCOCV) scheme, where nine instances of algorithms were iteratively trained and validated on data from eight centers and tested on the ninth for both scenarios separately. Segmentation performance was assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), while classification performance was assessed using metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC AUC), and area under the precision-recall curve (PRC AUC). ResUNet achieved DSC values of 0.84$\pm$0.03, 0.71$\pm$0.06, and 0.86$\pm$0.02 for MNG, TH, and DG, respectively. Classification in scenario 1 achieved an accuracy of 0.76$\pm$0.04 and a ROC AUC of 0.92$\pm$0.02 while in scenario 2, classification yielded an accuracy of 0.74$\pm$0.05 and a ROC AUC of 0.90$\pm$0.02. The automated pipeline demonstrated comparable performance to physician segmentations on several classification metrics across different classes, effectively reducing assessment time while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy.

      <title>Physics-Inspired Generative Models in Medical Imaging: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-inspired generative models, in particular diffusion and Poisson flow models, enhance Bayesian methods and promise great utilities in medical imaging. This review examines the transformative role of such generative methods. First, a variety of physics-inspired generative models, including Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Score-based Diffusion Models, and Poisson Flow Generative Models (PFGM and PFGM++), are revisited, with an emphasis on their accuracy, robustness as well as acceleration. Then, major applications of physics-inspired generative models in medical imaging are presented, comprising image reconstruction, image generation, and image analysis. Finally, future research directions are brainstormed, including unification of physics-inspired generative models, integration with vision-language models (VLMs),and potential novel applications of generative models. Since the development of generative methods has been rapid, this review will hopefully give peers and learners a timely snapshot of this new family of physics-driven generative models and help capitalize their enormous potential for medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Rational Approximation of Golden Angles: Accelerated Reconstructions for Radial MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02892v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a generic radial sampling scheme that combines the advantages of golden ratio sampling with simplicity of equidistant angular patterns. The irrational angle between consecutive spokes in golden ratio based sampling schemes enables a flexible retrospective choice of temporal resolution, while preserving good coverage of k-space for each individual bin. Nevertheless, irrational increments prohibit precomputation of the point-spread function (PSF), can lead to numerical problems, and require more complex processing steps. To avoid these problems, a new sampling scheme based on a rational approximation of golden angles (RAGA) is developed.
  Methods: The theoretical properties of RAGA sampling are mathematically derived. Sidelobe-to-peak ratios (SPR) are numerically computed and compared to the corresponding golden ratio sampling schemes. The sampling scheme is implemented in the BART toolbox and in a radial gradient-echo sequence. Feasibility is shown for quantitative imaging in a phantom and a cardiac scan of a healthy volunteer.
  Results: RAGA sampling can accurately approximate golden ratio sampling and has almost identical PSF and SPR. In contrast to golden ratio sampling, each frame can be reconstructed with the same equidistant trajectory using different sampling masks, and the angle of each acquired spoke can be encoded as a small index, which simplifies processing of the acquired data.
  Conclusion: RAGA sampling provides the advantages of golden ratio sampling while simplifying data processing, rendering it a valuable tool for dynamic and quantitative MRI.</description>

      <title>ITRUSST Consensus on Biophysical Safety for Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasonic stimulation (TUS) is an emerging technology for non-invasive brain stimulation. In a series of meetings, the International Consortium for Transcranial Ultrasonic Stimulation Safety and Standards (ITRUSST) has established expert consensus on considerations for the biophysical safety of TUS, drawing upon the relevant diagnostic ultrasound literature and regulations. This report reflects a consensus expert opinion and can inform but not replace regulatory guidelines or official international standards. Their establishment by international and national commissions will follow expert consensus. Similarly, this consensus will inform but not replace ethical evaluation, which will consider aspects beyond biophysical safety relevant to burden, risk, and benefit, such as physiological effects and disease-specific interactions. Here, we assume the application of TUS to persons who are not at risk for thermal or mechanical damage, and without ultrasound contrast agents. In this context, we present a concise yet comprehensive set of levels for a nonsignificant risk of TUS application. For mechanical effects, it is safe if the mechanical index (MI) or the mechanical index for transcranial application (MItc) does not exceed 1.9. For thermal effects, it is safe if any of the following three levels are met: a temperature rise less than 2 C, a thermal dose less than 0.25 CEM43, or specific values of the thermal index (TI) for a given exposure time. We review literature relevant to our considerations and discuss limitations and future developments of our approach.</description>
