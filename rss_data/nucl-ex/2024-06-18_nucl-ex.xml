      <title>An experimental search for an explanation of the difference between beam and bottle neutron lifetime measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past two decades have yielded several new measurements and reanalysis of older measurements of the neutron lifetime. These have led to a 4.4 standard deviation discrepancy between the most precise measurements of the neutron decay rate producing protons in cold neutron beams and the most precise lifetime measured in neutron storage experiments. Here we publish an analysis of the recently published UCN aimed a searching for an explanation of this difference using the model proposed by Koch and Hummel.</description>

      <title>Polarized internal target experiments based on EIC beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider is under construction at BNL. It will have high-energy high-intensity polarized beams of electrons and hadrons. These beams will allow a high accuracy investigation of nucleon structure in the low- to very-low-x DIS regime. At the same time, similar to the realization at HERA, these beams could be used with an internal target for a very productive investigation of medium- to high-x nucleon structure. Due to a novel regime of electron beam operation and its high polarization and intensity, the Figure-of-Merit of an internal target experiment at EIC will be 500+ times higher than was obtained by HERMES.</description>

      <title>Spinning Hall Probe magnetic compass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a large range of physics and space experiments, the direction of the magnetic field needs to be determined with an accuracy on the level of one milli radian or better. We have proposed a new type of magnetic compass - a rotation-based one, which provides an alternating signal from the Hall probe proportional to the value of the magnetic field transverse to the axis of rotation. The spinning Hall probe device has been realized. Alignment of the spinning axis for a minimum (zero) value of the signal allows us to find the direction of the magnetic field. The device does not require calibration and is free of any drift problems. The measurement of the rotation axis direction was accomplished by means of a laser and a flat mirror attached to the rotor. The constructed prototype achieved an accuracy for the magnetic field direction in the experiment with the polarized He-3 target on the level of one milli radian.</description>

      <title>Final Search for Short-Baseline Neutrino Oscillations with the PROSPECT-I Detector at HFIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PROSPECT experiment is designed to perform precise searches for antineutrino disappearance at short distances (7 - 9~m) from compact nuclear reactor cores. This Letter reports results from a new neutrino oscillation analysis performed using the complete data sample from the PROSPECT-I detector operated at the High Flux Isotope Reactor in 2018. The analysis uses a multi-period selection of inverse beta decay neutrino interactions with reduced backgrounds and enhanced statistical power to set limits on electron-flavor disappearance caused by mixing with sterile neutrinos with 0.2 - 20 eV$^2$ mass splittings. Inverse beta decay positron energy spectra from six different reactor-detector distance ranges are found to be statistically consistent with one another, as would be expected in the absence of sterile neutrino oscillations. The data excludes at 95% confidence level the existence of sterile neutrinos in regions above 3~eV$^2$ previously unexplored by terrestrial experiments, including all space below 10~eV$^2$ suggested by the recently strengthened Gallium Anomaly. The best-fit point of the Neutrino-4 reactor experiment's claimed observation of short-baseline oscillation is ruled out at more than five standard deviations.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium fragmentation in a variable-flavor number scheme: Towards NRFF1.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report progress on the determination and study of quarkonium production within the fragmentation approximation. Our analyses address the moderate and large transverse-momentum regime, where the collinear fragmentation of a single parton is expected to dominate over the short-distance production, directly from the hard scattering, of the constituent $(Q \bar{Q})$ system. Parton fragmentation channels to pseudoscalar and vector quarkonia are built on the basis of non-Relativistic QCD next-to-leading computations, which we use to model initial-scale fragmentation inputs. Thus, a preliminary family of Variable-Flavor Number-Scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions, named NRFF1.0, are constructed through standard DGLAP evolution. Statistical uncertainties are obtained from a Monte Carlo, replica-like approach embodying missing higher-order uncertainties.</description>

      <title>$B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C states and detailed study of momentum space method for $\Upsilon$- and $\eta_b$-nucleus bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed study of the $\Upsilon$-, $\eta_b$- and $B_c$-nucleus systems in momentum space to calculate the bound-state energies and the corresponding coordinate space radial wave functions. A comparison is made among different methods to obtain the partial wave decomposition of meson-nucleus potentials in momentum space, namely, (i) the spherical Bessel transform of the numerically obtained original potential in coordinate space, (ii) the partial wave decomposition of the Fourier transform of the Woods-Saxon approximated form for the original potential, and (iii) the spherical Bessel transform of the Woods-Saxon approximation of the numerically obtained original potential. The strong nuclear bound-state energies for the $\Upsilon$-$^{4}$He, $\Upsilon$-$^{12}$C, $\eta_b$-$^{4}$He, $\eta_b$-$^{12}$C, $B_c$-$^{4}$He (no Coulomb), and $B_c$-$^{12}$C (no Coulomb) systems and the corresponding wave functions in coordinate space are compared for the three methods. Furthermore, as an initial and realistic study, the $B_c^{\pm}$-$^{12}$C bound states are studied for the first time, with the effects of self-consistently calculated Coulomb potentials in $^{12}$C (when the $B_c^{\pm}$ mesons are absent).</description>

      <title>Investigating the excitation function of HBT radii for L\'evy-stable sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the main goals of today's heavy-ion physics research is to explore the phase diagram of strongly interacting matter and search for signs of the possible critical endpoint on the QCD phase diagram. Femtoscopy is among the important tools used for this endeavor; there have been indications that combinations of femtoscopic radii parameters (referred to as HBT radii for identical boson pairs) can be related to the system's emission duration. An apparent non-monotonic behavior in their excitation function thus might signal the location of the critical point. In this paper, we show that conclusions drawn from the results obtained with a Gaussian approximation for the pion source shape might be altered if one utilizes a more general L\'evy-stable source description. We find that the characteristic size of the pion source function is strongly connected to the shape of the source and its possible power-law behavior. Taking this into account properly changes the observed behavior of the excitation function.</description>

      <title>Measurement of $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production in $p+p$ and $p+d$ interactions at 120 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the $p+p$ and $p+d$ differential cross sections measured in the SeaQuest experiment for $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production at 120 GeV beam energy covering the forward $x$-Feynman ($x_F$) range of $0.5 &lt; x_F &lt;0.9$. The measured cross sections are in good agreement with theoretical calculations based on the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) using the long-distance matrix elements deduced from a recent global analysis of proton- and pion-induced charmonium production data. The $\sigma_{\psi\left(2S\right)} / \sigma_{J/\psi}$ cross section ratios are found to increase as $x_F$ increases, indicating that the $q \bar{q}$ annihilation process has larger contributions in the $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production than the $J/\psi$ production. The $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ cross section ratios are observed to be significantly different for the Drell-Yan process and $J/\psi$ production, reflecting their different production mechanisms. We find that the $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratios for $J/\psi$ production at the forward $x_F$ region are sensitive to the $\bar{d}/ \bar{u}$ flavor asymmetry of the proton sea, analogous to the Drell-Yan process. The transverse momentum ($p_T$) distributions for $J/\psi$ and $\psi\left(2S\right)$ production are also presented and compared with data collected at higher center-of-mass energies.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional QCD equation of state with multiple chemical potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a four-dimensional version of the equation of state (EoS) model NEOS, NEOS-4D, as a function of the temperature and chemical potentials of baryon, electric charge, and strangeness for the hot and dense QCD matter created in relativistic nuclear collisions. This EoS enables multiple conserved charge current evolution in a relativistic fluid. Input from Lattice QCD simulations and a hadron resonance gas model is considered for constructing the equation of state. We investigate its applicability to the relativistic hydrodynamic description of nuclear collisions and present a method for efficient numerical implementation.</description>

      <title>Helicity Evolution at Small $x$: Quark to Gluon and Gluon to Quark Transition Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We include the quark to gluon and gluon to quark shock-wave transition operators into the small Bjorken-$x$ evolution equations for helicity in the flavor-singlet channel derived earlier. While such transitions do not affect the large-$N_c$ version of the evolution equations for helicity, the large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ equations are affected. ($N_c$ and $N_f$ are the numbers of quark colors and flavors, respectively.) We derive the corresponding corrected large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ equations for the polarized dipole amplitudes contributing to the flavor-singlet quark and gluon helicity distributions in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA), resumming powers of $\alpha_s \, \ln^2 (1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the strong coupling constant. We solve these equations iteratively and extract the polarized splitting functions up to four loops. We show that our splitting functions agree with the fixed-order perturbative calculations up to and including the existing three-loops results. Similar to the large-$N_c$ helicity evolution in the shock-wave approach, our large-$N_c \&amp; N_f$ small-$x$ splitting functions agree with those obtained in the infrared evolution equations framework up to three loops, but appear to slightly disagree at four loops.</description>

      <title>High-precision mass measurements of neutron deficient silver isotopes probe the robustness of the $N$ = 50 shell closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-precision mass measurements of exotic $^{95-97}$Ag isotopes close to the $N = Z$ line have been conducted with the JYFLTRAP double Penning trap mass spectrometer, with the silver ions produced using the recently commissioned inductively-heated hot cavity catcher laser ion source at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line facility. The atomic mass of $^{95}$Ag was directly determined for the first time. In addition, the atomic masses of $\beta$-decaying 2$^+$ and 8$^+$ states in $^{96}$Ag have been identified and measured for the first time, and the precision of the $^{97}$Ag mass has been improved. The newly measured masses, with a precision of $\approx$ 1 keV/c$^2$, have been used to investigate the $N =$ 50 neutron shell closure confirming it to be robust. Empirical shell-gap and pairing energies determined with the new ground-state mass data are compared with the state-of-the-art \textit{ab initio} calculations with various chiral effective field theory Hamiltonians. The precise determination of the excitation energy of the $^{96m}$Ag isomer in particular serves as a benchmark for \textit{ab initio} predictions of nuclear properties beyond the ground state, specifically for odd-odd nuclei situated in proximity to the proton dripline below $^{100}$Sn. In addition, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and configuration-interaction shell-model (CISM) calculations are compared with the experimental results. All theoretical approaches face challenges to reproduce the trend of nuclear ground-state properties in the silver isotopic chain across the $N =$50 neutron shell and toward the proton drip-line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep understanding of $\gamma$-ray production from the fast neutron reaction in water is crucial for various physics studies at large-scale water Cherenkov detectors. We performed test experiments using quasi-mono energetic neutron beams ($E_n = 30$ and 250~MeV) at Osaka University's Research Center for Nuclear Physics to measure $\gamma$-rays originating from the neutron-oxygen reaction with a high-purity germanium detector. Multiple $\gamma$-ray peaks which are expected to be from excited nuclei after the neutron-oxygen reaction were successfully observed. We measured the neutron beam flux by using a liquid scintillator for the cross section measurement. With a spectral fitting analysis based on the tailored $\gamma$-ray signal and background templates, we measured cross sections for each observed $\gamma$-ray component. The results will be useful to validate neutron models employed in the on-going and future water Cherenkov experiments.</description>

Abstract: Eigenvector continuation is a computational method for parametric eigenvalue problems that uses subspace projection with a basis derived from eigenvector snapshots from different parameter sets. It is part of a broader class of subspace-projection techniques called reduced-basis methods. In this colloquium article, we present the development, theory, and applications of eigenvector continuation and projection-based emulators. We introduce the basic concepts, discuss the underlying theory and convergence properties, and present recent applications for quantum systems and future prospects.</description>

      <title>Steady state, displacement current and spin polarization for massless fermion in a shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider spin polarization of massless fermions in a shear flow, whose complete contributions contain magnetization current and side-jump current known from collisional chiral kinetic theory. We argue that the side-jump current adopts interpretation of displacement current. We explicitly determine the displacement current contribution in the steady state reached in shear flow for a QED plasma. We find the displacement contribution enhances the magnetization contribution at small and large momenta, but leads to a suppression effect at intermediate momenta. Major differences from previous studies on collisional effect are: (i) the fermions are in the same steady state as the medium rather than being probes; (ii) Compton scattering and pair annihilation are also included in addition to the Coulomb scattering considered before.</description>
