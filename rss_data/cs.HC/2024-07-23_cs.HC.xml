      <title>Using Case Studies to Teach Responsible AI to Industry Practitioners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responsible AI (RAI) is the science and the practice of making the design, development, and use of AI socially sustainable: of reaping the benefits of innovation while controlling the risks. Naturally, industry practitioners play a decisive role in our collective ability to achieve the goals of RAI. Unfortunately, we do not yet have consolidated educational materials and effective methodologies for teaching RAI to practitioners. In this paper, we propose a novel stakeholder-first educational approach that uses interactive case studies to achieve organizational and practitioner -level engagement and advance learning of RAI. We discuss a partnership with Meta, an international technology company, to co-develop and deliver RAI workshops to a diverse audience within the company. Our assessment results indicate that participants found the workshops engaging and reported a positive shift in understanding and motivation to apply RAI to their work.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Color Assignment for Hierarchical Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assigning discriminable and harmonic colors to samples according to their class labels and spatial distribution can generate attractive visualizations and facilitate data exploration. However, as the number of classes increases, it is challenging to generate a high-quality color assignment result that accommodates all classes simultaneously. A practical solution is to organize classes into a hierarchy and then dynamically assign colors during exploration. However, existing color assignment methods fall short in generating high-quality color assignment results and dynamically aligning them with hierarchical structures. To address this issue, we develop a dynamic color assignment method for hierarchical data, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. This method simultaneously considers color discriminability, color harmony, and spatial distribution at each hierarchical level. By using the colors of parent classes to guide the color assignment of their child classes, our method further promotes both consistency and clarity across hierarchical levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating dynamic color assignment results with quantitative experiments and a user study.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Needs of Nonhuman Stakeholders in Design Process: An Overview of and Reflection on Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Design practice traditionally focused on human concerns, either overseeing the various effects of climate issues on nonhuman stakeholders or considering them as resources to address these problems. The climate crisis's urgency demands a design shift towards sustainability and inclusivity. This shift was happening through an emerging theme in design, More-Than-Human (MTH), which expands the notion of the user to animals, things, nature, and microbes. Such an expansion creates a requirement for designers to consider nonhuman perspectives during the design process. This paper investigates the methods used in MTH Design studies to explore and synthesize the perspectives of nonhuman users. Reviewing 30 papers, it highlights a predominant focus on animals and things over plants and microbes in MTH studies, along with a scarcity of synthesis methods. It identifies the necessity of tools that represent nonhumans with their relationships within larger ecosystems, and calls for increased attention to plants and microbes, emphasizing their vital role in sustainable environments and urging researchers to develop methods for understanding these species. By highlighting method strengths and weaknesses, it aims to guide designers and design researchers who plan to work with nonhuman users in selecting appropriate methods.</description>

      <title>A Two-Phase Visualization System for Continuous Human-AI Collaboration in Sequelae Analysis and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In healthcare, AI techniques are widely used for tasks like risk assessment and anomaly detection. Despite AI's potential as a valuable assistant, its role in complex medical data analysis often oversimplifies human-AI collaboration dynamics. To address this, we collaborated with a local hospital, engaging six physicians and one data scientist in a formative study. From this collaboration, we propose a framework integrating two-phase interactive visualization systems: one for Human-Led, AI-Assisted Retrospective Analysis and another for AI-Mediated, Human-Reviewed Iterative Modeling. This framework aims to enhance understanding and discussion around effective human-AI collaboration in healthcare.</description>

      <title>SLInterpreter: An Exploratory and Iterative Human-AI Collaborative System for GNN-based Synthetic Lethal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic Lethal (SL) relationships, though rare among the vast array of gene combinations, hold substantial promise for targeted cancer therapy. Despite advancements in AI model accuracy, there is still a significant need among domain experts for interpretive paths and mechanism explorations that align better with domain-specific knowledge, particularly due to the high costs of experimentation. To address this gap, we propose an iterative Human-AI collaborative framework with two key components: 1) Human-Engaged Knowledge Graph Refinement based on Metapath Strategies, which leverages insights from interpretive paths and domain expertise to refine the knowledge graph through metapath strategies with appropriate granularity. 2) Cross-Granularity SL Interpretation Enhancement and Mechanism Analysis, which aids experts in organizing and comparing predictions and interpretive paths across different granularities, uncovering new SL relationships, enhancing result interpretation, and elucidating potential mechanisms inferred by Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. These components cyclically optimize model predictions and mechanism explorations, enhancing expert involvement and intervention to build trust. Facilitated by SLInterpreter, this framework ensures that newly generated interpretive paths increasingly align with domain knowledge and adhere more closely to real-world biological principles through iterative Human-AI collaboration. We evaluate the framework's efficacy through a case study and expert interviews.</description>

      <title>SpatialTouch: Exploring Spatial Data Visualizations in Cross-reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel cross-reality environment that seamlessly integrates a monoscopic 2D surface (an interactive screen with touch and pen input) with a stereoscopic 3D space (an augmented reality HMD) to jointly host spatial data visualizations. This innovative approach combines the best of two conventional methods of displaying and manipulating spatial 3D data, enabling users to fluidly explore diverse visual forms using tailored interaction techniques. Providing such effective 3D data exploration techniques is pivotal for conveying its intricate spatial structures -- often at multiple spatial or semantic scales -- across various application domains and requiring diverse visual representations for effective visualization. To understand user reactions to our new environment, we began with an elicitation user study, in which we captured their responses and interactions. We observed that users adapted their interaction approaches based on perceived visual representations, with natural transitions in spatial awareness and actions while navigating across the physical surface. Our findings then informed the development of a design space for spatial data exploration in cross-reality. We thus developed cross-reality environments tailored to three distinct domains: for 3D molecular structure data, for 3D point cloud data, and for 3D anatomical data. In particular, we designed interaction techniques that account for the inherent features of interactions in both spaces, facilitating various forms of interaction, including mid-air gestures, touch interactions, pen interactions, and combinations thereof, to enhance the users' sense of presence and engagement. We assessed the usability of our environment with biologists, focusing on its use for domain research. In addition, we evaluated our interaction transition designs with virtual and mixed-reality experts to gather further insights.</description>

      <title>PREVis: Perceived Readability Evaluation for Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed and validated an instrument to measure the perceived readability in data visualization: PREVis. Researchers and practitioners can easily use this instrument as part of their evaluations to compare the perceived readability of different visual data representations. Our instrument can complement results from controlled experiments on user task performance or provide additional data during in-depth qualitative work such as design iterations when developing a new technique. Although readability is recognized as an essential quality of data visualizations, so far there has not been a unified definition of the construct in the context of visual representations. As a result, researchers often lack guidance for determining how to ask people to rate their perceived readability of a visualization. To address this issue, we engaged in a rigorous process to develop the first validated instrument targeted at the subjective readability of visual data representations. Our final instrument consists of 11 items across 4 dimensions: understandability, layout clarity, readability of data values, and readability of data patterns. We provide the questionnaire as a document with implementation guidelines on osf.io/9cg8j. Beyond this instrument, we contribute a discussion of how researchers have previously assessed visualization readability, and an analysis of the factors underlying perceived readability in visual data representations.</description>

      <title>When Qualitative Research Meets Large Language Model: Exploring the Potential of QualiGPT as a Tool for Qualitative Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Qualitative research, renowned for its in-depth exploration of complex phenomena, often involves time-intensive analysis, particularly during the coding stage. Existing software for qualitative evaluation frequently lacks automatic coding capabilities, user-friendliness, and cost-effectiveness. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and its successors marks a transformative era for enhancing qualitative analysis. This paper introduces QualiGPT, a tool developed to address the challenges associated with using ChatGPT for qualitative analysis. Through a comparative analysis of traditional manual coding and QualiGPT's performance on both simulated and real datasets, incorporating both inductive and deductive coding approaches, we demonstrate that QualiGPT significantly improves the qualitative analysis process. Our findings show that QualiGPT enhances efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in qualitative coding. The tool's performance was evaluated using inter-rater reliability (IRR) measures, with results indicating substantial agreement between human coders and QualiGPT in various coding scenarios. In addition, we also discuss the implications of integrating AI into qualitative research workflows and outline future directions for enhancing human-AI collaboration in this field.</description>

      <title>Feeling the Grass Grow: Making Midair Haptic Parameters Visible, Touchable and Controllable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an ultrasound mid-air haptic interaction system that integrates a designed visualization of haptic parameters while maintaining ease of control. The design of corresponding haptic parameters for real-world tactile textures is a complex task. Furthermore, users often face difficulties in simultaneously controlling multi-dimensional haptic parameters to achieve the desired vibration feedback. To address these challenges, the SLS optimization method facilitates user control of these multi-dimensional parameters through a simple one-dimensional slider. Concurrently, our system employs the "Growing Grass" metaphor to visualize haptic parameter adjustments in real-time. This approach combining visual and haptic sensations can bring richer experiences and generate a realistic sensation of touching a grassy surface. Our objective is to enhance users' intuitive comprehension of haptic parameters through this innovative system.</description>

      <title>avaTTAR: Table Tennis Stroke Training with On-body and Detached Visualization in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table tennis stroke training is a critical aspect of player development. We designed a new augmented reality (AR) system avaTTAR for table tennis stroke training. The system provides both "on-body" (first-person view) and "detached" (third-person view) visual cues, enabling users to visualize target strokes and correct their attempts effectively with this dual perspectives setup. By employing a combination of pose estimation algorithms and IMU sensors, avaTTAR captures and reconstructs the 3D body pose and paddle orientation of users during practice, allowing real-time comparison with expert strokes. Through a user study, we affirm avaTTAR's capacity to amplify player experience and training results.</description>

      <title>TOM: A Development Platform For Wearable Intelligent Assistants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced digital assistants can significantly enhance task performance, reduce user burden, and provide personalized guidance to improve users' abilities. However, the development of such intelligent digital assistants presents a formidable challenge. To address this, we introduce TOM, a conceptual architecture and software platform (https://github.com/TOM-Platform) designed to support the development of intelligent wearable assistants that are contextually aware of both the user and the environment. This system was developed collaboratively with AR/MR researchers, HCI researchers, AI/Robotic researchers, and software developers, and it continues to evolve to meet the diverse requirements of these stakeholders. TOM facilitates the creation of intelligent assistive AR applications for daily activities and supports the recording and analysis of user interactions, integration of new devices, and the provision of assistance for various activities. Additionally, we showcase several proof-of-concept assistive services and discuss the challenges involved in developing such services.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Responsible AI Research on Innovation and Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Translational research, especially in the fast-evolving field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), is key to converting scientific findings into practical innovations. In Responsible AI (RAI) research, translational impact is often viewed through various pathways, including research papers, blogs, news articles, and the drafting of forthcoming AI legislation (e.g., the EU AI Act). However, the real-world impact of RAI research remains an underexplored area. Our study aims to capture it through two pathways: \emph{patents} and \emph{code repositories}, both of which provide a rich and structured source of data. Using a dataset of 200,000 papers from 1980 to 2022 in AI and related fields, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Human-Computer Interaction, we developed a Sentence-Transformers Deep Learning framework to identify RAI papers. This framework calculates the semantic similarity between paper abstracts and a set of RAI keywords, which are derived from the NIST's AI Risk Management Framework; a framework that aims to enhance trustworthiness considerations in the design, development, use, and evaluation of AI products, services, and systems. We identified 1,747 RAI papers published in top venues such as CHI, CSCW, NeurIPS, FAccT, and AIES between 2015 and 2022. By analyzing these papers, we found that a small subset that goes into patents or repositories is highly cited, with the translational process taking between 1 year for repositories and up to 8 years for patents. Interestingly, impactful RAI research is not limited to top U.S. institutions, but significant contributions come from European and Asian institutions. Finally, the multidisciplinary nature of RAI papers, often incorporating knowledge from diverse fields of expertise, was evident as these papers tend to build on unconventional combinations of prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>IDA: Breaking Barriers in No-code UI Automation Through Large Language Models and Human-Centric Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15673v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Business users dedicate significant amounts of time to repetitive tasks within enterprise digital platforms, highlighting a critical need for automation. Despite advancements in low-code tools for UI automation, their complexity remains a significant barrier to adoption among non-technical business users. However, recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have created new opportunities to overcome this barrier by offering more powerful, yet simpler and more human-centric programming environments. This paper presents IDA (Intelligent Digital Apprentice), a novel no-code Web UI automation tool designed specifically to empower business users with no technical background. IDA incorporates human-centric design principles, including guided programming by demonstration, semantic programming model, and teacher-student learning metaphor which is tailored to the skill set of business users. By leveraging LLMs, IDA overcomes some of the key technical barriers that have traditionally limited the possibility of no-code solutions. We have developed a prototype of IDA and conducted a user study involving real world business users and enterprise applications. The promising results indicate that users could effectively utilize IDA to create automation. The qualitative feedback indicates that IDA is perceived as user-friendly and trustworthy. This study contributes to unlocking the potential of AI assistants to enhance the productivity of business users through no-code user interface automation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today's visualization tools for conveying the risks and benefits of AI technologies are largely tailored for those with technical expertise. To bridge this gap, we have developed a visualization that employs narrative patterns and interactive elements, enabling the broader public to gradually grasp the diverse risks and benefits associated with AI. Using a dataset of 54 real-world incidents involving AI in mobile computing, we examined design choices that enhance public understanding and provoke reflection on how certain AI applications - even those deemed low-risk by law - can still lead to significant incidents.

      <description>arXiv:2407.15695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internet offers tremendous access to services, social connections, and needed products. However, to those without sufficient experience, engaging with businesses and friends across the internet can be daunting due to the ever present danger of scammers and thieves, to say nothing of the myriad of potential computer viruses. Like a forest rich with both edible and poisonous plants, those familiar with the norms inhabit it safely with ease while newcomers need a guide. However, reliance on a human digital guide can be taxing and often impractical. We propose and pilot a simple but unexplored idea: could an LLM provide the necessary support to help the elderly who are separated by the digital divide safely achieve digital autonomy?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary focus of this research is the discreet and subtle everyday contact interactions between mobile phones and their surrounding surfaces. Such interactions are anticipated to facilitate mobile context awareness, encompassing aspects such as dispensing medication updates, intelligently switching modes (e.g., silent mode), or initiating commands (e.g., deactivating an alarm). We introduce MicroCam, a contact-based sensing system that employs smartphone IMU data to detect the routine state of phone placement and utilizes a built-in microscope camera to capture intricate surface details. In particular, a natural dataset is collected to acquire authentic surface textures in situ for training and testing. Moreover, we optimize the deep neural network component of the algorithm, based on continual learning, to accurately discriminate between object categories (e.g., tables) and material constituents (e.g., wood). Experimental results highlight the superior accuracy, robustness and generalization of the proposed method. Lastly, we conducted a comprehensive discussion centered on our prototype, encompassing topics such as system performance and potential applications and scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of the Automatic Ball-Strike System in Professional Baseball: A Case Study on KBO League Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in professional baseball have led to the introduction of the Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) system, or ``robot umpires,'' which utilize machine learning, computer vision, and precise tracking technologies to automate ball-strike calls. The Korean Baseball Organization (KBO) league became the first professional baseball league to implement ABS during the 2024 season. This study analyzes pitching data for 2,515 games across multiple KBO seasons to compare decisions made by human umpires with those made by ABS, focusing specifically on differences within the ``gray zone'' of the strike zone. We propose and answer four research questions to examine the differences between human and robot umpires, player adaptation to ABS, assess the ABS system's fairness and consistency, and analyze its strategic implications for the game. Our findings offer valuable insights into the impact of technological integration in sports officiating, providing lessons relevant to future implementations in professional baseball and beyond.</description>

      <title>Imitation of human motion achieves natural head movements for humanoid robots in an active-speaker detection task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Head movements are crucial for social human-human interaction. They can transmit important cues (e.g., joint attention, speaker detection) that cannot be achieved with verbal interaction alone. This advantage also holds for human-robot interaction. Even though modeling human motions through generative AI models has become an active research area within robotics in recent years, the use of these methods for producing head movements in human-robot interaction remains underexplored. In this work, we employed a generative AI pipeline to produce human-like head movements for a Nao humanoid robot. In addition, we tested the system on a real-time active-speaker tracking task in a group conversation setting. Overall, the results show that the Nao robot successfully imitates human head movements in a natural manner while actively tracking the speakers during the conversation.

      <title>Morse Code-Enabled Speech Recognition for Individuals with Visual and Hearing Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed model aims to develop a speech recognition technology for hearing, speech, or cognitively disabled people. All the available technology in the field of speech recognition doesn't come with an interface for communication for people with hearing, speech, or cognitive disabilities. The proposed model proposes the speech from the user, is transmitted to the speech recognition layer where it is converted into text and then that text is then transmitted to the morse code conversion layer where the morse code of the corresponding speech is given as the output. The accuracy of the model is completely dependent on speech recognition, as the morse code conversion is a process. The model is tested with recorded audio files with different parameters. The proposed model's WER and accuracy are both determined to be 10.18% and 89.82%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Auditing the Grid-Based Placement of Private Label Products on E-commerce Search Result Pages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-commerce platforms support the needs and livelihoods of their two most important stakeholders -- customers and producers/sellers. Multiple algorithmic systems, like ``search'' systems mediate the interactions between these stakeholders by connecting customers to producers with relevant items. Search results include (i) private label (PL) products that are manufactured/sold by the platform itself, as well as (ii) third-party products on advertised / sponsored and organic positions. In this paper, we systematically quantify the extent of PL product promotion on e-commerce search results for the two largest e-commerce platforms operating in India -- Amazon.in and Flipkart. By analyzing snapshots of search results across the two platforms, we discover high PL promotion on the initial result pages (~ 15% PLs are advertised on the first SERP of Amazon). Both platforms use different strategies to promote their PL products, such as placing more PLs on the advertised positions -- while Amazon places them on the first, middle, and last rows of the search results, Flipkart places them on the first two positions and the (entire) last column of the search results. We discover that these product placement strategies of both platforms conform with existing user attention strategies proposed in the literature. Finally, to supplement the findings from the collected data, we conduct a survey among 68 participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The click pattern from our survey shows that users strongly prefer to click on products placed at positions that correspond to the PL products on the search results of Amazon, but not so strongly on Flipkart. The click-through rate follows previously proposed theoretically grounded user attention distribution patterns in a two-dimensional layout.</description>

      <title>Do Generative AI Models Output Harm while Representing Non-Western Cultures: Evidence from A Community-Centered Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our research investigates the impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models, specifically text-to-image generators (T2Is), on the representation of non-Western cultures, with a focus on Indian contexts. Despite the transformative potential of T2Is in content creation, concerns have arisen regarding biases that may lead to misrepresentations and marginalizations. Through a community-centered approach and grounded theory analysis of 5 focus groups from diverse Indian subcultures, we explore how T2I outputs to English prompts depict Indian culture and its subcultures, uncovering novel representational harms such as exoticism and cultural misappropriation. These findings highlight the urgent need for inclusive and culturally sensitive T2I systems. We propose design guidelines informed by a sociotechnical perspective, aiming to address these issues and contribute to the development of more equitable and representative GAI technologies globally. Our work also underscores the necessity of adopting a community-centered approach to comprehend the sociotechnical dynamics of these models, complementing existing work in this space while identifying and addressing the potential negative repercussions and harms that may arise when these models are deployed on a global scale.</description>

      <title>Political Leanings in Web3 Betting: Decoding the Interplay of Political and Profitable Motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the transparent blockchain user behavior data, we construct the Political Betting Leaning Score (PBLS) to measure political leanings based on betting within Web3 prediction markets. Focusing on Polymarket and starting from the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, we synthesize behaviors over 15,000 addresses across 4,500 events and 8,500 markets, capturing the intensity and direction of their political leanings by the PBLS. We validate the PBLS through internal consistency checks and external comparisons. We uncover relationships between our PBLS and betting behaviors through over 800 features capturing various behavioral aspects. A case study of the 2022 U.S. Senate election further demonstrates the ability of our measurement while decoding the dynamic interaction between political and profitable motives. Our findings contribute to understanding decision-making in decentralized markets, enhancing the analysis of behaviors within Web3 prediction environments. The insights of this study reveal the potential of blockchain in enabling innovative, multidisciplinary studies and could inform the development of more effective online prediction markets, improve the accuracy of forecast, and help the design and optimization of platform mechanisms.

      <title>Influencer: Empowering Everyday Users in Creating Promotional Posts via AI-infused Exploration and Customization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creating promotional posts on social platforms enables everyday users to disseminate their creative outcomes, engage in community exchanges, or generate additional income from micro-businesses. However, creating eye-catching posts combining both original, appealing images and articulate, effective captions can be rather challenging and time-consuming for everyday users who are mostly design novices. We propose Influen, an interactive tool to assist novice creators in crafting high-quality promotional post designs, achieving quick design ideation and unencumbered content creation through AI. Within Influencer, we contribute a multi-dimensional recommendation framework that allows users to intuitively generate new ideas through example-based image and caption recommendation. Further, Influencer implements a holistic promotional post design system that supports context-aware image and caption exploration considering brand messages and user-specified design constraints, flexible fusion of various images and captions, and a mind-map-like layout for thinking tracking and post-recording. We evaluated Influencer with 12 design enthusiasts through an in-lab user study by comparing it to a baseline combining Google Search + Figma. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that \sysname{} is effective in assisting design novices to generate ideas as well as creative and diverse promotional posts with user-friendly interaction.</description>

      <title>CoCoG-2: Controllable generation of visual stimuli for understanding human concept representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans interpret complex visual stimuli using abstract concepts that facilitate decision-making tasks such as food selection and risk avoidance. Similarity judgment tasks are effective for exploring these concepts. However, methods for controllable image generation in concept space are underdeveloped. In this study, we present a novel framework called CoCoG-2, which integrates generated visual stimuli into similarity judgment tasks. CoCoG-2 utilizes a training-free guidance algorithm to enhance generation flexibility. CoCoG-2 framework is versatile for creating experimental stimuli based on human concepts, supporting various strategies for guiding visual stimuli generation, and demonstrating how these stimuli can validate various experimental hypotheses. CoCoG-2 will advance our understanding of the causal relationship between concept representations and behaviors by generating visual stimuli. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/ncclab-sustech/CoCoG-2}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, educators face the challenge of preparing students for a future where AI-assisted work is integral to professional success. This paper introduces ChatISA, an in-house, multi-model chatbot designed to support students in an Information Systems and Analytics department. ChatISA comprises four primary modules-Coding Companion, Project Coach, Exam Ally, and Interview Mentor-each tailored to enhance different aspects of the educational experience. Through iterative development, student feedback, and leveraging open-source frameworks, we created a robust tool that addresses coding inquiries, project management, exam preparation, and interview readiness. The implementation of ChatISA revealed significant insights and challenges, including the necessity of ethical guidelines and balancing AI usage with maintaining student agency. Our findings underscore the importance of adaptive pedagogy and proactive engagement with AI tools to maximize their educational benefits. To support broader adoption and innovation, all code for ChatISA is made publicly available on GitHub, enabling other institutions to customize and integrate similar AI-driven educational tools within their curricula.</description>

Abstract: Understanding knowledge mechanisms in Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for advancing towards trustworthy AGI. This paper reviews knowledge mechanism analysis from a novel taxonomy including knowledge utilization and evolution. Knowledge utilization delves into the mechanism of memorization, comprehension and application, and creation. Knowledge evolution focuses on the dynamic progression of knowledge within individual and group LLMs. Moreover, we discuss what knowledge LLMs have learned, the reasons for the fragility of parametric knowledge, and the potential dark knowledge (hypothesis) that will be challenging to address. We hope this work can help understand knowledge in LLMs and provide insights for future research.</description>

      <title>On the Automated Processing of User Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: User feedback is becoming an increasingly important source of information for requirements engineering, user interface design, and software engineering in general. Nowadays, user feedback is largely available and easily accessible in social media, product forums, or app stores. Over the last decade, research has shown that user feedback can help software teams: a) better understand how users are actually using specific product features and components, b) faster identify, reproduce, and fix defects, and b) get inspirations for improvements or new features. However, to tap the full potential of feedback, there are two main challenges that need to be solved. First, software vendors must cope with a large quantity of feedback data, which is hard to manage manually. Second, vendors must also cope with a varying quality of feedback as some items might be uninformative, repetitive, or simply wrong. This chapter summarises and pipelines various data mining, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques, including recent Large Language Models, to cope with the quantity and quality challenges. We guide researchers and practitioners through implementing effective, actionable analysis of user feedback for software and requirements engineering.</description>

      <title>Empowering Agile-Based Generative Software Development through Human-AI Teamwork</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In software development, the raw requirements proposed by users are frequently incomplete, which impedes the complete implementation of application functionalities. With the emergence of large language models, recent methods with the top-down waterfall model employ a questioning approach for requirement completion, attempting to explore further user requirements. However, users, constrained by their domain knowledge, lack effective acceptance criteria, which fail to capture the implicit needs of the user. Moreover, the cumulative errors of the waterfall model can lead to discrepancies between the generated code and user requirements. The Agile methodologies reduce cumulative errors through lightweight iteration and collaboration with users, but the challenge lies in ensuring semantic consistency between user requirements and the code generated. We propose AgileGen, an agile-based generative software development through human-AI teamwork. AgileGen attempts for the first time to use testable requirements by Gherkin for semantic consistency between requirements and code. Additionally, we innovate in human-AI teamwork, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes they do well and enhancing the completeness of application functionality. Finally, to improve the reliability of user scenarios, a memory pool mechanism is used to collect user decision-making scenarios and recommend them to new users. AgileGen, as a user-friendly interactive system, significantly outperformed existing best methods by 16.4% and garnered higher user satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Problems in AI, their roots in philosophy, and implications for science and society</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of today's most relevant emergent technologies. In view thereof, this paper proposes that more attention should be paid to the philosophical aspects of AI technology and its use. It is argued that this deficit is generally combined with philosophical misconceptions about the growth of knowledge. To identify these misconceptions, reference is made to the ideas of the philosopher of science Karl Popper and the physicist David Deutsch. The works of both thinkers aim against mistaken theories of knowledge, such as inductivism, empiricism, and instrumentalism. This paper shows that these theories bear similarities to how current AI technology operates. It also shows that these theories are very much alive in the (public) discourse on AI, often called Bayesianism. In line with Popper and Deutsch, it is proposed that all these theories are based on mistaken philosophies of knowledge. This includes an analysis of the implications of these mistaken philosophies for the use of AI in science and society, including some of the likely problem situations that will arise. This paper finally provides a realistic outlook on Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and three propositions on A(G)I and philosophy (i.e., epistemology).</description>

Abstract: RAGMan is an LLM-powered tutoring system that can support a variety of course-specific and homework-specific AI tutors. RAGMan leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), as well as strict instructions, to ensure the alignment of the AI tutors' responses. By using RAGMan's AI tutors, students receive assistance with their specific homework assignments without directly obtaining solutions, while also having the ability to ask general programming-related questions.
  RAGMan was deployed as an optional resource in an introductory programming course with an enrollment of 455 students. It was configured as a set of five homework-specific AI tutors. This paper describes the interactions the students had with the AI tutors, the students' feedback, and a comparative grade analysis. Overall, about half of the students engaged with the AI tutors, and the vast majority of the interactions were legitimate homework questions. When students posed questions within the intended scope, the AI tutors delivered accurate responses 98% of the time. Within the students used AI tutors, 78% reported that the tutors helped their learning. Beyond AI tutors' ability to provide valuable suggestions, students reported appreciating them for fostering a safe learning environment free from judgment.</description>

      <title>Inequalities in Computational Thinking Among Incoming Students in an STEM Chilean University</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While computational thinking arises as an essential skill worldwide, formal primary and secondary education in Latin America rarely incorporates mechanisms to develop it in their curricula. The extent to which students in the region acquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start addressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross-sectional study that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming students at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines. Based on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant inequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private or no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into how these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a highly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies focused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary initiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten upcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable field for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar circumstances.</description>

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has emerged as a fundamental component of intelligent interactive systems, enabling the automatic generation of multimodal media content. The continuous enhancement in the quality of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), including but not limited to images and text, is forging new paradigms for its application, particularly within the domain of Augmented Reality (AR). Nevertheless, the application of GenAI within the AR design process remains opaque. This paper aims to articulate a design space encapsulating a series of criteria and a prototypical process to aid practitioners in assessing the aptness of adopting pertinent technologies. The proposed model has been formulated based on a synthesis of design insights garnered from ten experts, obtained through focus group interviews. Leveraging these initial insights, we delineate potential applications of GenAI in AR.</description>

      <title>SurrealDriver: Designing LLM-powered Generative Driver Agent Framework based on Human Drivers' Driving-thinking Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging advanced reasoning capabilities and extensive world knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to construct generative agents for solving complex real-world problems is a major trend. However, LLMs inherently lack embodiment as humans, resulting in suboptimal performance in many embodied decision-making tasks. In this paper, we introduce a framework for building human-like generative driving agents using post-driving self-report driving-thinking data from human drivers as both demonstration and feedback. To capture high-quality, natural language data from drivers, we conducted urban driving experiments, recording drivers' verbalized thoughts under various conditions to serve as chain-of-thought prompts and demonstration examples for the LLM-Agent. The framework's effectiveness was evaluated through simulations and human assessments. Results indicate that incorporating expert demonstration data significantly reduced collision rates by 81.04\% and increased human likeness by 50\% compared to a baseline LLM-based agent. Our study provides insights into using natural language-based human demonstration data for embodied tasks. The driving-thinking dataset is available at \url{https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/Driving-Thinking-Dataset}.</description>

      <title>An intelligent sociotechnical systems (iSTS) concept: Toward a sociotechnically-based hierarchical human-centered AI approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03223v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While artificial intelligence (AI) offers significant benefits, it also has negatively impacted humans and society. A human-centered AI (HCAI) approach has been proposed to address these issues. However, current HCAI practices have shown limited contributions due to a lack of sociotechnical thinking. To overcome these challenges, we conducted a literature review and comparative analysis of sociotechnical characteristics between the non-AI and AI eras. Then, we propose updated sociotechnical systems (STS) design principles. Based on these findings, this paper introduces a concept of intelligent sociotechnical systems (iSTS) to enhance traditional STS theory and meet the demands of the AI era. The iSTS concept emphasizes human-centered joint optimization across individual, organizational, ecosystem, and social levels. The paper further integrates iSTS with current HCAI practices, proposing a hierarchical HCAI framework. This framework offers a structured approach to address challenges in HCAI practices from a broader sociotechnical perspective. Finally, we provide recommendations to advance HCAI practice.</description>

      <title>Interrogating AI: Characterizing Emergent Playful Interactions with ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an era of AI's growing capabilities and influences, recent advancements are constantly reshaping HCI and CSCW's view of AI. Playful interactions with AI systems naturally emerged as an important way for users to make sense of the ever-changing technology. However, these emergent and playful interactions are underexamined. We target this gap by investigating playful interactions exhibited by users of an emerging AI technology, ChatGPT. Through a thematic analysis of 372 user-generated posts on the ChatGPT subreddit, we found that more than half of user discourse revolves around playful interactions. The analysis further allowed us to construct a preliminary framework to describe these interactions, categorizing them into six types: reflecting, jesting, imitating, challenging, tricking, and contriving; each included sub-categories. This study contributes to the field of HCI and CSCW by illuminating the multifaceted nature of playful interactions with AI, underlining their significance in helping users assess AI agency, shaping the human-AI relationship, and offering rich implications to AI system design.</description>

      <title>Constrained Online Recursive Source Separation Framework for Real-time Electrophysiological Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrophysiological signal processing often requires blind source separation (BSS) techniques due to the nature of mixing source signals. However, its complex computational demands make real-time applicability challenging. In this study, we propose a Constrained Online Recursive Source Separation (CORSS) framework for real time electrophysiological signals processing. With a stepwise recursive unmixing matrix learning rule, the algorithm achieves real-time updates with minimal computational overhead. By incorporating prior information of target signals to optimize the cost function, the algorithm converges more readily to ideal sources, yielding more accurate results. Two downstream tasks, real-time surface electromyogram (sEMG) decomposition and real-time respiratory intent monitoring based on diaphragmatic electromyogram (sEMGdi) extraction, were employed to assess the efficacy of our method. The results demonstrated superior performance compared to alternative methods, achieving a matching rate of 96.00% for the sEMG decomposition task and 98.12% for the sEMGdi extraction task. Moreover, compared to Online PFP, our method exhibits minimal time delay during computation, reflecting its streamlined processing and excellent real-time capabilities. Our approach demonstrates strong performance across various real-time processing tasks of electrophysiological signals, highlighting its significance for applications in real-time human-computer interaction and clinical monitoring.</description>

      <title>StuGPTViz: A Visual Analytics Approach to Understand Student-ChatGPT Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT, into education is poised to revolutionize students' learning experiences by introducing innovative conversational learning methodologies. To empower students to fully leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT in educational scenarios, understanding students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT is crucial for instructors. However, this endeavor is challenging due to the absence of datasets focused on student-ChatGPT conversations and the complexities in identifying and analyzing the evolutional interaction patterns within conversations. To address these challenges, we collected conversational data from 48 students interacting with ChatGPT in a master's level data visualization course over one semester. We then developed a coding scheme, grounded in the literature on cognitive levels and thematic analysis, to categorize students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, that tracks and compares temporal patterns in student prompts and the quality of ChatGPT's responses at multiple scales, revealing significant pedagogical insights for instructors. We validated the system's effectiveness through expert interviews with six data visualization instructors and three case studies. The results confirmed StuGPTViz's capacity to enhance educators' insights into the pedagogical value of ChatGPT. We also discussed the potential research opportunities of applying visual analytics in education and developing AI-driven personalized learning solutions.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a sensorized vision-enabled prosthetic hand aimed at replicating a natural hand's performance, functionality, appearance, and comfort. The design goal was to create an accessible substitution with a user-friendly interface requiring little to no training. Our mechanical hand uses a camera and embedded processors to perform most of these tasks. The interfaced pressure sensor is used to get pressure feedback and ensure a safe grasp of the object; an accelerometer is used to detect gestures and release the object. Unlike current EMG-based designs, the prototyped hand does not require personalized training. The details of the design, trade-offs, results, and informing the next iteration are presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Ad Memorability: Understanding &amp; Generating Memorable Ads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Marketers spend billions of dollars on advertisements, but to what end? At purchase time, if customers cannot recognize the brand for which they saw an ad, the money spent on the ad is essentially wasted. Despite its importance in marketing, until now, there has been no large-scale study on the memorability of ads. All previous memorability studies have been conducted on short-term recall on specific content types like action videos. On the other hand, the advertising industry only cares about long-term memorability, and ads are almost always highly multimodal. Therefore, we release the first memorability dataset, LAMBDA, consisting of 1749 participants and 2205 ads covering 276 brands. Running statistical tests over different participant subpopulations and ad types, we find many interesting insights into what makes an ad memorable, e.g., fast-moving ads are more memorable than those with slower scenes; people who use ad-blockers remember a lower number of ads than those who don't. Next, we present a model, Henry, to predict the memorability of a content. Henry achieves state-of-the-art performance across all prominent literature memorability datasets. It shows strong generalization performance with better results in 0-shot on unseen datasets. Finally, with the intent of memorable ad generation, we present a scalable method to build a high-quality memorable ad generation model by leveraging automatically annotated data. Our approach, SEED (Self rEwarding mEmorability Modeling), starts with a language model trained on LAMBDA as seed data and progressively trains an LLM to generate more memorable ads. We show that the generated advertisements have 44% higher memorability scores than the original ads. We release this large-scale ad dataset, UltraLAMBDA, consisting of 5 million ads. Our code and datasets are available at https://behavior-in-the-wild.github.io/memorability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Large Language Models' Ability Using a Psychiatric Screening Tool Based on Metaphor and Sarcasm Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metaphors and sarcasm are precious fruits of our highly evolved social communication skills. However, children with the condition then known as Asperger syndrome are known to have difficulties in comprehending sarcasm, even if they possess adequate verbal IQs for understanding metaphors. Accordingly, researchers had employed a screening test that assesses metaphor and sarcasm comprehension to distinguish Asperger syndrome from other conditions with similar external behaviors (e.g., attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). This study employs a standardized test to evaluate recent large language models' (LLMs) understanding of nuanced human communication. The results indicate improved metaphor comprehension with increased model parameters; however, no similar improvement was observed for sarcasm comprehension. Considering that a human's ability to grasp sarcasm has been associated with the amygdala, a pivotal cerebral region for emotional learning, a distinctive strategy for training LLMs would be imperative to imbue them with the ability in a cognitively grounded manner.</description>

      <title>OmniACT: A Dataset and Benchmark for Enabling Multimodal Generalist Autonomous Agents for Desktop and Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, human-computer interaction has fundamentally been manual. Even today, almost all productive work done on the computer necessitates human input at every step. Autonomous virtual agents represent an exciting step in automating many of these menial tasks. Virtual agents would empower users with limited technical proficiency to harness the full possibilities of computer systems. They could also enable the efficient streamlining of numerous computer tasks, ranging from calendar management to complex travel bookings, with minimal human intervention. In this paper, we introduce OmniACT, the first-of-a-kind dataset and benchmark for assessing an agent's capability to generate executable programs to accomplish computer tasks. Our scope extends beyond traditional web automation, covering a diverse range of desktop applications. The dataset consists of fundamental tasks such as "Play the next song", as well as longer horizon tasks such as "Send an email to John Doe mentioning the time and place to meet". Specifically, given a pair of screen image and a visually-grounded natural language task, the goal is to generate a script capable of fully executing the task. We run several strong baseline language model agents on our benchmark. The strongest baseline, GPT-4, performs the best on our benchmark However, its performance level still reaches only 15% of the human proficiency in generating executable scripts capable of completing the task, demonstrating the challenge of our task for conventional web agents. Our benchmark provides a platform to measure and evaluate the progress of language model agents in automating computer tasks and motivates future work towards building multimodal models that bridge large language models and the visual grounding of computer screens.</description>

      <title>Will the Real Linda Please Stand up...to Large Language Models? Examining the Representativeness Heuristic in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01461v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in modeling text and generating human-like text, they may exhibit biases acquired from training data in doing so. Specifically, LLMs may be susceptible to a common cognitive trap in human decision-making called the representativeness heuristic. This is a concept in psychology that refers to judging the likelihood of an event based on how closely it resembles a well-known prototype or typical example, versus considering broader facts or statistical evidence. This research investigates the impact of the representativeness heuristic on LLM reasoning. We created ReHeAT (Representativeness Heuristic AI Testing), a dataset containing a series of problems spanning six common types of representativeness heuristics. Experiments reveal that four LLMs applied to ReHeAT all exhibited representativeness heuristic biases. We further identify that the model's reasoning steps are often incorrectly based on a stereotype rather than on the problem's description. Interestingly, the performance improves when adding a hint in the prompt to remind the model to use its knowledge. This suggests the uniqueness of the representativeness heuristic compared to traditional biases. It can occur even when LLMs possess the correct knowledge while falling into a cognitive trap. This highlights the importance of future research focusing on the representativeness heuristic in model reasoning and decision-making and on developing solutions to address it.</description>

      <title>Social Life Simulation for Non-Cognitive Skills Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-cognitive skills are crucial for personal and social life well-being, and such skill development can be supported by narrative-based (e.g., storytelling) technologies. While generative AI enables interactive and role-playing storytelling, little is known about how users engage with and perceive the use of AI in social life simulation for non-cognitive skills learning. Additionally, the benefits of AI mentorship on self-reflection awareness and ability in this context remain largely underexplored. To this end, we introduced Simulife++, an interactive platform enabled by a large language model (LLM). The system allows users to act as protagonists, creating stories with one or multiple AI-based characters in diverse social scenarios. In particular, we expanded the Human-AI interaction to a Human-AI-AI collaboration by including a Sage Agent, who acts as a bystander, providing users with some perspectives and guidance on their choices and conversations in terms of non-cognitive skills to promote reflection. In a within-subject user study, our quantitative results reveal that, when accompanied by Sage Agent, users exhibit significantly higher levels of reflection on motivation, self-perceptions, and resilience &amp; coping, along with an enhanced experience of narrative transportation. Additionally, our qualitative findings suggest that Sage Agent plays a crucial role in promoting reflection on non-cognitive skills, enhancing social communication and decision-making performance, and improving overall user experience within Simulife++. Multiple supportive relationships between Sage Agent and users were also reported. We offer design implications for the application of generative AI in narrative solutions and the future potential of Sage Agent for non-cognitive skill development in broader social contexts.</description>

      <title>Biometrics and Behavior Analysis for Detecting Distractions in e-Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we explore computer vision approaches to detect abnormal head pose during e-learning sessions and we introduce a study on the effects of mobile phone usage during these sessions. We utilize behavioral data collected from 120 learners monitored while participating in a MOOC learning sessions. Our study focuses on the influence of phone-usage events on behavior and physiological responses, specifically attention, heart rate, and meditation, before, during, and after phone usage. Additionally, we propose an approach for estimating head pose events using images taken by the webcam during the MOOC learning sessions to detect phone-usage events. Our hypothesis suggests that head posture undergoes significant changes when learners interact with a mobile phone, contrasting with the typical behavior seen when learners face a computer during e-learning sessions. We propose an approach designed to detect deviations in head posture from the average observed during a learner's session, operating as a semi-supervised method. This system flags events indicating alterations in head posture for subsequent human review and selection of mobile phone usage occurrences with a sensitivity over 90%.</description>

      <title>Noninvasive Extraction of Maternal and Fetal ECG using Periodic Progressive FastICA Peel-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01281v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The abdominal electrocardiogram (AECG) gives a safe and non-invasive way to monitor fetal well-being during pregnancy. However, due to the overlap with maternal ECG (MECG) as well as significant external noise, it is challenging to extract weak fetal ECG (FECG) using surface electrodes. In this study, we introduce a novel periodic progressive FastICA peel-off (PPFP) method for noninvasive extraction of weak surface FECG signals, leveraging the two-step FastICA method and a peel-off strategy from the progressive FastICA peel-off (PFP) approach. Specifically, for ECG signals, the periodic constrained FastICA that integrates ECG signal characteristics enables precise extraction of MECG and FECG spike trains. Additionally, a peel-off strategy incorporating SVD waveform reconstruction ensures comprehensive identification of subtle source signals. The performance of the proposed method was examined on public datasets with reference, synthetic data and clinical data, with an F1-scores for FECG extraction on public dataset of 99.59%, on synthetic data with the highest noise level of 99.50%, which are all superior to other comparative methods. Furthermore, clearly periodic and physiologically consistent FECG signals were extracted from clinically collected data. The results indicates that our proposed method has potential and effectiveness to separate MECG and weak FECG from multichannel AECG with high precision in high noise condition, which is of vital importance for ensuring the safety of both the fetus and the mother, as well as the advancement of artificial intelligent clinical monitoring.</description>

      <title>The Efficacy of Conversational Artificial Intelligence in Rectifying the Theory of Mind and Autonomy Biases: Comparative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13813v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: The increasing deployment of Conversational Artificial Intelligence (CAI) in mental health interventions necessitates an evaluation of their efficacy in rectifying cognitive biases and recognizing affect in human-AI interactions. These biases, including theory of mind and autonomy biases, can exacerbate mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety.
  Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of therapeutic chatbots (Wysa, Youper) versus general-purpose language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini Pro) in identifying and rectifying cognitive biases and recognizing affect in user interactions.
  Methods: The study employed virtual case scenarios simulating typical user-bot interactions. Cognitive biases assessed included theory of mind biases (anthropomorphism, overtrust, attribution) and autonomy biases (illusion of control, fundamental attribution error, just-world hypothesis). Responses were evaluated on accuracy, therapeutic quality, and adherence to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) principles, using an ordinal scale. The evaluation involved double review by cognitive scientists and a clinical psychologist.
  Results: The study revealed that general-purpose chatbots outperformed therapeutic chatbots in rectifying cognitive biases, particularly in overtrust bias, fundamental attribution error, and just-world hypothesis. GPT-4 achieved the highest scores across all biases, while therapeutic bots like Wysa scored the lowest. Affect recognition showed similar trends, with general-purpose bots outperforming therapeutic bots in four out of six biases. However, the results highlight the need for further refinement of therapeutic chatbots to enhance their efficacy and ensure safe, effective use in digital mental health interventions. Future research should focus on improving affective response and addressing ethical considerations in AI-based therapy.</description>

      <title>CourseAssist: Pedagogically Appropriate AI Tutor for Computer Science Education</title>

Abstract: The growing enrollments in computer science courses and increase in class sizes necessitate scalable, automated tutoring solutions to adequately support student learning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have demonstrated potential in assisting students through question-answering, educators express concerns over student overreliance, miscomprehension of generated code, and the risk of inaccurate answers. Rather than banning these tools outright, we advocate for a constructive approach that harnesses the capabilities of AI while mitigating potential risks. This poster introduces CourseAssist, a novel LLM-based tutoring system tailored for computer science education. Unlike generic LLM systems, CourseAssist uses retrieval-augmented generation, user intent classification, and question decomposition to align AI responses with specific course materials and learning objectives, thereby ensuring pedagogical appropriateness of LLMs in educational settings. We evaluated CourseAssist against a baseline of GPT-4 using a dataset of 50 question-answer pairs from a programming languages course, focusing on the criteria of usefulness, accuracy, and pedagogical appropriateness. Evaluation results show that CourseAssist significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating its potential to serve as an effective learning assistant. We have also deployed CourseAssist in 6 computer science courses at a large public R1 research university reaching over 500 students. Interviews with 20 student users show that CourseAssist improves computer science instruction by increasing the accessibility of course-specific tutoring help and shortening the feedback loop on their programming assignments. Future work will include extensive pilot testing at more universities and exploring better collaborative relationships between students, educators, and AI that improve computer science learning experiences.</description>

      <title>XEQ Scale for Evaluating XAI Experience Quality Grounded in Psychometric Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10662</link>

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to improve the transparency of autonomous decision-making through explanations. Recent literature has emphasised users' need for holistic "multi-shot" explanations and the ability to personalise their engagement with XAI systems. We refer to this user-centred interaction as an XAI Experience. Despite advances in creating XAI experiences, evaluating them in a user-centred manner has remained challenging. To address this, we introduce the XAI Experience Quality (XEQ) Scale (pronounced "Seek" Scale), for evaluating the user-centred quality of XAI experiences. Furthermore, XEQ quantifies the quality of experiences across four evaluation dimensions: learning, utility, fulfilment and engagement. These contributions extend the state-of-the-art of XAI evaluation, moving beyond the one-dimensional metrics frequently developed to assess single-shot explanations. In this paper, we present the XEQ scale development and validation process, including content validation with XAI experts as well as discriminant and construct validation through a large-scale pilot study. Out pilot study results offer strong evidence that establishes the XEQ Scale as a comprehensive framework for evaluating user-centred XAI experiences.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of LLMs Biases Towards Elite Universities: A Persona-Based Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12801</link>

Abstract: Elite universities are a dream destination for not just students but also top employers who get a supply of amazing talents. When we hear about top universities, the first thing that comes to mind is their academic rigor, prestigious reputation, and highly successful alumni. However, society at large is not just represented by a few elite universities, but several others. We have seen several examples where many, even without formal education, built big businesses. There are various instances in which several people, however talented, couldn't make it to top elite universities because of several resource constraints. For recruitment of candidates, we do see candidates from a few elite universities well represented in top technology companies. However, we found during our study that LLMs go overboard in representing that. This study investigates whether popular LLMs exhibit bias towards elite universities when generating personas for technology industry professionals. We employed a novel persona-based approach to compare the educational background predictions of GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Claude 3 Sonnet with actual data from LinkedIn. The study focused on various roles at Microsoft, Meta, and Google, including VP Product, Director of Engineering, and Software Engineer. We generated 432 personas across the three LLMs and analyzed the frequency of elite universities (Stanford, MIT, UC Berkeley, and Harvard) in these personas compared to LinkedIn data. Results showed that LLMs significantly overrepresented elite universities, with 72.45% of generated personas featuring these institutions, compared to only 8.56% in the actual LinkedIn data. ChatGPT 3.5 exhibited the highest bias, followed by Claude Sonnet 3, while Gemini performed best. This research highlights the need to address educational bias in LLMs and suggests strategies for mitigating such biases in AI-driven recruitment processes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Foundation Models for Online Decisions: HyperAgent with Fast Incremental Uncertainty Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models often struggle with uncertainty when faced with new situations in online decision-making, necessitating scalable and efficient exploration to resolve this uncertainty. We introduce GPT-HyperAgent, an augmentation of GPT with HyperAgent for uncertainty-aware, scalable exploration in contextual bandits, a fundamental online decision problem involving natural language input. We prove that HyperAgent achieves fast incremental uncertainty estimation with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$ per-step computational complexity over $T$ periods under the linear realizable assumption. Our analysis demonstrates that HyperAgent's regret order matches that of exact Thompson sampling in linear contextual bandits, closing a significant theoretical gap in scalable exploration. Empirical results in real-world contextual bandit tasks, such as automated content moderation with human feedback, validate the practical effectiveness of GPT-HyperAgent for safety-critical decisions. Our code is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/szrlee/GPT-HyperAgent/}.</description>
