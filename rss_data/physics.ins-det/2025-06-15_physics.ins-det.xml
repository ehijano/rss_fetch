      <title>Multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a versatile approach to 4D-STEM precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precession of a converged beam during acquisition of a 4D-STEM dataset improves strain, orientation, and phase mapping accuracy by averaging over continuous angles of illumination. Precession experiments usually rely on integrated systems, where automatic alignments lead to fast, high-quality results. The dependence of these experiments on specific hardware and software is evident even when switching to non-integrated detectors on a precession tool, as experimental set-up becomes challenging and time-consuming. Here, we introduce multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a method to perform precession electron diffraction by collecting sequential 4D-STEM scans at different incident beam tilts. The multiple diffraction datasets are averaged together post-acquisition, resulting in a single dataset that minimizes the impact of the curvature and orientation of the Ewald sphere relative to the crystal under study. Our results demonstrate that even four additional tilts improved measurement of material properties, namely strain and orientation, as compared to single-tilt 4D-STEM experiments. We show the versatility and flexibility of our few-tilt precession approach with data collected on a number of microscopes with different hardware configurations and a variety of detectors.</description>

      <title>First complete characterization of an X-Ray tube through combined measurements and Geant4 simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray tubes are sources of X-rays used in various fields, ranging from radiographic imaging in medical physics to the characterization of detectors in particle physics. This article presents a method for the complete characterization of the Mini-X2 X-Ray tube from AMETEK, an X-ray source later used to characterize gas detectors in laboratory. Using data provided by the manual, we derive key operational parameters of the tube, such as the photon emission rate and the relationship between emissive power and supplied current. Based on this characterization, we determine the air dose rate as well as the absorbed dose rate within a given volume at various distances from the source. We derive this dose experimentally, theoretically and through simulations and find good agreement between these. To enable safe operation in a laboratory environment and to support experimental comparisons, a shielding system was developed. Finally, it will be illustrated how the shielding containing the Mini-X2 has been designed, exploiting the simulation power of the Geant4 software.</description>

      <title>Below 100 ps CTR using FastIC+, an ASIC including on-chip digitization for ToF-PET and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the 8-channel FastIC+, a low-power consumption and highly configurable multi-channel front-end ASIC with internal digitization, for the readout of photo-sensors with picosecond time resolution and intrinsic gain. This ASIC, manufactured in 65 nm CMOS technology, can readout positive or negative polarity sensors and provides a digitized measurement of the arrival time and energy of the detected events with a power consumption of 12.5 mW per channel. On-chip digitization is executed by a Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) based on a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) generating 16 phases at 1.28 GHz. The internal TDC introduces a jitter contribution of 31.3 ps FWHM, with minimal impact on timing measurements. When evaluating FastIC+ to readout 3$\times$3 mm$^2$ silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) with a pulsed laser, we achieved a single-photon time resolution (SPTR) of (98 $\pm$ 1) ps FWHM. We also performed time-of-flight positron emission tomography (ToF-PET) experiments using scintillator crystals of different sizes and materials. With LYSO:Ce,Ca crystals of 2.8$\times$2.8$\times$20 mm$^3$ we obtained a coincidence time resolution (CTR) of (130 $\pm$ 1) ps FWHM. With LGSO crystals of 2$\times$2$\times$3 mm$^3$, a CTR of (85 $\pm$ 1) ps FWHM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a CTR below 100 ps using on-chip digitization is reported.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Detector Radioimpurities $^{129}$I and $^{210}$Pb Measured with Accelerator Mass Spectrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium iodide crystals doped with thallium NaI(Tl) can be used as detector material for direct dark matter detection by taking advantage of their particle detection properties of scintillation. In order to achieve this, it is crucial that these crystals are of ultra-high purity. Radioimpurities within the crystals may potentially mimic dark matter signals and thus must be quantified, minimised where possible and distinguished from real events. Abundances of radionuclides $^{129}$I and $^{210}$Pb, which are dominant sources of radioimpurities in NaI(Tl) crystals, were measured using accelerator mass spectrometry at the Australian National University (ANU) and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO). NaI powder chemically processed to AgI, and, for the first time, unprocessed NaI powder, were shown to be suitable as AMS targets. A consistent $^{129}$I/$^{127}$I ratio of (2.0 $\pm$ 0.3) x 10$^{-13}$ was measured in three different commercially available NaI powders. Therefore, it was concluded that the choice of NaI powder has a negligible influence on the $^{129}$I contribution to low-background dark matter experiments. For $^{210}$Pb, different Pb molecular ion species were assessed with PbO$_2^-$ being the preferred species and applied to investigate different lead oxide compounds for their suitability as Pb carriers. A $^{210}$Pb/Pb isotopic ratio of (3.6 $\pm$ $^{1.7}_{1.4}$) x 10$^{-15}$ was measured in Pb$_3$O$_4$ powder. This met the required lower activity limit of $^{210}$Pb when adding 1 mg of stable lead into 1 kg of NaI(Tl) powder with a desired maximum $^{210}$Pb/Pb isotopic ratio of 1 x 10$^{-14}$. These results indicate the suitability of the investigated Pb$_3$O$_4$ as a potential carrier for incorporation with Pb extracted from NaI used for dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Energy Threshold of Phonon-mediated Superconducting Qubit Detectors Operated in an Energy-Relaxation Sensing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the lack of a conclusive detection of WIMP dark matter at the 10 GeV/c$^{2}$ mass scale and above has encouraged development of low-threshold detector technology aimed at probing lighter dark matter candidates. Detectors based on Cooper-pair-breaking sensors have emerged as a promising avenue for this detection due to the low (meV-scale) energy required for breaking a Cooper pair in most superconductors. Among them, devices based on superconducting qubits are interesting candidates for sensing due to their observed sensitivity to broken Cooper pairs. We have developed an end-to-end G4CMP-based simulation framework and have used it to evaluate performance metrics of qubit-based devices operating in a gate-based "energy relaxation" readout scheme, akin to those used in recent studies of qubit sensitivity to ionizing radiation. We find that for this readout scheme, the qubit acts as a phonon sensor with an energy threshold ranging down to $\simeq$0.4 eV for near-term performance parameters.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Pipeline for Track Finding in the Velo at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the next decade, increases in instantaneous luminosity and detector granularity will amplify the amount of data that has to be analysed by high-energy physics experiments, whether in real time or offline, by an order of magnitude. The reconstruction of charged particle tracks, which has always been a crucial element of offline data processing pipelines, must increasingly be deployed from the very first stages of the real time processing to enable experiments to achieve their physics goals. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received a great deal of attention in the community because their computational complexity scales nearly linearly with the number of hits in the detector, unlike conventional algorithms which often scale quadratically or worse. This paper presents ETX4VELO, a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's Vertex Locator, in the context of LHCb's fully GPU-based first-level trigger system, Allen. Currently implemented in Python, ETX4VELO offers the ability to reconstruct tracks with shared hits using a novel triplet-based method. When benchmarked against the traditional track-finding algorithm in Allen, this GNN-based approach not only matches but occasionally surpasses its physics performance. In particular, the fraction of fake tracks is reduced from over 2% to below 1% and the efficiency to reconstruct electrons is improved. While achieving comparable physics performance is a milestone, the immediate priority remains implementing ETX4VELO in Allen in order to determine and optimise its throughput, to meet the demands of this high-rate environment.</description>

      <title>Modeling Athermal Phonons in Novel Materials using the G4CMP Simulation Toolkit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding phonon and charge propagation in superconducting devices plays an important role in both performing low-threshold dark matter searches and limiting correlated errors in superconducting qubits. The Geant4 Condensed Matter Physics (G4CMP) package, originally developed for the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment, models charge and phonon transport within silicon and germanium detectors and has been validated by experimental measurements of phonon caustics, mean charge-carrier drift velocities, and heat pulse propagation times. In this work, we present a concise framework for expanding the capabilities for phonon transport to a number of other novel substrate materials of interest to the dark matter and quantum computing communities, including sapphire (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$), gallium arsenide (GaAs), lithium fluoride (LiF), calcium tungstate (CaWO$_{4}$), and calcium fluoride (CaF$_{2}$). We demonstrate the use of this framework in generating phonon transport properties of these materials and compare these properties with experimentally-determined values where available.</description>

      <title>Measuring Electron Energy in Muon-to-Electron Conversion using Holographic Synchrotron Radiation Emission Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherent conversion of a muon to an electron in a nuclear field has been one of the most powerful methods for searching for charged lepton flavor violation. Recent advancements have significantly enhanced the sensitivity of $\mu \rightarrow e$ searches, primarily driven by advancements in muon beamline design and low-mass tracking detectors, which afford exceptional momentum resolution. Nevertheless, the performance of these detectors is inherently limited by electron scattering and energy loss within detector materials. We propose a {\em holographic} track reconstruction method that leverages synchrotron radiation emitted by electrons to overcome these inevitable limitations. Similar to cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy, which has demonstrated outstanding energy resolutions for low-energy electrons, our technique relies on a precision measurement of cyclotron frequency, but in a regime where photons are emitted stochastically and are projected onto a 2-dimensional inner surface of a solenoidal magnet. We outline the concept of such a massless holographic tracker and the feasibility of employing this innovative detection strategy for $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. We also address pertinent limitations and challenges inherent to the method.</description>

Abstract: This paper describes a new photoelectron emission lifetime detection system. It is based on a recently developed Radio Frequency Timing technique of keV electrons and a 40 MHz, ultrafast pulsed laser. The photoelectron emission lifetimes from gold, monolayer MoS$_2$ and monolayer graphene were measured. As expected, we do not observe delayed electrons from gold, and the time distribution of the produced photoelectrons represents the time resolution of the device, which is $\sim$12~ps. From the graphene, we observed delayed photoelectrons with a lifetime of $\sim$189~ps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The TUCAN (TRIUMF UltraCold Advanced Neutron) Collaboration is completing a new ultracold neutron (UCN) source. The UCN source will deliver UCNs to a neutron electric dipole moment (EDM) experiment. The EDM experiment is projected to be capable of an uncertainty of $1\times 10^{-27}~e$cm, competitive with other planned projects, and a factor of ten more precise than the present world's best. The TUCAN source is based on a UCN production volume of superfluid helium (He-II), held at 1~K, and coupled to a proton-driven spallation target. The production rate in the source is expected to be in excess of $10^7$~UCN/s; since UCN losses can be small in superfluid helium, this should allow us to build up a large number of UCNs. The spallation-driven superfluid helium technology is the principal aspect making the TUCAN project unique. The superfluid production volume was recently cooled, for the first time, and successfully filled with superfluid helium. The design principles of the UCN source are described, along with some of the challenging cryogenic milestones that were recently passed.</description>
