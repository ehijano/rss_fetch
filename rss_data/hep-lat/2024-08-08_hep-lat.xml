      <title>Charmed meson masses and decay constants in the continuum from the tadpole improved clover ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03548v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the determination of the charm quark mass, the masses and decay constants of charmed mesons using thirteen 2+1 flavor full-QCD gauge ensembles at five different lattice spacings $a\in[0.05,0.11]$ fm, 8 pion masses $m_{\pi}\in(130,360)$ MeV, and several values of the strange quark mass, which facilitate us to do the chiral and continuum extrapolation. These ensembles are generated through the stout smeared clover fermion action and Symanzik gauge actions with the tadpole improvement. Using QED-subtracted $D_s$ meson mass and non-perturbative renormalization, we predict the charm quark mass in the continuum with physical light and strange quark masses to be {$m_c(m_c)=1.289(17)$} GeV in $\overline{\textrm{MS}}$ scheme, with the systematic uncertainties from lattice spacing determination, renormalization constant, {and fit ansatz} included. Predictions of the open and close charm mesons using this charm quark mass agree with the experimental value at 0.3\% level uncertainty. We obtained {$D_{(s)}$ decay constants and also by far the most precise $D_{(s)}^*$ decay constants $f_{D^*}=0.2321(43)$ GeV and $f_{D^*_s}=0.2743(34)$ GeV}, with the charm quark improved vector current normalization.</description>

      <title>Transverse force distributions in the proton from lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-spin asymmetries observed in polarised deep-inelastic scattering are important probes of hadron structure. The Sivers asymmetry has been the focus of much attention in QCD phenomenology and is yet to be understood at the quark level. In this Letter, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the spatial distribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton. We determine a spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent force distributions with local forces on the order of 3 GeV/fm. These distributions offer a complementary picture of the Sivers asymmetry in transversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>Investigation of pion-nucleon contributions to nucleon matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate contributions of excited states to nucleon matrix elements computed in lattice QCD by employing, in addition to the standard nucleon interpolating operator, pion-nucleon ($\pi$-$N$) operators. We solve a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) to obtain an optimal interpolating operator that minimizes overlap with the $\pi$-$N$ states. We derive a variant of the standard application of the GEVP method, which allows for constructing 3-point correlation functions using the optimized interpolating operator without requiring the computationally demanding combination that includes $\pi$-$N$ operators in both sink and source. We extract nucleon matrix elements using two twisted mass fermion ensembles, one ensemble generated using pion mass of 346 MeV and one ensemble tuned to reproduce the physical value of the pion mass. Especially, we determine the isoscalar and isovector scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial, and tensor matrix elements. We include results obtained using a range of kinematic setups, including momentum in the sink. Our results using this variational approach are compared with previous results obtained using the same ensembles and multi-state fits without GEVP improvement. We find that for the physical mass point ensemble, the improvement, in terms of suppression of excited states using this method, is most significant for the case of the matrix elements of the isovector axial and pseudoscalar currents.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Effective Theory for Partons in the Spirit of Steven Weinberg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard formulation of parton physics involves light-cone correlations of quark and gluon fields in a hadron, which leads to a widespread impression that it can only be studied through real-time Hamiltonian dynamics or light-front quantization, which are challenged by non-perturbative computations with a pertinent regulator for light-cone/rapidity divergences (or zero modes). As such, standard lattice QCD studies have been limited to indirect parton observables such as first few moments and short-distance correlations, which do not provide the $x$-distributions without solving the model-dependent inverse problem. Here I describe an alternative formulation of partons in terms of equal-time (or Euclidean) correlators, which allows to compute precision-controlled $x$-distribution through lattice QCD simulations. This approach is in accord with Weinberg's pioneering idea of effective field theory as well as Wilson's renormalization group, in which the large hadron momentum serves as a natural cut-off for light-cone/rapidity divergences and can ultimately be eliminated through a method like the ``perfect action'' program in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Fermions, quantum gravity and holography in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a model comprising $N$ flavors of K\"ahler Dirac fermion propagating on a triangulated two dimensional disk which is constrained to have a negative average bulk curvature. Dirichlet boundary conditions are chosen for the fermions. Quantum fluctuations of the geometry are included by summing over all possible triangulations consistent with these constraints. We show in the limit $N\to \infty$ that the partition function is dominated by a regular triangulation of two dimensional hyperbolic space. We use strong coupling expansions and Monte Carlo simulation to show that in this limit boundary correlators of the fermions have a power law dependence on boundary separation as one expects from holography. However we argue that this behavior breaks down for any finite number of massive fields in the thermodynamic limit and quantum fluctuations of the bulk geometry drive the theory into a non-holographic phase. In contrast, for massless fermions we find evidence that the boundary is conformal even for finite $N$. This is consistent with theoretical results in quantum Liouville theory.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of generalized XY model using tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the higher-order tensor renormalization group method to study the two-dimensional generalized XY model that admits integer and half-integer vortices. This model is the deformation of the classical XY model and has a rich phase structure consisting of nematic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases and three transition lines belonging to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) and Ising class. We explore the model for a wide range of temperatures, $T$, and the deformation parameter, $\Delta$, and compute specific heat along with integer and half-integer magnetic susceptibility, finding both BKT-like and Ising-like transitions and the region where they meet.</description>
