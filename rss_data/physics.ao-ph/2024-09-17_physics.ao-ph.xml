      <title>WeatherReal: A Benchmark Based on In-Situ Observations for Evaluating Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, AI-based weather forecasting models have matched or even outperformed numerical weather prediction systems. However, most of these models have been trained and evaluated on reanalysis datasets like ERA5. These datasets, being products of numerical models, often diverge substantially from actual observations in some crucial variables like near-surface temperature, wind, precipitation and clouds - parameters that hold significant public interest. To address this divergence, we introduce WeatherReal, a novel benchmark dataset for weather forecasting, derived from global near-surface in-situ observations. WeatherReal also features a publicly accessible quality control and evaluation framework. This paper details the sources and processing methodologies underlying the dataset, and further illustrates the advantage of in-situ observations in capturing hyper-local and extreme weather through comparative analyses and case studies. Using WeatherReal, we evaluated several data-driven models and compared them with leading numerical models. Our work aims to advance the AI-based weather forecasting research towards a more application-focused and operation-ready approach.</description>

      <title>GPC/m: Global Precipitation Climatology by Machine Learning; Quasi-global, Daily, and One Degree Spatial Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new precipitation dataset that is daily, has a spatial resolution of one degree on a quasi-global scale, and spans more than 42 years, using machine learning techniques. The ultimate goal of this dataset is to provide a homogeneous daily precipitation dataset for several decades without gaps, which is suitable for climate analysis. As a first step, 42 years of daily precipitation data was generated using machine learning techniques. The machine learning methods are supervised learning, and the reference data are estimated precipitation datasets from 2001 to 2020. The three machine learning methods are random forest, gradient-boosted decision trees, and convolutional neural networks. The input data are satellite observations and atmospheric circulations from reanalysis, which are somewhat modified based on knowledge of the climatological background. Using the trained statistical models, we predict back to 1979, when daily precipitation data was almost unavailable globally. The detailed procedures are described in this paper. The produced data have been partially evaluated. However, additional evaluations from different perspectives are needed. The advantages and disadvantages of this precipitation dataset are also discussed. Currently, this GPC/m precipitation dataset version is GPC/m-v1-2024.</description>

      <title>Satellite-Based Quantification of Contrail Radiative Forcing over Europe: A Two-Week Analysis of Aviation-Induced Climate Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aviation's non-CO$_2$ effects, especially the impact of aviation-induced contrails, drive atmospheric changes and can influence climate dynamics. Although contrails are believed to contribute to global warming through their net warming effect, uncertainties persist due to the challenges in accurately measuring their radiative impacts. This study aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between aviation-induced contrails, as observed in Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite imagery, and their impact on radiative forcing (RF) over a two-week study. Results show that while daytime contrails generally have a cooling effect, the higher number of nighttime contrails results in a net warming effect over the entire day. Net RF values for detected contrails range approximately from -8 TW to 2.5 TW during the day and from 0 to 6 TW at night. Our findings also show a 41.03% increase in contrail coverage from January 24-30, 2023, to the same week in 2024, accompanied by a 128.7% rise in contrail radiative forcing (CRF), indicating greater warming from the added contrails. These findings highlight the necessity of considering temporal factors, such as the timing and duration of contrail formation, when assessing their overall warming impact. They also indicate a potential increase in contrail-induced warming from 2023 to 2024, attributable to the rise in contrail coverage. Further investigation into these trends is crucial for the development of effective mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Integrated nowcasting of convective precipitation with Transformer-based models using multi-source data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting is crucial for mitigating the impacts of severe weather events and supporting daily activities. Conventional models predominantly relying on radar data have limited performance in predicting cases with complex temporal features such as convection initiation, highlighting the need to integrate data from other sources for more comprehensive nowcasting. Unlike physics-based models, machine learning (ML)-based models offer promising solutions for efficiently integrating large volumes of diverse data. We present EF4INCA, a spatiotemporal Transformer model for precipitation nowcasting that integrates satellite- and ground-based observations with numerical weather prediction outputs. EF4INCA provides high-resolution forecasts over Austria, accurately predicting the location and shape of precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 1 kilometre and a temporal resolution of 5 minutes, up to 90 minutes ahead. Our evaluation shows that EF4INCA outperforms conventional nowcasting models, including the operational model of Austria, particularly in scenarios with complex temporal features such as convective initiation and rapid weather changes. EF4INCA maintains higher accuracy in location forecasting but generates smoother fields at later prediction times compared to traditional models. Interpretation of our model showed that precipitation products and SEVIRI infrared channels CH7 and CH9 are the most important data streams. These results underscore the importance of combining data from different domains, including physics-based model products, with ML approaches. Our study highlights the robustness of EF4INCA and its potential for improved precipitation nowcasting. We provide access to our code repository, model weights, and the dataset curated for benchmarking, facilitating further development and application.</description>

      <title>High-order accurate structure-preserving finite volume schemes on adaptive moving meshes for shallow water equations: Well-balancedness and positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops high-order accurate, well-balanced (WB), and positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume schemes for shallow water equations on adaptive moving structured meshes. The mesh movement poses new challenges in maintaining the WB property, which not only depends on the balance between flux gradients and source terms but is also affected by the mesh movement. To address these complexities, the WB property in curvilinear coordinates is decomposed into flux source balance and mesh movement balance. The flux source balance is achieved by suitable decomposition of the source terms, the numerical fluxes based on hydrostatic reconstruction, and appropriate discretization of the geometric conservation laws (GCLs). Concurrently, the mesh movement balance is maintained by integrating additional schemes to update the bottom topography during mesh adjustments. The proposed schemes are rigorously proven to maintain the WB property by using the discrete GCLs and these two balances. We provide rigorous analyses of the PP property under a sufficient condition enforced by a PP limiter. Due to the involvement of mesh metrics and movement, the analyses are nontrivial, while some standard techniques, such as splitting high-order schemes into convex combinations of formally first-order PP schemes, are not directly applicable. Various numerical examples validate the high-order accuracy, high efficiency, WB, and PP properties of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Global Lightning-Ignited Wildfires Prediction and Climate Change Projections based on Explainable Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wildfires pose a significant natural disaster risk to populations and contribute to accelerated climate change. As wildfires are also affected by climate change, extreme wildfires are becoming increasingly frequent. Although they occur less frequently globally than those sparked by human activities, lightning-ignited wildfires play a substantial role in carbon emissions and account for the majority of burned areas in certain regions. While existing computational models, especially those based on machine learning, aim to predict lightning-ignited wildfires, they are typically tailored to specific regions with unique characteristics, limiting their global applicability. In this study, we present machine learning models designed to characterize and predict lightning-ignited wildfires on a global scale. Our approach involves classifying lightning-ignited versus anthropogenic wildfires, and estimating with high accuracy the probability of lightning to ignite a fire based on a wide spectrum of factors such as meteorological conditions and vegetation. Utilizing these models, we analyze seasonal and spatial trends in lightning-ignited wildfires shedding light on the impact of climate change on this phenomenon. We analyze the influence of various features on the models using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) frameworks. Our findings highlight significant global differences between anthropogenic and lightning-ignited wildfires. Moreover, we demonstrate that, even over a short time span of less than a decade, climate changes have steadily increased the global risk of lightning-ignited wildfires. This distinction underscores the imperative need for dedicated predictive models and fire weather indices tailored specifically to each type of wildfire.</description>

      <title>Simulating Atmospheric Processes in Earth System Models and Quantifying Uncertainties with Deep Learning Multi-Member and Stochastic Parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning is a powerful tool to represent subgrid processes in climate models, but many application cases have so far used idealized settings and deterministic approaches. Here, we develop stochastic parameterizations with calibrated uncertainty quantification to learn subgrid convective and turbulent processes and surface radiative fluxes of a superparameterization embedded in an Earth System Model (ESM). We explore three methods to construct stochastic parameterizations: 1) a single Deep Neural Network (DNN) with Monte Carlo Dropout; 2) a multi-member parameterization; and 3) a Variational Encoder Decoder with latent space perturbation. We show that the multi-member parameterization improves the representation of convective processes, especially in the planetary boundary layer, compared to individual DNNs. The respective uncertainty quantification illustrates that methods 2) and 3) are advantageous compared to a dropout-based DNN parameterization regarding the spread of convective processes. Hybrid simulations with our best-performing multi-member parameterizations remained challenging and crash within the first days. Therefore, we develop a pragmatic partial coupling strategy to sidestep issues in condensate emulation. We conduct Earth-like stable runs over 5 months with the multi-member parameterizations, while single DNN-based simulations fail within days. Even though our hybrid simulations exhibit biases in thermodynamic fields and precipitation patterns, they reduce biases seen in the traditional convective parameterization of extreme precipitation and its diurnal cycle over tropical continents compared to a superparameterization and observations. Our results show the potential of a new generation of parameterizations using machine learning with realistic uncertainty quantification that improve the representation of subgrid effects and their stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Beyond Ensemble Averages: Leveraging Climate Model Ensembles for Subseasonal Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15856v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Producing high-quality forecasts of key climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, on subseasonal time scales has long been a gap in operational forecasting. This study explores an application of machine learning (ML) models as post-processing tools for subseasonal forecasting. Lagged numerical ensemble forecasts (i.e., an ensemble where the members have different initialization dates) and observational data, including relative humidity, pressure at sea level, and geopotential height, are incorporated into various ML methods to predict monthly average precipitation and two-meter temperature two weeks in advance for the continental United States. For regression, quantile regression, and tercile classification tasks, we consider using linear models, random forests, convolutional neural networks, and stacked models (a multi-model approach based on the prediction of the individual ML models). Unlike previous ML approaches that often use ensemble mean alone, we leverage information embedded in the ensemble forecasts to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, we investigate extreme event predictions that are crucial for planning and mitigation efforts. Considering ensemble members as a collection of spatial forecasts, we explore different approaches to using spatial information. Trade-offs between different approaches may be mitigated with model stacking. Our proposed models outperform standard baselines such as climatological forecasts and ensemble means. In addition, we investigate feature importance, trade-offs between using the full ensemble or only the ensemble mean, and different modes of accounting for spatial variability.</description>
