      <title>Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE): Evaluating an LLM's Willingness to Re-engage in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and evaluate Stated Preference for Interaction and Continued Engagement (SPICE), a simple diagnostic signal elicited by asking a Large Language Model a YES or NO question about its willingness to re-engage with a user's behavior after reviewing a short transcript. In a study using a 3-tone (friendly, unclear, abusive) by 10-interaction stimulus set, we tested four open-weight chat models across four framing conditions, resulting in 480 trials. Our findings show that SPICE sharply discriminates by user tone. Friendly interactions yielded a near-unanimous preference to continue (97.5% YES), while abusive interactions yielded a strong preference to discontinue (17.9% YES), with unclear interactions falling in between (60.4% YES). This core association remains decisive under multiple dependence-aware statistical tests, including Rao-Scott adjustment and cluster permutation tests. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SPICE provides a distinct signal from abuse classification. In trials where a model failed to identify abuse, it still overwhelmingly stated a preference not to continue the interaction (81% of the time). An exploratory analysis also reveals a significant interaction effect: a preamble describing the study context significantly impacts SPICE under ambiguity, but only when transcripts are presented as a single block of text rather than a multi-turn chat. The results validate SPICE as a robust, low-overhead, and reproducible tool for auditing model dispositions, complementing existing metrics by offering a direct, relational signal of a model's state. All stimuli, code, and analysis scripts are released to support replication.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Value Iteration for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with complex dynamical systems that demand interactions at high frequencies or irregular time intervals. Continuous-time RL (CTRL) has emerged as a promising alternative by replacing discrete-time Bellman recursion with differential value functions defined as viscosity solutions of the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman (HJB) equation. While CTRL has shown promise, its applications have been largely limited to the single-agent domain. This limitation stems from two key challenges: (i) conventional solution methods for HJB equations suffer from the curse of dimensionality (CoD), making them intractable in high-dimensional systems; and (ii) even with HJB-based learning approaches, accurately approximating centralized value functions in multi-agent settings remains difficult, which in turn destabilizes policy training. In this paper, we propose a CT-MARL framework that uses physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to approximate HJB-based value functions at scale. To ensure the value is consistent with its differential structure, we align value learning with value-gradient learning by introducing a Value Gradient Iteration (VGI) module that iteratively refines value gradients along trajectories. This improves gradient fidelity, in turn yielding more accurate values and stronger policy learning. We evaluate our method using continuous-time variants of standard benchmarks, including multi-agent particle environment (MPE) and multi-agent MuJoCo. Our results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing continuous-time RL baselines and scales to complex multi-agent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Data Driven Discovery of Emergent Dynamics in Reaction Diffusion Systems from Sparse and Noisy Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven discovery of emergent dynamics is gaining popularity, particularly in the context of reaction-diffusion systems. These systems are widely studied across various fields, including neuroscience, ecology, epidemiology, and several other subject areas that deal with emergent dynamics. A current challenge in the discovery process relates to system identification when there is no prior knowledge of the underlying physics. We attempt to address this challenge by learning Soft Artificial Life (Soft ALife) models, such as Agent-based and Cellular Automata (CA) models, from observed data for reaction-diffusion systems. In this paper, we present findings on the applicability of a conceptual framework, the Data-driven Rulesets for Soft Artificial Life (DRSALife) model, to learn Soft ALife rulesets that accurately represent emergent dynamics in a reaction-diffusion system from observed data. This model has demonstrated promising results for Elementary CA Rule 30, Game of Life, and Vicsek Flocking problems in recent work. To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that explore machine-based Soft ALife ruleset learning and system identification for reaction-diffusion dynamics without any prior knowledge of the underlying physics. Moreover, we provide comprehensive findings from experiments investigating the potential effects of using noisy and sparse observed datasets on learning emergent dynamics. Additionally, we successfully identify the structure and parameters of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) representing these dynamics. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned models are able to predict the emergent dynamics with good accuracy (74%) and exhibit quite robust performance when subjected to Gaussian noise and temporal sparsity.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-loop Learning Through Decentralized Communication Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Information sharing platforms like TripAdvisor and Waze involve human agents as both information producers and consumers. All these platforms operate in a centralized way to collect agents' latest observations of new options (e.g., restaurants, hotels, travel routes) and share such information with all in real time. However, after hearing the central platforms' live updates, many human agents are found selfish and unwilling to further explore unknown options for the benefit of others in the long run. To regulate the human-in-the-loop learning (HILL) game against selfish agents' free-riding, this paper proposes a paradigm shift from centralized to decentralized way of operation that forces agents' local explorations through restricting information sharing. When game theory meets distributed learning, we formulate our decentralized communication mechanism's design as a new multi-agent Markov decision process (MA-MDP), and derive its analytical condition to outperform today's centralized operation. As the optimal decentralized communication mechanism in MA-MDP is NP-hard to solve, we present an asymptotically optimal algorithm with linear complexity to determine the mechanism's timing of intermittent information sharing. Then we turn to non-myopic agents who may revert to even over-explore, and adapt our mechanism design to work. Simulation experiments using real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our decentralized mechanisms for various scenarios.</description>

      <title>DeepVoting: Learning and Fine-Tuning Voting Rules with Canonical Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aggregating agent preferences into a collective decision is an important step in many problems (e.g., hiring, elections, peer review) and across areas of computer science (e.g., reinforcement learning, recommender systems). As Social Choice Theory has shown, the problem of designing aggregation rules with specific sets of properties (axioms) can be difficult, or provably impossible in some cases. Instead of designing algorithms by hand, one can learn aggregation rules, particularly voting rules, from data. However, prior work in this area has required extremely large models or been limited by the choice of preference representation, i.e., embedding. We recast the problem of designing voting rules with desirable properties into one of learning probabilistic functions that output distributions over a set of candidates. Specifically, we use neural networks to learn probabilistic social choice functions. Using standard embeddings from the social choice literature we show that preference profile encoding has significant impact on the efficiency and ability of neural networks to learn rules, allowing us to learn rules faster and with smaller networks than previous work. Moreover, we show that our learned rules can be fine-tuned using axiomatic properties to create novel voting rules and make them resistant to specific types of "attack". Namely, we fine-tune rules to resist a probabilistic version of the No Show Paradox.</description>

      <title>The Sound of Silence in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the classic multi-agent DeGroot model for opinion dynamics to incorporate the Spiral of Silence theory from political science. This theory states that individuals may withhold their opinions when they perceive them to be in the minority. As in the DeGroot model, a community of agents is represented as a weighted directed graph whose edges indicate how much agents influence one another. However, agents whose current opinions are in the minority become silent (i.e., they do not express their opinion). Two models for opinion update are then introduced. In the memoryless opinion model (SOM-), agents update their opinion by taking the weighted average of their non-silent neighbors' opinions. In the memory based opinion model (SOM+), agents update their opinions by taking the weighted average of the opinions of all their neighbors, but for silent neighbors, their most recent opinion is considered. We show that for SOM- convergence to consensus is guaranteed for clique graphs but, unlike for the classic DeGroot, not guaranteed for strongly-connected aperiodic graphs. In contrast, we show that for SOM+ convergence to consensus is not guaranteed even for clique graphs. We showcase our models through simulations offering experimental insights that align with key aspects of the Spiral of Silence theory. These findings reveal the impact of silence dynamics on opinion formation and highlight the limitations of consensus in more nuanced social models.</description>

      <title>Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks for Flexible Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06058v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances have enabled heterogeneous multi-robot teams to learn complex and effective coordination skills. However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a flexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.</description>

      <title>Towards Generalized Routing: Model and Agent Orchestration for Adaptive and Efficient Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and domain-specific AI agents has greatly expanded the ecosystem of AI-powered services. User queries, however, are highly diverse and often span multiple domains and task types, resulting in a complex and heterogeneous landscape. This diversity presents a fundamental routing challenge: how to accurately direct each query to an appropriate execution unit while optimizing both performance and efficiency. To address this, we propose MoMA (Mixture of Models and Agents), a generalized routing framework that integrates both LLM and agent-based routing. Built upon a deep understanding of model and agent capabilities, MoMA effectively handles diverse queries through precise intent recognition and adaptive routing strategies, achieving an optimal balance between efficiency and cost. Specifically, we construct a detailed training dataset to profile the capabilities of various LLMs under different routing model structures, identifying the most suitable tasks for each LLM. During inference, queries are dynamically routed to the LLM with the best cost-performance efficiency. We also introduce an efficient agent selection strategy based on a context-aware state machine and dynamic masking. Experimental results demonstrate that the MoMA router offers superior cost-efficiency and scalability compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Applicability of the Minimal Dominating Set for Influence Maximization in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximization in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilize rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an "AND" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Navigation in Social Mini-Games: Definitions, Taxonomy, and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to navigate constrained and cluttered environments that have high agency (e.g., doorways, hallways, corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs, which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers. However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation, etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly. It also discusses the essential properties of SMG solvers, defines what SMGs are and how they appear in practice, outlines how to evaluate SMG solvers, and highlights the differences between SMG solvers and general navigation systems. The survey concludes with an overview of future directions and open challenges in the field. Our project is open-sourced at https://socialminigames.github.io/.</description>
