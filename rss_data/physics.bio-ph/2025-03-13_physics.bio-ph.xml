      <title>Robustness of the avian compass function described by radical pair model against biomagnetic noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic sensing mechanism proposed to exist in avian eyes functions as a compass that detects the geomagnetic inclination aiding their migration. This mechanism is modeled by a quantum spin model known as the radical pair (RP) model. This model suggests that information about geomagnetic inclination is transmitted as biochemical signals via spin-selective recombination of the RP. However, as a delicate quantum system in a warm and noisy in vivo environment, the RP model is likely to be subject to unavoidable environmental noise. In this study, we develop a model that incorporates environmental magnetic noise, based on a Lindblad-type master equation. Our model includes the type of biological tissue and the temperature of the biological system as parameters, accounting for their effects. The results of numerical calculations indicate that the compass function of the RP model is robust against intrinsic magnetic noise arising from thermal fluctuations in the electromagnetic field within realistic biomagnetic range. However, noise from an environmental magnetic field far exceeding the biological magnetic range, on the order of hundreds to thousands of $\mu$T, significantly affects and disrupts the compass function. This work provides a foundation for quantifying environmental influences on open quantum systems in biological settings and offers a tool for connecting experimental measurements of environmental magnetic fields with quantum noise modeling.</description>

      <title>Novel design of biplanar electrodes in a multiwell plate for transepithelial electrical resistance measurement in 3D cell cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in microphysiological systems have underscored the need for novel sensing and monitoring systems specifically designed for three-dimensional (3D) cell culture. In this article, an original architecture of a cell-culture multiwell plate embedding an impedance spectroscopy monitoring system is presented alongside a fast and straightforward fabrication process that allows scale-up production for further industrial exploitation. Our proposed approach involves a biplanar electrode configuration, enabling real-time and high-throughput impedance spectroscopy measurements through a 3D biological construct. This configuration not only allows for non-invasive electrical characterization of a 3D tissue layer, but also offers the capability to thoroughly analyze and understand the characteristics of any type of biological barrier and 3D tissue. The proof of concept for the developed system has been effectively validated for measuring impedance across both endothelial and mouse myoblast monolayers cultured within a 3D collagen biomimicking matrix. Moreover, transepithelial electrical resistance values, which vary with cell type and duration of cell culture, were effectively determined from the impedance spectra. The obtained results showed that the proposed device allows the monitoring of tight junction and cell layer formation over time without inducing alterations to the cells.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic inference in molecular motors: a Martingale approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular motors are in charge of almost every process in the life cycle of cells, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell locomotion, hence being of crucial importance for understanding the cellular dynamics. However, given their size scales on the order of nanometers, direct measurements are rather challenging, and the information that can be extracted from them is limited. In this work, we propose strategies based on martingale theory in stochastic thermodynamics to infer thermodynamic properties of molecular motors using a limited amount of available information. In particular, we use two recent theoretical results valid for systems arbitrary far of equilibrium: the integral fluctuation theorem (IFT) at stopping times, and a family of bounds to the maximal excursions of entropy production. The potential of these strategies is illustrated with a simple model for the F1-ATPase rotary molecular motor, where our approach is able to estimate several quantities determining the thermodynamics of the motor, such as the rotational work of the motor performed against an externally applied force, or the effective environmental temperature.</description>

      <title>Redefining Fitness: Evolution as a Dynamic Learning Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evolution is the process of optimal adaptation of biological populations to their living environments. This is expressed via the concept of fitness, defined as relative reproductive success. However, it has been pointed out that this definition is incomplete and logically circular. To address this issue, several authors have called for new ways to specify fitness explicitly in terms of the relationship between phenotypes and their environment. Here, we show that fitness, defined as the likelihood function that follows from mapping population dynamics to Bayesian learning, provides a general solution to this problem. We show how probabilistic models of fitness can easily be constructed in this way, and how their averages acquire meaning as information. We also show how this approach leads to powerful tools to analyze challenging problems of evolution in variable environments, game theory, and selection in group-structured populations. The approach is general and creates an explicit bridge between population dynamics under selection, statistical learning theory, and emerging models of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>PolyMorph: Extension of PolyHoop for tissue morphogenesis coupled to chemical signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PolyMorph, a lightweight standalone C++ program that extends its predecessor PolyHoop by a finite-difference solver for multi-component reaction-advection-diffusion equations. PolyMorph simulates two integral parts of tissue morphogenesis in two dimensions: 1) the mechanics of cellular deformation, growth and proliferation, and 2) transport and reaction of an arbitrary number of chemical species. Both of these components are bidirectionally coupled, allowing cells to base their behavior on local information on concentrations and flow, and allowing the chemical transport and reaction kinetics to depend on spatial information such as the local cell type. This bidirectional feedback makes PolyMorph a versatile tool to study a variety of cellular morphogenetic processes such as chemotaxis, cell sorting, tissue patterning with morphogen gradients, Turing patterning, and diffusion- or supply-limited growth with sub-cellular resolution.</description>

      <title>Epithelial layer fluidization by curvature-induced unjamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition of an epithelial layer from a stationary, quiescent state to a highly migratory, dynamic state is required for wound healing, development, and regeneration. This transition, known as the unjamming transition (UJT), is responsible for epithelial fluidization and collective migration. Previous theoretical models have primarily focused on the UJT in flat epithelial layers, neglecting the effects of strong surface curvature characteristic of the epithelium \textit{in vivo}. In this study, we investigate the role of surface curvature on tissue plasticity and cellular migration using a vertex model embedded on a spherical surface. Our findings reveal that increasing curvature promotes the UJT by reducing the energy barriers to cellular rearrangements. Higher curvature favors cell intercalation, mobility, and self-diffusivity, resulting in epithelial structures that are malleable and migratory when small, but become more rigid and stationary as they grow. Together, these results provide a conceptual framework to better understand how cell shape, cell propulsion, and tissue geometry contribute to tissue malleability, remodeling, and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Resolving shortwave and longwave irradiation distributions across the human body in outdoor built environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outdoor built environments can be designed to enhance thermal comfort, yet the relationship between the two is often assessed in whole-body terms, overlooking the asymmetric nature of thermal interactions between the human body and its surroundings. Moreover, the radiative component of heat exchange-dominant in hot and dry climates-is typically lumped into a single artificial metric, the mean radiant temperature, rather than being resolved into its shortwave and longwave spectral components. The shortwave irradiation distribution on the human body is often highly anisotropic, causing localized thermal discomfort in outdoor environments. However, no existing methods effectively quantify shortwave and longwave irradiation distributions on the human body. To address this gap, we developed two methods to quantify these processes. The first approach uses an outdoor thermal manikin with a white-coated side, enabling the separation of spectral components by subtracting measurements from symmetrically corresponding surface zones of tan color. The second hybrid approach converts radiometer measurements in six directions into boundary conditions for computational thermal manikin simulations. We evaluated irradiation distributions for various body parts using both methods during outdoor measurements across sunny, partially shaded, and fully shaded sites under warm to extremely hot conditions. In most cases, the two methods produced closely aligned results, with divergences highlighting their respective strengths and limitations. Additionally, we used the manikin to quantify irradiation attenuation provided by five long-sleeve shirts with colors ranging from white to black. These advanced methods can be integrated with airflow and thermoregulatory modeling to optimize outdoor built environments for enhanced human thermal comfort.</description>

      <title>Evolution of human cognition required Einstein's gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe an unexpected anthropic fine-tuning of gravity: human cognition arose on Earth only because the laws of gravity included gravitational waves. Their link is the heat from decays of the radioactive isotopes U-238 and Th-232, which were synthesized mainly in rare explosive mergers of binary neutron stars, brought about by the loss of orbital energy to gravitational radiation. This heat, released in Earth's interior, has (1) maintained plate tectonics and (2) likely helped keep Earth's iron core molten. The core's magnetic field has protected all life from annihilation by the solar wind. More surprisingly, relative brain size, a proxy for cognition, has seen two sharp increases, first for mammals and then for humans, both attributed by evolutionary biologists to adaptations to major climatic changes caused by specific tectonic events. After the second event, the joining of North and South America, human brain size grew from chimpanzee levels to modern ones. If the laws of gravity had not included gravitational waves, humans would not be capable of studying the laws of gravity.</description>
