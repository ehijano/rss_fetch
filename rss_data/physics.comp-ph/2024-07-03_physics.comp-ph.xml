      <title>Simple proof that there is no sign problem in Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations of fermions in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is widely known that there is no sign problem in Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of fermions in one dimension. Yet, as far as the author is aware, there is no direct proof of this in the literature. This work shows that the $sign$ of the $N$-fermion anti-symmetric free propagator is given by the product of all possible pairs of particle separations, or relative displacements. For a non-vanishing closed-loop product of such propagators, as required by PIMC, all relative displacements from adjacent propagators are paired into perfect squares, and therefore the loop product must be positive, but only in one dimension. By comparison, permutation sampling, which does not evaluate the determinant of the anti-symmetric propagator exactly, remains plagued by a low-level sign problem, even in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes Deployment Options for On-Prem Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Kubernetes container orchestration platform has become essential to many scientific workflows. Despite its popularity, deploying a production-ready Kubernetes cluster on-premises can be challenging for system administrators. Many of the proprietary integrations that application developers take for granted in commercial cloud environments must be replaced with alternatives when deployed locally. This article will compare three popular deployment strategies for sites deploying Kubernetes on-premise: Kubeadm with Kubespray, OpenShift / OKD and Rancher via K3S/RKE2.</description>

      <title>Learning tensor networks with tensor cross interpolation: new algorithms and libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor cross interpolation (TCI) algorithm is a rank-revealing algorithm for decomposing low-rank, high-dimensional tensors into tensor trains/matrix product states (MPS). TCI learns a compact MPS representation of the entire object from a tiny training data set. Once obtained, the large existing MPS toolbox provides exponentially fast algorithms for performing a large set of operations. We discuss several improvements and variants of TCI. In particular, we show that replacing the cross interpolation by the partially rank-revealing LU decomposition yields a more stable and more flexible algorithm than the original algorithm. We also present two open source libraries, xfac in Python/C++ and TensorCrossInterpolation.jl in Julia, that implement these improved algorithms, and illustrate them on several applications. These include sign-problem-free integration in large dimension, the superhigh-resolution quantics representation of functions, the solution of partial differential equations, the superfast Fourier transform, the computation of partition functions, and the construction of matrix product operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The suitability of a range of interatomic potentials for elemental tin was evaluated in order to identify an appropriate potential for modeling the stanene (2D tin) allotropes. Structural and mechanical properties of the flat (F), low-buckled (LB), high-buckled (HB), full dumbbell (FD), trigonal dumbbell (TD), honeycomb dumbbell (HD) and large honeycomb dumbbell (LHD) monolayer tin (stanene) phases, were gained by means of the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular statics (MS) calculations with ten different Tersoff, modified embedded atom method (MEAM) and machine-learning-based (ML-IAP) interatomic potentials. A systematic quantitative comparison and discussion of the results are reported.</description>

      <title>Numerical method for the magnetic vector potential in incompressible magnetohydrodynamic flows and the conservation properties of magnetic helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows requires accurate predictions of the Lorentz force and energy conversion. Total energy, cross-helicity, and magnetic helicity can be used to investigate energy conservation properties in inviscid MHD flows. However, the conservation property of magnetic helicity has not been fully clarified using the magnetic vector potential equation. This study presents a numerical method to simultaneously relax magnetic vector and electric potentials for incompressible MHD flows using a conservative finite difference scheme that discretely conserves total energy. First, it was proven that the transport equations of total energy, cross-helicity, and magnetic helicity can be discretely derived from the equations of momentum, magnetic flux density, and magnetic vector potential, thereby elucidating the conservation properties of these quantities. Subsequently, five models for steady and unsteady problems were analyzed to verify the accuracy and convergence of the proposed numerical method. Additionally, the computational approach involving the magnetic vector and electric potentials was validated. A comparison of the calculated results with exact solutions in the analysis of one- and two-dimensional flow models and Hartmann flow further validated the numerical method. Unsteady analyses of two- and three-dimensional decaying vortices were performed. The ideal periodic inviscid MHD flow exhibited good conservation properties for total energy and cross-helicity. Magnetic helicity was discretely preserved even in three-dimensional flow. Furthermore, in viscous flow, the attenuation trends of total energy, cross-helicity, and magnetic helicity aligned with the exact solution. The numerical method accurately captured the decay trends of energy. Thus, the proposed method can facilitate the investigation of energy conservation and conversion in compressible MHD flows.</description>

      <title>Realistic binary neutron star initial data with Elliptica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces the Elliptica pseudo-spectral code for generating initial data of binary neutron star systems. Building upon the recent Elliptica code update, we can now construct initial data using not only piecewise polytropic equations of state, but also tabulated equations of state for these binary systems. Furthermore, the code allows us to endow neutron stars within the binary system with spins. These spins can have a magnitude close to the mass shedding limit and can point in any direction.</description>

      <title>Switchable Ferroelectricity in Subnano Silicon Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements underscore the critical need to develop ferroelectric materials compatible with silicon. We systematically explore possible ferroelectric silicon quantum films and discover a low-energy variant (hex-OR-2*2-P) with energy just 1 meV/atom above the ground state (hex-OR-2*2). Both hex-OR-2*2 and hex-OR-2*2-P are confirmed to be dynamically and mechanically stable semiconductors with indirect gaps of 1.323 eV and 1.311 eV, respectively. The ferroelectric hex-OR-2*2-P exhibits remarkable in-plane spontaneous polarization up to 120 Pc/m and is protected by a potential barrier (13.33 meV/atom) from spontaneously transitioning to hex-OR-22. To simulate the switching ferroelectricity in electric fields of the single-element silicon bilayer, we develop a method that simultaneously learns interatomic potentials and Born effective charges (BEC) in a single equivariant model with a physically informed loss. Our method demonstrates good performance on several ferroelectrics. Simulations of hex-OR-2*2-P silicon suggest a depolarization temperature of approximately 300 K and a coercive field of about 0.05 V/{\AA}. These results indicate that silicon-based ferroelectric devices are feasible, and the ground state phase of the silicon bilayer (hex-OR-2*2) is an ideal system. Our findings highlight the promise of pure silicon ferroelectric materials for future experimental synthesis and applications in memory devices, sensors, and energy converters.</description>

      <title>Network Theory in Galaxy Distributions: The Coma Supercluster Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use the theory of spatial networks to analyze galaxy distributions. The aim is to develop new approaches to study the spatial galaxy environment properties by means of the network parameters. We investigate how each of the network parameters (degree, closeness and betweeness centrality; diameter; giant component; transitivity) map the cluster structure and properties. We measure the network parameters of galaxy samples comprising the Coma Supercluster and 4 regions in their neighborhood ($z&lt;0.0674$) using the catalog produced by \citet{tempel2014flux}. For comparison we repeat the same procedures for Random Geometric Graphs and Segment Cox process, generated with the same dimensions and mean density of nodes. We found that there is a strong correlation between degree centrality and the normalized environmental density. Also, at high degrees there are more elliptical than spiral galaxies, which confirms the density-morphology relation. The mean degree as a function of the connection radius is an estimator of the count-of-spheres and consequently provides the correlation dimension as a function of the connection radius. The correlation dimension indicates high clustering at scales indicated by the network diameter. Further, at this scales, high values of betweeness centrality characterize galaxy bridges connecting dense regions, tracing very well the filamentary structures. Then, since galaxies with the highest closeness centrality belongs to the largest components of the network, associated to supercluster regions, we can produce a catalog of superclusters only by extracting the largest connected components of the network. Establishing the correlation between the well-studied normalized environmental densities and the parameters of the network theory allows us to develop alternative tools to the study of the large-scale structures.</description>

      <title>PINNs-MPF: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Multi-Phase-Field Simulation of Interface Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks to handle MultiPhase-Field simulations of microstructure evolution. It has been showcased that a combination of optimization techniques extended and adapted from the PINNs literature, and the introduction of specific techniques inspired by the MPF Method background, is required. The numerical resolution is realized through a multi-variable time-series problem by using fully discrete resolution. Within each interval, space, time, and phases are treated separately, constituting discrete subdomains. An extended multi-networking concept is implemented to subdivide the simulation domain into multiple batches, with each batch associated with an independent Neural Network trained to predict the solution. To ensure efficient interaction across different phasesand in the spatio-temporal-phasic subdomain, a Master NN handles efficient interaction among the multiple networks, as well as the transfer of learning in different directions. A set of systematic simulations with increasing complexity was performed, that benchmarks various critical aspects of MPF simulations, including different geometries, types of interface dynamics and the evolution of an interfacial triple junction. A comprehensive approach is adopted to specifically focus the attention on the interfacial regions through an automatic and dynamic meshing process, significantly simplifying the tuning of hyper-parameters and serving as a fundamental key for addressing MPF problems using Machine Learning. The pyramidal training approach is proposed to the PINN community as a dual-impact method: it facilitates the initialization of training and allows an extended transfer of learning. The proposed PINNs-MPF framework successfully reproduces benchmark tests with high fidelity and Mean Squared Error loss values ranging from 10$^{-4}$ to 10$^{-6}$ compared to ground truth solutions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Matching the Self-Consistent Expansion to Approximate the Modified Bessel Functions of the Second Kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-consistent expansion (SCE) is a powerful technique for obtaining perturbative solutions to problems in statistical physics but it suffers from a subtle problem - too much freedom! The SCE can be used to generate an enormous number of approximations but distinguishing the superb approximations from the deficient ones can only be achieved after the fact by comparison to experimental or numerical results. Here, we propose a method of using the SCE to a priori obtain uniform approximations, namely asymptotic matching. If the asymptotic behaviour of a problem can be identified, then the approximations generated by the SCE can be tuned to asymptotically match the desired behaviour and this can be used to obtain uniform approximations over the entire domain of consideration, without needing to resort to empirical comparisons. We demonstrate this method by applying it to the task of obtaining uniform approximations of the modified Bessel functions of the second kind, $K_\alpha(x)$.</description>

      <title>Hypersonic Boundary Layer Transition and Heat Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypersonic boundary layer transition using high-order methods for direct numerical simulations (DNS) is largely unexplored, although a few references exist in the literature. Experimental data in the hypersonic regime are scarce, while almost all existing hypersonic codes have low-order accuracy, which could lead to erroneous results in long-time integration and at high Reynolds numbers. Here, we focus on the transition from laminar to turbulent flow, where the Nusselt number may be five times or higher than the Nusselt number in the turbulent regime. The hypersonic flow regime must be modeled accurately using realistic chemistry to predict heat flux on the surface correctly. In this study, we simulate hypersonic boundary layer transition on a flat plate to compute the thermal and shear stresses on the wall. The domain is initialized with a laminar Blasius solution of compressible boundary layer equations. The transition to turbulence is induced using suction and blowing from a thin strip on the wall. Sponge regions are defined at the inflow and outflow boundaries to eliminate the solution contamination due to the reflections of the boundary conditions. In the spanwise direction, periodic boundary conditions are imposed. The numerical method applied here is a sixth-order compact finite difference in the interior of the domain coupled with a fourth-order Runge-Kutta time-stepping scheme for a structured Cartesian grid using staggered variables. The base finite difference code can perform simulations of non-equilibrium hypersonic flows. The numerical scheme is stabilized using the approximate deconvolution model (ADM) and artificial diffusion coefficients. We investigated the effect of non-equilibrium chemistry on the non-linear instability growth with hypersonic boundary layers. We also quantify thermal loads during the boundary layer laminar to turbulent transition for Mach number 10.</description>

      <title>Exploring the parameter dependence of atomic minima with implicit differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interatomic potentials are essential to go beyond ab initio size limitations, but simulation results depend sensitively on potential parameters. Forward propagation of parameter variation is key for uncertainty quantification, whilst backpropagation has found application for emerging inverse problems such as fine-tuning or targeted design. Here, the implicit derivative of functions defined as a fixed point is used to Taylor expand the energy and structure of atomic minima in potential parameters, evaluating terms via automatic differentiation, dense linear algebra or a novel sparse operator approach. The latter allows efficient forward and backpropagation through relaxed structures of arbitrarily large systems. The implicit expansion accurately predicts lattice distortion and defect formation energies and volumes with classical and machine-learning potentials, enabling high-dimensional uncertainty propagation without prohibitive overhead. We then show how the implicit derivative can be used to solve challenging inverse problems, minimizing an implicit loss to fine-tune potentials and stabilize solute-induced structural rearrangements at dislocations in tungsten.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07103v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of biomolecular complexes, e.g., of protein-ligand (un)binding, requires the understanding of paths such systems take between metastable states. In MD simulation data, paths are usually not observable per se, but need to be inferred from simulation trajectories. Here we present a novel approach to cluster trajectories based on a community detection algorithm that requires the definition of only a single free parameter. Using the streptavidin-biotin complex as benchmark system and the A\textsubscript{2a} adenosine receptor in complex with the inhibitor ZM241385 as an elaborate application, we demonstrate how such clusters of trajectories correspond to pathways, and how the approach helps in the identification of reaction coordinates for a considered (un)binding process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generative diffusion model specifically tailored to the discovery of surface structures. The generative model takes into account substrate registry and periodicity by including masked atoms and $z$-directional confinement. Using a rotational equivariant neural network architecture, we design a method that trains a denoiser-network for diffusion alongside a force-field for guided sampling of low-energy surface phases. An effective data-augmentation scheme for training the denoiser-network is proposed to scale generation far beyond structure sizes represented in the training data. We showcase the generative model by investigating multiple surface systems and propose an atomistic structure model for a previously unknown silver-oxide domain-boundary of unprecedented size.</description>

      <title>Portable, Massively Parallel Implementation of a Material Point Method for Compressible Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent evolution of software and hardware technologies is leading to a renewed computational interest in Particle-In-Cell (PIC) methods such as the Material Point Method (MPM). Indeed, provided some critical aspects are properly handled, PIC methods can be cast in formulations suitable to the requirements of data locality and fine-grained parallelism of modern hardware accelerators as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). Such a rapid and continuous technological development increases also the importance of generic and portable implementations. While continuum mechanics simulations have already shown the capabilities of MPM on a wide range of phenomena, the use of the method in compressible fluid dynamics is less frequent. In this paper we present a portable, highly parallel, GPU based MPM solver for compressible gas dynamics. The implementation aims to reach a good compromise between portability and efficiency and to give a first assessment of the potential of this approach in reproducing strongly compressible gas flows, also taking into account solid obstacles. The proposed model constitutes a first step towards the development of a monolithic MPM solver for Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) problems at all Mach numbers up to the supersonic regime.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Representations of Multiphase Equations of State</title>

Abstract: Equations of State model relations between thermodynamic variables and are ubiquitous in scientific modelling, appearing in modern day applications ranging from Astrophysics to Climate Science. The three desired properties of a general Equation of State model are adherence to the Laws of Thermodynamics, incorporation of phase transitions, and multiscale accuracy. Analytic models that adhere to all three are hard to develop and cumbersome to work with, often resulting in sacrificing one of these elements for the sake of efficiency. In this work, two deep-learning methods are proposed that provably satisfy the first and second conditions on a large-enough region of thermodynamic variable space. The first is based on learning the generating function (thermodynamic potential) while the second is based on structure-preserving, symplectic neural networks, respectively allowing modifications near or on phase transition regions. They can be used either "from scratch" to learn a full Equation of State, or in conjunction with a pre-existing consistent model, functioning as a modification that better adheres to experimental data. We formulate the theory and provide several computational examples to justify both approaches, and highlight their advantages and shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the Rodeo Algorithm on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.07747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rodeo algorithm is an efficient algorithm for eigenstate preparation and eigenvalue estimation for any observable on a quantum computer. This makes it a promising tool for studying the spectrum and structure of atomic nuclei as well as other fields of quantum many-body physics. The only requirement is that the initial state has sufficient overlap probability with the desired eigenstate. While it is exponentially faster than well-known algorithms such as phase estimation and adiabatic evolution for eigenstate preparation, it has yet to be implemented on an actual quantum device. In this work, we apply the rodeo algorithm to determine the energy levels of a random one-qubit Hamiltonian, resulting in a relative error of $0.08\%$ using mid-circuit measurements on the IBM Q device Casablanca. This surpasses the accuracy of directly-prepared eigenvector expectation values using the same quantum device. We take advantage of the high-accuracy energy determination and use the Hellmann-Feynman theorem to compute eigenvector expectation values for a different random one-qubit observable. For the Hellmann-Feynman calculations, we find a relative error of $0.7\%$. We conclude by discussing possible future applications of the rodeo algorithm for multi-qubit Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Generalization of the Perdew-Zunger Self-Interaction Correction: a Way Out of Multiple Minima and Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Perdew-Zunger (PZ) self-interaction correction (SIC) is an established tool to correct unphysical behavior in density functional approximations. Yet, PZ-SIC is well-known to sometimes break molecular symmetries. An example of this is the benzene molecule, for which PZ-SIC predicts a symmetry-broken electron density and molecular geometry, since the method does not describe the two possible Kekul\'e structures on an even footing, leading to local minima [Lehtola et al, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2016, 12, 3195]. PZ-SIC is often implemented with Fermi-L\"owdin orbitals (FLOs), yielding the FLO-SIC method, which likewise has issues with symmetry breaking and local minima [Trepte et al, J. Chem. Phys. 2021, 155, 224109].
  In this work, we propose a generalization of PZ-SIC - the ensemble PZ-SIC (E-PZ-SIC) method - which shares the asymptotic computational scaling of PZ-SIC (albeit with an additional prefactor). E-PZ-SIC is straightforwardly applicable to various molecules, merely requiring one to average the self-interaction correction over all possible Kekul\'e structures, in line with chemical intuition. We showcase the implementation of E-PZ-SIC with FLOs, as the resulting E-FLO-SIC method is easy to realize on top of an existing implementation of FLO-SIC. We show that E-FLO-SIC indeed eliminates symmetry breaking, reproducing a symmetric electron density and molecular geometry for benzene. The ensemble approach suggested herein could also be employed within approximate or locally scaled variants of PZ-SIC and their FLO-SIC versions.</description>
