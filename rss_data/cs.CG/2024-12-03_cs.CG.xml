      <title>A Hierarchical Heuristic for Clustered Steiner Trees in the Plane with Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Euclidean Steiner trees are relevant to model minimal networks in real-world applications ubiquitously. In this paper, we study the feasibility of a hierarchical approach embedded with bundling operations to compute multiple and mutually disjoint Euclidean Steiner trees that avoid clutter and overlapping with obstacles in the plane, which is significant to model the decentralized and the multipoint coordination of agents in constrained 2D domains. Our computational experiments using arbitrary obstacle configuration with convex and non-convex geometries show the feasibility and the attractive performance when computing multiple obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees in the plane. Our results offer the mechanisms to elucidate new operators for obstacle-avoiding Steiner trees.</description>

      <title>A Survey and Benchmark of Automatic Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13656v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive survey and benchmark of both traditional and learning-based methods for surface reconstruction from point clouds. This task is particularly challenging for real-world acquisitions due to factors such as noise, outliers, non-uniform sampling, and missing data. Traditional approaches often simplify the problem by imposing handcrafted priors on either the input point clouds or the resulting surface, a process that can require tedious hyperparameter tuning. In contrast, deep learning models have the capability to directly learn the properties of input point clouds and desired surfaces from data. We study the influence of handcrafted and learned priors on the precision and robustness of surface reconstruction techniques. We evaluate various time-tested and contemporary methods in a standardized manner. When both trained and evaluated on point clouds with identical characteristics, the learning-based models consistently produce higher-quality surfaces compared to their traditional counterparts -- even in scenarios involving novel shape categories. However, traditional methods demonstrate greater resilience to the diverse anomalies commonly found in real-world 3D acquisitions. For the benefit of the research community, we make our code and datasets available, inviting further enhancements to learning-based surface reconstruction.
