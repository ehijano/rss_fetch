      <title>Influence of the free surface on turbulent kinetic energy in the wake of a full ship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is a measure for unsteady loads and important regarding the design of e.g. propellers or energy-saving devices. While simulations are often done for a double-body, using a symmetry condition, experiments and the final product have a free surface. Simulations with and without free surface are carried out for the Japan Bulk Carrier, comparing TKE in the vortex cores. The reliability of finding the vortex centers is discussed. As the fine meshes show an unexpected trend for the TKE, a detailed investigation is done, mainly to exclude method-related drawbacks from using a hybrid URANS/ LES model. It is found that a shift in vortex-core positions distorts the results whereby the experimental center positions which are referenced are questionable. Using a fixed position for all cases improves comparability and gives a different picture. Thereupon the medium meshes were enhanced in such a way that one of the refinement boxes was extended further forward, now showing much better agreement with the fine meshes. TKE is then portrayed as integral quantity and shows no significant difference between the simulations with and without free surface. However, the structure itself is influenced by the surface in a way which alters local characteristics.</description>

      <title>Study of the influence of instability wave scattering on the efficiency of jet noise shielding within the geometric theory of diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents the results of a theoretical study of the noise shielding effect of a subsonic turbulent jet located near a rigid screen. The developed theoretical model, based on the methods of the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD), takes into account the effects of scattering of the hydrodynamic fluctuations of the jet near field at the edges of the screen and diffraction of acoustic perturbations generated by small-scale turbulence. Small-scale turbulent noise radiating pulsations are described within the framework of the correlation theory of jet noise in the form of compact quadrupole sources distributed along the jet axis. Hydrodynamic near-field fluctuations are approximated as a superposition of Kelvin-Helmholtz instability wave packets of different azimuthal numbers. Typical parameters of both types of fluctuations are adjusted using experimental data on the near and far fields of a free jet issuing from a profiled nozzle with a diameter of 0.04 m at a velocity of 181 m/s. The result of the jet noise shielding efficiency calculation, using the developed model, is in good agreement with the experimental data obtained for the jet-plate configuration, including correct reproduction of the low-frequency noise amplification (jet-plate installation noise) and the effect of high-frequency noise decrease (shielding itself).</description>

      <title>Forces and grain-grain contacts in bidisperse beds sheared by viscous fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Gonzalez et al., 2023), we investigated the motion of grains within a granular bed sheared by a viscous fluid, and showed how segregation and hardening occur in the fluid- (bedload) and solid-like (creep) regions. In this paper, we inquire further into the mechanisms leading to grain segregation in a bidisperse bed, and how the forces are distributed. For that, we carried out numerical simulations at the grain scale by using CFD-DEM (computational fluid dynamics-discrete element method), with which we were able to track the positions, velocities, forces, and solid contacts underwent by each grain. We show that during the upward motion of large grains the direct action of fluid forces is significant in the middle and upper parts of the bedload layer, while only contact forces are significant in the creep layer and lower part of the bedload layer. We also show that in all cases the particles experience a moment about a -45 degrees contact point (with respect to the horizontal plane) when migrating upward, whether entrained by other contacts or directly by the fluid. In addition, we show the variations in the average solid-solid contacts, and how forces caused either by solid-solid contacts or directly by the fluid are distributed within the bed. Our results provide the relationship between force propagation and reorganization of grains in sheared beds, explaining mechanisms found, for example, in river beds and landslides.</description>

      <title>New Higher-Order Super-Compact Scheme for Enhanced Three-Dimensional Heat Transfer with Nanofluid and Conducting Fins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a new higher-order super-compact (HOSC) finite difference scheme for analyzing enhanced heat transfer of three-dimensional (3D) nanofluid natural convection in a cubic cavity. The unique contribution of the present work lies in the extension of the higher-order super-compact finite difference scheme to examine the natural convection of nanofluid in the 3D cavity. This numerical approach achieves fourth-order spatial accuracy and second-order temporal accuracy. `Super-compact' term signifies its efficiency, utilizing 19 grid points at the current time level $(n^{th}$ time level$)$ and just seven grid points at the subsequent time level $((n + 1)^{th}$ time level$)$ around which the finite difference discretization is made. The nanoparticle volume fraction is maintained up to 0.04 (4\%) to ensure the mixture exhibits Newtonian behavior. The newly developed numerical scheme is validated by qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing benchmark results. The scheme is then applied to investigate fluid flow and heat transfer phenomena in a Cu-water nanofluid-filled cavity over a range of Rayleigh numbers ($10^2 \leq Ra \leq 10^5$). In addition to introducing the new HOSC scheme for the convection of nanofluids, we examine two cases: the natural convection of nanofluid in a simple 3D cavity, and a configuration incorporating two aluminum conducting fins on the heated wall to further enhance the heat transfer rate. Results are presented through isotherms, streamlines, local Nusselt numbers, and average Nusselt numbers for both the considered cases and compared their results. It is found that the addition of nanoparticles or conducting fins does not always lead to enhanced heat transfer rates. Instead, the effectiveness of these enhancements is highly dependent on a range of parameters, which are thoroughly examined and discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>A Study of Spherical and Sessile Droplet Dynamics by Fluctuating Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the mesoscopic dynamics of droplets formed by phase separated fluids at nanometer scales where thermal fluctuations are significant. Both spherical droplets fully immersed in a second fluid and sessile droplets which are also in contact with a solid surface are studied. Our model combines a Cahn-Hillard formulation with incompressible fluctuating hydrodynamics; for sessile droplets the fluid-solid contact angle is specified as a boundary condition. Deterministic simulations with an applied body force are used to measure the droplets' mobility from which a diffusion coefficient is obtained using the Einstein relation. Stochastic simulations are independently used to obtain a diffusion coefficient from a linear fit of the variance of a droplet's position with time. In some scenarios these two measurements give the same value but not in the case of a spherical droplet initialized near a slip wall or in the case of sessile droplets with large contact angles (greater than 90 degrees) on both slip and no-slip surfaces.</description>

      <title>On the solutions of a factorized wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-distance transmission of energy by waves is a key mechanism for many natural processes. It becomes possible when the inhomogeneous medium is arranged in such a manner that it enables a specific type of waves to propagate with virtually no reflection or scattering. If the corresponding wave equation admits factorization, at least one of the waves it describes propagates without reflection. The paper is devoted to searching for conditions under which both solutions of a one-dimensional factorized wave equation of the second order describe traveling waves, that is, waves propagating without reflection. Possible variants of wave structure are found and the results are compared with those obtained in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Turbulent pipe flow with spherical particles: drag as a function of particle size and volume fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspensions of finite-size solid particles in a turbulent pipe flow are found in many industrial and technical flows. Due to the ample parameter space consisting of particle size, concentration, density and Reynolds number, a complete picture of the particle-fluid interaction is still lacking. Pressure drop predictions are often made using viscosity models only considering the bulk solid volume fraction. For the case of turbulent pipe flow laden with neutrally buoyant spherical particles, we investigate the pressure drop and overall drag (friction factor), fluid velocity and particle distribution in the pipe. We use a combination of experimental (MRV) and numerical (DNS) techniques and a continuum flow model. We find that the particle size and the bulk flow rate influence the mean fluid velocity, velocity fluctuations and the particle distribution in the pipe for low flow rates. However, the effects of the added solid particles diminish as the flow rate increases. We created a master curve for drag change compared to single-phase flow for the particle-laden cases. This curve can be used to achieve more accurate friction factor predictions than the traditional modified viscosity approach that does not account for particle size.</description>

      <title>Compressible turbulent convection at very high Rayleigh numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transport in highly turbulent convection is not well understood. In this paper, we simulate compressible convection in a box of aspect ratio 4 using computationally-efficient MacCormack-TVD finite difference method on single and multi-GPUs, and reach very high Rayleigh number ($\mathrm{Ra}$) -- $10^{15}$ in two dimensions and $10^{11}$ in three dimensions. We show that the Nusselt number $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{0.3}$ (classical scaling) that differs strongly from the ultimate-regime scaling, which is $\mathrm{Nu} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$. The bulk temperature drops adiabatically along the vertical even for high $\mathrm{Ra}$, which is in contrast to the constant bulk temperature in Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection (RBC). Unlike RBC, the density decreases with height. In addition, the vertical pressure-gradient ($-dp/dz$) nearly matches the buoyancy term ($\rho g$). But, the difference, $-dp/dz-\rho g$, is equal to the nonlinear term that leads to Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re} \propto \mathrm{Ra}^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Soliton Dynamics over a Disordered Topography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the dynamics of a soliton propagating on the surface of a fluid in a 4-m-long canal with a random or periodic bottom topography. Using a full space-and-time resolved wavefield measurement, we evidence, for the first time experimentally, how the soliton is affected by the disorder, in the context of Anderson localization, and how localization depends on nonlinearity. For weak soliton amplitudes, the localization length is found in quantitative agreement with a linear shallow-water theory. For higher amplitudes, this spatial attenuation of the soliton amplitude is found to be enhanced. Behind the leading soliton slowed down by the topography, different experimentally unreported dynamics occur: Fission into backward and forward nondispersive pulses for the periodic case, and scattering into dispersive waves for the random case. Our findings open doors to potential applications regarding ocean coastal protection against large-amplitude waves.</description>

      <title>Ghost states underlying spatial and temporal patterns: how non-existing invariant solutions control nonlinear dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to a saddle-node bifurcation, when two invariant solutions collide and disappear, the behavior of a dynamical system can closely resemble that of a solution which is no longer present at the chosen parameter value. For bifurcating equilibria in low-dimensional ODEs, the influence of such 'ghosts' on the temporal behavior of the system, namely delayed transitions, has been studied previously. We consider spatio-temporal PDEs and characterize the phenomenon of ghosts by defining representative state-space structures, which we term 'ghost states,' as minima of appropriately chosen cost functions. Using recently developed variational methods, we can compute and parametrically continue ghost states of equilibria, periodic orbits, and other invariant solutions. We demonstrate the relevance of ghost states to the observed dynamics in various nonlinear systems including chaotic maps, the Lorenz ODE system, the spatio-temporally chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky PDE, the buckling of an elastic arc, and 3D Rayleigh-B\'enard convection.</description>

      <title>Exploitation-exploration transition in the physics of fluid-driven branching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-organized branching structures can emerge spontaneously as interfacial instabilities in both simple and complex fluids, driven by the interplay between bulk material rheology, boundary constraints, and interfacial forcing. In our experiments, injecting dye between a source and a sink in a Hele-Shaw cell filled with a yield-stress fluid reveals an abrupt transition in morphologies as a function of injection rate. Slow injection leads to a direct path connecting the source to the sink, while fast injection leads to a rapid branching morphology that eventually converges to the sink. This shift from an exploitative (direct) to an exploratory (branched) strategy resembles search strategies in living systems; however, here it emerges in a simple physical system from a combination of global constraints (fluid conservation) and a switch-like local material response. We show that the amount of fluid needed to achieve breakthrough is minimal at the transition, and that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy in these arborization patterns. Altogether, our study provides an embodied paradigm for fluidic computation driven by a combination of local material response (body) and global boundary conditions (environment).</description>

      <title>Learning rheological parameters of non-Newtonian fluids from velocimetry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a Bayesian inverse Navier-Stokes (N-S) problem that assimilates velocimetry data in order to jointly reconstruct the flow field and learn the unknown N-S parameters. By incorporating a Carreau shear-thinning viscosity model into the N-S problem, we devise an algorithm that learns the most likely Carreau parameters of a shear-thinning fluid, and estimates their uncertainties, from velocimetry data alone. We then conduct a flow-MRI experiment to obtain velocimetry data of an axisymmetric laminar jet through an idealised medical device (FDA nozzle) for a blood analogue fluid. We show that the algorithm can successfully reconstruct the flow field by learning the most likely Carreau parameters, and that the learned parameters are in very good agreement with rheometry measurements. The algorithm accepts any algebraic effective viscosity model, as long as the model is differentiable, and it can be extended to more complicated non-Newtonian fluids (e.g. Oldroyd-B fluid) if a viscoelastic model is incorporated into the N-S problem.</description>

      <title>Dense Suspension Inertial Microfluidic Particle Theory (DENSE-IMPACT) Model for Elucidating Outer Wall Focusing at High Cell Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial microfluidics has been limited to dilute particle concentrations due to defocusing (spreading out) at high particle concentrations. We observe a counterintuitive shift of focusing to the outer curved wall under high concentration flow, which contradicts the existing particle focusing theory. We developed a multiphase model incorporating lift forces and particle-particle interactions to explain this behaviour. Numerical simulations validated by experimental data reveal the shift is governed by the ratio of the lift force strength to that of particle interaction frequencies.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned flow estimation with sparse data -- exemplified for the rooftop of a UAV vertiport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a physics-informed data-driven framework for urban wind estimation. This framework validates and incorporates the Reynolds number independence for flows under various working conditions, thus allowing the extrapolation for wind conditions far beyond the training data. Another key enabler is a machine-learned non-dimensionalized manifold from snapshot data. The velocity field is modeled using a double encoder-decoder approach. The first encoder normalizes data using the oncoming wind speed, while the second encoder projects this normalized data onto the isometric feature mapping manifold. The decoders reverse this process, with $k$-nearest neighbor performing the first decoding and the second undoing the normalization. The manifold is coarse-grained by clustering to reduce the computational load for de- and encoding. The sensor-based flow estimation is based on the estimate of the oncoming wind speed and a mapping from sensor signal to the manifold latent variables. The proposed machine-learned flow estimation framework is exemplified for the flow above an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle vertiport. The wind estimation is shown to generalize well for rare wind conditions, not included in the original database.</description>

      <title>CaLES: A GPU-accelerated solver for large-eddy simulation of wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CaLES, a GPU-accelerated finite-difference solver designed for large-eddy simulations (LES) of incompressible wall-bounded flows in massively parallel environments. Built upon the existing direct numerical simulation (DNS) solver CaNS, CaLES relies on low-storage, third-order Runge-Kutta schemes for temporal discretization, with the option to treat viscous terms via an implicit Crank-Nicolson scheme in one or three directions. A fast direct solver, based on eigenfunction expansions, is used to solve the discretized Poisson/Helmholtz equations. For turbulence modeling, the classical Smagorinsky model with van Driest near-wall damping and the dynamic Smagorinsky model are implemented, along with a logarithmic law wall model. GPU acceleration is achieved through OpenACC directives, following CaNS-2.3.0. Performance assessments were conducted on the Leonardo cluster at CINECA, Italy. Each node is equipped with one Intel Xeon Platinum 8358 CPU (2.60 GHz, 32 cores) and four NVIDIA A100 GPUs (64 GB HBM2e), interconnected via NVLink 3.0 (200 GB/s). The inter-node communication bandwidth is 25 GB/s, supported by a DragonFly+ network architecture with NVIDIA Mellanox InfiniBand HDR. Results indicate that the computational speed on a single GPU is equivalent to approximately 15 CPU nodes, depending on the treatment of viscous terms and the subgrid-scale model, and that the solver efficiently scales across multiple GPUs. The predictive capability of CaLES has been tested using multiple flow cases, including decaying isotropic turbulence, turbulent channel flow, and turbulent duct flow. The high computational efficiency of the solver enables grid convergence studies on extremely fine grids, pinpointing non-monotonic grid convergence for wall-modeled LES.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks and Differential Equations: A hybrid approach for data assimilation of fluid flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09476</link>

Abstract: This study presents a novel hybrid approach that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Reynolds-Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) equations to enhance the accuracy of mean flow reconstruction across a range of fluid dynamics applications. Traditional purely data-driven Neural Networks (NNs) models, often struggle maintaining physical consistency. Moreover, they typically require large datasets to achieve reliable performances. The GNN framework, which naturally handles unstructured data such as complex geometries in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is here integrated with RANS equations as a physical baseline model. The methodology leverages the adjoint method, enabling the use of RANS-derived gradients as optimization terms in the GNN training process. This ensures that the learned model adheres to the governing physics, maintaining physical consistency while improving the prediction accuracy. We test our approach on multiple CFD scenarios, including cases involving generalization with respect to the Reynolds number, sparse measurements, denoising and inpainting of missing portions of the mean flow. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the accuracy of the reconstructed mean flow compared to purely data-driven models, using limited amounts of data in the training dataset. The key strengths of this study are the integration of physical laws into the training process of the GNN, and the ability to achieve high-accuracy predictions with a limited amount of data, making this approach particularly valuable for applications in fluid dynamics where data is often scarce.</description>

      <title>The inviscid fixed point of the multi-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new scaling regime characterized by a $z=1$ dynamical critical exponent has been reported in several numerical simulations of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and noisy Burgers equations. In these works, this scaling, differing from the well-known KPZ one $z=3/2$, was found to emerge in the tensionless limit for the interface and in the inviscid limit for the fluid. Based on functional renormalization group, the origin of this scaling has been elucidated. It was shown to be controlled by a yet unpredicted fixed point of the one-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation, termed inviscid Burgers (IB) fixed point. The associated universal properties, including the scaling function, were calculated. All these findings were restricted to $d=1$, and it raises the intriguing question of the fate of this new IB fixed point in higher dimensions. In this work, we address this issue and analyze the multi-dimensional Burgers-KPZ equation using functional renormalization group. We show that the IB fixed point exists in all dimensions $d\geq 0$, and that it controls the large momentum behavior of the correlation functions in the inviscid limit. It turns out that it yields in all $d$ the same super-universal value $z=1$ for the dynamical exponent.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and structure-preservation in summation by parts methods for the moist compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moist thermodynamics is a fundamental driver of atmospheric dynamics across all scales, making accurate modeling of these processes essential for reliable weather forecasts and climate change projections. However, atmospheric models often make a variety of inconsistent approximations in representing moist thermodynamics. These inconsistencies can introduce spurious sources and sinks of energy, potentially compromising the integrity of the models.
  Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent and structure preserving formulation of the moist compressible Euler equations. When discretised with a summation by parts method, our spatial discretisation conserves: mass, water, entropy, and energy. These properties are achieved by discretising a skew symmetric form of the moist compressible Euler equations, using entropy as a prognostic variable, and the summation-by-parts property of discrete derivative operators. Additionally, we derive a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method with energy and tracer variance stable numerical fluxes, and experimentally verify our theoretical results through numerical simulations.</description>
