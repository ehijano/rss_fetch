      <title>A Sophisticated Analytical Methodology for Refining the Smagorinsky Model in Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present three important theorems related to the corrected Smagorinsky model for turbulence in time-dependent domains. The first theorem establishes an improved regularity criterion for the solution of the corrected Smagorinsky model in Sobolev spaces $H^s(\Omega(t))$ with smooth and evolving boundaries. The result provides a bound on the Sobolev norm of the solution, ensuring that the solution remains regular over time. The second theorem quantifies the approximation error between the corrected Smagorinsky model and the true Navier-Stokes solution. Taking advantage of high-order Sobolev spaces and energy methods, we derive an explicit error estimate for the velocity fields, showing the relationship between the error and the external force term. The third theorem focuses on the asymptotic convergence of the corrected Smagorinsky model to the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations as time progresses. We provide an upper bound for the error in the $L^2(\Omega)$ norm, demonstrating that the error decreases as time increases, especially as the external force term vanishes. This result highlights the long-term convergence of the corrected model to the true solution, with explicit dependences on the initial conditions, viscosity, and external forces.</description>

      <title>Classification of kink clusters for scalar fields in dimension 1+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a real scalar field equation in dimension 1+1 with an even, positive self-interaction potential having two non-degenerate zeros (vacua) 1 and -1. Such a model admits non-trivial static solutions called kinks and antikinks. We define a kink n-cluster to be a solution approaching, for large positive times, a superposition of n alternating kinks and antikinks whose velocities converge to $0$. They can be equivalently characterized as the solutions of minimal possible energy containing n transitions between the vacua, or as the solutions whose kinetic energy decays to 0 in large time.
  Our first main result is a determination of the main-order asymptotic behavior of any kink n-cluster. The proof relies on a reduction,using appropriately chosen modulation parameters, to an n-body problem with attractive exponential interactions. We then construct a kink n-cluster for any prescribed initial positions of the kinks and antikinks, provided that their mutual distances are sufficiently large. Next, we prove that the set of all the kink n-clusters is an n-dimensional topological manifold, and we show how it can be parametrized by the positions of the kinks in the configuration. The proof relies on energy estimates and the contraction mapping principle, using the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction technique. Finally, we show that kink clusters are universal profiles for the formation/collapse of multikink configurations. In this sense, they can be interpreted as forming the stable/unstable manifold of the multikink state given by a superposition of n infinitely separated alternating kinks and antikinks.</description>

      <title>Finite time blow-up in a 1D model of the incompressible porous media equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a PDE that models the behavior of a boundary layer solution to the incompressible porous media (IPM) equation posed on the 2D periodic half-plane. This 1D IPM model is a transport equation with a non-local velocity similar to the well-known C\'{o}rdoba-C\'{o}rdoba-Fontelos (CCF) equation. We discuss how this modification of the CCF equation can be regarded as a reasonable model for solutions to the IPM equation. Working in the class of bounded smooth periodic data, we then show local well-posedness for the 1D IPM model as well as finite time blow-up for a class of initial data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present a concise proof for the interior H\"{o}lder continuity of two-dimensional stationary Q-valued maps. The proof employs a blow-up argument based on the monotonicity formula for the frequency function, along with the oscillation estimate from the author's previous article, which leverages the conformality of the modified maps.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear stochastic diffusion-convection equation with reflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a nonlinear, pseudomonotone, stochastic diffusion-convection evolution problem on a bounded spatial domain, in any space dimension, with homogeneous boundary conditions and reflection. The additive noise term is given by a stochastic It\^{o} integral with respect to a Hilbert space valued $Q$-Wiener process. We show existence of a solution to the pseudomonotone stochastic diffusion-convection equation with non-negative initial value as well as the existence of a reflection measure which prevents the solution from taking negative values. In order to show a minimality condition of the measure, we study the properties of quasi everywhere defined representatives of the solution with respect to parabolic capacity.</description>

      <title>Twisting in One Dimensional Periodic Vlasov-Poisson System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that twisting and filamentation occur near a family of stable steady states for one dimensional periodic Vlasov-Poisson system, describing the electron dynamics under a fixed ion background. More precisely, we establish the growth in time of the L1 norm of the gradient for the electron distribution function and the corresponding flow map in the phase space. To support this result, we prove existence results of stable steady states for a class of ion densities on the torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we characterize different fractional caloric capacities with fractional parabolic $\text{BMO}$ and $\text{Lip}_\alpha$ normalization conditions. That is, we characterize geometrically removable sets for functions solving the fractional heat equation under fractional parabolic $\text{BMO}$ or $\text{Lip}_\alpha$ constraints. Ultimately, we compare all capacities to a certain parabolic Hausdorff content.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of Leray--Hopf solutions for the $3D$ fractional Navier--Stokes equations perturbed by transport noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the $3D$ fractional Navier--Stokes equations perturbed by transport noise, we prove the existence of infinitely many H\"older continuous analytically weak, probabilistically strong Leray--Hopf solutions starting from the same deterministic initial velocity field. Our solutions are global in time and satisfy the energy inequality pathwise on a non-empty random interval $[0,\tau]$. In contrast to recent related results, we do not consider an additional deterministic suitably chosen force $f$ in the equation. In this unforced regime, we prove the first result of Leray--Hopf nonuniqueness for fractional Navier--Stokes equations with any kind of stochastic perturbation. Our proof relies on convex integration techniques and a flow transformation by which we reformulate the SPDE as a PDE with random coefficients.</description>

      <title>Analysis of two direct sampling methods for an anisotropic scatterer with a conductive boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inverse scattering problem associated with an anisotropic medium with a conductive boundary condition. We will assume that the corresponding far--field pattern or Cauchy data is either known or measured. The conductive boundary condition models a thin coating around the boundary of the scatterer. We will develop two direct sampling methods to solve the inverse shape problem by numerically recovering the scatterer. To this end, we study direct sampling methods by deriving that the corresponding imaging functionals decay as the sampling point moves away from the scatterer. These methods have been applied to other inverse shape problems, but this is the first time they will be applied to an anisotropic scatterer with a conductive boundary condition. These methods allow one to recover the scatterer by considering an inner--product of the far--field data or the Cauchy data. Here, we will assume that the Cauchy data is known on the boundary of a region $\Omega$ that completely encloses the scatterer $D$. We present numerical reconstructions in two dimensions to validate our theoretical results for both circular and non-circular scatterers.</description>

      <title>The Sattinger iteration method for 1-Laplace type problems and its application to concave-convex nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the classical sub-supersolution Sattinger iteration method to $1$-Laplace type boundary value problems of the form \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \displaystyle -\Delta_1 u = F(x,u) &amp; \text{in}\;\Omega,\\ \newline
  u=0 &amp; \text{on}\;\partial\Omega,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\Omega$ is an open bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$) with Lipschitz boundary and $F(x,s)$ is a Carathe\'{o}dory function. This goal is achieved through a perturbation method that overcomes structural obstructions arising from the presence of the $1$-Laplacian and by proving a weak comparison principle for these problems. As a significant application of our main result we establish existence and non-existence theorems for the so-called ``concave-convex'' problem involving the $1$-Laplacian as leading term.</description>

      <title>Diagonal systems of differential operators on compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global hypoellipticity and global solvability of systems of left-invariant differential operators on compact Lie groups. Focusing on diagonal systems, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for these global properties. Specifically, we show that global solvability is characterized by a Diophantine condition on the symbol of the system, while global hypoellipticity further requires that a set depending on the symbol to be finite. As an application, we provide a complete characterization of these properties for systems of vector fields defined on products of tori and spheres. Additionally, we present illustrative examples, including systems involving higher-order differential operators. Finally, we extend our analysis to triangular systems on compact Lie groups, introducing an additional condition related to the boundedness of the dimensions of the representations in these Lie groups.</description>

      <title>A localized construction of Kasner-like singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct local, in spacetime, singular solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations that exhibit Kasner-like behavior in their past boundary. Our result can be viewed as a localization (in space) of the construction in \cite{FL}. We also prove a refined uniqueness statement and give a simple argument that generates general asymptotic data for Kasner-like singularities, enjoying all expected degrees of freedom, albeit only locally in space. The key difference of the present work with \cite{FL} is our use of a first order symmetric hyperbolic formulation of the Einstein vacuum equations, relative to the connection coefficients of a parallelly propagated orthonormal frame which is adapted to the Gaussian time foliation. This makes it easier to localize the construction, since elliptic estimates are no longer required to complete the energy argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates a class of degenerate forward-backward diffusion equations with a nonlinear source term, proposed as a model for removing multiplicative noise in images. Based on Rothe's method, the relaxation theorem, and Schauder's fixed-point theorem, we establish the existence of Young measure solutions for the corresponding initial boundary problem. The continuous dependence result relies on the independence property satisfied by the Young measure solution. Numerical experiments illustrate the denoising effectiveness of our model compared to other denoising models.</description>

      <title>Gradient flows on metric graphs with reservoirs: Microscopic derivation and multiscale limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study evolution equations on metric graphs with reservoirs, that is graphs where a one-dimensional interval is associated to each edge and, in addition, the vertices are able to store and exchange mass with these intervals. Focusing on the case where the dynamics are driven by an entropy functional defined both on the metric edges and vertices, we provide a rigorous understanding of such systems of coupled ordinary and partial differential equations as (generalized) gradient flows in continuity equation format. Approximating the edges by a sequence of vertices, which yields a fully discrete system, we are able to establish existence of solutions in this formalism. Furthermore, we study several scaling limits using the recently developed framework of EDP convergence with embeddings to rigorously show convergence to gradient flows on reduced metric and combinatorial graphs. Finally, numerical studies confirm our theoretical findings and provide additional insights into the dynamics under rescaling.</description>

      <title>The time-relaxation limit for weak solutions to the quantum hydrodynamics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes weak solutions of the quantum hydrodynamics (QHD) system with a collisional term posed on the one-dimensional torus. The main goal of our analysis is to rigorously prove the time-relaxation limit towards solutions to the quantum drift-diffusion (QDD) equation. The existence of global in time, finite energy weak solutions can be proved by straightforwardly exploiting the polar factorization and wave function lifting tools previously developed by the authors. However, the sole energy bounds are not sufficient to show compactness and then pass to the limit. For this reason, we consider a class of more regular weak solutions (termed GCP solutions), determined by the finiteness of a functional involving the chemical potential associated with the system. For solutions in this class and bounded away from vacuum, we prove the time-relaxation limit and provide an explicit convergence rate. Our analysis exploits compactness tools and does not require the existence (and smoothness) of solutions to the limiting equations or the well-preparedness of the initial data. As a by-product of our analysis, we also establish the existence of global in time $H^2$ solutions to a nonlinear Schr\"odinger-Langevin equation and construct solutions to the QDD equation as strong limits of GCP solutions to the QHD system.</description>

      <title>Stability for an inverse random source problem of the biharmonic Schrodinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the inverse random source scattering problem for the biharmonic Schrodinger equation in two and three dimensions. The driven source is assumed to be a generalized microlocally isotropic Gaussian random function whose covariance operator is a classical pseudodifferential operator. We examine the meromorphic continuation and estimates for the resolvent of the biharmonic Schrodinger operator with respect to complex frequencies, which yields the well-posedness of the direct problem and a Born series expansion for the solution. For the inverse problem, we present quantitative stability estimates in determining the micro-correlation strength of the random source by using the correlation far-field data at multiple frequencies. The key ingredient in the analysis is employing scattering theory to obtain the analytic domain and an upper bound for the resolvent of the biharmonic Schrodinger operator and applying a quantitative analytic continuation principle in complex theory. The analysis only requires data in a finite interval of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Modified scattering for the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with long-range potentials in one space dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with long-range linear potentials in one space dimension, and prove the modified scattering in the energy space for the associated final state problem with a prescribed small asymptotic profile. Compared with the leading term of the free solution, the asymptotic profile has an additional phase correction depending both on the long-range part of the potential and on the nonlinear term. The proof is based on a simple energy method and does not rely on global-in-time Strichartz estimates for Schr\"odinger equations with linear potentials. In particular, the class of potentials to which our theorem applies is large enough to accommodate slowly decaying negative potentials so that the associated Schr\"odinger operators may have negative eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Quantization analysis of Moser-Trudinger equations in the Poincar\'e disk and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the quantitative properties for positive solutions to the Moser-Trudinger equations in the two-dimensional Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^2$: \begin{equation*}\label{mt1}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^2}u=\lambda ue^{u^2},\ x\in\mathbb{B}^2,
  &amp;u\to0,\ \text{when}\ \rho(x)\to\infty,
  &amp;||\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^2} u||_{L^2(\mathbb{B}^2)}^2\leq M_0,
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation*} 
where $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\frac{1}{4}=\inf\limits_{u\in W^{1,2}(\mathbb{B}^2)\backslash\{0\}}\frac{\|\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^2}u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{B}^2)}^2}{\|u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{B}^2)}^2}$, $\rho(x)$ denotes the geodesic distance between $x$ and the origin and $M_0$ is a fixed large positive constant (see Theorem 1.1). Furthermore, by doing a delicate expansion for Dirichlet energy $\|\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^2}u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{B}^2)}^2$ when $\lambda$ approaches to $0,$ we prove that there exists $\Lambda^\ast&gt;4\pi$ such that the Moser-Trudinger functional $F(u)=\int_{\mathbb{B}^2}\left(e^{u^2}-1\right) dV_{\mathbb{B}^2}$ under the constraint $\int_{\mathbb{B}^2}|\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^2}u|^2 dV_{\mathbb{B}^2}=\Lambda$ has at least one positive critical point for $\Lambda\in(4\pi,\Lambda^{\ast})$ up to some M\"{o}bius transformation. Finally, when $\lambda\rightarrow 0$, by doing a more accurate expansion for $u$ near the origin and away from the origin, applying a local Pohozaev identity around the origin and the uniqueness of the Cauchy initial value problem for ODE,Cauchy-initial uniqueness for ODE, we prove that the Moser-Trudinger equation only has one positive solution when $\lambda$ is close to $0.$ During the process of the proofs, we overcome some new difficulties which involves the decay properties of the positive solutions, as well as some precise expansions for the solutions both near the origin and away from the origin.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and optimal decay rates of classical solutions to the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-P$_1$ approximation model in radiation hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier-$P_1$ (NSF-$P_1$) approximation model in radiation hydrodynamics is investigated in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^3$. This model consists of the compressible NSF equations of fluid coupled with the transport equations of the radiation field propagation. Assuming that the initial data are a small perturbation near the equilibrium state, we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions for this model by performing the Fourier analysis techniques and employing the delicate energy estimates in frequency spaces. Here, we develop a new method to overcome a series of difficulties arising from the linear terms $n_1$ in (3.2)$_2$ and $n_0$ in (3.3)$_3$ related to the radiation intensity. Furthermore, if the $L^1$-norm of the initial data is bounded, we obtain the optimal time decay rates of the classical solution at $L^p$-norm $(2\leq p\leq \infty)$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result on the global well-posedness of the NSF-$P_1$ approximation model.</description>

      <title>Cancellations for dispersive PDEs with random initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a combinatorial formalism for dealing with the cancellations that have appeared recently in the context of dispersive PDEs with random initial data. The main idea is to transform iterated integrals encoded by decorated trees into words via an arborification map. This provides a formalism alternative to the one of molecules introduced by Deng and Hani (2023). It allows us to compute the cancellations coming from Wave turbulence and the proof of the invariance of the Gibbs measure under the dynamics of the three-dimensional cubic wave equation.</description>

      <title>Fully nonlinear free boundary problems: optimal boundary regularity beyond convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a general class of elliptic free boundary problems equipped with a Dirichlet boundary condition. Our primary result establishes an optimal $C^{1,1}$-regularity estimate for $L^p$-strong solutions at points where the free and fixed boundaries intersect. A key novelty is that no convexity or concavity assumptions are imposed on the fully nonlinear operator governing the system. Our analysis derives BMO estimates in a universal neighbourhood of the fixed boundary. It relies solely on a differentiability assumption. Once those estimates are available, applying by now standard methods yields the optimal regularity.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the analysis of the stationary exterior Navier-Stokes problem with interior boundary data and vanishing condition at infinity. We first show an existence result that extends a previous contribution of the second author by considering boundary data prescribing a non-trivial flux on the internal boundary. We obtain in particular that the non-uniqueness result of G. Hamel extends to an open set of internal boundary data. We then show that one way to recover uniqueness of a solution is to complement the perturbation of velocity field with a decay condition at infinity for small circulation through the interior boundary. Our method is based on a fine analysis of the linearized Navier-Stokes system around potential flows in the exterior domain.</description>

      <title>An extended variational setting for critical SPDEs with L{\'e}vy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical variational setting was recently introduced and shown to be applicable to many important SPDEs not covered by the classical variational setting. In this paper, we extend the critical variational setting in several ways. We introduce a flexibility in the range space for the nonlinear drift term, due to which certain borderline cases can now also be included. An example of this is the Allen-Cahn equation in dimension two in the weak setting. In addition to this, we allow the drift to be singular in time, which is something that naturally arises in the study of the skeleton equations for large deviation principles for SPDEs. Last but not least, we present the theory in the case of L{\'e}vy noise for which the critical setting was not available yet.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous carrying capacities and global extinction in metapopulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a simple two patch reaction diffusion model with strong Allee effect, sufficiently distinct carrying capacities, similar reaction strengths, and strong diffusion. In the homogeneous case, i.e., in in the case of equal or similar capacities and reaction strengths, it is well known that the number of stationary solutions ranges from three (strong diffusion) to nine (weak diffusion). We provide sufficient conditions which includes the diffusion strength and reaction parameters that ensure that the extinction point is the unique and globally asymptotically stable equilibrium in the case of heterogeneous capacities. For the sake of robustness we consider several bistable reaction functions, compare our analytical result with numerical simulations, and conclude the paper with a short discussion on global extinction literature (which has provided mostly numerical results so far), as well as other related phenomena, e.g., fragmentation, the perfect mixing paradox, and the natural form the reaction diffusion patch models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we derive a new nonlocal and nonlinear dispersive equations capturing the main dynamics of a circular interface separating a light, viscous fluid rising buoyantly through a heavy, more viscous, miscible fluid at small Reynolds numbers. This equation that we termed the $g-$model shares some common structure with the Camassa-Holm equation but has additional nonlocal effects. For this new PDE we study the well-posedness together with the existence of periodic traveling waves. Furthermore, we also show some numerical simulations suggesting the finite time singularity formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a novel efficient algorithm for clustering and classification tasks based on the famous MBO scheme. On the one hand, inspired by Jacobs et al. [J. Comp. Phys. 2018], we introduce constraints on the size of clusters leading to a linear integer problem. We prove that the solution to this problem is induced by a novel order statistic. This viewpoint allows us to develop exact and highly efficient algorithms to solve such constrained integer problems. On the other hand, we prove an estimate of the computational complexity of our scheme, which is better than any available provable bounds for the state of the art. This rigorous analysis is based on a variational viewpoint that connects this scheme to volume-preserving mean curvature flow in the big data and small time-step limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Calder\'on problem for a logarithmic Schr\"odinger type operator of the form $L_{\Delta} +q$, where $L_{\Delta}$ denotes the logarithmic Laplacian, which arises as formal derivative $\frac{d}{ds} \big|_{s=0}(-\Delta)^s$ of the family of fractional Laplacian operators. This operator enjoys remarkable nonlocal properties, such as the unique continuation and Runge approximation. Based on these tools, we can uniquely determine bounded potentials using the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map. Additionally, we can build a constructive uniqueness result by utilizing the monotonicity method. Our results hold for any space dimension.</description>

Abstract: In this article we consider operators of the form $\partial_s\xi+A(s)\xi$ where $s$ lies in an interval $[-T,T]$ and $s\mapsto A(s)$ is continuous. Without boundary conditions these operators are not Fredholm. However, using interpolation theory one can define suitable boundary conditions for these operators so that they become Fredholm. We show that in this case the Fredholm index is given by the spectral flow of the operator path $A$.</description>

We obtain the existence of monostable fronts for all super-critical speeds in the regime where the spatial step size is small. The key strategy is to transfer the invertibility of certain linear operators related to the front solutions from the continuous setting to the discrete case we are interested in. We rely on resolvent bounds which are uniform with respect to the step size, a procedure which is also known as spectral convergence. The approach is also able to handle infinite range discretizations with geometrically decaying coefficients that are allowed to have both signs, which prevents the use of the comparison principle.</description>

      <title>Local Conservation Laws and Entropy Inequality for Kinetic Models with Delocalized Collision Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a common setting for the collision integrals $\mathrm{St}$ appearing in the kinetic theory of dense gases. It includes the collision integrals of the Enskog equation, of (a variant of) the Povzner equation, and of a model for soft sphere collisions proposed by Cercignani [Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 36 (1983), 479-494]. All these collision integrals are delocalized, in the sense that they involve products of the distribution functions of gas molecules evaluated at positions whose distance is of the order of the molecular radius. Our first main result is to express these collision integrals as the divergence in $v$ of some mass current, where $v$ is the velocity variable, while $v_i\mathrm{St}$ and $|v|^2\mathrm{St}$ are expressed as the phase space divergence (i.e divergence in both position and velocity) of appropriate momentum and energy currents. This extends to the case of dense gases an earlier result by Villani [Math. Modelling Numer. Anal. M2AN 33 (1999), 209-227] in the case of the classical Boltzmann equation (where the collision integral is involves products of the distribution function of gas molecules evaluated at different velocities, but at the same position. Applications of this conservative formulation of delocalized collision integrals include the possibility of obtaining the local conservation laws of momentum and energy starting from this kinetic theory of denses gases. Similarly a local variant of the Boltzmann H Theorem, involving some kind of free energy instead of Boltzmann's H function, can be obtained in the form of an expression for the entropy production in terms of the phase space divergence of some phase space current, and of a nonpositive term.</description>

      <title>Space-time divergence lemmas and optimal non-reversible lifts of diffusions on Riemannian manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reversible lifts reduce the relaxation time of reversible diffusions at most by a square root. For reversible diffusions on domains in Euclidean space, or, more generally, on a Riemannian manifold with boundary, non-reversible lifts are in particular given by the Hamiltonian flow on the tangent bundle, interspersed with random velocity refreshments, or perturbed by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise, and reflected at the boundary. In order to prove that for certain choices of parameters, these lifts achieve the optimal square-root reduction up to a constant factor, precise upper bounds on relaxation times are required. A key tool for deriving such bounds by space-time Poincar\'e inequalities is a quantitative space-time divergence lemma. Extending previous work of Cao, Lu and Wang, we establish such a divergence lemma with explicit constants for general locally convex domains with smooth boundary in Riemannian manifolds satisfying a lower, not necessarily positive, curvature bound. As a consequence, we prove optimality of the lifts described above up to a constant factor, provided the deterministic transport part of the dynamics and the noise are adequately balanced. Our results show for example that an integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on a locally convex domain with diameter $d$ achieves a relaxation time of the order $d$, whereas, in general, the Poincar\'e constant of the domain is of the order $d^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple quantitative method for studying the hydrodynamic limit of interacting particle systems on lattices. It is applied to the diffusive scaling of the symmetric Zero-Range Process (in dimensions one and two). The rate of convergence is estimated in a Monge-Kantorovich distance asymptotic to the L^1 stability estimate of Kruzkhov, as well as in relative entropy; and it is uniform in time. The method avoids the use of the so-called ``block estimates''. It is based on a modulated Monge-Kantorovich distance estimate and microscopic stability properties.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the uniform doubling property holds for every Lie group which can be written as a quotient group of $\operatorname{SU}(2) \times \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n$. In particular, this class includes the four-dimensional unitary group $\operatorname{U}(2)$. As this class contain non-compact as well as compact Lie groups, we discuss a number of analytic and spectral consequences for the corresponding heat kernels.</description>

      <title>Analytic 3D vector non-uniform Fourier crystal optics in arbitrary $\bar{\bar{\varepsilon}}$ dielectric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17224v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To find a suitable incubator for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics(FCO) and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics(CO) in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass(M-M TC) to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional(2D) spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional(3D) $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f system. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz Continuity Results for Minimax Solutions of Path-Dependent Hamilton--Jacobi Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Cauchy problem for a (first-order) path-dependent Hamilton--Jacobi equation with coinvariant derivatives and a right-end boundary condition. Such problems arise naturally in the study of properties of the value functional in (deterministic) optimal control problems and differential games for time-delay systems. We prove that, under certain assumptions on the Hamiltonian and the boundary functional, a minimax (generalized) solution of the Cauchy problem satisfies Lipschitz conditions both in time and functional variables. In the latter case, Lipschitz conditions are formulated with respect to the uniform norm and some special norm of the space of continuous functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the spectrum of the Laplace operator, subject to homogeneous complex magnetic fields in the plane. For real magnetic fields, it is well-known that the spectrum consists of isolated eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities (Landau levels). We demonstrate that when the magnetic field has a nonzero imaginary component, the spectrum expands to cover the entire complex plane. Additionally, we show that the Landau levels (appropriately rotated and now embedded in the complex plane) persists, unless the magnetic field is purely imaginary in which case they disappear and the spectrum becomes purely continuous.</description>

      <title>Large scale regularity and correlation length for almost length-minimizing random curves in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model of random curves in the plane related to the large-scale behavior of the Random Field Ising Model (RFIM) at temperature zero in two space dimensions. Our work is motivated by attempts to quantify the Imry--Ma phenomenon concerning the rounding of the phase transition by quenched disorder, and connects to recent advances regarding the decay of correlations in the RFIM.
  We study a continuum model of minimal surfaces in two space dimensions subject to an external, quenched random field, and restrict ourselves to isotropic surface integrands. The random fields we consider behave like white noise on large scales with an ultra-violet regularization reminiscent of the lattice structure of the RFIM.
  We give a finer description of the minimizer below the length scale starting from which the influence of boundary conditions is suppressed with a given probability, which has recently been shown to be of order $\exp(\varepsilon^{-\frac{4}{3}})$ in the amplitude $\varepsilon&gt;0$ of the noise. More precisely, we prove flatness of the phase boundaries on scales up to order $\exp(\varepsilon^{-\frac{4}{13}})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider reaction-diffusion fronts in spatially periodic bistable media with large periods. Whereas the homogenization regime associated with small periods had been well studied for bistable or Fisher-KPP reactions and, in the latter case, a formula for the limit minimal speeds of fronts in media with large periods had also been obtained thanks to the linear formulation of these minimal speeds and their monotonicity with respect to the period, the main remaining open question is concerned with fronts in bistable environments with large periods. In bistable media the unique front speeds are not linearly determined and are not monotone with respect to the spatial period in general, making the analysis of the limit of large periods more intricate. We show in this paper the existence of and an explicit formula for the limit of bistable front speeds as the spatial period goes to infinity. We also prove that the front profiles converge to a family of front profiles associated with spatially homogeneous equations. The main results are based on uniform estimates on the spatial width of the fronts, which themselves use zero number properties and intersection arguments.</description>

Abstract: We study the long-time behavior of solutions to a model of sexual populations structured in phenotypes. The model features a nonlinear integral reproduction operator derived from the Fisher infinitesimal operator and a trait-dependent selection term. The reproduction operator describes here the inheritance of the mean parental traits to the offspring without variability. We show that, under assumptions on the growth of the selection rate, Dirac masses are stable around phenotypes for which the difference between the selection rate and its minimum value is less than 1/2. Moreover, we prove the convergence in some Fourier-based distance of the centered and rescaled solution to a stationary profile under some conditions on the initial moments of the solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the degenerate linear Boltzmann equation inside a bounded domain with a generalized diffuse reflection at the boundary and variable temperature, including the Maxwell boundary conditions with the wall Maxwellian or heavy-tailed reflection kernel and the Cercignani-Lampis boundary condition. Our abstract collisional setting applies to the linear BGK model, the relaxation towards a space-dependent steady state, and collision kernels with fat tails. We prove for the first time the existence of a steady state and a rate of convergence towards it without assumptions on the temperature variations. Our results for the Cercignani-Lampis boundary condition make also no hypotheses on the accommodation coefficients. The proven rate is exponential when a control condition on the degeneracy of the collision operator is satisfied, and only polynomial when this assumption is not met, in line with our previous results regarding the free-transport equation. We also provide a precise description of the different convergence rates, including lower bounds, when the steady state is bounded. Our method yields constructive constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By a semi-Lagrangian change of coordinates, the hydrostatic Euler equations describing free-surface sheared flows is rewritten as a system of quasilinear equations, where stability conditions can be determined by the analysis of its hyperbolic structure. The system one obtains can be written as a quasi linear system in time and horizontal variables and involves no more vertical derivatives. However, the coefficients in front of the horizontal derivatives include an integral operator acting on the new vertical variable. The spectrum of these operators is studied in detail, in particular it includes a continuous part. Riemann invariants are then determined as conserved quantities along the characteristic curves. Examples of solutions are provided, in particular stationary solutions and solutions blowing-up in finite time. Eventually, we propose an exact multilayer $\mathbb{P}_0$-discretization, which could be used to solve numerically this semi-Lagrangian system, and analyze the eigenvalues of the corresponding discretized operator to investigate the hyperbolic nature of the approximated system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of nonlocal curvatures determined through a kernel which is symmetric and bounded from above by a radial and radially non-increasing profile satisfying an integrability condition. It turns out that such definition encompasses various variants of nonlocal curvatures that have already appeared in the literature, including fractional curvature and anisotropic fractional curvature. The main task undertaken in the article is to study the limit behaviour of the introduced nonlocal curvatures under an appropriate limiting procedure. This enables us to recover known asymptotic results e.g. for the fractional curvature and for the anisotropic fractional curvature. For the convergence of anisotropic fractional curvatures we identify the limit object as the nonlocal curvature being the first variation of the related anisotropic fractional perimeter. We also prove existence, uniqueness and stability of viscosity solutions to the corresponding level-set parabolic Cauchy problem formulated in terms of the investigated nonlocal curvature.</description>

Abstract: We show that a large class of 1D first-order conservation PDEs can be probabilistically represented using multi-type branching processes. The representation holds when the initial conditions are linear combinations of negative exponentials. We also show that in some cases, the time of gradient blow up can be identified by studying criticality conditions of the corresponding branching processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-posedness of two-dimensional signal-dependent Keller-Segel system and its mean field derivation from a interacting particle system on the whole space are investigated. The signal dependence effect is reflected by the fact that the diffusion coefficient in the particle system depends nonlinearly on the interactions between the individuals. Therefore, the mathematical challenge in studying the well-posedness of this system lies in the possible degeneracy and the aggregation effect when the concentration of signal becomes unbounded. The well-established method on bounded domain, to obtain the appropriate estimates for the signal concentration, is invalid for the whole space case. Motivated by the entropy minimization method and Onofri's inequality, which has been successfully applied for parabolic-parabolic Keller-Segel system, we establish a complete entropy estimate benefited from linear diffusion term, which plays important role in obtaining the Lp estimates for the solution. Furthermore, the upper bound for the concentration of signal is obtained. Based on estimates we obtained for the density of cells, the rigorous mean-field derivation is proved by introducing an intermediate particle system with a mollified interaction potential with logarithmic scaling. By using this mollification, we obtain the convergence of the particle trajectories in expectation, which implies the weak propagation of chaos. Additionally, under a regularity assumption of the initial data, we infer higher regularity for the solutions, which allows us to use relative entropy method to derive the strong L1 convergence for the propagation of chaos.</description>

Abstract: An accurate functional inequality for Div-BV positive symmetric tensors $A$ in a bounded domain $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ arises whenever the tangential part of the normal trace $\gamma_\nu A\sim A\vec\nu$ is a finite measure over $\partial U$. The proof involves an extension operator to a neighbourhood of $\bar U$. The resulting inequality depends upon the domain only through the $C^3$-regularity of $\partial U$, some constant involving the curvature and its first derivatives.This abstract statement applies to several models of Gas Dynamics (Euler system, Hard Spheres dynamics), as the boundary condition (slip, or reflection) tells us that $A\vec\nu$ is parallel to $\vec\nu$, where $A$ is the mass-momentum tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a large class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations that arise in laser generation models and models for propagation in random media in a unified mathematical framework. Continuous and pulse-wave propagation models, free electron laser generation models, as well as laser-plasma interaction models have been cast in a convenient and unified abstract framework as semilinear evolution equations in a Hilbert space to enable stochastic analysis. We formulate Ito calculus and white noise calculus methods of treating stochastic terms and prove existence and uniqueness of mild solutions.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness and Soliton Resolution for the Half-Wave Maps Equation with Rational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy-critical half-wave maps equation: \[ \partial_t \mathbf{u} = \mathbf{u} \times |D| \mathbf{u} \] for $\mathbf{u} : [0, T) \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. Our main result establishes the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all rational initial data $\mathbf{u}_0 : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{S}^2$. This demonstrates global well-posedness for a dense subset within the scaling-critical energy space $\dot{H}^{1/2}(\mathbb{R}; \mathbb{S}^2)$. Furthermore, we prove soliton resolution for a dense subset of initial data in the energy space, with uniform bounds for all higher Sobolev norms $\dot{H}^s$ for $s &gt; 0$.
  Our analysis utilizes the Lax pair structure of the half-wave maps equation on Hardy spaces in combination with an explicit flow formula. Extending these results, we establish global well-posedness for rational initial data (along with a soliton resolution result) for a generalized class of matrix-valued half-wave maps equations with target spaces in the complex Grassmannians $\mathbf{Gr}_k(\mathbb{C}^d)$. Notably, this includes the complex projective spaces $ \mathbb{CP}^{d-1} \cong \mathbf{Gr}_1(\mathbb{C}^d)$ thereby extending the classical case of the target $\mathbb{S}^2 \cong \mathbb{CP}^1$.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup in a five- and higher-dimensional chemotaxis model with indirect signal production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a three-component chemotaxis model accounting for indirect signal production, reading as $u_t = \nabla\cdot(\nabla u - u\nabla v)$, $v_t = \Delta v - v + w$ and $0 = \Delta w - w + u$, posed on a ball in $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\geq5$, subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions.
  It is suggested that the system has a four-dimensional critical mass phenomenon concerning blowup in finite or infinite time according to the work of Fujie and Senba [J. Differential Equations, 263 (2017), 88--148; 266 (2019), 942--976]. In this paper, we prove that for any prescribed mass $m &gt; 0$, there exist radially symmetric and positive initial data $(u_0,v_0)\in C^0(\overline{\Omega})\times C^2(\overline{\Omega})$ with $\int_\Omega u_0 = m$ such that the corresponding solutions blow up in finite time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by problems in machine learning, we study a class of variational problems characterized by nonlocal operators. These operators are characterized by power-type weights, which are singular at a portion of the boundary. We identify a range of exponents on these weights for which the variational Dirichlet problem is well-posed. This range is determined by the ambient dimension of the problem, the growth rate of the nonlocal functional, and the dimension of the boundary portion on which the Dirichlet data is prescribed. We show the variational convergence of solutions to solutions of local weighted Sobolev functionals in the event of vanishing nonlocality.</description>

      <title>Spreading speed of locally regulated population models in macroscopically heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.06985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.06985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a certain lattice branching random walk with on-site competition and in an environment which is heterogeneous at a macroscopic scale $1/\varepsilon$ in space and time. This can be seen as a model for the spatial dynamics of a biological population in a habitat which is heterogeneous at a large scale (mountains, temperature or precipitation gradient\ldots). The model incorporates another parameter, $K$, which is a measure of the local population density. We study the model in the limit when first $\varepsilon\to 0$ and then $K\to\infty$. In this asymptotic regime, we show that the rescaled position of the front as a function of time converges to the solution of an explicit ODE. We further discuss the relation with another popular model of population dynamics, the Fisher-KPP equation, which arises in the limit $K\to\infty$. Combined with known results on the Fisher-KPP equation, our results show in particular that the limits $\varepsilon\to0$ and $K\to\infty$ do not commute in general. We conjecture that an interpolating regime appears when $\log K$ and $1/\varepsilon$ are of the same order.</description>

Abstract: Let $D$ be an open set of $\mathbb{R}^d$, $\alpha\in (0, 2)$ and let $\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}^D$ be the generator of the censored $\alpha$-stable process in $D$. In this paper, we establish sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for $\mathcal{L}_{\alpha}^D-\kappa$, with $\kappa$ being a non-negative critical potential and $D$ being a $C^{1, \beta}$ open set, $\beta \in ((\alpha-1)_+,1]$. The potential $\kappa$ can exhibit multi-singularities and our regularity assumption on $D$ is weaker than the regularity assumed in earlier literature on heat kernel estimates of fractional Laplacians.</description>

      <title>Dirac-harmonic maps with trivial index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a homotopy class $[u]$ of maps between a closed Riemannian manifold $M$ and a general manifold $N$, we want to find a Dirac-harmonic map with the map component in the given homotopy class. Most known results require the index to be nontrivial. When the index is trivial, the few known results are all constructive and produce uncoupled solutions. In this paper, we define a new quantity. As a byproduct of proving the homotopy invariance of this new quantity, we find a new simple proof for the fact that all Dirac-harmonic spheres in surfaces are uncoupled. More importantly, by using the homotopy invariance of this new quantity, we prove the existence of Dirac-harmonic maps from manifolds in the trivial index case. In particular, when the domain is a closed Riemann surface, we prove the short-time existence of the $\alpha$-Dirac-harmonic map flow in the trivial index case. Together with the density of the minimal kernel, we get an existence result for Dirac-harmonic maps from closed Riemann surfaces to K\"ahler manifolds, which extends the previous result of the first and third authors. This establishes a general existence theory for Dirac-harmonic maps in the context of trivial index.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Cotlar identities for groups acting on tree-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $T_m$ be a noncommutative Fourier multiplier. In recent work, Mei and Ricard introduced a noncommutative analogue of Cotlar's identity in order to prove that certain multipliers are bounded on the non-commutative $L_p$-spaces of a free group. Here, we study Cotlar type identities in full generality, giving a closed characterization for them in terms of $m$:
  \[
  \big( m(g h) - m(g) \big) \, \big( m(g^{-1}) - m(h) \big) = 0,
  \; \forall g \in \mathrm{G} \setminus \{e\}, h \in \mathrm{G}.
  \] We manage to prove, using a geometric argument, that if $X$ is a tree -- or more generally an $\mathbb{R}$-tree -- on which $\mathrm{G}$ acts and $m$ lifts to a function $\widetilde{m}: X \to \mathbb{C}$ that is constant on the connected subsets of $X \setminus \{x_0\}$, then $m$ satisfies Cotlar's identity and thus $T_m$ is bounded in $L_p$ for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. This result establishes a new connection between groups actions on $\mathbb{R}$-trees and Fourier multipliers. We show that $m$ is trivial when the action has global fixed points. This machinery allows us to simultaneously generalize the free group transforms of Mei and Ricard and the theory of Hilbert transforms in left-orderable groups, which follows from Arveson's subdiagonal algebras. Using Bass-Serre theory, we construct new examples of Fourier multipliers in groups. Those include new families like Baumslag-Solitar groups. We also show that a natural Hilbert transform in $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$ satisfies Cotlar's identity when restricted to the Bianchi group $\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{-1}])$.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, we study optimal control problems for stochastic delay differential equations using the dynamic programming approach in Hilbert spaces via viscosity solutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We show how to use the partial $C^{1,\alpha}$-regularity of the value function established in \cite{defeo_federico_swiech} to obtain optimal feedback controls. The main result of the paper is a verification theorem which provides a sufficient condition for optimality using the value function. We then discuss its applicability to the construction of optimal feedback controls. We provide an application to stochastic optimal advertising problems.</description>

      <title>A unified two-scale gas-liquid multi-fluid model with capillarity and interface regularization through a mass transfer between scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we derive a gas-liquid two-scale multi-fluid model with capillarity effects to enable a novelinterface regularization approach for multi-fluid models. As this unified modelling is capable of switching from theinterface representation of a separated to a disperse regime it lays a new way of modelling regime transitions as itoccurs in atomization processes. Above a preset length threshold at large scale, a multi-fluid diffuse interface modelresolves the dynamics of the interface while, at small-scale, a set of geometric variables is used to characterizethe interface geometry. These variables result from a reduced-order modelling of the small-scale kinetic equationthat describes a collection of liquid inclusions. The flow model can be viewed as a two-phase two-scale mixture,and the equations of motion are obtained thanks to the Hamilton's Stationary Action Principle, which requiresto specify the kinetic and potential energies at play. We particularly focus on modelling the effects of capillarityon the mixture's energy by including dependencies on additional variables accounting for the interface's geometryat both scales. The regularization of the large-scale interface is then introduced as a local and dissipative process.The local curvature is limited via a relaxation toward a modified Laplace equilibrium such that an inter-scalemass transfer is triggered when the mean curvature is too high. We propose an original numerical method andassess the properties and potential of the modelling strategy on the relevant test-case of a two-dimensional liquidcolumn in a compressible gas flow.</description>

      <title>On a variational problem related to the Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum and Lieb-Thirring inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly solve a variational problem related to upper bounds on the optimal constants in the Cwikel--Lieb--Rozenblum (CLR) and Lieb--Thirring (LT) inequalities, which has recently been derived in [Invent. Math. 231 (2023), no.1, 111-167. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00222-022-01144-7 ] and [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 23 (2021), no.8, 2583-2600. https://doi.org/10.4171/jems/1062 ]. We achieve this through a variational characterization of the $L^1$ norm of the Fourier transform of a function and duality, from which we obtain a reformulation in terms of a variant of the Hadamard three lines lemma. By studying Hardy-like spaces of holomorphic functions in a strip in the complex plane, we are able to provide an analytic formula for the minimizers, and use it to get the best possible upper bounds for the optimal constants in the CLR and LT inequalities achievable by the method of [Invent. Math. 231 (2023), no.1, 111-167. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00222-022-01144-7 ] and [J. Eur. Math. Soc. (JEMS) 23 (2021), no.8, 2583-2600. https://doi.org/10.4171/jems/1062 ].</description>

      <title>Sinh-Gordon equations on finite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the sinh-Gordon equation on graphs. We introduce a uniform a priori estimate to define the topological degree for this equation with nonzero prescribed functions on finite, connected and symmetric graphs. Furthermore, we calculate this topological degree case by case and show several existence results. In particular, we prove that the classical sinh-Gordon equation with nonzero prescribed function is always solvable on such graphs.</description>

      <title>$p$-Brownian motion and the $p$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18744v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a stochastic process, more precisely, a (nonlinear) Markov process, which is related to the parabolic $p$-Laplace equation in the same way as Brownian motion is to the classical heat equation given by the (2-) Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Generic regularity of equilibrium measures for the logarithmic potential with external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is a well-known conjecture in $\beta$-models and in their discrete counterpart that, generically, external potentials should be ``off-critical'' (or, equivalently, ``regular''). Exploiting the connection between minimizing measures and thin obstacle problems, we give a positive answer to this conjecture.</description>
