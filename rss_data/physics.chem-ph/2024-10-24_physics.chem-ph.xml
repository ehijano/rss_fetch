      <title>Nuclear Quantum Effects in Liquid Water Are Negligible for Structure but Significant for Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopic substitution, which can be realized both in experiment and computer simulations, is a direct approach to assess the role of nuclear quantum effects on the structure and dynamics of matter. Yet, the impact of nuclear quantum effects on the structure of liquid water as probed in experiment by comparing normal to heavy water has remained controversial. To settle this issue, we employ a highly accurate machine-learned high-dimensional neural network potential to perform converged coupled cluster-quality path integral simulations of liquid H$_2$O versus D$_2$O at ambient conditions. We find substantial H/D quantum effects on the rotational and translational dynamics of water, in close agreement with the experimental benchmarks. However, in stark contrast to the role for dynamics, H/D quantum effects turn out to be unexpectedly small, on the order of 1/1000 \r{A}, on both intramolecular and H-bonding structure of water. The most probable structure of water remains nearly unaffected by nuclear quantum effects, but effects on fluctuations away from average are appreciable, rendering H$_2$O substantially more "liquid" than D$_2$O.</description>

      <title>Why does the $GW$ approximation give accurate quasiparticle energies? The cancellation of vertex corrections quantified</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hedin's $GW$ approximation to the electronic self-energy has been impressively successful to calculate quasiparticle energies, such as ionization potentials, electron affinities, or electronic band structures. The success of this fairly simple approximation has been ascribed to the cancellation of the so-called vertex corrections that go beyond $GW$. This claim is mostly based on past calculations using vertex corrections within the crude local-density approximation. In this study, we explore a wide variety of non-local vertex corrections in the polarizability and the self-energy, using first-order approximations or infinite summations to all orders. In particular, we use vertices based on statically screened interactions like in the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We demonstrate on realistic molecular systems that indeed the two vertices in Hedin's equation essentially compensate. We further show that the consistency between the two vertices is crucial to obtain realistic electronic properties. We finally consider increasingly large clusters and extrapolate that our conclusions would hold for extended systems.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of Charge Densities in Electronic Structure Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate charge densities are essential for reliable electronic structure calculations because they significantly impact predictions of various chemical properties and in particular, according to the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, atomic forces. This study examines the accuracy of charge densities obtained from different DFT exchange-correlation functionals in comparison with coupled cluster calculations with single and double excitations. We find that modern DFT functionals can provide highly accurate charge densities, particularly in case of meta-GGA and hybrid functionals. In connection with Gaussian basis sets, it is necessary to use the largest basis sets available to obtain densitites that are nearly basis set error free. These findings highlight the importance of selecting appropriate computational methods for generating high-precision charge densities, which are for instance needed to generate reference data for training modern machine learned potentials.</description>

      <title>Magnetite field line dependent anisotropic chemiresistive response in Magnetite: A new piece to the puzzle of magnetoreception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many species demonstrate remarkable navigational abilities, enabling precise long-distance journeys. Magnetite-based magnetoreception is one key component of this navigational prowess. Despite decades of research, the mechanisms behind magnetite-based magnetoreception remain inadequately understood. Understanding how magnetic fields affect magnetite's properties is crucial for revealing the mechanistic basis of this phenomenon. Here we report that the chemiresistive response of magnetite, which measures changes in its electrical resistance due to interactions with surrounding chemicals, varies substantially when exposed to magnetic field analogous to that of the Earth's. Significantly, large variations have been observed in response to humidity, a common atmospheric factor that can induce mass migration in species. This variation in chemiresistive response has been found to be anisotropic in nature, displaying dependence on the strength, direction, and inclination of the magnetic field lines. This indicates that any electrical signal generated involving magnetite particles will be affected both by the strength and the orientation of the earth's magnetic field. Furthermore, this discovery suggests a possibility that magnetite-driven navigational abilities in biological species likely rely on a combination of magnetic and chemical cues, a phenomenon that was unknown until now.</description>

      <title>Liquid-Vapor Phase Equilibrium in Molten Aluminum Chloride (AlCl3) Enabled by Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molten salts are promising candidates in numerous clean energy applications, where challenges in experimental methods limit knowledge of their safety-critical temperature-properties correlations. Herein, we developed and employed machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIP) to study AlCl3 molten salt across varied thermodynamic conditions. The MLIP accurately predicted the existence of Al2Cl6 dimers in this molten salt as informed by Raman spectra and neutron structure factor. The MLIP is validated using available experimental data for temperature correlations with viscosities, surface tension, as well as liquid and vapor densities evaluated from two-phase coexistence simulations. In doing so, we closely predicted the critical temperature and critical density compared to reported experimental values for AlCl3. The demonstrated approach for MLIP training in closely predicting phase equilibrium in this study can be useful towards screening nuclear reactors-relevant salt compositions, helping to mitigate safety concerns.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue crossings in equivariant families of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to a result of Wigner and von Neumann [1], real symmetric matrices with a doubly degenerate lowest eigenvalue form a submanifold of codimension 2 within the space of all real symmetric matrices. This mathematical result has important consequences for chemistry. First, it implies that degeneracies do not occur within generic one-parameter families of real symmetric matrices - this is the famous non-crossing rule, and is responsible for the phenomenon of avoided crossings in the energy levels of diatomic molecules. Second, it implies that energy levels are expected to cross in polyatomic molecules, with crossings taking place on a submanifold of nuclear configuration space which is codimension 2 - this submanifold is the famous conical intersection seam, of central importance in nonadiabatic chemistry. In this paper we extend the analysis of Wigner and von Neumann to include symmetry. We introduce a symmetry group, and consider parametrised families of matrices which respect an action of that symmetry group on both the parameter space and on the space of matrices. A concrete application is to molecules, for which the relevant symmetry group is generated by permutations of atomic nuclei combined with spatial reflections and rotations. In the presence of this extra symmetry, we find that energy level crossings do not typically occur on codimension 2 submanifolds, and connect our findings with the discovery of confluences of conical intersection seams in the chemical literature. We give a classification of confluences for triatomic molecules and planar molecules, unifying the previous literature on this topic, and predict several new types of confluence.</description>

      <title>Water cavitation results from the kinetic competition of bulk, surface and surface-defect nucleation events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water at negative pressures can remain in a metastable state for a surprisingly long time before it reaches equilibrium by cavitation, i.e. by the formation of vapor bubbles. The wide spread of experimentally measured cavitation pressures depending on water purity, surface contact angle and surface quality implicates the relevance of water cavitation in bulk, at surfaces and at surface defects for different systems. We formulate a kinetic model that includes all three different cavitation pathways and determine the needed nucleation attempt frequencies in bulk, at surfaces and at defects from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.
  Our model reveals that cavitation occurs in pure bulk water only for defect-free hydrophilic surfaces with wetting contact angles below 50{\deg} to 60{\deg} and at pressures of the order of $-$100 MPa, depending only slightly on system size and observation time. Cavitation on defect-free surfaces occurs only for higher contact angles, with the typical cavitation pressure rising to about $-$30 MPa for very hydrophobic surfaces. Nanoscopic hydrophobic surface defects act as very efficient cavitation nuclei and can dominate the cavitation kinetics in a macroscopic system. In fact, a nanoscopic defect that hosts a pre-existing vapor bubble can raise the critical cavitation pressure much further. Our results explain the wide variation of experimentally observed cavitation pressures in synthetic and biological systems and highlight the importance of surface and defect mechanisms for the nucleation of metastable systems.</description>

      <title>A Fluorescent Ratiometric Potassium Sensor Based on IPG4-Silica Microparticles for Selective Detection and Fluorescence Imaging of Potassium Cations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potassium cations play many important roles in living organisms, especially in electro-physiology, since they are involved in neurotransmission and muscle contractions. We report the synthesis of a ratiometric fluorescent microsensor for potassium (K+) detection, based on the fluorescent probe ION potassium green 4. Potassium-sensitive fluorescent microparticles were obtained by using silica as core material. We obtained silica-based microsensors with a size in the micrometer range, spherical shape, good monodispersity, optimal selectivity and a sensitivity range between 0 to 40 mM. The microsensors also proved to be non-toxic in cell cultures as well as suitable for fluorescent imaging, offering new possibilities for non-invasive optical detection, quantification and in situ monitoring of K+ variations in cell culture systems.</description>

      <title>Facile One Pot Synthesis of Hybrid Core-Shell Silica-Based Sensors for Live Imaging of Dissolved Oxygen and Hypoxia Mapping in 3D cell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence imaging allows for non-invasively visualizing and measuring key physiological parameters like pH and dissolved oxygen. In our work, we created two ratiometric fluorescent microsensors designed for accurately tracking dissolved oxygen levels in 3D cell cultures. We developed a simple and cost-effective method to produce hybrid core-shell silica microparticles that are biocompatible and versatile. These sensors incorporate oxygen-sensitive probes (Ru(dpp) or PtOEP) and reference dyes (RBITC or A647 NHS-Ester). SEM analysis confirmed efficient loading and distribution of the sensing dye on the outer shell. Fluorimetric and CLSM tests demonstrated the sensors' reversibility and high sensitivity to oxygen, even when integrated into 3D scaffolds. Aging and bleaching experiments validated the stability of our hybrid core-shell silica microsensors for 3D monitoring. The Ru(dpp)-RBITC microparticles showed the most promising performance, especially in a pancreatic cancer model using alginate microgels. By employing computational segmentation, we generated 3D oxygen maps during live cell imaging, revealing oxygen gradients in the extracellular matrix and indicating a significant decrease in oxygen levels characteristic of solid tumors. Notably, after 12 hours, the oxygen concentration dropped to a hypoxic level of PO2 2.7 +/- 0.1%.</description>

      <title>Advanced simulations with PLUMED: OPES and Machine Learning Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological processes occur on time scales longer than those accessible to molecular dynamics simulations. Identifying collective variables (CVs) and introducing an external potential to accelerate them is a popular approach to address this problem. In particular, $\texttt{PLUMED}$ is a community-developed library that implements several methods for CV-based enhanced sampling. This chapter discusses two recent developments that have gained popularity in recent years. The first is the On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method as a biasing scheme. This provides a unified approach to enhanced sampling able to cover many different scenarios: from free energy convergence to the discovery of metastable states, from rate calculation to generalized ensemble simulation. The second development concerns the use of machine learning (ML) approaches to determine CVs by learning the relevant variables directly from simulation data. The construction of these variables is facilitated by the $\texttt{mlcolvar}$ library, which allows them to be optimized in Python and then used to enhance sampling thanks to a native interface inside $\texttt{PLUMED}$. For each of these methods, in addition to a brief introduction, we provide guidelines, practical suggestions and point to examples from the literature to facilitate their use in the study of the process of interest.</description>

      <title>Single particle tracking of polymer aggregates inside disordered porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion motions of individual polymer aggregates in disordered porous media were visualized using the single particle tracking (SPT) method because the motions inside porous media play important roles in various fields of science and engineering. The aggregates diffused on the surfaces of pores; continuous adsorption and desorption processes were obserbed. The relationship between the size of the aggregates and pore size was analysed based on diffusion coefficients, moment scaling spectrum (MSS) slope, and diffusion anisotropy analyisies. The obtained diffusion coefficients were different for different the aggregate and pore sizes. The MSS Slope analysis indicated that more than 85% of the aggregates were confined diffusion for all the conditions investigated. The diffusion anisotropies analysis suggested that the diffusions of the aggregates were anisotropic. The interactions between the aggregates and the pores were complex and exhibited different motions than surface diffusion of smooth surfaces.</description>
