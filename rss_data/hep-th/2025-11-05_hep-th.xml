      <title>Effervescent Spikes in M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AdS$_3 \times$ S$^3 \times$ S$^3$ solutions warped over a Riemann surface, $\Sigma$, are indexed by a parameter, $\gamma$, that defines the superconformal algebra, $D(2,1; \gamma) \oplus D(2,1; \gamma)$ they preserve. We show that these solutions come from multiple back-reacted M2-M5 spikes, and that different values of $\gamma$ correspond to different scaling limits of the same M2-M5 solutions. We find that when $\gamma$ switches from positive to negative, the infrared region of the AdS$_3$ switches from the tip of spikes, far from the M5 branes, to the bottom of the spikes, far from the M2 branes. We also explain how the bubbling negative-$\gamma$ solutions emerge from the geometric transition of multiple M2-M5 spikes.</description>

      <title>Spindle solutions, hyperscalars and smooth uplifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct $AdS_3\times Y_7$ solutions of type IIB supergravity, where $Y_7$ is a smooth $S^5$ bundle over a spindle $\Sigma(n_N,n_S)$, which are dual to $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ SCFTs in $d=2$. The solutions are constructed using the $D=5$ STU $U(1)^3$ gauged supergravity theory coupled to a hyperscalar charged under $U(1)_B$. We investigate spindle solutions with two new features: first, we allow $(n_N,n_S)$ to be non-coprime integers, including orbifolds of the round $S^2$, which can lead to non-unique, inequivalent uplifts, distinguished by the hyperscalar spectra, for given magnetic flux through the spindle. Second, we also allow the hyperscalar to vanish at the poles leading to solutions carrying non-vanishing $U(1)_B$ flux. The new hyperscalar $AdS_3$ solutions can naturally arise as the endpoint of RG flows, triggered by relevant hyperscalar deformations of the $AdS_3$ solutions of the STU model.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic NISPT Phases, igNISPT Phases, and Mixed Anomalies of Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bosonic non-invertible Symmetry Protected Topological (NISPT) phase in (1+1)-dim is referred to as $\textit{intrinsic}$ if it cannot be mapped, under discrete gauging, to a gapped phase with any invertible symmetry, that is, if it is protected by a non-group-theoretical fusion category symmetry. We construct the intrinsic NISPT phases by performing discrete gauging in a partial SSB phase with a fusion category symmetry that has a certain mixed anomaly. Sometimes, the anomaly of that symmetry category can be alternatively understood as a self-anomaly of a proper categorical sub-symmetry; when this is the case, the same gauging provides an anomaly resolution of this anomalous categorical sub-symmetry. This allows us to construct intrinsic gapless SPT (igSPT) phases, where the anomalous faithfully acting symmetry is non-invertible; and we refer to such igSPT phases as igNISPT phases. We provide two concrete lattice models realizing an intrinsic NISPT phase and an igNISPT phase, respectively. We also generalize the construction of intrinsic NISPT phases to (3+1)-dim.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories: chiral anomaly in the finite temperature massless Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry has emerged in recent years as a practical quantity to study phases of matter. We present the first study of entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories by considering the chiral anomaly of the analytically solvable massless Schwinger model at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Generalised Symmetries and Moduli Spaces in 3d $\mathcal{N}=5$ SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space and generalised global symmetries of 3d $\mathcal{N} = 5$ superconformal field theories are investigated, with a focus on the orthosymplectic ABJ theories and their discrete gauging variants. We extend the known classification of $\mathcal{N}=5$ moduli spaces as orbifolds $\mathbb{H}^{2N}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a quaternionic reflection group, to theories incorporating $\mathrm{Spin}$, $\mathrm{O}^-$, and $\mathrm{Pin}$-type gauge groups. In these cases, we find that the moduli space is governed not by $\Gamma$ itself, but by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central extension thereof, for which we explicitly describe the generators. We provide a systematic method to construct the group $\Gamma'$ governing the moduli space of a theory $\mathcal{T}'$ obtained by gauging a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ zero-form symmetry of an original theory $\mathcal{T}$. This is achieved by identifying the specific generator that must be added to $\Gamma$. We compute the Hilbert series for these moduli spaces and verify them against the corresponding limits of the superconformal index, finding perfect agreement. We also discuss how 't Hooft anomalies for the zero-form symmetries manifest in the superconformal index and the moduli space. Furthermore, we revisit the symmetry category of the $\mathfrak{so}(2N)_{2k} \times \mathfrak{usp}(2N)_{-k}$ theories. We extend previous analyses to the case where $N$ and $k$ have opposite parities, finding that the symmetry category remains $D_8$; however, the details of the symmetry web differ. Finally, we analyse theories with unequal ranks, those containing the $\mathfrak{so}(2N+1)$ gauge algebra, and the two SCFT variants based on the $F(4)$ superalgebra.</description>

      <title>Gradient RG Flow in Scalar-Fermion QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) is examined to four-loop order in scalar-fermion systems in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The crucial role played by the beta shift, which is a modification of the standard dim-reg beta function, is elucidated, and specific conditions that it needs to satisfy for the RG flow to be gradient are derived. Over a thousand gradient-flow conditions are found, all of which are scheme-independent and satisfied whenever the full set of results needed to check them is available. It is shown, in the framework of the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion, that the space of conformal field theories (CFTs) is dominated by those with non-zero beta shift as the number of fields grows. Physical properties of CFTs obtained as solutions where the beta functions are not zero in the $\varepsilon$ expansion are discussed.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal membranes in M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider near-extremal membranes embedded in M-theory, consistently truncated to gauged $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity in four dimensions on the coset space $M^{1,1,0}$. These are holographically dual to $2 + 1$ dimensional superconformal gauge theory with $U(1)_R \times U(1)_B$ global symmetry. Turning on the chemical potential to either the $R$-symmetry or the baryonic symmetry gives access to the quantum critical regime of the boundary gauge theory. We study perturbative stability of the extremal limit, and demonstrate that membranes with topological (baryonic) charge are free from all known instabilities. $R$-charged membranes are free from the superconducting instabilities, but have unstable charge transport and instabilities associated with the condensation of the axions.</description>

      <title>Smooth String Vacua in a Gravitationally Non-perturbative Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling regime of four-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric vacua of the heterotic string is analyzed from a dual domain wall perspective. Using modular invariance, we compute a closed form for the non-perturbative corrections to the supersymmetric domain wall equations, which enables a quantitative study of gravitational strong coupling regimes. A strong coupling singularity for the hidden Horava-Witten 9-brane is resolved, and the domain wall interpolates between the visible 9-brane and a supersymmetric Anti-de Sitter vacuum, thereby realizing a variant of the Randall-Sundrum model.</description>

      <title>Single-Sided Black Holes in Double-Scaled SYK Model and No Man's Island</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01978v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a single-sided black hole with an end-of-the-world (EoW) brane behind the horizon in the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK). The new Hamiltonian is a deformation of the original DSSYK Hamiltonian with an extra exponential wormhole length operator, which leads to a new chord diagram rule. The boundary algebra is defined as generated by the new Hamiltonian and boundary matter. There is an alternative but equivalent definition with a $q$-coherent state due to a nontrivial isomorphism of the vN algebra of DSSYK. This isomorphism induces a unitary equivalence, which yields a surprising result that the boundary algebra of a single-sided black hole in DSSYK has a non-trivial commutant and is a type II$_1$ vN factor. It follows that the full bulk reconstruction from the boundary is impossible, and there is a ``no man's island" behind the horizon in the semiclassical JT limit. Inspired by the EoW brane, we construct a family of matter-brane states with an arbitrary number of matter chords and behaving like an EoW brane. They exactly solve the full spectrum of DSSYK.
  We take different ways to understand the nontrivial commutant. We show that the commutant is complex on chord number basis and thus non-geometric. In the semiclassical JT limit, the commutant becomes the canonical purification of the boundary algebra and claims the no man's island. In the context of Hawking radiation after Page time, the unitary equivalence is interpreted as encoding the canonical purification into the old Hawking radiation, and the no man's island has the same essence as the island. Including the exponential wormhole length operator independently, the boundary algebra is extended to all bounded operators and reconstructs the no man's island. This can be regarded as a different choice for the definition of boundary algebra. This type I$_\infty$ algebra is closely related to the EoW brane in Kourkoulou-Maldacena.</description>

      <title>Translation invariant defects as an extension of topological symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern way to understand symmetries of a quantum field theory is via its topological defects in various dimensions. In this contribution to the proceedings we focus on line defects in 2d QFT and we point out that topological defects naturally embed into a larger class, namely translation invariant defects. The latter still allow for non-singular fusion and one obtains a monoidal category of translation invariant defects which contains that of topological defects as a full subcategory. We give a simple perturbative description of translation invariant defects in a perturbed conformal field theory via chiral three-dimensional topological field theory. We show in the example of the Ising CFT and the Lee-Yang CFT that even if no topological defects survive the deformation, some translation invariant defects still do.</description>

      <title>Euler-Heisenberg action for fermions coupled to gauge and axial vectors: Hessian diagonalization, sector classification, and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the closed-form one-loop Euler--Heisenberg effective actions for Dirac fermions coupled simultaneously to classical electromagnetic vector and massive pseudo-vector backgrounds within a controlled quasi-static approximation. Through complete diagonalization of the functional Hessian, we systematically delineate the parameter space into distinct sectors characterized by stability properties and spectral structure. We identify subspaces that encompass and extend results from previous studies into a broader class, admitting propagating axial fields as physically viable regimes; strikingly, we note a sector presenting chirality-asymmetric instability. This addresses long-standing questions regarding the well-defined nature, diagonalizability, and stability of the model. From the effective action, we derive novel nonperturbative pair-production rates for simultaneously propagating electromagnetic and axial vector backgrounds; remarkably, we find pronounced vacuum stabilization compared to previous results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this framework allows for a unified derivation of the chiral anomaly structures in the general case and show that the electromagnetic coupling induces instanton-like configurations for the axial field, even when it is not a fundamental gauge field. As a proof-of-concept, we analyze a cosmological toy model of baryogenesis driven by an axial vector, providing numerical estimates that support the viability of this hypothesis. Additionally, we outline qualitative predictions for Weyl/Dirac semi-metals and briefly discuss potential applications in related phenomena, such as the Strong-CP problem.</description>

      <title>Fundamental structure of string geometry theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String geometry theory is one of the candidates of a non-perturbative formulation of string theory. In this theory, the ``classical'' action is almost uniquely determined by T-symmetry, which is a generalization of the T-duality, where the parameter of ``quantum'' corrections $\beta$ in the path-integral of the theory is independent of that of quantum corrections $\hbar$ in the perturbative string theories. We distinguish the effects of $\beta$ and $\hbar$ by putting " " like "classical" and "loops" for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\beta$, respectively, whereas by putting nothing like classical and loops for tree level and loop corrections with respect to $\hbar$, respectively. A non-renormalization theorem states that there is no ``loop'' correction. Thus, there is no problem of non-renormalizability, although the theory is defined by the path-integral over the fields including a metric on string geometry. No ``loop'' correction is also the reason why the complete path-integrals of the all-order perturbative strings in general string backgrounds are derived from the ``tree''-level two-point correlation functions in the perturbative vacua, although string geometry includes information of genera of the world-sheets of the stings. Furthermore, a non-perturbative correction in string coupling with the order $e^{-1/g_s^2}$ is given by a transition amplitude representing a tunneling process between the semi-stable vacua in the ``classical'' potential by an ``instanton'' in the theory. From this effect, a generic initial state will reach the minimum of the potential.</description>

      <title>Three-charge black holes from the worldsheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the general asymptotically flat, doubly-rotating, three-charge black hole uplifted to a family of NS5-F1-P black brane solutions of Type IIB supergravity. We construct a null-gauged WZW model whose target-space geometry reproduces this background in the NS5 decoupling limit, and show that the gauging parameters precisely satisfy the appropriate consistency conditions on the perturbative string spectrum. Through an analytic continuation and an appropriate limit, this model relates to a recently studied construction describing strings on smooth, horizonless geometries. We further analyze the supersymmetric and extremal three-charge configuration, corresponding to the ten-dimensional uplift of the (NS5-decoupled) BMPV black hole, and show that it requires a novel class of null-gauged WZW models. Our construction provides explicit examples of worldsheet CFTs that capture string dynamics on certain black hole geometries with linear dilaton asymptotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We point out a correspondence between the Jackiw--Teitelboim (JT) gravity and the stationary measure of the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation on an interval. By relating the Schwarzian limit of the double-scaled SYK to the weakly asymmetric limit of the open ASEP, we establish that the path-integral measure defining the Euclidean evolution between two end-of-the-world branes in JT gravity can be interpreted as the stationary measure of the KPZ equation on an interval with Neumann boundary conditions. We also establish the match between correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we extend the notion of co-algebra, co-algebraic Wess-Zumino-Witten formulation of Lagrangian Field Theory and the Homotopy transfer theorem to many strings and particle systems. We discuss in detail the construction of higher dimensional co-algebras and the computational methods derived from them with a special interest regarding String Field Theory and Quantum Field Theory. As a result of this work we will be able to effortlessly extend some of the newly developed tools to study the algebraic structure, compute effective actions and compute scattering amplitudes of more complicated QFTs.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of semi-simple supersymmetric gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fixed points and phase diagrams of semi-simple supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to chiral superfields and a superpotential. Particular emphasis is put on new phenomena which arise due to the semi-simple nature of gauge interactions and the constraints dictated by supersymmetry, unitarity, and the $a$-theorem. Using field multiplicities as free parameters, we find all superconformal fixed points and classify theories according to their phase diagrams. Highlights include asymptotically free theories displaying a range of interacting fixed points in the IR, asymptotically non-free theories that become asymptotically safe due to residual interactions, UV-complete theories with gauge sectors that are simultaneously UV-free and IR-free, and theories that remain interacting both in the asymptotic UV and IR. Estimates for the sizes of conformal windows are also provided, and implications for model building are discussed.</description>

      <title>Type II embeddings for $d=6$ Einstein-Maxwell gauged supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bi-spinor and G-structure methods are used to classify the possible consistent truncations of type II supergravity to $d=6$ Einstein-Maxwell (gauged) supergravity, and its consistent sub-sectors. In the absence of R-symmetry gauging and a tensor multiplet we establish that every supersymmetric Mink$_6$ solution defines an embedding of the $d=6$ theory. Adding a tensor multiplet places restrictions on these embeddings, but embeddings still exist. In the presence of R-symmetry gauging the internal spaces of the embeddings are neither related to Mink$_6$ or AdS$_6$. Under the assumption that the internal space contains a single U(1) isometry housing the $d=6$ gauge field we classify the possible embedding manifolds. We find two classes of embedding for the entire theory, one of which is governed by a Toda-like equation and contains at least one bounded embedding. In the absence of a tensor multiple the classes of embeddings become more permissive, though the PDEs governing them become more complicated in general.</description>

      <title>The curious case of parabolic encounters: gravitational waves with linear &amp; non-linear memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memory effect is known to introduce a permanent displacement in the gravitational wave (GW) detectors after the passage of a GW signal. While the linear memory adheres to the source properties, the non-linear memory is a secondary effect sourced by the GW itself. In the present work, we discuss GW signals with both these kinds of memory effects, while focusing on the parabolic limit of an encounter. This special case is theoretically intriguing and emerges as a limiting situation for both eccentric and hyperbolic events. However, in this paper, we argue that a simple extrapolation of memory calculations for eccentric or hyperbolic cases to the parabolic case may lead to incorrect estimations. Therefore, we treat the parabola as a special case and use an intrinsic parameterization, with which we calculate gravitational wave signals and their energy spectrum via an effective field theory formalism. Unlike the hyperbolic case, which is known to have linear memory, we notice that parabolic encounters bring out new features in the zero frequency limit (ZFL). Our work highlights some of the key challenges and salient aspects of these encounters, and paves the way to study such binary evolution with nonzero memory.</description>

      <title>Testing Quantum Gravity with Gravitational Waves from the ringdown of binary Black Holes coalescences: A New Frontier in Fundamental Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves emitted during the merging phase of compact binary coalescing objects has opened a new field of investigation in fundamental physics. It is now possible to test the predictions of General Relativity with unprecedented precision in the strong gravitational field regime. These initial observations therefore call for further research, as the detection of gravitational waves emitted by coalescing black holes may allow the investigation of the properties of spacetime near the event horizon, also providing valuable information on the structure of these objects. This also opens the possibility of testing predictions from quantum gravity models regarding the presumed quantized structure of black holes, related to the quantization of their surface and, consequently, their entropy. In the future, the considerable amount of data obtained by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration will be followed by observations from next-generation interferometers such as the Einstein Telescope or the Cosmic Explorer. It is therefore of great interest to explore the potential of gravitational wave observations for investigating aspects of quantum gravity, which we will address considering the special case of the ringdown emission following the coalescence of binary black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Geometric Solution of Turbulence as Diffusion in Loop Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly nonlinear dynamics, from fluid turbulence to quantum chromodynamics, have long constituted some of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics. This review describes a unified theoretical framework, the loop space calculus, which offers an analytical approach to these problems. The central idea is a shift in perspective from pointwise fields to integrated loop observables, a transformation that recasts the governing nonlinear equations into a universal linear diffusion equation in the space of loops. This framework, supported by recent mathematical analysis, is analytically solvable and yields an exact, parameter-free solution for decaying hydrodynamic turbulence--the Euler ensemble--which is shown to be dual to a solvable string theory. The theory's predictions include: (i) the unification of spatial and temporal scaling laws, which are shown to be governed by two related, infinite spectra of intermittency and decay exponents, respectively, both derived from the nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function; (ii) a first-order phase transition in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence; and (iii) the formation of quantized, concentric shells in passive scalar mixing. The theory also predicts log-periodic oscillations in correlation functions, effects not described by standard phenomenology, for which there is now emerging evidence from high-precision turbulence experiments. The appearance of identical mathematical structures as solutions to the turbulent regime of Yang-Mills gradient flow points towards the broad applicability of this approach. The framework also yields a new type of minimal surface that solves the QCD loop equations in the limit of large loops.</description>

Abstract: The generic shape of the single-time and two-time correlators in non-equilibrium phase-ordering kinetics with ${z}=2$ is obtained from the co-variance of the four-point response functions. Their non-equilibrium scaling forms follow from a new non-equilibrium representation of the Schr\"odinger algebra.</description>

      <title>NLO heavy-quark contributions to DIS structure functions in the ACOT scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02407v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculations of heavy-quark contributions to deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) structure functions $F_4$ and $F_5$ within the Aivazis--Collins--Olness--Tung (ACOT) scheme, implemented in the open source library \texttt{APFEL++} using \texttt{CT18NLO} parton distribution functions. These structure functions, suppressed by lepton mass effects in light-lepton processes, become significant in muon, tau-lepton and neutrino scattering at facilities such as SHiP, IceCube, and DUNE. Our results reveal NLO corrections up to 10\% relative to leading order, with pronounced heavy-quark effects at low Bjorken-$x$, impacting gluon and strange quark distributions. In the unpolarized case, $F_{4/5}^{\gamma Z}$ and $F_{4/5}^{\gamma}$ do not contribute to the cross section, while the $\gamma Z$ interference becomes accessible with longitudinally polarized lepton beams at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), offering enhanced sensitivity at low $Q^2$ due to reduced $Z$-boson propagator suppression. Analytical NLO expressions have also been derived for the polarized structure functions $g_1$, $g_4$, $g_5$, $g_6$, and $g_7$ in the ACOT framework. These developments enable precise theoretical predictions for upcoming experimental programs and global QCD analyses.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition and Critical Behavior in Gravitational Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamic analysis of spherically symmetric gravitational collapse. Using the Hayward-Kodama formalism, we treat a collapsing sphere as a thermodynamic system and express the surface gravity $\kappa_{hk}$ in terms of the geometric variables. We derive the specific heat capacities and identify a critical condition $\dot{\kappa}_{hk} = 0$ as the locus of second order phase transition during the collapse. Through specific examples, we demonstrate that the condition is independent of singular/non-singular nature of the geometry. We also find that the critical condition of phase transition is equivalent to a stationary condition of the expansion of null congruence. This establishes a direct correspondence between geometric stability and thermodynamic criticality, allowing the identification of apparent horizon as a universal critical surface in the phase-space of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a family of new equivalence relations among fusion categories that are less refined than the usual Morita equivalence. We obtain abelian groups by quotienting these new equivalence relations from the commutative monoids of the equivalence classes of all fusion categories. Moreover, we upgrade them to equivalence relations among nondegenerate braided fusion categories that are more refined than the usual Witt equivalence. As a consequence, we obtain new abelian groups that are more refined than the usual Witt group. These new groups allow us to access the internal structures within Witt classes. We expect that they are useful in the classification program of (braided) fusion (higher) categories and in the study of gapless edges of 2+1D topological orders.</description>

      <title>Observational tests of the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02729v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider detailed cosmological tests of dark energy models obtained from the general conformal transformation of the Kropina metric, representing an $(\alpha,\beta)$-type Finslerian geometry. In particular, we restrict our analysis to the osculating Barthel-Kropina geometry. The Kropina metric function is defined as the ratio of the square of a Riemannian metric $\alpha$ and of the one-form $\beta$. In this framework we also consider the role of the conformal transformations of the metric, which allows to introduce a family of conformal Barthel-Kropina theories in an osculating geometry. The models obtained in this way are described by second order field equations, in the presence of an effective scalar field induced by the conformal factor. The generalized Friedmann equations of the model are obtained by adopting for the Riemannian metric $\alpha$ the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker representation. In order to close the cosmological field equations we assume a specific relationship between the component of the one-form $\beta$ and the conformal factor. With this assumption, the cosmological evolution is determined by the initial conditions of the scalar field and a single free parameter $\gamma$ of the model. The conformal Barthel-Kropina cosmological models are compared against several observational datasets, including Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, which allows the determination of $\gamma$. A comparison with the predictions of standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed. Our results indicate that the conformal osculating Barthel-Kropina model can be considered as a successful, and simple, alternative to standard cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Non-saturation of Bootstrap Bounds by Hyperbolic Orbifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years the conformal bootstrap has produced surprisingly tight bounds on many non-perturbative CFTs. It is an open question whether such bounds are indeed saturated by these CFTs. A toy version of this question appears in a recent application of the conformal bootstrap to hyperbolic orbifolds, where one finds bounds on Laplace eigenvalues that are exceptionally close to saturation by explicit orbifolds. In some instances, the bounds agree with the actual values to 11 significant digits. In this work we show, under reasonable assumptions about the convergence of numerics, that these bounds are not in fact saturated. In doing so, we find formulas for the OPE coefficients of hyperbolic orbifolds, using links between them and the Rankin-Cohen brackets of modular forms.</description>

      <title>Grey Galaxies in $AdS_5$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has recently been conjectured \cite{Kim:2023sig} that the end point of the rotational superradiant instability of black holes in $AdS_4$ is a Grey Galaxy: an $\omega=1$ black hole sitting at the centre of $AdS_4$, surrounded by a large disk of rapidly rotating gravitons and other bulk fields. In this paper we study Grey Galaxies in $AdS_5$. In this case, the rotational group is of rank 2, and so has two distinct angular velocities $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. We demonstrate that $AdS_5$ hosts two qualitatively distinct Grey Galaxy phases: the first with either $\omega_1\approx 1$ or $\omega_2\approx 1$, and the second with both angular velocities $\approx 1$. We use these results to present a conjecture for a part of the phase diagram of ${\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills (as a function of energy and the two angular momenta) that displays several phase transitions between regular black holes and various Grey Galaxy phases. We present an explicit gravitational construction of the phases in which $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are both parametrically close to unity, and demonstrate that the corresponding boundary stress tensor is the sum of two pieces. The first is the stress tensor of the central black hole. The second - the contribution of the bulk gas - takes the form of the stress tensor of an equilibrated boundary conformal fluid, rotating at the given angular speeds $\omega_i$. We also briefly comment on the structure of Grey Galaxies in $AdS_D$ for $D &gt; 5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sphere partition function is one of the simplest euclidean gravity computations. It is usually interpreted as count of states. However, the one loop gravity correction contains a dimension dependent phase factor, $i^{D+2}$, which seems confusing for such an interpretation. We show that, after including an observer, this phase gets mostly cancelled for the quantity that should correspond to a count of states. However, an overall minus sign remains.</description>

      <title>Carroll theories from Lorentzian light-cone theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive Carrollian field theories via null reduction from Lorentzian light-cone actions in Minkowski spacetime. By suitably deforming the light-cone action, we reduce the Poincar\'e invariance to a Bargmann subgroup, from which both magnetic and electric Carroll actions can be obtained in one lower dimension. Through a canonical analysis, we show that the second-class constraints usually found in Lorentzian light-cone theories are absent for these deformed Bargmann-invariant actions. We demonstrate the procedure for theories with and without gauge symmetry. Notably, while the magnetic Carroll sector can be directly derived from the original Lorentzian action, the deformation is essential to obtain the electric Carroll sector. We further argue that magnetic Carroll solutions in $d$ dimensions represent a consistent truncation of the solutions of the $(d+1)$-dimensional Lorentzian parent theory, providing an effective description of light-cone dynamics near a null hypersurface. For gauge theories, we also highlight the role of the light-cone gauge condition in deriving Carrollian theories.</description>

      <title>The unequal-mass three-loop banana integral</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the three-loop banana integral with four unequal masses in dimensional regularisation. This integral is associated to a family of K3 surfaces, thus representing an example for Feynman integrals with geometries beyond elliptic curves. We evaluate the integral by deriving an $\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation, for which we rely on the algorithm presented in a recent publication. Equipping the space of differential forms in Baikov representation by a set of filtrations inspired by Hodge theory, we first obtain a differential equation with entries as Laurent polynomials in $\varepsilon$. Via a sequence of basis rotations we then remove any non-$\varepsilon$-factorising terms. This procedure is algorithmic and at no point relies on prior knowledge of the underlying geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit modular invariance in two-dimensional Carrollian conformal field theories from a geometric perspective. Focusing on the characters of the induced and highest-weight representations of the theory, we show that there are regions of parameter space where the vacuum character dominates in the dual channel. We use this property to zoom into different subsectors of the Carrollian theory. One of them is reminiscent of the Schwarzian sector of a relativistic CFT2 and has a flat space holographic interpretation as O-plane orbifold. It exists only for the highest-weight representation. We prove that for all sectors with vacuum dominance in the dual channel, the specific heat is negative, concurrent with the holographic interpretation of the negative specific heat of asymptotically flat spacetimes with horizons.</description>

      <title>Spinning Boundary Correlators from (A)dS$_4$ Twistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a twistor-space framework to compute boundary correlators via a boundary limit of nested Penrose transforms in (A)dS$_4$. Starting from correlators of (anti-)self-dual bulk fields, the boundary limit reproduces the correlators of the dual conserved currents; we demonstrate this explicitly for two- and three-point functions. The two-point correlator is rendered finite by working in Euclidean signature. At three points, we obtain compact rational twistor-space representatives obeying a double-copy relation, thereby clarifying the twistor-space origin of the results in Baumann et al. 2024. We further extend the analysis to non-conserved currents with integer conformal dimension, dual to massive bulk fields, as well as to the free scalar.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Carrollian Geometry</title>

Abstract: Carrollian physics provides the natural framework for describing null hypersurfaces. This review explores the geometry of Carrollian manifolds -- spaces endowed with a degenerate metric. We begin with an algebraic overview of the Carroll group, its conformal extension, and its relation to the BMS group. Then, in the core of the review, we follow the standard pseudo-Riemannian narrative: metric $\to$ connection $\to$ curvature. We first introduce the modern, general definition of a Carrollian structure, the analogue of the metric on such manifolds, reviewing the historical developments, symmetries, and link with the algebraic groups. The second part concerns connections. We show the breakdown of the Levi-Civita theorem in the Carrollian setting and construct the most general intrinsic Carrollian connection. A preferred connection is then identified intrinsically and later shown to coincide with the one induced by embedding a null hypersurface in an ambient spacetime. The third part develops the associated curvature tensors. We include novel results presented here for the first time.
  Two advanced topics highlight the broader scope of this framework. The first treats null hypersurfaces via the rigging technique, deriving the induced geometry from the ambient space. This provides a unified language for spacelike, timelike, and null hypersurfaces, and shows that the induced rigged connection exactly reproduces the intrinsic Carrollian one. From this, the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations follow, and the Einstein equations emerge as conservation laws for the null Brown-York stress tensor. The second topic extends the Carrollian setup to generic, non-null hypersurfaces, enabling a smooth null limit and completing the unified geometric description of hypersurfaces of all causal characters.</description>

      <title>Timelike Holographic Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the pseudo-entropy program, we investigate timelike subregion complexity within the holographic ``Complexity=Volume'' framework, extending the usual spatial constructions to Lorentzian boundary intervals. For hyperbolic timelike regions in AdS geometries, we compute the corresponding bulk volumes and demonstrate that, despite the Lorentzian embedding, the resulting subregion complexity remains purely real. We further generalize our analysis to AdS black brane geometries, where the extremal surfaces can either be constant-time hypersurfaces or penetrate the horizon. In all cases, the computed complexity exhibits the same universal UV divergences as in the spacelike case but shows no imaginary contribution, underscoring its causal and geometric origin. This stands in sharp contrast with the complex-valued pseudo-entropy and suggests that holographic complexity preserves a genuinely geometric and real character even under Lorentzian continuation.</description>

      <title>Emergent Area Operators in the Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some cases in two and three bulk dimensions without bulk local degrees of freedom, I look for area operators in a fixed boundary theory. In each case, I define an exact quantum error-correcting code (QECC) and show that it admits a central decomposition. However, the area operator that arises from this central decomposition vanishes. A non-zero area operator, however, emerges after coarse-graining. The expectation value of this operator approximates the actual entanglement entropy for a class of states that do not form a linear subspace. These non-linear constraints can be interpreted as semiclassicality conditions. The coarse-grained area operator is ambiguous, and this ambiguity can be matched with that in defining fixed-area states.</description>

      <title>Localisation with on-shell supersymmetry algebras via the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism: Localisation as gauge fixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism provides a powerful technique to deal with gauge and global (super)symmetries that may only hold on shell. We argue that, since global (super)symmetries and gauge symmetries appear on an equal footing in the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, similarly localisation with respect to global (super)symmetries appears on an equal footing with gauge fixing of gauge symmetries; in general, when the gauge-fixing condition is not invariant under the global symmetries, localisation (with respect to a localising fermion) and gauge fixing (with respect to a gauge-fixing fermion) combine into a single operation. Furthermore, this perspective enables supersymmetric localisation using only on-shell supermultiplets, dispensing with auxiliary fields, extending an insight first discovered by Losev and Lysov arXiv:2312.13999. We provide the first examples of on-shell localisation for quantum field theories (together with a companion paper by Arvanitakis arXiv:2511.00144).</description>

      <title>Modular invariant inflation and reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use modular symmetry as an organizing principle that attempts to simultaneously address the lepton flavor puzzle, inflation, and post-inflationary reheating. We demonstrate this approach using the finite modular group $A_4$ in the lepton sector. In our model, neutrino masses are generated via the Type-I see-saw mechanism, with modular symmetry dictating the form of the Yukawa couplings and right-handed neutrino masses. The modular field also drives inflation, providing an excellent fit to recent Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. The corresponding prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is very small, $r \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$, while the prediction for the running of the spectral index, $\alpha \sim -\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, could be tested in the near future. An appealing feature of the setup is that the inflaton-matter interactions required for reheating naturally arise from the expansion of relevant modular forms. Although the corresponding inflaton decay rates are suppressed by the Planck scale, the reheating temperature can still be high enough to ensure successful Big Bang nucleosynthesis. The same couplings responsible for reheating can also contribute to generating baryon asymmetry of the Universe through non-thermal leptogenesis. However, the contribution is negligibly small in the current inflationary setup.</description>

      <title>When alcoved polytopes add</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alcoved polytopes are characterized by the property that all facet normal directions are parallel to the roots $e_i-e_j$. Unlike other prominent families of polytopes, like generalized permutahedra, alcoved polytopes are not closed under Minkowski sums. We nonetheless show that the Minkowski sum of a collection of alcoved polytopes is alcoved if and only if each pairwise sum is alcoved. This implies that the type fan of alcoved polytopes is determined by its two-dimensional cones. Moreover, we provide a complete characterization of when the Minkowski sum of alcoved simplices is again alcoved via a graphical criterion on pairs of ordered set partitions. Our characterization reduces to checking conditions on restricted partitions of length at most six. In particular, we show how the Minkowski sum decompositions of the two most well-known families of alcoved polytopes, the associahedron and the cyclohedron, fit in our framework. Additionally, inspired by the physical construction of one-loop scattering amplitudes, we present a new infinite family of alcoved polytopes, called $\widehat{D}_n$ polytopes. We conclude by drawing a connection to matroidal blade arrangements and the Dressian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we use the latest cosmological observations, including SNe, BAO, CC and RSD, to reconstruct the cosmological evolution via the Gaussian process. At the background level, we find consistency with the quintom dynamics for different data combinations and divide the characteristics of dark energy into three different categories, which are negative-energy dark energy, late-dominated dark energy and oscillating dark energy, respectively. Considering the effect of modified gravity on the growth of matter perturbations, the reconstruction results at the perturbative level show that we only need minor corrections to general relativity. Furthermore, we provide theoretical interpretation for the three different types of dynamical dark-energy behavior, in the framework of modified gravity, scalar fields, and dark-energy equation-of-state parametrizations. Finally, we show that all of these models can be unified in the framework of effective field theory.</description>

Abstract: We present a computation of the one-loop QCD corrections to top-quark pair production in association with a $W$ boson, including terms up to order $\varepsilon^2$ in dimensional regularization. Providing a first glimpse into the complexity of the corresponding two-loop amplitude, this result is a first step towards a description of this process at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD. We perform a tensor decomposition and express the corresponding form factors in terms of a basis of independent special functions with compact rational coefficients, providing a structured framework for future developments. In addition, we derive an explicit analytic representation of the form factors, valid up to order $\varepsilon^0$, expressed in terms of logarithms and dilogarithms. For the complete set of special functions required, we obtain a semi-numerical solution based on generalized power series expansion.</description>

      <title>Signatures of quasi-Dirac neutrinos in diffuse high-energy astrophysical neutrino data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the sources of astrophysical neutrinos are still unknown, they are believed to be produced by a population of sources in the distant universe. Measurements of the diffuse, all-sky astrophysical flux can thus be sensitive to flavor and energy-dependent propagation effects, such as very long baseline oscillations. These oscillations are present in certain neutrino mass models, such as when neutrinos are quasi-Dirac. Assuming generic models for the source flux, we find that these oscillations can still be resolved even when integrated over wide distributions in source redshift. We use two sets of IceCube all-sky flux measurements, made with muon and all-flavor neutrino samples, to set constraints at the $3\sigma$ level on quasi-Dirac mass-splittings between $(5 \times 10^{-19}, 8 \times 10^{-19})~\textrm{eV}^2$. We also consider systematic uncertainties on the source population and find that our results are robust under alternate spectral hypotheses or physical redshift distributions. Our analysis shows that spectral features in the all-sky neutrino measurements provide strong constraints on massive neutrino scenarios and are sensitive to uncharted parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing Black Hole Phase Transitions through Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we probe the well known thermodynamic phase structure of black hole through the lens of its quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). Can QPOs be influenced by black hole phase transi- tions? Do they carry any signature of such transitions in their observational patterns? These were the central questions guiding our study. Using both RN AdS and Kerr black hole backgrounds across different QPO models, we analyzed the behavior of upper and lower QPO frequencies as functions of the Hawking temperature. Our results shows that QPO frequencies trace out distinct thermo- dynamic phases and also reflect their stability properties. As the black hole transitions between different thermodynamic phases, the trend of QPO frequencies with respect to temperature also shifts. Due to lack of of observational data, the present work is primarily more on the mathematical side, as the underlying mechanism responsible for the Hawking temperature has not yet been fully understood or experimentally verified. Moreover, given the speculative nature of black hole phase transitions, it would be unfair to claim that our results establish a definitive connection between an observable quantity such as the QPO frequency and the thermodynamic phase behavior of black holes. Nevertheless, our analysis suggests a possibility that changes in black hole geometry could be one of the contributing factors influencing QPO behavior.</description>

      <title>Quest for a phenomenologically consistent low cutoff theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Randall-Sundrum model with the Higgs localized on the IR brane solves the gauge hierarchy problem. However, the associated low cutoff ($\Lambda \sim 10$ TeV) generically leads to unacceptably rapid nucleon decay and excessively large Majorana neutrino masses. Achieving consistency while simultaneously explaining the Yukawa hierarchy requires either a horizontal symmetry or a discrete gauged symmetry. We demonstrate that eliminating all dangerous operators within a horizontal symmetry framework must come with large and unattractive charge assignments, if possible at all. Hence, we consider an exact discrete gauged $\mathbf{Z}_N$ symmetry, with fermion mass hierarchies generated via wave function overlap. We employ this to reproduce the current Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa and Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata structures. Assuming universal five-dimensional Yukawa couplings, generation-blind profile for right-handed neutrinos and flat profile for the third generation SM doublets, it predicts Dirac neutrinos with a total mass $\sim 66$ meV. Since the $\mathbf{Z}_N$ charges must be generation blind, flavor observables serve as key probes.</description>

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic Ising models on frustrated lattices can realize classical spin liquids, with highly degenerate ground states and, possibly, fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. Motivated by the recent interest in many-body system in negatively curved space, we study hyperbolic frustrated Ising models. Specifically, we consider nearest-neighbor Ising models on tesselations with odd-length loops in two-dimensional hyperbolic space. For finite systems with open boundaries we determine the ground-state degeneracy exactly, and we perform extensive finite-temperature Monte-Carlo simulations to obtain thermodynamic data as well as correlation functions. We show that the shape of the boundary, constituting an extensive part of the system, can be used to control low-energy states: Depending on the boundary, we find ordered or disordered ground states. Our results demonstrate how geometric frustration acts in curved space to produce classical spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Probing dynamical axion quasiparticles with two-photon correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical axion (quasi) particles are emergent collective excitations in topological magnetic insulators that break parity and time reversal invariance or in Weyl semimetals. They couple to electromagnetism via a topological Chern-Simons term, leading to their decay into two photons. We extend the Weisskopf-Wigner formulation of atomic spontaneous emission to the quantum field theory of dynamical axion quasiparticles, allowing us to obtain the quantum two-photon state emerging from axion decay in real time. This state features \emph{hyperentanglement} in momentum and polarization with a distinct polarization pattern, a consequence of the parity and time reversal breaking of the axion-photon interaction. Polarization aspects of this two-photon state are studied by introducing quantum Stokes operators. Whereas the two-photon quantum state features vanishing \emph{averages} of the degree of polarization and polarization asymmetry, there are non-trivial momentum correlations of the Stokes operators. In particular momentum correlations of the \emph{polarization asymmetry} can be obtained directly from coincident momentum and polarization resolved two photon detection. Correlations of Stokes operators are directly related to momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury-Brown Twiss second order coherences. This relationship suggests two-photon correlations as a direct probe of dynamical axion quasiparticles. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons and other systems where spontaneous emission yield hyperentangled two photon states are recognized, suggesting experimental avenues similar to tests of Bell inequalities to probe dynamical axion quasiparticles with coincident two photon detection.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and quench dynamics in the thermally perturbed tricritical fixed point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Blume--Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling limit extrapolation for one-point functions and R\'enyi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-lived oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of R\'enyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Searching for gluon saturation effects in the momentum transfer dependence of coherent charmonium electroproduction off nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study for the first time the transverse momentum transfer distributions $d\sigma/dt$ in coherent production of charmonia in nuclear ultra-peripheral and electron-ion collisions within the QCD color dipole approach based on a rigorous Green function formalism. This allows us to treat properly the color transparency effects, as well as the higher and leading-twist shadowing corrections associated with the $|Q\bar Q\rangle$ and $|Q\bar QnG\rangle$ Fock components of the photon. While the multi-gluon photon fluctuations represent the dominant source of nuclear shadowing at kinematic regions related to the recent LHC and its future upgrade to LHeC, the upcoming electron-ion collider at RHIC will additionally require the proper incorporation of reduced quark shadowing. The latter effect leads to a significant decrease in the differential cross sections $d\sigma/dt$ compared to standard calculations based on the eikonal form for the dipole-nucleus amplitude. The leading-twist shadowing corrections, corresponding to a non-linear QCD evolution of a partial dipole-nucleus amplitude, reduce substantially charmonium $t$-distributions in the LHeC energy range. We predict a non-monotonic energy dependence of $d\sigma/dt$ suggesting so possible gluon saturation effects with increased onset at larger $t$-values. In addition to shadowing corrections, we study how the color transparency effects affect the shape of $t$-dependent nuclear modification factor. We also briefly discuss several aspects that can modify the charmonium production rate and thus may have a large impact on the search for gluon saturation effects.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Hot SM, Magnetic Flux &amp; Baryogenesis from Helicity Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the electroweak crossover of the Standard Model (SM) in the early Universe, focusing on the interplay between generalized global symmetries, magnetic flux dynamics, and baryogenesis. Employing the dimensionally reduced 3d effective field theory of the SM at high temperature, we identify the symmetry structure -- including higher-form and magnetic symmetries -- and analyze their spontaneous breaking patterns across the crossover. We further define a gauge-invariant mixing angle that interpolates between $\mathrm{U}(1)_Y$ and $\mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{em}$ magnetic fields. Based on this framework, we examine baryogenesis via decaying magnetic helicity and identify three key effects: the baryon asymmetry is modified by an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factor due to (1) the gauge-invariant definition of the mixing angle and (2) the approximate conservation of the unconfined magnetic flux; (3) a novel non-perturbative process in the presence of magnetic flux, which has been overlooked in previous analyses. Our findings suggest that the previous estimation of baryon asymmetry from the magnetic helicity decay may have sizable uncertainties, and we caution against relying on it, calling for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Duality Symmetry and Anomaly for Gravitational Waves in Curved Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vacuum Einstein equations admit a formulation closely analogous to the source-free Maxwell theory. In particular, the linearized equations exhibit an electric-magnetic duality symmetry. We develop a framework that makes this analogy manifest by explicitly identifying the electric and magnetic components of perturbative gravitational waves. Within this formulation, we show that duality rotations between these gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields constitute a Noether symmetry of the linearized theory, and we derive the associated conserved current. The corresponding conserved charge encodes the difference in intensity between the right- and left-handed circularly polarized components of the gravitational wave - that is, between its self-dual and anti-self-dual parts. Remarkably, this conservation law remains valid even when the gravitational perturbations propagate on generic curved backgrounds. We then investigate whether this symmetry survives quantization. While the duality symmetry is preserved at the quantum level in flat spacetime, we find that it is anomalously broken in curved backgrounds. As a result, an imbalance between right- and left-handed gravitons could be excited from the vacuum. This effect represents a chiral anomaly for massless spin-two fields, generalizing known results for fermions and spin-one photon fields.</description>

      <title>New class of rotating charged black holes with nonaligned electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a large family of twisting and expanding solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations of algebraic type D, for which the two double principal null directions (PNDs) of the Weyl tensor are not aligned with the null eigendirections of the Faraday tensor. In addition to systematically deriving this new class, we present its various metric forms and convenient parameterizations. We show that in Boyer-Lindquist-type coordinates these solutions depend on 7 parameters, namely the Kerr and NUT (Newman-Unti-Tamburino) twist parameters $a$ and $l$, mass parameter $m$, acceleration $\alpha$, strength of the Maxwell field $|c|$, and angular parameters $\beta, \gamma$ that represent two duality rotations of the Faraday tensor, which include the rotation between the electric and magnetic charges generating the aligned part of the Maxwell field. This coordinate parameterization, analogous to the Griffiths-Podolsk\'y form of the Pleba\'nski-Demia\'nski solutions, allows us to perform various limits, explicitly identify the subcases, and determine the physical interpretation of the new class. Interestingly, by considering the limit with no acceleration ($\alpha\to 0$), one obtains either the famous Kerr-Newman-NUT black holes (if the parameter $|c|$ remains constant) or the novel Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson black holes, announced recently in our work [Kerr Black Hole in a Uniform Bertotti-Robinson Magnetic Field: An Exact Solution, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 135} (2025) 18, 181401] (if $|c|\rightarrow \infty$ while $\alpha |c|=\mathrm{const.}$). We may thus conclude that this new class of spacetimes represents twisting charged accelerating black holes, immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field. In the non-twisting subcase, we obtain the previously known solution of Van den Bergh-Carminati.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a string theoretic approach to surface counting in local Calabi--Yau fourfolds via supersymmetric localization in topologically twisted four-dimensional gauge theories. This approach is based on a spectral correspondence between PT1-stable pairs on local fourfolds and twisted quasimaps with fixed two-dimensional domain associated to the ADHM quiver, or, equivalently, ADHM sheaves. For local toric fourfolds, we derive a conjectural residue formula for the K-theoretic quasimap partition function via Coulomb branch localization. As a result, in this case, we obtain a conjectural prescription fixing all usual sign ambiguities in the equivariant computation of such invariants. We present some explicit computations for local P2, extending the results available in the literature, and describe the formalism in general. This is the first instance of Coulomb branch localization for a quasimap theory in the context of four-dimensional gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: We construct the most general form of our previously proposed nonlinear extension of quantum mechanics that possesses three basic properties. Unlike the simpler model, the new version is not completely integrable, but it has an underlying Hamiltonian structure. We analyze a particular solution in detail, and we use a natural extension of the Born rule to compute particle trajectories. We find that closed particle orbits are possible.</description>

      <title>Quantum Curve for strip geometries, Topological Recursion and open GW/DT invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open topological string partition function gives rise to open Gromov-Witten invariants, open Donaldson-Thomas invariants and 3D-5D BPS indices. Utilizing the remodelling conjecture which connects topological recursion and topological string theory, in this paper we study open topological string theory for the subclass of toric Calabi-Yau threefold known as strip geometries. For this purpose, certain new developments in the theory of topological recursion are applied as its extension to Logarithmic Topological Recursion (Log-TR) and the universal $x$--$y$ duality. Through this we derive the open topological string partition function and also the associated quantum curve. We also explain how this is related to the open Donaldson-Thomas partition function associated with certain symmetric quivers, exponential networks and $q$-Barnes type integrals. In the process, we also connect how 3D-5D wall crossing affects these partition functions as one varies $x$, in examples.</description>

      <title>Hubble Constant and Mass Determination of Centaurus A &amp; M83 from TRGB Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An independent determination of the Hubble constant is crucial given the persistent tension between early- and late-Universe measurements. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus~A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$). By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. From the overlap of these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(7.3 \pm 2.0) \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{12}\,M_{\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass yields a corresponding Hubble constant of $(64.0 \pm 4.6)\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the $\sim 2\sigma$ tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the proximity of M83 to the velocity surface, breaking the assumptions of the Hubble flow model. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial mass estimate is in good agreement with the group mass derived from the $K$-band luminosity of its brightest members and from projected mass methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17597v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The photon radiation induced by rescattering in a magnetized medium is investigated in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Within the high-energy limit, the photon emission rate and the associated electromagnetic energy loss are derived using the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev formalism at first order in opacity, for a quark jet propagating a quark-gluon plasma under a background magnetic field. Quantitative analysis shows a slight suppression of the overall photon radiation over a broad range of jet energies in this process. This reduction in photon yield consequently leads to a moderate decrease in the electromagnetic energy loss of the jet. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the electromagnetic properties of strongly interacting matter in high-energy nucleus-nucleus collisions and motivate experimental comparison of photon yields from quark-gluon plasma with similar properties but distinct magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Baryogenesis with BARYONET: a self-contained review of the WKB approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive, self-contained pedagogical computation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe within electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG), from the derivation of the semiclassical, CP-dependent force to the formulation and solution of the transport equations obtained from the Boltzmann equations$-$all implemented in the open-source code BARYONET. Our analysis follows the semiclassical WKB approach, where spatially varying complex masses across expanding bubble walls feel CP-violating forces that bias plasma transport. Starting from the stationary Boltzmann equation in the wall frame and projecting onto a hierarchy of velocity moments, we derive a compact, fluid-like system of coupled differential equations for chemical potentials and velocity perturbations. After obtaining the solutions, one can define the left-handed baryon chemical potential, which acts as the source term for the weak sphalerons. These processes generate the baryon asymmetry in front of the wall, which is subsequently frozen once it passes through it.
  We validate the framework against established formalisms and provide benchmarks in representative scenarios, including singlet extensions of the Standard Model, two-Higgs-doublet models, and Higgs$-\phi^6$ constructions. The resulting BARYONET implementation delivers an automated, reproducible pipeline for WKB-based baryogenesis studies, connecting formal derivations with phenomenological applications.
  In parallel, we revisit standard EWBG ingredients$-$diffusion constants, Yukawa/helicity-flip rates, and strong/weak sphaleron rates$-$to clarify conventions, update numerical inputs, and present a pedagogical derivation, ensuring transparent reproducibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25605v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stringy description of a system composed of two heavy quarks and two heavy antiquarks, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present both analytical and numerical studies of the string configurations for rectangular geometries. As an application, we analyze the two lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials. Our results suggest that the ground state of the $QQ\bar Q\bar Q$ system is a mixed state of a hadronic molecule and a tetraquark state. For general geometries, we derive the asymptotic expression for the energy of the tetraquark configuration in the infrared limit and extend this result to multiquark configurations. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension.</description>
