      <title>Ring-Exchange Interaction Effects on Magnons in Dirac Magnet CoTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic interactions that determine magnetic order and magnon energies typically involve only two spins. While rare, multi-spin interactions can also appear in quantum magnets and be the driving force in the ground state selection and in the nature of its excitations. By performing time-domain terahertz and magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements combined with theoretical modeling, we determine the origin of the magnon excitation gap in Dirac antiferromagnet CoTiO$_3$. By adding a ring-exchange interaction in a hexagonal plaquette of the honeycomb lattice to both an XXZ spin model and to a low energy spin-orbital flavor wave model, a gap is generated in the magnon spectrum at the Brillouin zone center. With this addition, the flavor wave model reproduces a large swath of experimental results including terahertz, Raman, inelastic neutron scattering, and magnetization experiments.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Limits of Energy Extraction in Active Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active materials form a class of far-from-equilibrium systems that are driven internally and exhibit self-organization which can be harnessed to perform mechanical work. Inspired by experiments on synthetic active networks we examine limits of work extraction from an active viscoelastic medium by analyzing the transport of a particle. The active viscoelastic material possesses an equilibrium density where the active and passive forces are balanced out. In one dimension, a gliding activation front (AF) that converts a passive to an active medium, provides active energy at a constant rate, which is injected into the system at one end and propagates to the other. We demonstrate that there exists a maximum velocity of the AF, above which the activated region fails to deliver the transport power. We hypothesize, and intuitively argue based on the limit cases, that the feasibility and the velocity of transport can be interpreted in terms of the velocity of an equilibration Domain Wall of the field, which is set by two parameters: a measure of activity, and the viscoelastic timescale. The phase diagram comprises Transport and No-Transport sectors, namely for any pair of the two parameters, there exists a threshold velocity of the AF above which the particle transport becomes impossible. Constructing the phase diagram we find that there are regions of the phase diagram for which the threshold velocity of the AF diverges. Larger viscoelastic timescale makes the transport region more accessible, and increases the transport velocity therein. Also, we find that increasing the velocity of AF results in larger extracted power but smaller transport coefficient; the ratio of the transport velocity and that of the AF. Our model provides a framework for understanding the energetics of transport phenomena in biology, and designing efficient mechanisms of transport in synthetic active materials.</description>
