      <title>Decomposable Transformer Point Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard paradigm of modeling marked point processes is by parameterizing the intensity function using an attention-based (Transformer-style) architecture. Despite the flexibility of these methods, their inference is based on the computationally intensive thinning algorithm. In this work, we propose a framework where the advantages of the attention-based architecture are maintained and the limitation of the thinning algorithm is circumvented. The framework depends on modeling the conditional distribution of inter-event times with a mixture of log-normals satisfying a Markov property and the conditional probability mass function for the marks with a Transformer-based architecture. The proposed method attains state-of-the-art performance in predicting the next event of a sequence given its history. The experiments also reveal the efficacy of the methods that do not rely on the thinning algorithm during inference over the ones they do. Finally, we test our method on the challenging long-horizon prediction task and find that it outperforms a baseline developed specifically for tackling this task; importantly, inference requires just a fraction of time compared to the thinning-based baseline.</description>

      <title>A Unified View on Learning Unnormalized Distributions via Noise-Contrastive Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a family of estimators based on noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) for learning unnormalized distributions. The main contribution of this work is to provide a unified perspective on various methods for learning unnormalized distributions, which have been independently proposed and studied in separate research communities, through the lens of NCE. This unified view offers new insights into existing estimators. Specifically, for exponential families, we establish the finite-sample convergence rates of the proposed estimators under a set of regularity assumptions, most of which are new.</description>

      <title>Local Prediction-Powered Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To infer a function value on a specific point $x$, it is essential to assign higher weights to the points closer to $x$, which is called local polynomial / multivariable regression. In many practical cases, a limited sample size may ruin this method, but such conditions can be improved by the Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) technique. This paper introduced a specific algorithm for local multivariable regression using PPI, which can significantly reduce the variance of estimations without enlarge the error. The confidence intervals, bias correction, and coverage probabilities are analyzed and proved the correctness and superiority of our algorithm. Numerical simulation and real-data experiments are applied and show these conclusions. Another contribution compared to PPI is the theoretical computation efficiency and explainability by taking into account the dependency of the dependent variable.</description>

      <title>A model-constrained Discontinuous Galerkin Network (DGNet) for Compressible Euler Equations with Out-of-Distribution Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time accurate solutions of large-scale complex dynamical systems are critically needed for control, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and decision-making in practical engineering and science applications, particularly in digital twin contexts. In this work, we develop a model-constrained discontinuous Galerkin Network (DGNet) approach, an extension to our previous work [Model-constrained Tagent Slope Learning Approach for Dynamical Systems], for compressible Euler equations with out-of-distribution generalization. The core of DGNet is the synergy of several key strategies: (i) leveraging time integration schemes to capture temporal correlation and taking advantage of neural network speed for computation time reduction; (ii) employing a model-constrained approach to ensure the learned tangent slope satisfies governing equations; (iii) utilizing a GNN-inspired architecture where edges represent Riemann solver surrogate models and nodes represent volume integration correction surrogate models, enabling capturing discontinuity capacity, aliasing error reduction, and mesh discretization generalizability; (iv) implementing the input normalization technique that allows surrogate models to generalize across different initial conditions, boundary conditions, and solution orders; and (v) incorporating a data randomization technique that not only implicitly promotes agreement between surrogate models and true numerical models up to second-order derivatives, ensuring long-term stability and prediction capacity, but also serves as a data generation engine during training, leading to enhanced generalization on unseen data. To validate the effectiveness, stability, and generalizability of our novel DGNet approach, we present comprehensive numerical results for 1D and 2D compressible Euler equation problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Learning of the Latent Space of Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models based on latent variables, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs), have gained lots of interests due to their impressive performance in many fields. However, many data such as natural images usually do not populate the ambient Euclidean space but instead reside in a lower-dimensional manifold. Thus an inappropriate choice of the latent dimension fails to uncover the structure of the data, possibly resulting in mismatch of latent representations and poor generative qualities. Towards addressing these problems, we propose a novel framework called the latent Wasserstein GAN (LWGAN) that fuses the Wasserstein auto-encoder and the Wasserstein GAN so that the intrinsic dimension of the data manifold can be adaptively learned by a modified informative latent distribution. We prove that there exist an encoder network and a generator network in such a way that the intrinsic dimension of the learned encoding distribution is equal to the dimension of the data manifold. We theoretically establish that our estimated intrinsic dimension is a consistent estimate of the true dimension of the data manifold. Meanwhile, we provide an upper bound on the generalization error of LWGAN, implying that we force the synthetic data distribution to be similar to the real data distribution from a population perspective. Comprehensive empirical experiments verify our framework and show that LWGAN is able to identify the correct intrinsic dimension under several scenarios, and simultaneously generate high-quality synthetic data by sampling from the learned latent distribution.</description>

      <title>WHOMP: Optimizing Randomized Controlled Trials via Wasserstein Homogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate methods for partitioning datasets into subgroups that maximize diversity within each subgroup while minimizing dissimilarity across subgroups. We introduce a novel partitioning method called the $\textit{Wasserstein Homogeneity Partition}$ (WHOMP), which optimally minimizes type I and type II errors that often result from imbalanced group splitting or partitioning, commonly referred to as accidental bias, in comparative and controlled trials. We conduct an analytical comparison of WHOMP against existing partitioning methods, such as random subsampling, covariate-adaptive randomization, rerandomization, and anti-clustering, demonstrating its advantages. Moreover, we characterize the optimal solutions to the WHOMP problem and reveal an inherent trade-off between the stability of subgroup means and variances among these solutions. Based on our theoretical insights, we design algorithms that not only obtain these optimal solutions but also equip practitioners with tools to select the desired trade-off. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of WHOMP through numerical experiments, highlighting its superiority over traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Diffusion Models Under the Manifold Hypothesis in High-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) are powerful state-of-the-art methods used to generate synthetic data from high-dimensional data distributions and are widely used for image, audio and video generation as well as many more applications in science and beyond. The manifold hypothesis states that high-dimensional data often lie on lower-dimensional manifolds within the ambient space, and is widely believed to hold in provided examples. While recent results has provided invaluable insight into how diffusion models adapt to the manifold hypothesis, they do not capture the great empirical success of these models, making this a very fruitful research direction.
  In this work, we study DDPMs under the manifold hypothesis and prove that they achieve rates independent of the ambient dimension in terms of learning the score. In terms of sampling, we obtain rates independent of the ambient dimension w.r.t. the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and $O(\sqrt{D})$ w.r.t. the Wasserstein distance. We do this by developing a new framework connecting diffusion models to the well-studied theory of extrema of Gaussian Processes.</description>

      <title>Constructing Confidence Intervals for 'the' Generalization Error -- a Comprehensive Benchmark Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When assessing the quality of prediction models in machine learning, confidence intervals (CIs) for the generalization error, which measures predictive performance, are a crucial tool. Luckily, there exist many methods for computing such CIs and new promising approaches are continuously being proposed. Typically, these methods combine various resampling procedures, most popular among them cross-validation and bootstrapping, with different variance estimation techniques. Unfortunately, however, there is currently no consensus on when any of these combinations may be most reliably employed and how they generally compare. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale study comparing CIs for the generalization error - empirically evaluating 13 different methods on a total of 18 tabular regression and classification problems, using four different inducers and a total of eight loss functions. We give an overview of the methodological foundations and inherent challenges of constructing CIs for the generalization error and provide a concise review of all 13 methods in a unified framework. Finally, the CI methods are evaluated in terms of their relative coverage frequency, width, and runtime. Based on these findings, we are able to identify a subset of methods that we would recommend. We also publish the datasets as a benchmarking suite on OpenML and our code on GitHub to serve as a basis for further studies.</description>

      <title>Classical Statistical (In-Sample) Intuitions Don't Generalize Well: A Note on Bias-Variance Tradeoffs, Overfitting and Moving from Fixed to Random Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sudden appearance of modern machine learning (ML) phenomena like double descent and benign overfitting may leave many classically trained statisticians feeling uneasy -- these phenomena appear to go against the very core of statistical intuitions conveyed in any introductory class on learning from data. The historical lack of earlier observation of such phenomena is usually attributed to today's reliance on more complex ML methods, overparameterization, interpolation and/or higher data dimensionality. In this note, we show that there is another reason why we observe behaviors today that appear at odds with intuitions taught in classical statistics textbooks, which is much simpler to understand yet rarely discussed explicitly. In particular, many intuitions originate in fixed design settings, in which in-sample prediction error (under resampling of noisy outcomes) is of interest, while modern ML evaluates its predictions in terms of generalization error, i.e. out-of-sample prediction error in random designs. Here, we highlight that this simple move from fixed to random designs has (perhaps surprisingly) far-reaching consequences on textbook intuitions relating to the bias-variance tradeoff, and comment on the resulting (im)possibility of observing double descent and benign overfitting in fixed versus random designs.</description>

      <title>Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Networks for Geographic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positional Encoder Graph Neural Networks (PE-GNNs) are a leading approach for modeling continuous spatial data. However, they often fail to produce calibrated predictive distributions, limiting their effectiveness for uncertainty quantification. We introduce the Positional Encoder Graph Quantile Neural Network (PE-GQNN), a novel method that integrates PE-GNNs, Quantile Neural Networks, and recalibration techniques in a fully nonparametric framework, requiring minimal assumptions about the predictive distributions. We propose a new network architecture that, when combined with a quantile-based loss function, yields accurate and reliable probabilistic models without increasing computational complexity. Our approach provides a flexible, robust framework for conditional density estimation, applicable beyond spatial data contexts. We further introduce a structured method for incorporating a KNN predictor into the model while avoiding data leakage through the GNN layer operation. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PE-GQNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.</description>

      <title>Most Influential Subset Selection: Challenges, Promises, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can we attribute the behaviors of machine learning models to their training data? While the classic influence function sheds light on the impact of individual samples, it often fails to capture the more complex and pronounced collective influence of a set of samples. To tackle this challenge, we study the Most Influential Subset Selection (MISS) problem, which aims to identify a subset of training samples with the greatest collective influence. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the prevailing approaches in MISS, elucidating their strengths and weaknesses. Our findings reveal that influence-based greedy heuristics, a dominant class of algorithms in MISS, can provably fail even in linear regression. We delineate the failure modes, including the errors of influence function and the non-additive structure of the collective influence. Conversely, we demonstrate that an adaptive version of these heuristics which applies them iteratively, can effectively capture the interactions among samples and thus partially address the issues. Experiments on real-world datasets corroborate these theoretical findings, and further demonstrate that the merit of adaptivity can extend to more complex scenarios such as classification tasks and non-linear neural networks. We conclude our analysis by emphasizing the inherent trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, questioning the use of additive metrics such as the linear datamodeling score, and offering a range of discussions.</description>

      <title>A novel application of Shapley values for large multidimensional time-series data: Applying explainable AI to a DNA profile classification neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Shapley values to high-dimensional, time-series-like data is computationally challenging - and sometimes impossible. For $N$ inputs the problem is $2^N$ hard. In image processing, clusters of pixels, referred to as superpixels, are used to streamline computations. This research presents an efficient solution for time-seres-like data that adapts the idea of superpixels for Shapley value computation. Motivated by a forensic DNA classification example, the method is applied to multivariate time-series-like data whose features have been classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). In DNA processing, it is important to identify alleles from the background noise created by DNA extraction and processing. A single DNA profile has $31,200$ scan points to classify, and the classification decisions must be defensible in a court of law. This means that classification is routinely performed by human readers - a monumental and time consuming process. The application of a CNN with fast computation of meaningful Shapley values provides a potential alternative to the classification. This research demonstrates the realistic, accurate and fast computation of Shapley values for this massive task</description>

      <title>Bridging OOD Detection and Generalization: A Graph-Theoretic View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of modern machine learning, models deployed in real-world scenarios often encounter diverse data shifts like covariate and semantic shifts, leading to challenges in both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and detection. Despite considerable attention to these issues separately, a unified framework for theoretical understanding and practical usage is lacking. To bridge the gap, we introduce a graph-theoretic framework to jointly tackle both OOD generalization and detection problems. By leveraging the graph formulation, data representations are obtained through the factorization of the graph's adjacency matrix, enabling us to derive provable error quantifying OOD generalization and detection performance. Empirical results showcase competitive performance in comparison to existing methods, thereby validating our theoretical underpinnings. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/graph-spectral-ood.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Event Categorization Matrix Approach for Nuclear Detonations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current efforts to detect nuclear detonations and correctly categorize explosion sources with ground- and space-collected discriminants presents challenges that remain unaddressed by the Event Categorization Matrix (ECM) model. Smaller events (lower yield explosions) often include only sparse observations among few modalities and can therefore lack a complete set of discriminants. The covariance structures can also vary significantly between such observations of event (source-type) categories. Both obstacles are problematic for ``classic'' ECM. Our work addresses this gap and presents a Bayesian update to the previous ECM model, termed B-ECM, which can be trained on partial observations and does not rely on a pooled covariance structure. We further augment ECM with Bayesian Decision Theory so that false negative or false positive rates of an event categorization can be reduced in an intuitive manner. To demonstrate improved categorization rates with B-ECM, we compare an array of B-ECM and classic ECM models with multiple performance metrics that leverage Monte Carlo experiments. We use both synthetic and real data. Our B-ECM models show consistent gains in overall accuracy and a lower false negative rates relative to the classic ECM model. We propose future avenues to improve B-ECM that expand its decision-making and predictive capability.</description>

      <title>Using dynamic loss weighting to boost improvements in forecast stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rolling origin forecast instability refers to variability in forecasts for a specific period induced by updating the forecast when new data points become available. Recently, an extension to the N-BEATS model for univariate time series point forecasting was proposed to include forecast stability as an additional optimization objective, next to accuracy. It was shown that more stable forecasts can be obtained without harming accuracy by minimizing a composite loss function that contains both a forecast error and a forecast instability component, with a static hyperparameter to control the impact of stability. In this paper, we empirically investigate whether further improvements in stability can be obtained without compromising accuracy by applying dynamic loss weighting algorithms, which change the loss weights during training. We show that some existing dynamic loss weighting methods achieve this objective. However, our proposed extension to the Random Weighting approach -- Task-Aware Random Weighting -- shows the best performance.</description>

      <title>Towards the Mitigation of Confirmation Bias in Semi-supervised Learning: a Debiased Training Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) commonly exhibits confirmation bias, where models disproportionately favor certain classes, leading to errors in predicted pseudo labels that accumulate under a self-training paradigm. Unlike supervised settings, which benefit from a rich, static data distribution, SSL inherently lacks mechanisms to correct this self-reinforced bias, necessitating debiased interventions at each training step. Although the generation of debiased pseudo labels has been extensively studied, their effective utilization remains underexplored. Our analysis indicates that data from biased classes should have a reduced influence on parameter updates, while more attention should be given to underrepresented classes. To address these challenges, we introduce TaMatch, a unified framework for debiased training in SSL. TaMatch employs a scaling ratio derived from both a prior target distribution and the model's learning status to estimate and correct bias at each training step. This ratio adjusts the raw predictions on unlabeled data to produce debiased pseudo labels. In the utilization phase, these labels are differently weighted according to their predicted class, enhancing training equity and minimizing class bias. Additionally, TaMatch dynamically adjust the target distribution in response to the model's learning progress, facilitating robust handling of practical scenarios where the prior distribution is unknown. Empirical evaluations show that TaMatch significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across a range of challenging image classification tasks, highlighting the critical importance of both the debiased generation and utilization of pseudo labels in SSL.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction has become increasingly popular for quantifying the uncertainty associated with machine learning models. Recent work in graph uncertainty quantification has built upon this approach for conformal graph prediction. The nascent nature of these explorations has led to conflicting choices for implementations, baselines, and method evaluation. In this work, we analyze the design choices made in the literature and discuss the tradeoffs associated with existing methods. Building on the existing implementations for existing methods, we introduce techniques to scale existing methods to large-scale graph datasets without sacrificing performance. Our theoretical and empirical results justify our recommendations for future scholarship in graph conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Embed and Emulate: Contrastive representations for simulation-based inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific modeling and engineering applications rely heavily on parameter estimation methods to fit physical models and calibrate numerical simulations using real-world measurements. In the absence of analytic statistical models with tractable likelihoods, modern simulation-based inference (SBI) methods first use a numerical simulator to generate a dataset of parameters and simulated outputs. This dataset is then used to approximate the likelihood and estimate the system parameters given observation data. Several SBI methods employ machine learning emulators to accelerate data generation and parameter estimation. However, applying these approaches to high-dimensional physical systems remains challenging due to the cost and complexity of training high-dimensional emulators. This paper introduces Embed and Emulate (E&amp;E): a new SBI method based on contrastive learning that efficiently handles high-dimensional data and complex, multimodal parameter posteriors. E&amp;E learns a low-dimensional latent embedding of the data (i.e., a summary statistic) and a corresponding fast emulator in the latent space, eliminating the need to run expensive simulations or a high dimensional emulator during inference. We illustrate the theoretical properties of the learned latent space through a synthetic experiment and demonstrate superior performance over existing methods in a realistic, non-identifiable parameter estimation task using the high-dimensional, chaotic Lorenz 96 system.</description>

      <title>Dual Cone Gradient Descent for Training Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a prominent approach for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing a combined loss function that incorporates both boundary loss and PDE residual loss. Despite their remarkable empirical performance in various scientific computing tasks, PINNs often fail to generate reasonable solutions, and such pathological behaviors remain difficult to explain and resolve. In this paper, we identify that PINNs can be adversely trained when gradients of each loss function exhibit a significant imbalance in their magnitudes and present a negative inner product value. To address these issues, we propose a novel optimization framework, Dual Cone Gradient Descent (DCGD), which adjusts the direction of the updated gradient to ensure it falls within a dual cone region. This region is defined as a set of vectors where the inner products with both the gradients of the PDE residual loss and the boundary loss are non-negative. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence properties of DCGD algorithms in a non-convex setting. On a variety of benchmark equations, we demonstrate that DCGD outperforms other optimization algorithms in terms of various evaluation metrics. In particular, DCGD achieves superior predictive accuracy and enhances the stability of training for failure modes of PINNs and complex PDEs, compared to existing optimally tuned models. Moreover, DCGD can be further improved by combining it with popular strategies for PINNs, including learning rate annealing and the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK).</description>

      <title>A comparison of Bayesian sampling algorithms for high-dimensional particle physics and cosmology applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several decades now, Bayesian inference techniques have been applied to theories of particle physics, cosmology and astrophysics to obtain the probability density functions of their free parameters. In this study, we review and compare a wide range of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling techniques to determine their relative efficacy on functions that resemble those encountered most frequently in the particle astrophysics literature. Our first series of tests explores a series of high-dimensional analytic test functions that exemplify particular challenges, for example highly multimodal posteriors or posteriors with curving degeneracies. We then investigate two real physics examples, the first being a global fit of the $\Lambda$CDM model using cosmic microwave background data from the Planck experiment, and the second being a global fit of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model using a wide variety of collider and astrophysics data. We show that several examples widely thought to be most easily solved using nested sampling approaches can in fact be more efficiently solved using modern MCMC algorithms, but the details of the implementation matter. Furthermore, we also provide a series of useful insights for practitioners of particle astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Autoregressive Models as Causal Inference Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing causal inference (CI) models are limited to primarily handling low-dimensional confounders and singleton actions. We propose an autoregressive (AR) CI framework capable of handling complex confounders and sequential actions common in modern applications. We accomplish this by {\em sequencification}, transforming data from an underlying causal diagram into a sequence of tokens. This approach not only enables training with data generated from any DAG but also extends existing CI capabilities to accommodate estimating several statistical quantities using a {\em single} model. We can directly predict interventional probabilities, simplifying inference and enhancing outcome prediction accuracy. We demonstrate that an AR model adapted for CI is efficient and effective in various complex applications such as navigating mazes, playing chess endgames, and evaluating the impact of certain keywords on paper acceptance rates.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Benefits of SimCLR Pre-Training in Two-Layer Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SimCLR is one of the most popular contrastive learning methods for vision tasks. It pre-trains deep neural networks based on a large amount of unlabeled data by teaching the model to distinguish between positive and negative pairs of augmented images. It is believed that SimCLR can pre-train a deep neural network to learn efficient representations that can lead to a better performance of future supervised fine-tuning. Despite its effectiveness, our theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms of SimCLR is still limited. In this paper, we theoretically introduce a case study of the SimCLR method. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a toy image data model. We show that, under certain conditions on the number of labeled data, SimCLR pre-training combined with supervised fine-tuning achieves almost optimal test loss. Notably, the label complexity for SimCLR pre-training is far less demanding compared to direct training on supervised data. Our analysis sheds light on the benefits of SimCLR in learning with fewer labels.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric efficient estimation of marginal structural models with multi-valued time-varying treatments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marginal structural models are a popular method for estimating causal effects in the presence of time-varying exposures. In spite of their popularity, no scalable non-parametric estimator exist for marginal structural models with multi-valued and time-varying treatments. In this paper, we use machine learning together with recent developments in semiparametric efficiency theory for longitudinal studies to propose such an estimator. The proposed estimator is based on a study of the non-parametric identifying functional, including first order von-Mises expansions as well as the efficient influence function and the efficiency bound. We show conditions under which the proposed estimator is efficient, asymptotically normal, and sequentially doubly robust in the sense that it is consistent if, for each time point, either the outcome or the treatment mechanism is consistently estimated. We perform a simulation study to illustrate the properties of the estimators, and present the results of our motivating study on a COVID-19 dataset studying the impact of mobility on the cumulative number of observed cases.</description>

      <title>Best Arm Identification with Minimal Regret</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by real-world applications that necessitate responsible experimentation, we introduce the problem of best arm identification (BAI) with minimal regret. This innovative variant of the multi-armed bandit problem elegantly amalgamates two of its most ubiquitous objectives: regret minimization and BAI. More precisely, the agent's goal is to identify the best arm with a prescribed confidence level $\delta$, while minimizing the cumulative regret up to the stopping time. Focusing on single-parameter exponential families of distributions, we leverage information-theoretic techniques to establish an instance-dependent lower bound on the expected cumulative regret. Moreover, we present an intriguing impossibility result that underscores the tension between cumulative regret and sample complexity in fixed-confidence BAI. Complementarily, we design and analyze the Double KL-UCB algorithm, which achieves asymptotic optimality as the confidence level tends to zero. Notably, this algorithm employs two distinct confidence bounds to guide arm selection in a randomized manner. Our findings elucidate a fresh perspective on the inherent connections between regret minimization and BAI.</description>

      <title>$O(d/T)$ Convergence Theory for Diffusion Probabilistic Models under Minimal Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models, which generate new data by learning to reverse a diffusion process that perturbs data from the target distribution into noise, have achieved remarkable success across various generative tasks. Despite their superior empirical performance, existing theoretical guarantees are often constrained by stringent assumptions or suboptimal convergence rates. In this paper, we establish a fast convergence theory for a popular SDE-based sampler under minimal assumptions. Our analysis shows that, provided $\ell_{2}$-accurate estimates of the score functions, the total variation distance between the target and generated distributions is upper bounded by $O(d/T)$ (ignoring logarithmic factors), where $d$ is the data dimensionality and $T$ is the number of steps. This result holds for any target distribution with finite first-order moment. To our knowledge, this improves upon existing convergence theory for both the SDE-based sampler and another ODE-based sampler, while imposing minimal assumptions on the target data distribution and score estimates. This is achieved through a novel set of analytical tools that provides a fine-grained characterization of how the error propagates at each step of the reverse process.</description>

The development of new Talagrand's contraction lemmas for high-dimensional mappings between function spaces and CNNs for general Lipschitz activation functions is a key technical contribution. Our results show that the Rademacher complexity does not depend on the network length for CNNs with some special types of activation functions such as ReLU, Leaky ReLU, Parametric Rectifier Linear Unit, Sigmoid, and Tanh.</description>

      <title>A Differentially Private Weighted Empirical Risk Minimization Procedure and its Application to Outcome Weighted Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is common practice to use data containing personal information to build predictive models in the framework of empirical risk minimization (ERM). While these models can be highly accurate in prediction, sharing the results from these models trained on sensitive data may be susceptible to privacy attacks. Differential privacy (DP) is an appealing framework for addressing such data privacy issues by providing mathematically provable bounds on the privacy loss incurred when releasing information from sensitive data. Previous work has primarily concentrated on applying DP to unweighted ERM. We consider weighted ERM (wERM), an important generalization, where each individual's contribution to the objective function can be assigned varying weights. We propose the first differentially private algorithm for general wERM, with theoretical DP guarantees. Extending the existing DP-ERM procedures to wERM creates a pathway for deriving privacy-preserving learning methods for individualized treatment rules, including the popular outcome weighted learning (OWL). We evaluate the performance of the DP-wERM framework applied to OWL in both simulation studies and in a real clinical trial. All empirical results demonstrate the feasibility of training OWL models via wERM with DP guarantees while maintaining sufficiently robust model performance, providing strong evidence for the practicality of implementing the proposed privacy-preserving OWL procedure in real-world scenarios involving sensitive data.</description>

      <title>Policy learning "without" overlap: Pessimism and generalized empirical Bernstein's inequality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.09900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies offline policy learning, which aims at utilizing observations collected a priori (from either fixed or adaptively evolving behavior policies) to learn an optimal individualized decision rule that achieves the best overall outcomes for a given population. Existing policy learning methods rely on a uniform overlap assumption, i.e., the propensities of exploring all actions for all individual characteristics must be lower bounded. As one has no control over the data collection process, this assumption can be unrealistic in many situations, especially when the behavior policies are allowed to evolve over time with diminishing propensities for certain actions.
  In this paper, we propose Pessimistic Policy Learning (PPL), a new algorithm that optimizes lower confidence bounds (LCBs) -- instead of point estimates -- of the policy values. The LCBs are constructed using knowledge of the behavior policies for collecting the offline data. Without assuming any uniform overlap condition, we establish a data-dependent upper bound for the suboptimality of our algorithm, which only depends on (i) the overlap for the optimal policy, and (ii) the complexity of the policy class we optimize over. As an implication, for adaptively collected data, we ensure efficient policy learning as long as the propensities for optimal actions are lower bounded over time, while those for suboptimal ones are allowed to diminish arbitrarily fast. In our theoretical analysis, we develop a new self-normalized type concentration inequality for inverse-propensity-weighting estimators, generalizing the well-known empirical Bernstein's inequality to unbounded and non-i.i.d. data. We complement our theory with an efficient optimization algorithm via Majorization-Minimization and policy tree search, as well as extensive simulation studies and real-world applications that demonstrate the efficacy of PPL.</description>

      <title>Exponential Quantum Communication Advantage in Distributed Inference and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training and inference with large machine learning models that far exceed the memory capacity of individual devices necessitates the design of distributed architectures, forcing one to contend with communication constraints. We present a framework for distributed computation over a quantum network in which data is encoded into specialized quantum states. We prove that for models within this framework, inference and training using gradient descent can be performed with exponentially less communication compared to their classical analogs, and with relatively modest overhead relative to standard gradient-based methods. We show that certain graph neural networks are particularly amenable to implementation within this framework, and moreover present empirical evidence that they perform well on standard benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first example of exponential quantum advantage for a generic class of machine learning problems that hold regardless of the data encoding cost. Moreover, we show that models in this class can encode highly nonlinear features of their inputs, and their expressivity increases exponentially with model depth. We also delineate the space of models for which exponential communication advantages hold by showing that they cannot hold for linear classification. Our results can be combined with natural privacy advantages in the communicated quantum states that limit the amount of information that can be extracted from them about the data and model parameters. Taken as a whole, these findings form a promising foundation for distributed machine learning over quantum networks.</description>

      <title>On fundamental aspects of quantum extreme learning machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Extreme Learning Machines (QELMs) have emerged as a promising framework for quantum machine learning. Their appeal lies in the rich feature map induced by the dynamics of a quantum substrate - the quantum reservoir - and the efficient post-measurement training via linear regression. Here we study the expressivity of QELMs by decomposing the prediction of QELMs into a Fourier series. We show that the achievable Fourier frequencies are determined by the data encoding scheme, while Fourier coefficients depend on both the reservoir and the measurement. Notably, the expressivity of QELMs is fundamentally limited by the number of Fourier frequencies and the number of observables, while the complexity of the prediction hinges on the reservoir. As a cautionary note on scalability, we identify four sources that can lead to the exponential concentration of the observables as the system size grows (randomness, hardware noise, entanglement, and global measurements) and show how this can turn QELMs into useless input-agnostic oracles. In particular, our result on the reservoir-induced concentration strongly indicates that quantum reservoirs drawn from a highly random ensemble make QELM models unscalable. Our analysis elucidates the potential and fundamental limitations of QELMs, and lays the groundwork for systematically exploring quantum reservoir systems for other machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Differentially Private PCA and Estimation for Spiked Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating a covariance matrix and its associated principal components is a fundamental problem in contemporary statistics. While optimal estimation procedures have been developed with well-understood properties, the increasing demand for privacy preservation introduces new complexities to this classical problem. In this paper, we study optimal differentially private Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and covariance estimation within the spiked covariance model. We precisely characterize the sensitivity of eigenvalues and eigenvectors under this model and establish the minimax rates of convergence for estimating both the principal components and covariance matrix. These rates hold up to logarithmic factors and encompass general Schatten norms, including spectral norm, Frobenius norm, and nuclear norm as special cases. We propose computationally efficient differentially private estimators and prove their minimax optimality for sub-Gaussian distributions, up to logarithmic factors. Additionally, matching minimax lower bounds are established. Notably, compared to the existing literature, our results accommodate a diverging rank, a broader range of signal strengths, and remain valid even when the sample size is much smaller than the dimension, provided the signal strength is sufficiently strong. Both simulation studies and real data experiments demonstrate the merits of our method.</description>

      <title>Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects on Survival Outcomes Using Counterfactual Censoring Unbiased Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) from observational data have largely focused on continuous or binary outcomes, with less attention paid to survival outcomes and almost none to settings with competing risks. In this work, we develop censoring unbiased transformations (CUTs) for survival outcomes both with and without competing risks. After converting time-to-event outcomes using these CUTs, direct application of HTE learners for continuous outcomes yields consistent estimates of heterogeneous cumulative incidence effects, total effects, and separable direct effects. Our CUTs enable application of a much larger set of state of the art HTE learners for censored outcomes than had previously been available, especially in competing risks settings. We provide generic model-free learner-specific oracle inequalities bounding the finite-sample excess risk. The oracle efficiency results depend on the oracle selector and estimated nuisance functions from all steps involved in the transformation. We demonstrate the empirical performance of the proposed methods in simulation studies.</description>

      <title>HyperBERT: Mixing Hypergraph-Aware Layers with Language Models for Node Classification on Text-Attributed Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07309v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs are characterized by complex topological structure, representing higher-order interactions among multiple entities through hyperedges. Lately, hypergraph-based deep learning methods to learn informative data representations for the problem of node classification on text-attributed hypergraphs have garnered increasing research attention. However, existing methods struggle to simultaneously capture the full extent of hypergraph structural information and the rich linguistic attributes inherent in the nodes attributes, which largely hampers their effectiveness and generalizability. To overcome these challenges, we explore ways to further augment a pretrained BERT model with specialized hypergraph-aware layers for the task of node classification. Such layers introduce higher-order structural inductive bias into the language model, thus improving the model's capacity to harness both higher-order context information from the hypergraph structure and semantic information present in text. In this paper, we propose a new architecture, HyperBERT, a mixed text-hypergraph model which simultaneously models hypergraph relational structure while maintaining the high-quality text encoding capabilities of a pre-trained BERT. Notably, HyperBERT presents results that achieve a new state-of-the-art on five challenging text-attributed hypergraph node classification benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Simplifying Random Forests' Probabilistic Forecasts</title>

Abstract: Since their introduction by Breiman, Random Forests (RFs) have proven to be useful for both classification and regression tasks. The RF prediction of a previously unseen observation can be represented as a weighted sum of all training sample observations. This nearest-neighbor-type representation is useful, among other things, for constructing forecast distributions (Meinshausen, 2006). In this paper, we consider simplifying RF-based forecast distributions by sparsifying them. That is, we focus on a small subset of nearest neighbors while setting the remaining weights to zero. This sparsification step greatly improves the interpretability of RF predictions. It can be applied to any forecasting task without re-training existing RF models. In empirical experiments, we document that the simplified predictions can be similar to or exceed the original ones in terms of forecasting performance. We explore the statistical sources of this finding via a stylized analytical model of RFs. The model suggests that simplification is particularly promising if the unknown true forecast distribution contains many small weights that are estimated imprecisely.</description>

      <title>The Star Geometry of Critic-Based Regularizer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational regularization is a classical technique to solve statistical inference tasks and inverse problems, with modern data-driven approaches parameterizing regularizers via deep neural networks showcasing impressive empirical performance. Recent works along these lines learn task-dependent regularizers. This is done by integrating information about the measurements and ground-truth data in an unsupervised, critic-based loss function, where the regularizer attributes low values to likely data and high values to unlikely data. However, there is little theory about the structure of regularizers learned via this process and how it relates to the two data distributions. To make progress on this challenge, we initiate a study of optimizing critic-based loss functions to learn regularizers over a particular family of regularizers: gauges (or Minkowski functionals) of star-shaped bodies. This family contains regularizers that are commonly employed in practice and shares properties with regularizers parameterized by deep neural networks. We specifically investigate critic-based losses derived from variational representations of statistical distances between probability measures. By leveraging tools from star geometry and dual Brunn-Minkowski theory, we illustrate how these losses can be interpreted as dual mixed volumes that depend on the data distribution. This allows us to derive exact expressions for the optimal regularizer in certain cases. Finally, we identify which neural network architectures give rise to such star body gauges and when do such regularizers have favorable properties for optimization. More broadly, this work highlights how the tools of star geometry can aid in understanding the geometry of unsupervised regularizer learning.</description>
