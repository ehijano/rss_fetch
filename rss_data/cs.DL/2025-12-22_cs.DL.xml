      <title>Intelligent Knowledge Mining Framework: Bridging AI Analysis and Trustworthy Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented proliferation of digital data presents significant challenges in access, integration, and value creation across all data-intensive sectors. Valuable information is frequently encapsulated within disparate systems, unstructured documents, and heterogeneous formats, creating silos that impede efficient utilization and collaborative decision-making. This paper introduces the Intelligent Knowledge Mining Framework (IKMF), a comprehensive conceptual model designed to bridge the critical gap between dynamic AI-driven analysis and trustworthy long-term preservation. The framework proposes a dual-stream architecture: a horizontal Mining Process that systematically transforms raw data into semantically rich, machine-actionable knowledge, and a parallel Trustworthy Archiving Stream that ensures the integrity, provenance, and computational reproducibility of these assets. By defining a blueprint for this symbiotic relationship, the paper provides a foundational model for transforming static repositories into living ecosystems that facilitate the flow of actionable intelligence from producers to consumers. This paper outlines the motivation, problem statement, and key research questions guiding the research and development of the framework, presents the underlying scientific methodology, and details its conceptual design and modeling.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the field normalization approaches/practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Field normalization plays a crucial role in scientometrics to ensure fair comparisons across different disciplines. In this paper, we revisit the effectiveness of several widely used field normalization methods. Our findings indicate that source-side normalization (as employed in SNIP) does not fully eliminate citation bias across different fields and the imbalanced paper growth rates across fields are a key factor for this phenomenon. To address the issue of skewness, logarithmic transformation has been applied. Recently, a combination of logarithmic transformation and mean-based normalization, expressed as ln(c+1)/mu, has gained popularity. However, our analysis shows that this approach does not yield satisfactory results. Instead, we find that combining logarithmic transformation (ln(c+1)) with z-score normalization provides a better alternative. Furthermore, our study suggests that the better performance is achieved when combining both source-side and target-side field normalization methods.</description>
