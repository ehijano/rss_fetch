      <title>Shortwave Absorption by Alumina Aerosol Amplifies Stratospheric Warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stratospheric alumina aerosols from rocket launches and geoengineering proposals are presently understood to help counteract greenhouse gas-induced warming by reflecting sunlight and cooling the lower atmosphere. Here, from direct measurement of aerosol absorption cross-sections, we report alumina's hitherto unknown shortwave absorption characteristics. Alumina's shortwave absorption could offset up to 10\% of its solar-reflective cooling, and if implemented for geoengineering, would warm the stratosphere more than black carbon from rocket launches.</description>

      <title>Limited impact of Greenland meltwater on abruptness and reversibility of future Atlantic overturning changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All climate models project that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will weaken in the 21st century, but most models neglect increasing runoff from the Greenland ice sheet. Greenland meltwater is expected to exacerbate AMOC weakening, and omitting it increases the uncertainty in assessing the possibility of a future abrupt collapse or tipping of the AMOC. Here, we test the abruptness and reversibility of AMOC changes under strong future global warming in a state-of-the-art climate model with and without physically plausible Greenland meltwater forcing. While Greenland meltwater significantly exacerbates future AMOC weakening, modeled long-term AMOC changes are neither abrupt nor irreversible. While accounting for Greenland meltwater will increase the accuracy of climate projections, our results suggest that the importance of Greenland meltwater for assessing the risk of future AMOC tipping may be smaller than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Event-based complexity in atmospheric turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the studies of Kolmogorov and Oboukhov in 1941, the problem of intermittent large velocity excursions was recognized to be one of the most intriguing and elusive aspects of turbulent flows. While many efforts were devoted since 1960s to the magnitude intermittency, related to the statistics of the large increments in the turbulent signals, the attention towards the so-called clustering intermittency has started to increase only in the last two decades, even if some pioneering studies were carried in previous years. The low attention towards the clustering intermittency is somewhat surprising, as intermittency itself is essentially defined as an alternance of extended quiescent periods/regions and short/small high activity periods/zones. It is then natural to characterize intermittency by means of events marked along the dependent variable axes, whatever time or space. Conversely, the concept of crucial events and of temporal complexity, related to non-trivial clustering properties of these same events, has been proposed as a general interpretative framework for the investigation of complex systems with metastable self-organizing dynamics. Without any claim to being complete, in this chapter we give a review of event-based complexity approaches used in literature for the description of turbulence in the planetary boundary layer. The main goal is to put a first bridge between turbulence studies exploiting event-based complexity approaches, such as clustering exponents and classical Oboukhov intermittency exponents, and studies about intermittent complex systems, where concepts and ideas developed in the fields of non-equilibrium statistical physics, probability theory and dynamical system theory are jointly exploited.</description>

      <title>PACER: Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21657v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate models serve as critical tools for evaluating the effects of climate change and projecting future climate scenarios. However, the reliance on numerical simulations of physical equations renders them computationally intensive and inefficient. While deep learning methodologies have made significant progress in weather forecasting, they are still unstable for climate emulation tasks. Here, we propose PACER, a lightweight 684K parameter Physics Informed Uncertainty Aware Climate Emulator. PACER emulates temperature and precipitation stably for 86 years while only being trained on greenhouse gas emissions data. We incorporate a fundamental physical law of advection-diffusion in PACER accounting for boundary conditions and empirically estimating the diffusion co-efficient and flow velocities from emissions data. PACER has been trained on 15 climate models provided by ClimateSet outperforming baselines across most of the climate models and advancing a new state of the art in a climate diagnostic task.</description>

      <title>MAUSAM: An Observations-focused assessment of Global AI Weather Prediction Models During the South Asian Monsoon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasts are critical for societal planning and disaster preparedness. Yet these forecasts remain challenging to produce and evaluate, especially in regions with sparse observational coverage. Current evaluation of artificial intelligence (AI) weather prediction relies primarily on reanalyses, which can obscure important deficiencies. Here we present MAUSAM (Measuring AI Uncertainty during South Asian Monsoon), an evaluation of seven leading AI-based forecasting systems - FourCastNet, FourCastNet-SFNO, Pangu-Weather, GraphCast, Aurora, AIFS, and GenCast - during the South Asian Monsoon, using ground-based weather stations, rain gauge networks, and geostationary satellite imagery. The AI models demonstrate impressive forecast skill during monsoon across a broad range of variables, ranging from large-scale surface temperature and winds to precipitation, cloud cover, and subseasonal to seasonal eddy statistics, highlighting the strength of data-driven weather prediction. However, the models still exhibit systematic errors at finer scales like the underprediction of extreme precipitation, divergent cyclone tracks, and the mesoscale kinetic energy spectra, highlighting avenues for future improvement. A comparison against observations reveals forecast errors up to 15-45% larger than those relative to reanalysis and traditional forecasts, indicating that reanalysis-centric benchmarks can overstate forecast skill. Of the models assessed, AIFS achieves the most consistent representation of atmospheric variables, with GraphCast and GenCast also showing strong skill. The analysis presents a framework for evaluating AI weather models on regional prediction and highlights both the promise and current limitations of AI weather prediction in data-sparse regions, underscoring the importance of observational evaluation for future operational adoption.</description>

      <title>Constraining Atmospheric River Uncertainty Using Instantaneous Poleward Latent Heat Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are extreme weather events that play a crucial role in the global hydrological cycle. As a key mechanism of latent heat transport (LHT), they help maintain energy balance in the climate system. While an AR is characterized by a long, narrow corridor of water vapor associated with a low-level jet stream, there is no unambiguous definition of an AR grounded in geophysical fluid dynamics. AR identification is currently performed by a variety of threshold-based algorithms, which has introduced uncertainty in the estimated contribution of ARs to LHT. We calculate the instantaneous eddy LHT from moist, poleward anomalies. Based on the dynamics of the large-scale atmospheric circulation, this quantity is a physics-based upper bound that constrains AR projections from the variety of detection algorithms. We quantify the contribution of ARs to transient eddies, stationary eddies, and transient-stationary eddy interactions, and we show the relative contributions of ARs vs. other processes, such as dry, equatorward transport. We use this upper bound as a reference to quantify ARs' frequency, intensity, and temporal variability. In the historical climate, the AR reference transport is ~2.21 PW at the latitude of peak transport in Northern Hemisphere winter, with a temporal standard deviation of approximately 0.47 PW. In a future climate projection, at this latitude, AR-induced LHT will increase by 0.5 PW and the corresponding temporal variability will increase by 0.14 PW. The future change in the AR reference transport is larger than the changes associated with other types of atmospheric anomalies.</description>

      <title>A data-driven global ocean forecasting model with sub-daily and eddy-resolving resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-fidelity ocean forecasting at high spatial and temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-scale dynamical features, with profound implications for hazard prediction, maritime navigation, and sustainable ocean management. While conventional numerical models can generate sub-daily, eddy-resolving forecasts, they demand substantial computational resources and often struggle to maintain predictive skill at such fine scales. Data-driven models offer a promising alternative with significantly higher computational efficiency; however, most are constrained to daily outputs and show a rapid decay in accuracy when extended to sub-daily timescales. Here, we introduce TianHai, the first-of-its-kind global data-driven 6-hour forecasting model, which delivers predictions at 1/12{\deg} eddy-resolving resolution with a vertical extent down to 1,500 m. A key feature of TianHai is the integration of atmospheric forcings through FuXi-Atmosphere, a data-driven atmospheric forecasting system, which enables the explicit representation of air-sea coupling effects. Unlike conventional approaches, TianHai does not rely on numerical atmospheric models or external meteorological forecasts, making it a fully data-driven framework for coupled prediction. Benchmark experiments demonstrate that TianHai delivers state-of-the-art performance in forecasting temperature and salinity profiles, zonal and meridional currents, sea surface temperature, and sea level anomalies for lead times ranging from 1 to 10 days.</description>
