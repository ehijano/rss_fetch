      <title>Geometric investigation of chaos unfolding in Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the geometric approach to chaos in Hamiltonian dynamics, by means of the Jacobi-Levi-Civita equation (JLCE). We inspect numerically two low-dimensional dynamical systems; show that, along chaotic orbits, the exponential divergence between nearby trajectories quantified by the JLCE does not unfold in a continuous manner, rather is closer to a multiplicative discrete process: in correspondence of each turning point, where the trajectory bounces away from the boundary of the energetically allowed region, the relative separation increases sharply and abruptly. We highlight through analytical and numerical arguments that the chaotic rather than regular nature of the trajectory is determined by the details of the scattering with the boundary, and interpret these results in terms of parametric resonance theory, and specifically the Mathieu equation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and non-integrability of the variable-length double pendulum: exploring chaos and periodicity via the Lyapunov refined maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends our previous work~(Szumi\'nski and Maciejewski, 2024), where we explored the dynamics and integrability of the double-spring pendulum. Here, we investigate the variable-length double pendulum, a three-degree-of-freedom Hamiltonian system combining features of the classic double pendulum and the swinging Atwood machine. With its intricate dynamics, this system is crucial for studying nonlinear phenomena such as high-order resonances, chaos, and bifurcations. We address the challenges posed by high-dimensional phase spaces using a novel tool, the \textit{Lyapunov refined maps}, which integrates Poincar\'e sections, phase-parametric diagrams, and Lyapunov exponents. This framework comprehensively analyzes periodic, quasi-periodic, and chaotic behaviors. By measuring the strength of chaos, it also offers insights into the system's dynamical structure. Additionally, we apply Morales-Ramis theory to examine integrability, leveraging the differential Galois group of variational equations to establish non-integrability conditions. The Kovacic algorithm is used to analyze the solvability of higher-dimensional differential equations, complemented by Lyapunov exponent diagrams to exclude integrable dynamics under certain parameters. Our findings advance the fundamental understanding of variable-length pendulum dynamics, offering new insights and methodologies for further research with potential applications in adaptive robotics, energy harvesting, and biomechanics. Additionally, this work represents a significant step toward proving the long-sought non-integrability of the classical double pendulum.</description>

      <title>Geometry- and inertia-limited chaotic growth in classical many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic instability in many-body systems is commonly quantified by the largest Lyapunov exponent, yet general constraints on its magnitude in classical interacting systems remain poorly understood. Here we establish explicit, Hamiltonian-specific upper bounds on the largest Lyapunov exponent for classical many-body systems with local interactions. These bounds arise from instantaneous stability constraints on the Hamiltonian flow and are expressed in terms of inertial scales and the curvature of the interaction potential. We show that they naturally separate into two qualitatively distinct classes: non-violable bounds, controlled by worst-case local curvature scales and inertia and insensitive to spatial structure, and ergodic ceilings, which retain spectral information and encode collective modes and finite-size effects under generic dynamical evolution. For a paradigmatic one-dimensional coupled-rotor chain (Josephson junction array), the ergodic ceiling admits a closed analytic form and produces a dynamically inaccessible region for sustained chaotic growth in the Lyapunov exponent-energy plane, which we confirm numerically. In contrast to non-violable estimates, the ergodic ceiling yields a sharper constraint on chaotic growth by capturing collective suppression mechanisms absent at the level of local curvature alone. Remarkably, in the thermodynamic limit the ergodic ceiling asymptotically approaches an inertial ceiling that limits sustained Lyapunov growth, becoming independent of temperature and interaction strength. While classical systems do not admit universal chaos bounds, our results identify a broad class of natural Hamiltonian systems in which chaotic growth is inherently limited by inertia and interaction geometry, thereby setting a minimal microscopic timescale for long-time loss of memory of initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Tipping points in complex ecological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tipping points are one of the hot topics in modern physics of complex systems. But what is a tipping point? A generic definition declares it as ``a state of the system where a small change in its parameters can lead to a significant change in its properties''. Additional ingredients that often enter the definition of tipping process are the abruptness of the resulting change and its irreversibility, i.e. it is impossible to recover the initial state if one reverses the protocol of change of the parameters. However, there exists a number of different mathematical structures that can show this behavior, the one that was originally suggested as a tipping point (nowadays usually referred to as bifurcation induced tipping) is just one of many. Different preconditions and/or different level of details included into the model, reflecting also different environmental forcing, can lead to a variety of tipping mechanisms. Furthermore, in a spatially extended system and/or a system with multiple scales, different parts can react to a change in environmental conditions differently or at a different time, interacting with each other to create a tipping cascade. In this paper, using ecosystems as a paradigm of complex nonlinear open systems, we provide a critical overview of the progress made in tipping point science over the last 15 years. We highlight the main findings, identify gaps in our knowledge, and outline a roadmap for further progress.</description>

      <title>Control of spatiotemporal chaos by stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how spatiotemporal chaos in dynamical systems can be controlled by stochastically returning them to their initial conditions. Focusing on discrete nonlinear maps, we analyze how key measures of chaos -- the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, which quantify sensitivity to initial perturbations and the ballistic spread of information, respectively -- are reduced by stochastic resetting. We identify a critical resetting rate that induces a dynamical phase transition, characterized by the simultaneous vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, effectively arresting the spread of information. These theoretical predictions are validated and illustrated with numerical simulations of the celebrated logistic map and its lattice extension. Beyond discrete maps, our findings are applicable to virtually any chaotic extended classical many-body system.</description>

      <title>Localization of information driven by stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of extended many-body systems are generically chaotic. Classically, a hallmark of chaos is the exponential sensitivity to initial conditions captured by positive Lyapunov exponents. Supplementing chaotic dynamics with stochastic resetting drives a sharp dynamical phase transition: We show that the Lyapunov spectrum, i.e., the complete set of Lyapunov exponents, abruptly collapses to zero above a critical resetting rate. At criticality, we find a sudden loss of analyticity of the velocity-dependent Lyapunov exponent, which we relate to the transition from ballistic scrambling of information to an arrested regime where information becomes exponentially localized over a characteristic length diverging at criticality with an exponent $\nu = 1/2$ and a dynamical exponent $z=2$. We illustrate our analytical results on generic chaotic dynamics by numerical simulations of coupled map lattices.</description>

      <title>Causally coherent structures in turbulent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extraction of spatio-temporal coherence in high-dimensional, chaotic, non-linear dynamical systems, such as turbulent flows, remains a fundamental challenge in physics, mathematics and engineering. In this work, we employ Shannon transfer entropy (TE) to identify causally coherent motions in a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (TBL). This causality metric, rooted in information theory, enables the identification of sources and targets in dynamical systems using the corresponding time series. However, TE requires sophisticated tuning of various hyperparameters, such as the Markovian order of the source ($m$), which can spatially vary in wall-bounded turbulent flow. Here, we present an adaptive tuning and discuss the influence of $m$ across different TBLs. We introduce the concept of causally coherent structures (CCS), i.e. coherent structures interpreted as spatio-temporal patterns of causality. Moreover, the net transfer entropy flux is also utilised to identify boundary layer locations acting either as sources or targets. The standard viscous, logarithmic, and outer layers are characterised by information fluxes, highlighting, for example, dominant top-down interactions between the inner and outer layers, analogously to the classical energy cascade. This work extends techniques previously employed in the literature, such as correlation and spectral analysis, and presents an approach that is inherently general and applicable to a wide range of chaotic dynamical systems, with applications in cognitive sciences, systems biology and finance.</description>
