      <title>Financial Wind Tunnel: A Retrieval-Augmented Market Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Market simulator tries to create high-quality synthetic financial data that mimics real-world market dynamics, which is crucial for model development and robust assessment. Despite continuous advancements in simulation methodologies, market fluctuations vary in terms of scale and sources, but existing frameworks often excel in only specific tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Financial Wind Tunnel (FWT), a retrieval-augmented market simulator designed to generate controllable, reasonable, and adaptable market dynamics for model testing. FWT offers a more comprehensive and systematic generative capability across different data frequencies. By leveraging a retrieval method to discover cross-sectional information as the augmented condition, our diffusion-based simulator seamlessly integrates both macro- and micro-level market patterns. Furthermore, our framework allows the simulation to be controlled with wide applicability, including causal generation through "what-if" prompts or unprecedented cross-market trend synthesis. Additionally, we develop an automated optimizer for downstream quantitative models, using stress testing of simulated scenarios via FWT to enhance returns while controlling risks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables the generalizable and reliable market simulation, significantly improve the performance and adaptability of downstream models, particularly in highly complex and volatile market conditions.

      <title>Unleashing the power of text for credit default prediction: Comparing human-written and generative AI-refined texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the integration of a representative large language model, ChatGPT, into lending decision-making with a focus on credit default prediction. Specifically, we use ChatGPT to analyse and interpret loan assessments written by loan officers and generate refined versions of these texts. Our comparative analysis reveals significant differences between generative artificial intelligence (AI)-refined and human-written texts in terms of text length, semantic similarity, and linguistic representations. Using deep learning techniques, we show that incorporating unstructured text data, particularly ChatGPT-refined texts, alongside conventional structured data significantly enhances credit default predictions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the contents of both human-written and ChatGPT-refined assessments contribute to the models' prediction and show that the effect of essential words is highly context-dependent. Moreover, we find that ChatGPT's analysis of borrower delinquency contributes the most to improving predictive accuracy. We also evaluate the business impact of the models based on human-written and ChatGPT-refined texts, and find that, in most cases, the latter yields higher profitability than the former. This study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of generative AI in financial services.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Startup Success Predictions in Venture Capital: A GraphRAG Augmented Multivariate Time Series Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09420v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Venture Capital (VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a novel approach using GraphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions.</description>

      <title>Smart leverage? Rethinking the role of Leveraged Exchange Traded Funds in constructing portfolios to beat a benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraged Exchange Traded Funds (LETFs), while extremely controversial in the literature, remain stubbornly popular with both institutional and retail investors in practice. While the criticisms of LETFs are certainly valid, we argue that their potential has been underestimated in the literature due to the use of very simple investment strategies involving LETFs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the potential of including a broad stock market index LETF in long-term, dynamically-optimal investment strategies designed to maximize the outperformance over standard investment benchmarks in the sense of the information ratio (IR). Our results exploit the observation that positions in a LETF deliver call-like payoffs, so that the addition of a LETF to a portfolio can be a convenient way to add inexpensive leverage while providing downside protection. Under stylized assumptions, we present and analyze closed-form IR-optimal investment strategies using either a LETF or standard/vanilla ETF (VETF) on the same equity index, which provides the necessary intuition for the potential and benefits of LETFs. In more realistic settings, we use a neural network-based approach to determine the IR-optimal strategies, trained on bootstrapped historical data. We find that IR-optimal strategies with a broad stock market LETF are not only more likely to outperform the benchmark than IR-optimal strategies derived using the corresponding VETF, but are able to achieve partial stochastic dominance over the benchmark and VETF-based strategies in terms of terminal wealth.</description>
