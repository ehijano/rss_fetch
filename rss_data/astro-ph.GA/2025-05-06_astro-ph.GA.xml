      <title>Magnetic field amplification during a turbulent collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The question of whether a dynamo can be triggered by gravitational collapse is of great interest, especially for the early Universe. Here, we employ supercomoving coordinates to study the magnetic field amplification from decaying turbulence during gravitational collapse. We perform three-dimensional simulations and show that for large magnetic Reynolds numbers, there can be exponential growth of the comoving magnetic field with conformal time before the decay of turbulence impedes further amplification. The collapse dynamics only affects the nonlinear feedback from the Lorentz force, which diminishes more rapidly for shorter collapse times, allowing nearly kinematic continued growth. We also confirm that helical turbulence is more efficient in driving dynamo action than nonhelical turbulence, but this difference decreases for larger collapse times. We also show that for nearly irrotational flows, dynamo amplification is still possible, but it is always associated with a growth of vorticity -- even if it still remains very small. In nonmagnetic runs, the growth of vorticity is associated with viscosity and grows with the Mach number. In the presence of magnetic fields, vorticity emerges from the curl of the Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>GULP II: Hierarchical Distribution and Evolution of Young Stellar Structures in NGC 4449</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the hierarchical distribution and evolution of young stellar structures in the dwarf starburst galaxy NGC 4449 using data from the GULP survey. By analyzing the spatial distribution of field stars younger than 100 Myr, we identify large-scale stellar complexes and substructures using HDBSCAN -- a density-based clustering algorithm -- and trace their evolution over time. While comparing these stellar structures in different regions of the galaxy, we find that the central bar-like region shows a clear expansion of the structures within the first $\sim$ 60 Myrs, while the arm-like structure in the NE shows no discernible trend, possibly due to external perturbations from tidal interactions with a neighboring galaxy. An age-dependent two point correlation function (TPCF) analysis shows that young stars exhibit a strong hierarchical distribution, with clustering strength decreasing over time. The power-law slope of the TPCF, which starts at $\alpha \sim 0.65$ for stars younger than 5 Myr, shows a slight decline to $\alpha \sim 0.4$ for stars older than 50 Myr, though it does not reach a completely flat (random) distribution. This trend indicates a subtle weakening of structural hierarchy among young ($&lt;$100 Myr) stars, which is primarily driven by internal stellar motions. Future work will extend this analysis to the remaining 26 galaxies in the GULP survey to better constrain the role of the galactic environment in shaping the hierarchical evolution of young stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Abundant Population of Broad H$\alpha$ Emitters in the GOODS-N Field Revealed by CONGRESS, FRESCO, and JADES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectroscopic search for broad H$\alpha$ emitters at z~3.7-6.5 in the GOODS-N field, utilizing JWST/NIRCam slitless spectroscopy from FRESCO and CONGRESS, complemented by JADES imaging. We identify 19 broad H$\alpha$ emitters with FWHM &gt; 1000 km/s at z~4-5.5, including 9 new sources. The black hole masses and AGN bolometric luminosities, inferred from the broad H$\alpha$ components, indicate that most sources are accreting at ~10% of the Eddington limit. We derive their host stellar masses via SED fitting and find higher $M_{BH}/M_{*}$ ratios relative to the local $M_{BH}$-$M_{*}$ relations, consistent with previous studies. We find that 42% of the sample do not satisfy the widely-used color selection criteria for Little Red Dots (LRDs), with the majority of these sources lacking the characteristic steep red slope. A comparison of the average SEDs between our sample and LRDs selected in the same field reveals that the steep red slopes observed in some LRDs are likely due to line-boosting effects as previously suggested. Furthermore, we find that 68% of color-selected LRDs with H$\alpha$ detections in the NIRCam/Grism spectra do not exhibit broad-line features. While the limited sensitivity of the grism spectra may hinder the detection of broad-line components in faint sources, our findings still highlight the enigmatic nature of the LRD population.</description>

      <title>The Large-scale Environments of Low-luminosity AGNs at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 6$ and Implications for Their Host Dark Matter Halos from a Complete NIRCam Grism Redshift Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-scale environments and clustering properties of 28 low-luminosity AGNs at $z=3.9-6$ in the GOODS-N field. Our sample, identified from the JWST NIRCam Imaging and WFSS data in CONGRESS and FRESCO surveys with either broad H$\alpha$ emission lines or V-shape continua, are compared to 782 H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs) selected from the same data. These AGNs are located in diverse large-scale environments and do not preferentially reside in denser environments compared to HAEs. Their overdensity field, $\delta$, averaged over (15 $h^{-1}$cMpc)$^3$, ranges from $-0.56$ to 10.56, and shows no clear correlation with broad-line luminosity, black hole (BH) masses, or the AGN fraction. It suggests that $&gt; 10$ cMpc structures do not significantly influence BH growth. We measure the two-point cross-correlation function of AGNs with HAEs, finding a comparable amplitude to that of the HAE auto-correlation. This indicates similar bias parameters and host dark matter halo masses for AGNs and HAEs. The correlation length of field AGNs is 4.26 $h^{-1}$cMpc, and 7.66 $h^{-1}$cMpc at $3.9 &lt; z &lt; 5$ and $5 &lt; z &lt; 6$, respectively. We infer a median host dark matter halo mass of $\log (M_h/M_\odot)\approx 11.0-11.2$ and host stellar masses of $\log (M_\star/M_\odot) \approx 8.4-8.6$ by comparing with the UniverseMachine simulation. Our clustering analysis suggests that low-luminosity AGNs at high redshift reside in normal star-forming galaxies with overmassive BHs. They represent an intrinsically distinct population from luminous quasars and could be a common phase in galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic field and stellar feedback in the evolution of filamentary structures in collapsing star-forming clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Filaments are common features in molecular clouds and they play a key role in star formation (SF). Studying their life cycle is essential to fully understand the SF process.
  Aims: We aim to characterise the impact of magnetic field ($B$) and stellar feedback on the evolution of filamentary structures in star-forming clouds.
  Methods: We performed two numerical simulations of a collapsing $10^4\,$M$_\odot$ cloud with different mass-to-flux ratios ($\mu=2$ and $\mu=8$), including early stellar feedback (jets and HII regions). Using DisPerSE, we extracted the three-dimensional filamentary network and analysed its properties as it evolves throughout the SF event.
  Results: We observed that the filamentary network in the simulations follow two distinct evolutionary pathways. In the strongly magnetised case, the cloud maintains a sparser filamentary network, and the arising filaments are predominantly perpendicular to $B$ lines. With a weak field, the cloud develops a single central hub, with converging filaments favouring a parallel alignment relative to $B$. Furthermore, while always accreting, filaments exhibit faster flows towards the hub relative to the surrounding gas. In the weakly magnetised run, the central hub dominates the dynamics, and filaments exhibit faster flows as they approach the central hub. Finally, once the expanding HII region impacts the filaments, they align to $B$ independently of the initial configuration.
  Conclusions: Magnetic fields play a critical role in shaping the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds. Stronger magnetic fields slow the cloud's evolution and inhibit the formation of central hubs, promoting a broader filamentary network instead.
  However, ionising feedback dominates the late-stage evolution, overriding the initial differences and dictating the final filament configuration.</description>

      <title>Recovering the pattern speeds of edge-on barred galaxies via an orbit-superposition method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies, and evaluate its capability to recover the bar pattern speed $\rm\Omega_p$. We select three simulated galaxies Au-18, Au-23, and Au-28 with known pattern speeds from the Auriga simulations, and create MUSE-like mock data sets with edge-on views (inclination angles $\theta_{\rm T}\ge85^\circ$) and various bar azimuthal angles $\varphi_{\rm T}$. For mock data sets with side-on bars ($\varphi_{\rm T}\ge50^\circ$), the model-recovered pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_p$ encompass the true pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_T$ within the model uncertainties ($1\sigma$ confidence levels, $68\%$) for 10 of 12 cases. The average model uncertainty within the $1\sigma$ confidence levels is equal to $10\%$. For mock data sets with end-on bars ($\varphi_{\rm T}\le30^\circ$), the model uncertainties of $\rm\Omega_p$ depend significantly on the bar azimuthal angles $\varphi_{\rm T}$, with the uncertainties of cases with $\varphi_{\rm T}=10^\circ$ approaching $\sim30\%$. However, by imposing a stricter constraint on the bar morphology ($p_{\rm bar}\le0.50$), the average uncertainties are reduced to $14\%$, and $\rm\Omega_p$ still encompass $\rm\Omega_T$ within the model uncertainties for three of four cases. For all the models that we create in this paper, the $2\sigma$ ($95\%$) confidence levels of the model-recovered pattern speeds $\rm\Omega_p$ always cover the true values $\rm\Omega_T$.</description>

      <title>Probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and their hosts from scaling relations pairwise residuals: dominance of stellar velocity dispersion and host halo mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlations between Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies still defy our understanding from both the observational and theoretical perspectives. Here we perform pairwise residual analysis on the latest sample of local inactive galaxies with a uniform calibration of their photometric properties and with dynamically measured masses of their central SMBHs. The residuals reveal that stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$ and, possibly host dark matter halo mass $M_{\rm halo}$, appear as the galactic properties most correlated with SMBH mass, with a secondary (weaker) correlation with spheroidal (bulge) mass $M_{\rm sph}$, as also corroborated by additional Machine Learning tests. These findings may favour energetic/kinetic feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) as the main driver in shaping SMBH scaling relations. Two state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations, inclusive of kinetic AGN feedback, are able to broadly capture the mean trends observed in the residuals, although they tend to either favour $M_{\rm sph}$ as the most fundamental property, or generate too flat residuals. Increasing AGN feedback kinetic output does not improve the comparison with the data. In the Appendix we also show that the galaxies with dynamically measured SMBHs are biased high in $\sigma$ at fixed luminosity with respect to the full sample of local galaxies, proving that this bias is not a byproduct of stellar mass discrepancies. Overall, our results suggest that probing the SMBH-galaxy scaling relations in terms of total stellar mass alone may induce biases, and that either current data sets are incomplete, and/or that more insightful modelling is required to fully reproduce observations.</description>

      <title>Phase-space mixing of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Globular clusters (GCs) host multiple populations characterised by abundance variations in a number of light elements. In many cases, these populations also show spatial and/or kinematic differences, which vary in strength from cluster to cluster and tend to decrease with the clusters' dynamical ages. Aims: In this work, we aim to study the dynamical mixing of multiple populations and establish a link between the more theoretical aspects of the mixing process and various observational parameters that quantify differences between the populations' spatial concentration and velocity anisotropy. Methods: We follow the dynamical mixing of multiple populations in a set of numerical simulations through their distribution in the energy and angular momentum phase space and quantify the evolution of their degree of dynamical mixing. Results: We present the degree of dynamical mixing traced by the intrinsic differences in the phase space distribution of the populations. We compare the differences in phase-space with three observable quantities that describe the degree of mixing in the structural and kinematic differences of the populations: $A^{+}$, commonly used in the literature for spatial differences; and we introduce two new parameters, $\Delta A_{\beta}$ that traces the difference in velocity anisotropy and $\sigma_{\text{Lz}}$, that traces the angular momentum distribution of stars. Conclusions: Our study provides new insights into the dynamics of phase space mixing of multiple populations in globular clusters. We show that differences between the 1P and the 2P observed in old clusters contain key information on the cluster's dynamics and the 1P and the 2P spatial and kinematic properties set by the formation processes, but caution is necessary in using the strength of the present-day differences to quantitatively constrain those imprinted at the time of formation.</description>

      <title>Interstellar dust as a dynamic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of accounting for only a small fraction of the mass of the Interstellar Medium (ISM), dust plays a primary role in many physical and chemical processes in the Universe. It is the main driver of extinction of radiation in the UV/optical wavelength range and a primary source of thermal IR emission. Dust grains contain most of the refractory elements of the ISM and they host chemical processes that involve complex molecular compounds. However, observational evidence suggests that grain structure is highly non-trivial and that dust particles are characterized by granularity, asymmetry and stratification, which significantly affect their interaction with radiation fields. Accurate modeling of such interaction is fundamental to properly explain observational results, but it is a computationally demanding task. Here we present the possibility to investigate the effects of radiation/particle interactions in non-spherically symmetric conditions using a novel implementation of the Transition Matrix formalism, designed to run on scalable parallel hardware facilities.</description>

      <title>The Absolute Age of Milky Way Globular Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) provide statistically significant coeval populations of stars spanning various evolutionary stages, allowing robust constraints on stellar evolution model parameters and ages. We analyze eight old Milky Way GCs with metallicities between [Fe/H] $=-2.31$ and $-0.77$ by comparing theoretical isochrone sets from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program to HST observations. The theoretical isochrones include uncertainties introduced by $21$ stellar evolution parameters such as convective mixing, opacity, diffusion, and nuclear reactions, capturing much of the quantifiable physics used in our code. For each isochrone, we construct synthetic color-magnitude diagrams (CMD) near the main-sequence turn-off region and apply two full-CMD-fitting methods to fit HST ACS data across a range of distance and reddening and measure the absolute age of each GC from the resulting posterior distribution, which accounts for uncertainties in the stellar models, observations, and fitting method. The resulting best-fitting absolute ages range from $\approx 11.5$ to $13.5$ Gyr, with a typical error of $0.5-0.75$ Gyr; the data show a clear trend toward older ages at lower metallicities. Notably, distance and reddening account for over $50\%$ of the uncertainty in age determination in each case, with metallicity, $\alpha$ abundance, mixing length, and helium diffusion being the most important stellar physics parameters for the error budget. We also provide an absolute age-metallicity relation for Milky Way GCs.</description>

      <title>Stellar Mass-Size Relation and Morphology of Massive Quiescent Galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 4$ with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the morphological properties of 17 spectroscopically confirmed massive quiescent galaxies ($10.2 &lt; \log(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) &lt; 11.2$) at $3.0 &lt; z &lt; 4.3$, observed with JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam. Using S\'{e}rsic profile fits to the F277W and F444W imaging, we derive the size-mass relation and find typical sizes of $\sim$0.6-0.8 kpc at $M_{\ast} = 5 \times 10^{10}~M_{\odot}$, consistent with a factor of $\sim$7 growth from $z \sim 4$ to the present day, including a factor of $\sim$2 by $z \sim 2$. Galaxies with earlier formation times ($z_{50} \gtrsim 5$) tend to be larger (up to 0.3 dex above the relation), while late-forming galaxies are more compact. Using a random forest regressor, we identify local environmental density, quantified by $\log(1+\delta^{\prime}_{3})$ from the distances to the three nearest neighbors, as the strongest predictor of bulge-to-total ratio ($B/T$), which ranges from 0.25 to 1. Applying the same method to the IllustrisTNG simulation, the ex-situ stellar mass fraction ($f_{\ast,\mathrm{ex\text{-}situ}}$) -- a proxy for mergers -- is the dominant predictor of $B/T$. Galaxies with high $B/T$ in dense environments show bursty star formation and short quenching timescales ($\lesssim0.4$ Gyr), consistent with bulge growth via merger-induced starbursts; in simulations, such galaxies exhibit elevated ex-situ fractions ($\sim20\%$-$30\%$). In contrast, some high-$B/T$ galaxies in intermediate-density environments have low ex-situ fractions, suggesting that additional mechanisms -- such as violent disk instabilities -- may contribute. These findings point to multiple bulge growth pathways at high redshift, unified by rapid gas accretion, central starbursts, and AGN feedback, as predicted by cosmological simulations.</description>

Abstract: We present a catalog of quasar pairs (QPs) constructed from the DESI DR1 quasar sample, which includes approximately 1.6 million spectroscopically confirmed quasars. Using a redshift-dependent self-matching procedure and applying physical constraints on projected separation (up to 110 kpc) and line-of-sight velocity difference (up to 2000 km/s), we identified 1,842 candidate quasar pairs. Each pair is spectroscopically confirmed, providing reliable redshift and velocity information. We visually classified these systems using DESI Legacy Imaging and SPARCL spectral data into four categories: QP (quasar pairs), QPC (quasar pair candidates), LQC (lensed quasar candidates), and Uncertain. The redshift distribution peaks at around z = 1 to 2.5, and 64.3 percent of QPs have line-of-sight velocity differences below 600 km/s, suggesting that many systems may be physically associated. This catalog provides a statistically meaningful sample for future studies of dual AGNs, gravitational lensing, and quasar clustering.</description>

      <title>FAST Reveals the Extended HI Halo and Accretion Signatures of NGC2683</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of our recent HI observations conducted on the edge-on galaxy NGC2683 using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). In comparison to previous observations made by the VLA, FAST has detected a more extensive distribution of HI. Particularly noteworthy is that the detections made by FAST extend approximately four times farther than those of the VLA in the vertical direction from the galactic plane. The total HI flux measured for NGC2683 amounts to $F_{\rm HI} = 112.1\,\rm{Jy\,km\,s^{-1}}$ (equivalent to a total HI mass of $M_{\rm HI} = 2.32 \times 10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$), which is slightly higher than that detected by VLA. FAST has also identified three dwarf galaxies in close proximity to NGC2683, namely KK69, NGC2683dw1 (hereafter dw1), and NGC2683dw3$?$ (hereafter dw3$?$). dw3$?$ is situated within the extended HI distribution of NGC2683 in projection and lies near the tail of KK69 extending towards NGC2683. These observations suggest that dw3$?$ is likely a result of the accretion process from NGC2683 to KK69. Furthermore, FAST has detected three high-velocity clouds (HVCs), with complex B potentially undergoing accretion with NGC2683. Based on the model from Vollmer et al. 2016 and incorporating the HI halo component, we found that the model with the added HI halo aligns more closely with our FAST observations in NGC2683. The estimated mass of this HI halo is $3 \times 10^8\,{\rm M_\odot}$, constituting approximately 13% of the total HI mass of the galaxy. We suggest that the origination of this HI halo is more likely attributed to external gas accretion.</description>

      <title>The Physical Nature of the Off-centered Extended Emission Associated with the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant fraction of little red dots (LRDs) exhibit nearby extended emission of unknown origin. If physically associated with the LRD, this component may trace stellar emission from an off-centered host galaxy, neighboring companions, or nebular gas illuminated by the active nucleus. We investigate the detailed spectral energy distribution of the extended emission near four LRDs in the JWST UNCOVER and MegaScience surveys. We accurately decompose the extended emission from the dominant point source by simultaneously fitting the images in eight broad-band and nine medium-band filters. After considering both the results from photometric redshift fitting and the probability of galaxies at different redshift overlapping, we confirm that the off-centered blobs in three sources are physically associated with the LRDs, with two of them showing strong [\ion{O}{3}] $\lambda\lambda 4959,\,5007$ emission captured by the medium-band filters. While the spectral energy distributions of all three blobs can be modeled assuming star-forming galaxies with stellar mass $\sim 10^8\,M_{\odot}$, the exceptionally strong [\ion{O}{3}] emission of two sources is best interpreted as pure nebular emission from low-density ($n&lt;10\, {\rm cm}^{-3}$), low-metallicity ($Z\approx 0.05\,Z_{\odot}$) gas photoionized by the ultraviolet radiation from the nearby LRD. Adopting LRD halo masses constrained by clustering measurements and theoretical considerations, we estimate a typical baryonic halo mass accretion rate of $\sim 2-9\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. If the halo accretion rate is sustained to $z=4$ and stars form with an efficiency of 10\%, the accreted gas would form a galaxy with stellar mass $\sim 10^9\,M_{\odot}$, potentially rendering them spatially resolved at lower redshift.</description>

      <title>A pilot method to determine the high mass end of the Stellar Initial Mass Function in galaxies using UVIT, H$\alpha$-MUSE observations and applied to NGC628</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a pilot method to estimate the high-mass initial mass function (IMF) across the arm, interarm, and spur regions in galaxies and apply it to NGC 628. We extracted star-forming complexes (SFCs) from H$\alpha$ VLT/MUSE and UVIT (FUV and NUV) observations of NGC 628 and used ALMA observations to define the molecular gas distribution. We find that the extinction-corrected H$\alpha$ and FUV luminosities correlate well. Using the fact that O stars have a shorter lifetime (10$^7$ yr) compared to B stars (10$^8$ yr), we estimated the approximate number of O stars from H$\alpha$ emission, and the number of B0 ($M_{*} &gt; 10 M_{\odot}$), and B1 ($10 M_{\odot} \geq M_{*} \geq 3 M_{\odot}$) stars using FUV, NUV observations. We derived the IMF index ($\alpha$) for different regions using O to B0 ($\alpha_{1}$) and B0 to B1 ($\alpha_{2}$) stellar ratios. Our findings indicate that if we assume H$\alpha$ arises only from O8-type stars, the resulting $\alpha_{1}$ value is consistent with the canonical IMF index. It steepens when we assume O stars with masses up to 100 $M_{\odot}$ with mean $\alpha_{1}= 3.16 \pm 0.62$. However, the $\alpha_{2}$ does not change for large variations in the O-star population, and the mean $\alpha= 2.64 \pm 0.14$. When we include only blue SFCs ($ FUV-NUV\leq0.3$), mean $\alpha_{2}$ is $2.43 \pm 0.06$. The IMF variation for SFCs in arms and spurs is insignificant. We also find that $\alpha_{2}$ correlates with different properties of the SFCs, the most prominent being the extinction-corrected UV color (FUV-NUV).</description>

      <title>The long-term optical flux variations of Compact Symmetric Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact Symmetric Objects (CSOs) are a distinct category of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) whose optical variability characteristics have not been well investigated. We present here the results of our investigation on the optical flux and colour variability properties of a bona fide sample of 38 CSOs. We used the g-, r- and i-bands data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey that spans a duration of about 5 years. We also considered a comparison sub-sample of blazars that includes 5 flat spectrum radio quasars and 12 BL Lac objects with redshifts and g-band magnitudes similar to the limited sub-sample of 9 CSOs. These two sub-samples of AGN, chosen for this comparative study of their long-term optical variability, represent different orientations of their relativistic jets with respect to the observer. We found that both CSOs and blazars exhibit optical flux variations, although variability of CSOs is lower than that of blazars. The observed variability in both CSOs and blazars is attributed to the relativistic jets and the increased optical variations in blazars relative to CSOs are likely due to beaming effects. CSOs and blazars exhibit similar colour variations, with both of them showing a bluer when brighter trend. Such a colour variability pattern is expected due to processes associated with their relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Reexploring Molecular Complexity with ALMA: Insights into chemical differentiation from the molecular composition of hot cores in Sgr B2(N2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used ALMA to perform a line survey of the high-mass star forming region Sgr B2(N), called ReMoCA. We modeled under the assumption of LTE the spectra obtained toward the sources embedded in the secondary hot core Sgr B2(N2). We compared the chemical composition of these sources to that of sources from the literature and to predictions of the chemical kinetics model MAGICKAL. We detected up to 58 molecules toward Sgr B2(N2)'s hot cores, including up to 24 COMs, as well as many less abundant isotopologs. The compositions of some pairs of sources are well correlated, but differences also exist in particular for HNCO and NH2CHO. The abundances of series of homologous molecules drop by about one order of magnitude at each further step in complexity. The nondetection of radicals yields stringent constraints on the models. The comparison to the chemical models confirms previous evidence of a high cosmic-ray ionization rate in Sgr B2(N). The comparison to sources from the literature gives new insight into chemical differentiation. The composition of most hot cores of Sgr B2(N2) is tightly correlated to that of the hot core G31.41+0.31 and the hot corino IRAS 16293-2422B after normalizing the abundances by classes of molecules (O-, N-, O+N-, and S-bearing). There is no overall correlation between Sgr B2(N2) and the shocked region G+0.693-0.027 also located in Sgr B2, and even less with the cold starless core TMC-1. The class of N-bearing species reveals the largest variance among the four classes of molecules. The S-bearing class shows in contrast the smallest variance. These results imply that the class of N-bearing molecules reacts more sensitively to shocks, low-temperature gas phase chemistry after non-thermal desorption, or density. The abundance shifts observed between the N- and O-bearing molecules may indicate how violently and completely the ice mantles are desorbed. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Identification of BHB stars using Synthetic SkyMapper colors from Gaia XP spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are ideal tracers for mapping the structure of Galactic stellar halo. Traditionally, BHB sample stars are built from large-scale spectroscopic surveys utilizing their spectral features, however, the resulting sample sizes have been quite limited. In this paper, we construct a catalog of BHB stars based on synthetic colors $(u-v)_{0}$ and $(g-i)_{0}$ in SkyMapper photometric systems, which are convolved from Gaia XP spectra. A total of 49,733 BHB stars are selected from nearly the entire sky (excluding regions of low Galactic latitudes $|b| \le 8^{\circ}$ with heavy reddening), with a completeness and purity exceeding 90\%. Using member stars of globular clusters with precise distance determinations, we carefully calibrate the relationship between the $g$-band absolute magnitude and $(g-i)_{0}$, achieving a precision of 0.11\,mag, which corresponds to a 5\% uncertainty in distance. This relation is applied to derive distances for all BHB stars in the constructed sample. Given current capabilities of Gaia XP observations, the constructed BHB sample is primarily located within 20 kpc, enabling detailed mapping of the inner stellar halo. To extend this depth to the outer halo or even the edge of our Galaxy, we explore the potential of the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) and its broad-band photometry for detecting BHB stars. Using mock data from synthetic spectra, we find that it is feasible to distinguish BHB stars from blue stragglers (BS) stars using CSST near-ultraviolet bands ($NUV, u$) photometry. Thanks to the deep limiting magnitude of CSST, its data will provide a groundbreaking perspective on our Galaxy, particularly regarding the outer halo, in an unprecedented volume.</description>

      <title>Formation of hydroxy, cyano and ethynyl derivatives of C4H4 isomers in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of cyclic hydrocarbons is of utmost relevance in current astrochemical research, as they are considered to be among the most significant reservoirs of carbon in the interstellar medium. However, while unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons with three, five, and six carbon atoms have been widely investigated, the highly strained antiaromatic cyclobutadiene, c-C4H4, still remains uncharted. Here, we employed high-level CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12//B2PLYPD3/aug-cc-pVTZ theoretical calculations to analyze whether the cyano (CN), ethynyl (CCH), and hydroxy (OH) derivatives of c-C4H4 and its structural isomers butatriene (H2CCCCH2) and vinylacetylene (H2CCHCCH) can readily form via the gas-phase reaction: C4H4 + X -&gt; C4H3X + H (where X = CN, CCH, and OH). For each system, we thoroughly explored the corresponding potential energy surfaces, identifying their critical points to enable a detailed analysis of the thermochemistry. Hence, we found various exothermic pathways for the formation of CN and CCH derivatives of butatriene and vinylacetylene, with no net activation barriers, while the formation of the OH derivatives is in general less favorable. Prior to the mechanistic study, we also analyzed the complete conformational panorama and stability of all the derivatives at the CCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZ-F12 level. Overall, c-C4H3CN and c-C4H3CCH emerge as particularly promising candidates for interstellar detection, provided that the parental c-C4H4 is present in the gas phase. These findings highlight the potential for detecting polar derivatives of c-C4H4 as indirect evidence of its presence in the ISM, as it appears to be "invisible" to radioastronomical observations. Also, this study underscores the need for future laboratory and theoretical efforts to characterize the spectroscopic properties of the proposed derivatives, paving the way for their eventual identification in space.</description>

      <title>VLBA observations of a sample of low-power compact symmetric objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are intrinsically compact extragalactic radio sources that are thought to be the progenitors of classical radio galaxies. To date, evolutionary models have mainly focused on the formation and growth of high-power radio sources, leaving unanswered many questions related to low-power objects, whose relativistic jets are likely more prone to instabilities. We present a new sample of candidate low-power CSOs selected from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm (FIRST) survey. The main selection criteria are (i) a parsec-scale double radio morphology from archival Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) images and (ii) a VLBA total flux density consistent with that from the FIRST survey, which rules out the presence of significant radio emission extending beyond the parsec scale. The final sample consists of 60 sources with radio luminosities between 10$^{24}$ and 10$^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$ at 1.4 GHz and projected linear sizes between 45 and 430 pc, which fill a region in the radio power-size plane that is currently underpopulated. We carried out VLBA observations at 4.98 GHz of a sub-sample of 20 sources among the brightest candidate CSOs with the aim of confirming their classification. We classify 12 sources as CSOs on the basis of their radio structure and spectral index distribution. In two out of the four CSOs with core identification, the asymmetry in the flux density of the outer components is in agreement with light travel time effects, and there is no evidence of jet-cloud interaction. If we assume a simplistic parametric model, most of the sources in the total sample have a jet power of $\sim 10^{44} - 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$, making their evolutionary paths sensitive to the individual conditions of the jet and its environment.</description>

      <title>DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 survey toward a sample of Planck cold clumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuterated molecules can be used to study the physical conditions and the astro-chemical evolution of molecular clouds. large-sample surveys for deuterated molecules are needed to understand the enhancement of deuterated molecules from diffuse molecular gas to cold cores. A single-pointing survey toward the 559 Planck cold clumps of the Early Cold Core Catalogue (ECC) has been conducted using the Arizona Radio Observatory 12-meter telescope, focusing on the $J$=1-0 transitions of DCO$^+$ and DCN. The survey included observations of 309 cores for DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 simultaneously, followed by 71 of these cores where DCO$^+$ 1-0 was detected for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously, aiming to determine the deuterated fraction ($D_{\rm frac}$). Additionally, 250 cores were observed for DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 simultaneously. Among the 309 sources, DCO$^+$ and DCN 1-0 were detected in 79 and 11 sources, with a detection rates of 25.6 % and 3.6 % respectively. In the 250 sources observed for all four species, DCO$^+$, DCN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CN 1-0 were detected in 58, 9, 57 and 13 sources, with a detection rate of 23.2 %, 3.6 %, 22.8 % and 5.2 % respectively. The $D_{\rm frac}$(HCO$^+$) values in 112 sources range from 0.89 % to 7.4 % with a median value of 3.1 %, while $D_{\rm frac}$(HCN) values in 11 sources range from 1.5 % to 5.5 % with a median value of 2.3 %. The line widths of DCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ 1-0 detections are mostly within 1 km s$^{-1}$. The similarity in $D_{\rm frac}$ values between HCO$^+$ and HCN indicates that the higher detection rate of DCO$^+$ 1-0 compared with DCN 1-0 is due to the lower critical density of DCO$^+$ 1-0. We suggest that the enhancement of DCO$^+$ and DCN likely begins in the early diffuse stage of the molecular cloud, rather than during the cold core formation stage.</description>

      <title>The Tip of Red Giant Branch Distances to Nearby Dwarf Galaxies WLM and Sextans A with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distance measurements to extragalactic systems that are both accurate and precise are cornerstones of modern astrophysics, underpinning the calibration of standard candles and the determination of the Hubble constant. Dwarf galaxies, such as Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM) and Sextans A, provide valuable laboratories for testing distance scales across different stellar populations. In this work, we utilize the high sensitivity and spatial resolution of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to measure the distances to WLM and Sextans A using the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) method. Adopting the TRGB absolute magnitude calibrated by NGC 4258, we determine distance moduli of $\mu_{\mathrm{0,WLM}} = 24.977 \pm 0.018 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.056 (\mathrm{sys})$ mag for WLM and $\mu_{\mathrm{0,SexA}} = 25.740 \pm 0.011 (\mathrm{stat}) \pm 0.057 (\mathrm{sys})$ mag for Sextans A. Our results are consistent within a 3% distance uncertainty with previous measurements based on TRGB, Cepheids, and J-Region Asymptotic Giant Branch (JAGB) methods. With improved distance measurements in the future, these two galaxies have the potential to serve as additional anchor points for TRGB calibration, aiming to reduce the TRGB-based distance uncertainty to below 2%.</description>

      <title>Massive Acquisition of Ultraviolet Color Excess Information from GALEX and UVOT Bands</title>

Abstract: This study employs stellar parameters from spectroscopic surveys and Zhang et al. based on Gaia XP spectra, along with photometric data from GALEX, UVOT, and Gaia, to obtain extensive ultraviolet color excess information for the relevant bands of GALEX and UVOT. By considering the impact of stellar parameters (\teff, \feh, and \logg) on intrinsic color indices, and utilizing the blue-edge method combined with a random forest algorithm, an empirical relationship between stellar parameters and intrinsic ultraviolet color indices is established. By combining observed color indices, the study derives color excesses for 11,624,802 and 65,531 stars in the GALEX/near-UV and far-UV bands, and 336,633, 137,739, and 253,271 stars in the UVOT/\uvwa, \uvmb, and \uvwb\ bands, constructing corresponding ultraviolet extinction maps. Notably, the color excess data for the GALEX/near-UV band shows a tenfold increase from previous results, with the extinction map covering approximately two-thirds of the sky at a resolution of 0.4$^{\circ}$. The typical uncertainties in the ultraviolet color excesses are 0.21 mag, 0.30 mag, 0.19 mag, 0.24 mag, and 0.21 mag for \enb, \efb, \ewab, \embb, and \ewbb, respectively. By comparing the spatial distributions of \rv\ derived from ultraviolet and Gaia optical band measurements with those obtained from infrared and optical data in previous works, it is evident that the \rv\ distributions based on the ultraviolet data show noticeable differences, with some regions even exhibiting opposite trends. This suggests that a single-parameter \rv\ extinction law may not be sufficient to simultaneously characterize the extinction behavior across infrared, optical, and ultraviolet bands.</description>

      <title>The eventful life journey of galaxy clusters. I. Impact of DM halo and ICM properties on their full assembly histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Galaxy clusters assemble over gigayears in a very anisotropic environment, which causes a remarkable diversity in their mass assembly histories (MAH).
  Aims. In this work, we have aimed to understand how the present-day properties of the dark matter halo and the intracluster medium are related to the whole evolution of these structures.
  Methods. To this end, we analysed a $\Lambda$CDM hydrodynamical+$N$-Body simulation of a $(100 \, h^{-1} \mathrm{Mpc})^3$ volume, containing over 30 clusters and 300 groups, and looked at the individual and the stacked MAHs (determined from complete merger trees) in relation to properties of the DM haloes and the ICM at fixed cosmic time (indicators of assembly state).
  Results. The ensemble MAHs are well separated when stacked in bins of these indicators, yielding clear dependencies of evolutionary properties (such as formation redshift) on fix-time halo properties. Additionally, we find that different indicators are informative about distinct epochs of accretion. Finally, by summarising the complex MAH diversity with two parameters, we describe how different indicators bring complementary information in different directions of this biparametric space. Overall, halo spin and a combined indicator appear to be the ones encoding the most information about the MAH.
  Conclusions. The results shown here add up to the idea that the dynamical state of cosmic structures is a multifaceted concept, and warn that single indicators are incapable of capturing the whole complexity of the process. This work sheds light on the nature of this characterisation by untangling precisely when and how several indicators are informative about. In turn, this can provide clues to better constrain the MAH of observed structures.</description>

      <title>GrAviPaSt's Lens to the Past: Unveiling the Evolution of Filamentary Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the evolution of cosmic filaments across redshifts 1, 0.5, and 0 using the IllustrisTNG100-1 magneto-hydrodynamical simulation. To achieve this, we introduce GrAviPaSt, a simple and efficient filament identification method that leverages gravitational potential, an A*-like path-finding algorithm, and spanning trees. Applying this method to galaxy distributions at different redshifts allows us to analyze various filament properties, including their length, thickness, mass density contrast, and radial profile. Additionally, we investigate dynamic characteristics such as the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton, their weighted mean velocity, and velocity trends normalized by their positions within the filaments. Our findings reveal the evolution of cosmic filaments from redshift 1 to 0, highlighting key differences across classifications. In particular, we examine the mass density contrast radial profile of filaments connecting two galaxy groups and those linking two galaxy clusters, identifying distinct differences in profile shape between these categories. Furthermore, in the context of weighted mean velocity, we analyze cosmic filaments exhibiting either negative or positive weighted mean velocity, demonstrating their differing evolutionary trends in terms of the mean distance of filament galaxies from the skeleton.</description>

      <title>Early Shock-Cooling Observations and Progenitor Constraints of Type IIb SN 2024uwq</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present early multi-wavelength photometric and spectroscopic observations of the Type IIb supernova SN 2024uwq, capturing its shock-cooling emission phase and double-peaked light curve evolution. Early spectra reveal broad H-alpha (v ~ 15,500 km s$^{-1}$) and He I P-Cygni profiles of similar strengths. Over time the He I lines increase in strength while the H-alpha decreases, consistent with a hydrogen envelope ($M_{env}$ = 0.7 - 1.35 $M_\odot$ ) overlying helium-rich ejecta. Analytic modeling of early shock cooling emission and bolometric light analysis constrains the progenitor to a partially stripped star with radius R = 10 - 60 $R_\odot$, consistent with a blue/yellow supergiant with an initial ZAMS mass of 12 - 20 $M_\odot$ , likely stripped via binary interaction. SN 2024uwq occupies a transitional position between compact and extended Type IIb supernovae, highlighting the role of binary mass-transfer efficiency in shaping a continuum of stripped-envelope progenitors. Our results underscore the importance of both early UV/optical observations to characterize shock breakout signatures critical to map the diversity in evolutionary pathways of massive stars. Upcoming time domain surveys including Rubin Observatory's LSST and UV missions like ULTRASAT and UVEX will revolutionise our ability to systematically capture these early signatures, probing the full diversity of stripped progenitors and their explosive endpoints.</description>

      <title>Carbon from massive binary-stripped stars over cosmic time: effect of metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of carbon in the Universe remains uncertain. At solar metallicity, binary-stripped massive stars -- stars that lost their envelope through stable interaction with a companion -- have been suggested to produce twice as much carbon as their single-star counterparts. However, understanding the chemical evolution of galaxies over cosmic time requires examining stellar yields across a range of metallicities. Using the stellar evolution code MESA, we compute the carbon yields from wind mass loss and supernova explosions of single and binary-stripped stars across a wide range of initial masses ($10$-$46,M_\odot$), metallicities ($Z = 0.0021$, $0.0047$, $0.0142$), and initial orbital periods ($10$-$5000$ days). We find that metallicity is the dominant factor influencing the carbon yields of massive stars, outweighing the effects of binarity and detailed orbital parameters. Since the chemical yields from binary massive stars are highly sensitive to metallicity, we caution that yields predicted at solar metallicity should not be directly extrapolated to lower metallicities. At sub-solar metallicities, particularly below $1/7$ solar, weak stellar winds and inefficient binary stripping result in carbon yields from binary-stripped stars that closely resemble those of single stars. This suggests that binary-stripped massive stars are unlikely to explain the presence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars or the carbon enrichment observed in high-redshift galaxies as probed by the James Webb Space Telescope. Our findings only concern the stripped stars in massive binaries. The impact of other outcomes of binary star evolution, in particular stellar mergers and accretors, remains largely unexplored but will be necessary for a full understanding of the role of massive binaries in nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulation of minidisks in equal-mass massive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are on the cusp of detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from individual massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna and pulsar-timing arrays. These MBHBs may be surrounded by circumbinary disks and minidisks, the electromagnetic emission from which are essential for localizing the MBHBs on the sky. Here we present the first radiative magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) minidisk simulation that directly solves the radiative transfer equation on discretized grid rays. The simulation examines one of the minidisks in an equal-mass $2\times10^7\,M_\odot$ MBHB separated by 100 gravitational radii. Minidisks simulated with and without radiative effects resemble each other qualitatively but differ in several key aspects. The RMHD minidisk is denser and geometrically thinner than the magnetohydrodynamics minidisk. Furthermore, the RMHD minidisk, with a nonaxisymmetric photosphere and temperature distribution, produces an anisotropic illumination pattern. As a result, the observed radiative flux of two RMHD minidisks orbiting each other varies at half the binary orbital period, a feature independent of relativistic boosting and lensing effects. Such periodic light curves, if identified in upcoming optical transient surveys, could reveal the existence of MBHBs on the way to merger, particularly if they are in a constant phase relation with detected GWs.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGN distributions (SDSS DR16). We find evidence of an excess of low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as low-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results provide the first observational evidence for GW sources coming from either low-luminosity or low-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.</description>

      <title>Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL): Rubin-era photometric redshift stress-testing and at-scale production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Virtually all extragalactic use cases of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) require the use of galaxy redshift information, yet the vast majority of its sample of tens of billions of galaxies will lack high-fidelity spectroscopic measurements thereof, instead relying on photometric redshifts (photo-$z$) subject to systematic imprecision and inaccuracy best encapsulated by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs). We present the version 1 release of Redshift Assessment Infrastructure Layers (RAIL), an open source Python library for at-scale probabilistic photo-$z$ estimation, initiated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) with contributions from the LSST Interdisciplinary Network for Collaboration and Computing (LINCC) Frameworks team. RAIL's three subpackages provide modular tools for end-to-end stress-testing, including a forward modeling suite to generate realistically complex photometry, a unified API for estimating per-galaxy and ensemble redshift PDFs by an extensible set of algorithms, and built-in metrics of both photo-$z$ PDFs and point estimates. RAIL serves as a flexible toolkit enabling the derivation and optimization of photo-$z$ data products at scale for a variety of science goals and is not specific to LSST data. We thus describe to the extragalactic science community, including and beyond Rubin the design and functionality of the RAIL software library so that any researcher may have access to its wide array of photo-$z$ characterization and assessment tools.</description>

      <title>Very massive stars at low metallicity: evolution, synthetic spectroscopy, and impact on the integrated light of starbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectroscopic appearance of very massive stars and their effect on the integrated light of starbursts at low metallicity (Z). We adopt two frameworks for the mass loss rates of VMS: in one case we assume no Z dependence, in the other case we assume a linear scaling with Z. We compute evolutionary models for masses 150, 200, 250 and 300 Msun at Z=0.2, 0.1 and 0.01 Zsun. We compute the associated synthetic spectra at selected points along the evolutionary tracks. Finally we build population synthesis models including VMS. We find that the evolution of VMS critically depends on the assumptions regarding mass loss rates. In case of no Z dependence VMS remain hot for all their lifetime. Conversely when mass loss rates are reduced because of lower Z VMS follow a classical evolution towards the red part of the HR diagram. VMS display HeII 1640 emission in most phases of their evolution, except when they become too cool. This line is present in the integrated light of population synthesis models down to 0.1 Zsun whatever the star formation history, and is also sometimes seen at Z=0.01 Zsun. HeII 1640 is weaker in models that include a Z scaling of the mass loss rates. The optical spectra of starbursts, especially the Wolf-Rayet bumps, sometimes display VMS signatures when these stars are present. At low Z, adding VMS to population synthesis models produces more ionising photons down to 45 eV. At higher energy the ionising flux depends on age, Z, assumption regarding VMS mass loss rates, and on the very short phases at the end of VMS evolution. HeII ionising fluxes large enough to produce some amount of nebular HeII 4686 emission can be produced under specific circumstances. Our models are able to reproduce qualitatively and sometimes also quantitatively the UV spectra of star-forming regions. However we are not able to clearly identify which mass loss framework is favoured.</description>

      <title>Decoding the cosmological baryonic fluctuations using localized fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: The enigma of the missing baryons poses a prominent and unresolved problem in astronomy. Dispersion measures (DM) serve as a distinctive observable of fast radio bursts (FRBs). They quantify the electron column density along each line of sight and reveal the missing baryons that are described in the Macquart (DM-z) relation. The scatter of this relation is anticipated to be caused by the variation in the cosmic structure. This is not yet statistically confirmed, however. We present statistical evidence that the cosmological baryons fluctuate. Methods: We measured the foreground galaxy number densities around 14 and 13 localized FRBs with the WISE-PS1-STRM and WISE x SCOS photometric redshift galaxy catalog, respectively. The foreground galaxy number densities were determined through a comparison with measured random apertures with a radius of 1 Mpc. Results: We found a positive correlation between the excess of DM that is contributed by the medium outside galaxies (DM_cosmic) and the foreground galaxy number density. The correlation is strong and statistically significant, with median Pearson coefficients of 0.6 and 0.6 and median p-values of 0.012 and 0.032 for the galaxy catalogs, respectively, as calculated with Monte Carlo simulations. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the baryonic matter density outside galaxies exceeds its cosmic average along the line of sight to regions with an excess galaxy density, but there are fewer baryons along the line of sight to low-density regions. This is statistical evidence that the ionized baryons fluctuate cosmologically on a characteristic scale of $\lesssim$6 Mpc.</description>

      <title>Identifying Astrophysical Anomalies in 99.6 Million Cutouts from the Hubble Legacy Archive Using AnomalyMatch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical archives contain vast quantities of unexplored data that potentially harbour rare and scientifically valuable cosmological phenomena. We have systematically searched approximately 100 million image cutouts from the entire Hubble Legacy Archive using the recently developed AnomalyMatch method, which combines semi-supervised and active learning techniques for the efficient detection of astrophysical anomalies. This comprehensive search rapidly uncovered a multitude of astrophysical anomalies presented here that significantly expand the inventory of known rare objects. Among our discoveries are 138 new candidate gravitational lenses, 18 jellyfish galaxies, and 417 mergers or interacting galaxes. The efficiency and accuracy of our iterative detection strategy allows us to trawl the complete archive within just 2-3 days, highlighting its potential for large-scale astronomical surveys. We present a detailed overview of these newly identified objects, discuss their astrophysical significance, and demonstrate the considerable potential of AnomalyMatch to efficiently explore extensive astronomical datasets, e.g., upcoming Euclid data releases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine simulations with new analyses that overcome previous pitfalls to explicate how nonhelical mean-field dynamos grow and saturate in unstratified, magnetorotationally driven turbulence. Shear of the mean radial magnetic field amplifies the azimuthal component. Radial fields are regenerated by velocity fluctuations that induce shear of radial magnetic fluctuations, followed by Lorentz and Coriolis forces that source a negative off-diagonal component in the turbulent diffusivity tensor. We present a simple schematic to illustrate this dynamo growth. A different part of the Lorentz force forms a third-order correlator in the mean electromotive force that saturates the dynamo.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the kinematical properties of the CHEX-MATE (Cluster HEritage project with XMM-Newton - Mass Assembly and Thermodynamics at the Endpoint of structure formation) galaxy cluster sample. [...] We derive cluster mass profiles for 75 clusters using the \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} procedure, which recovers the gravitational potential and the anisotropy profiles from line-of-sight velocities and projected positions of galaxy members. The standard NFW and the Burkert models with flatter cores than NFW both adequately fit the kinematic data, with only marginal statistical preference for one model over the other. An estimation of the mass bias $(1-B_1) = M^{SZ}_{500}/M^{M}_{500} $ is performed from the comparison with SZ-X-ray-calibrated mass estimates, resulting in a value of $ 0.54 \pm 0.11$ when four evidently disturbed clusters are removed from the sample. We assess the dynamical state of the clusters by inferring the Anderson-Darling coefficient $(A^2)$ and the fraction of galaxies in substructures ($f_\text{sub}$). Except for a few cases, we found relatively low values for $A^2$, suggesting that CHEX-MATE clusters are not too far from relaxation. Moreover, no significant trends emerge among $A^2,\,f_\text{sub}$ and the difference between the log-masses estimated by \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt} and by SZ-X-ray.
  We study the concentration-mass relation for the sample; despite the large scatter, we observe signs of an increasing trend for large-mass clusters, in agreement with recent theoretical expectations.
  Finally, the analysis of radial anisotropy profiles of member galaxies - stacked in five bins of mass and redshift - reveals that orbits tend to be isotropic at the center and more radial towards the edge, as already found in previous studies. A slight trend of increasing radial orbits at $r_{200}$ is observed in clusters with larger velocity dispersion</description>

      <title>Investigating the Upper Scorpius OB association with HERMES. I. The spectroscopic sample and 6D kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present results from a large spectroscopic survey of the nearest young association to the Sun, Upper Scorpius, conducted using 2dF/HERMES on the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We use spectroscopic youth criteria such as Li-equivalent widths to identify &gt;1000 pre-main sequence (PMS) members across the region and measure radial velocities, combining these with Gaia EDR3 5-parameter astrometry to obtain 6D kinematic information. We separate confirmed PMS association members into distinct kinematic groups and measure expansion and rotation trends in each. We find strong evidence for asymmetric expansion in several groups and derive expansion timescales from the greatest rates of expansion in each group. We also trace the past motion of these groups using an epicycle approximation and estimate the time since their most compact configuration. These kinematic properties are compared to literature ages and the star formation history of Upper Scorpius is discussed. We find evidence that a scenario in which star formation in the subgroups of Upper Scorpius proceeded independently, either by self-instability or external feedback from Upper Centaurus-Lupus, is more likely than a recently proposed "cluster chain" scenario in which these subgroups have triggered each other.</description>

      <title>The Great Wave: Evidence of a large-scale vertical corrugation propagating outwards in the Galactic disc</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse the three-dimensional structure and kinematics of two samples of young stars in the Galactic disc, containing respectively young giants ($\sim$17$\, $000 stars out to heliocentric distances of $\sim$7 kpc) and classical Cepheids ($\sim$3400 stars out to heliocentric distances of $\sim$15 kpc). The vertical structure of the two samples exhibit a consistent shape of the Milky Way's warp, whose amplitude reaches $\sim$700 pc at a Galactocentric radius R $\sim$ 14 kpc. Moreover, both samples show evidence of a large-scale vertical corrugation on top of the warp with a vertical height of $\sim$150-200 pc, extending over a large portion of the Galactic disc between Galactocentric radii $R \sim$ 10-12 kpc in the third Galactic quadrant (galactic longitudes $180^\circ &lt; l &lt; 270^\circ$) and $\sim$12-14 kpc in the second Galactic quadrant ($90^\circ &lt; l &lt; 180^\circ$). Its total length is at least 10 kpc and can possibly reach $\sim$ 20 kpc with the Cepheid sample. The stars in the corrugation exhibit both radial and vertical systematic motions, with Galactocentric radial velocities towards the outer disc of about 10-15 km/s. In the vertical motions, once the warp signature is subtracted, the residuals show a large-scale feature of systematically positive vertical velocities, which is shifted to slightly larger Galactocentric radii with respect to the spatial vertical corrugation (with a phase difference of roughly $\pi/2$), indicating an oscillatory behaviour. A comparison of the observed shift with a simple toy model suggests that the corrugation can be interpreted as a wave propagating towards the outer disc. The wave mapped in this work is located at larger heliocentric distances compared to the Radcliffe wave, a $\sim$2.7 kpc filament of dense gas clouds close to the Sun, and exhibits a larger coverage of the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>The physical origin of positive metallicity radial gradients in high-redshift galaxies: insights from the FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations, we investigate the temporal evolution of gas-phase metallicity radial gradients of Milky Way-mass progenitors in the redshift range of $0.4&lt;z&lt;3$. We pay special attention to the occurrence of positive (i.e. inverted) metallicity gradients -- where metallicity increases with galactocentric radius. This trend, contrary to the more commonly observed negative radial gradients, has been frequently seen in recent spatially resolved grism observations. The rate of occurrence of positive gradients in FIRE-2 is about $\sim7\%$ for $0.4&lt;z&lt;3$ and $\sim13\%$ at higher redshifts ($1.5&lt;z&lt;3$), broadly consistent with observations. Moreover, we investigate the correlations among galaxy metallicity gradient, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and degree of rotational support. Metallicity gradients show a strong correlation with both sSFR and the rotational-to-dispersion velocity ratio ($v_c/\sigma$), implying that starbursts and kinematic morphology of galaxies play significant roles in shaping these gradients. The FIRE-2 simulations indicate that galaxies with high sSFR (${\rm log(sSFR~[yr^{-1}])}\gtrsim-9.2$) and weak rotational support ($v_c/\sigma\lesssim 1$) are more likely -- by $\sim$15\% -- to develop positive metallicity gradients. This trend is attributed to galaxy-scale gas flows driven by stellar feedback, which effectively redistribute metals within the interstellar medium. Our results support the important role of stellar feedback in governing the chemo-structural evolution and disk formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies at the cosmic noon epoch.</description>

      <title>The unabridged satellite luminosity function of Milky Way-like galaxies in $\Lambda$CDM: the contribution of "orphan" satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the abundance, radial distribution, and orbits of luminous satellites in simulations of MW-mass dark halos in the LCDM cosmology. We follow the evolution of a halo from the Aquarius project and the formation of its maximal satellite population with the GALFORM semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. This population consists of all subhalos able to form stars through efficient gas cooling before or after reionization, which effectively selects systems with peak circular velocities exceeding a critical threshold of roughly 15-20 km/s. The total number of luminous satellites is sensitive to the assumed redshift of reionization, but the shape of the GALFORM satellite stellar mass function is robust, peaking at the stellar mass (10^3Msun) of a halo just above the critical threshold. Subhalos are prone to artificial disruption in the tidal field of the main halo, with the number of surviving satellites increasing with resolution. Even in the highest resolution simulation (Aq-L1, with particle mass of 10^3Msun), a substantial number of satellite subhalos are disrupted, leaving behind ``orphan'' galaxies tracked in GALFORM by the subhalo's most-bound particle before disruption. When orphans are included (and the effects of tidal stripping on stars neglected), all simulations that adequately resolve the critical threshold yield a converged maximal satellite stellar mass function. Most orphans were accreted early, are found in the central regions of the main halo, and make up roughly half of all satellites in Aq-L1. Taking orphans into account there is no need to populate subhalos below the critical threshold with satellites to fit the radial distribution of MW satellites, as has been argued in recent work. Our model predicts that orphans dominate the ultra-faint population and that many more satellites with small apocentric radii should be detected in upcoming deep wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>The outflow impacts on the size of the narrow-line region among type-2 AGNs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the study of the gas kinematics in narrow-line regions (NLRs) of 2,009 type-2 AGNs at $z&lt;0.34$. We construct the [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission-line images using publicly available broadband images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The [O III] emission area of the samples, measured down to $1.4\times10^{-15}$ erg/s/cm$^2$/arcsec$^2$, ranges from 3.7 kpc$^2$ up to 224 kpc$^2$. With our broadband technique, we found the strong correlation between [O III] area and AGN luminosity inferred from the [O III] luminosity and the mid-infrared luminosity at the rest-frame $15\mu$m. The isophotal threshold used to determine the [O III] area affects the correlation strength in that the brighter isophote yields the stronger correlation between the [O III] area and AGN luminosity. The presence of gas outflow is examined by the ratio of the [O III] velocity dispersion to the stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm [O\,III]}/\sigma_\star &gt; 1.4$) using the SDSS spectra. At the given luminosity, the objects with and without outflows exhibit the same extension of the [O III] emission. Their correlation between the [O III] area and luminosity is almost identical. It is suggested that the size of NLRs is not affected by outflow mechanisms but rather by photoionization from the central AGNS.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Aromatic and Aliphatic Universe at Redshifts $z\sim$0.2--0.5 with JWST NIRCam/WFSS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing deep NIRCam/WFSS data from JWST's FRESCO program, we spectroscopically survey the 3.3 $\mu m$ aromatic and 3.4 $\mu m$ aliphatic C--H stretching emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules in galaxies at redshifts $z$$\sim$0.2--0.5. Unlike pre-JWST studies, largely limited to infrared (IR)-bright galaxies ($L_{\rm IR}\gtrsim10^{11}~L_\odot$) at $z\lesssim0.1$, we probe 200 galaxies down to $L_{\rm IR}$$\sim$$10^{8.5}$--$10^{10}~L_\odot$ well beyond the local Universe. The 3.3 $\mu m$ emission is detected at $\geq$3-$\sigma$ in 88 out of 187 galaxies, correlating tightly with galaxy IR luminosity and star formation rate (SFR) and confirming the 3.3 $\mu m$ PAH as a viable SFR tracer. Despite a large scatter, the 3.3 $\mu m$-to-IR luminosity ratio ($L_{3.3}/L_{\rm IR}$) exhibits a strong metallicity dependence with a drop of $L_{3.3}/L_{\rm IR}$ by a factor of $\gtrsim10$ at 12+log(O/H)$\sim$8.4--8.5 towards lower metallicities. The 3.4 $\mu m$ emission is detected in 37 out of 159 galaxies, with the 3.4 $\mu m$-to-3.3 $\mu m$ luminosity ratio ($L_{3.4}/L_{3.3}$) spanning from $\sim$0.05 to $\sim$0.58 (median $\sim$0.19), corresponding to PAH aliphatic fractions of $\sim$0.78%--8.3% (median $\sim$2.9%) in terms of fractional carbon atoms in aliphatic units. While $L_{3.4}/L_{3.3}$ does not depend significantly on redshift, stellar mass, metallicity, or galaxy morphology, it does decrease with various SFR tracers, suggesting that ultraviolet photons in active star-forming regions may strip aliphatic sidegroups from PAH molecules. Our study showcases the unique power of JWST's NIRCam/WFSS to systematically map PAH aromatic and aliphatic content in statistically significant, less-biased galaxy samples, providing critical insights into PAH chemistry and its connection to galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>Dot to dot: high-$z$ little red dots in $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star}$ diagrams with galaxy-morphology-specific scaling relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high redshift 'little red dots' (LRDs) detected with the James Webb Space Telescope are considered to be the cores of emerging galaxies that host active galactic nuclei (AGN). For the first time, we compare LRDs with local compact stellar systems and an array of galaxy-morphology-dependent stellar mass-black hole mass scaling relations in the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\star}$ diagrams. When considering the 2023-2024 masses for LRDs, they are not equivalent to nuclear star clusters (NSCs), with the latter having higher $M_{\rm bh}/M_{\star}$ ratios. However, the least massive LRDs exhibit similar $M_{\rm bh}$ and $M_{\rm \star,gal}$ values as ultracompact dwarf (UCD) galaxies, believed to be the cores of stripped/threshed galaxies. We show that the LRDs span the $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\rm \star,gal}$ diagram from UCD galaxies to primaeval lenticular galaxies. In contrast, local spiral galaxies and the subset of major-merger-built early-type galaxies define $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\star,gal}$ relations that are offset to higher stellar masses. Based on the emerging 2025 masses for LRDs, they may yet have similarities with NSCs, UCD galaxies, and green peas. Irrespective of this developing situation, we additionally observe that low-redshift galaxies with AGN align with the quasi-quadratic or steeper black hole scaling relations defined by local disc galaxies with directly measured black hole masses. This highlights the benefits of considering a galaxy's morphology - which reflects its accretion and merger history - to understand the coevolution of galaxies and their black holes. Future studies of spatially-resolved galaxies with secure masses at intermediate-to-high redshift hold the promise of detecting the emergence and evolution of the galaxy-morphology-dependent $M_{\rm bh}$-$M_{\star}$ relations.</description>

      <title>Toward A General Theory of Grain Alignment and Disruption by Radiative Torques and Magnetic Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory for general astrophysical environments described by a dimensionless parameter $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$ with $U$ local radiation strength, $n_{1}=n_{\rm H}/(10{\rm cm}^{-3})$ the hydrogen density, and $T_{2}=T_{\rm gas}/100{\rm K}$ the gas temperature. We first derive the critical magnetic relaxation $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ required to produce high-J attractors for different RAT models and local conditions and find that $\delta_{\rm mag,cri}$ must be larger for stronger radiation fields. We then numerically study the grain alignment and rotational disruption by the MRAT mechanism taking into account gas collisions and magnetic fluctuations. We find that, for the collision-dominated (CD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})\leq 1$), collisional and magnetic excitations can slowly transport large grains from low-J rotation to high-J attractors, leading to the perfect {\it slow alignment} within $\sim 10-100$ damping times due to MRATs. However, for the radiation-dominated (RD) regime ($U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;1$), only a fraction of grains can be fast aligned at high-J attractors by MRATs, and the majority of grains are trapped at low-J rotation due to strong radiative torques, a new effect we term {\it radiative torque (RAT) trapping}. For extreme radiation fields of $U/(n_{1}T_{2})&gt;10^{4}$, the efficiency of magnetic relaxation on grain alignment is suppressed, and grains only have fast alignment and disruption purely determined by RATs. We quantified the fraction of grains with fast alignment at high-J attractors, $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$, for different RAT models, magnetic relaxation, and $U/(n_{1}T_{2})$, and found that the maximum $f_{\rm high-J}^{\rm fast}$ can reach $45\%$ by MRATs and $22\%$ by RATs.</description>

      <title>First confirmation of anisotropic halo bias from statistically anisotropic matter distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12004v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We confirm for the first time the existence of distinctive halo bias associated with the quadrupolar type of statistical anisotropy (SA) of the linear matter density field using cosmological $N$-body simulations. We find that the coefficient of the SA-induced bias for cluster-sized halos takes negative values and exhibits a decreasing trend with increasing halo mass. This results in the quadrupole halo power spectra in a statistically anisotropic universe being less amplified compared to the monopole spectra. The anisotropic feature in halo bias that we found presents a promising new tool for testing the hypothesis of a statistically anisotropic universe, with significant implications for the precise verification of anisotropic inflation scenarios and vector dark matter and dark energy models.</description>

      <title>Properties of high-redshift Type II supernovae discovered by the JADES transient survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we estimate the explosion and progenitor properties of six Type II supernovae (SNe) at 0.675 &lt;= z &lt;= 3.61 discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) transient survey by modeling their light curves. Two Type II SNe are found to have high explosion energies of 3e51 erg, while the other four Type II SNe are estimated to have typical explosion energies found in the local Universe [(0.5-2)e51 erg]. The fraction of Type II SNe with high explosion energies might be higher at high redshifts because of, e.g., lower metallicity, but it is still difficult to draw a firm conclusion because of the small sample size and potential observational biases. We found it difficult to constrain the progenitor masses for Type II SNe in our sample because of the sparse light-curve data. We found two Type II SN light curves can be better reproduced by introducing confined, dense circumstellar matter. Thus, the confined, dense circumstellar matter frequently observed in nearby Type II SNe is likely to exist in Type II SNe at high redshifts as well. Two Type II SNe are estimated to have high host galaxy extinctions, showing the ability of JWST to discover dust-obscured SNe at high redshifts. More high-redshift Type II SNe are required to investigate the differences in the properties of Type II SNe near and far, but here we show the first glimpse into the high-redshift population of Type II SNe.</description>

Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulation of a sub-Eddington circumbinary disk (CBD) around an equal-mass massive black hole binary (MBHB) with a total mass of $2\,\times\,10^7\,M_{\odot}$ on a circular orbit, separated by 100$\,GM_{\rm tot}/c^2$. The inclusion of radiation leads to a denser, thinner, and more filamentary disk compared to non-radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation, primarily due to reduced pressure support and an altered equation of state. The RMHD disk also features $\sim 3$ times lower accretion rate ($\approx 0.15\,\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), weaker accretion streams and a less pronounced overdensity (a.k.a., ``lump") at the inner edge. Our analysis of the light curves and thermal spectra reveals that the variability induced by the binary-CBD interaction is distinguishable in the optical/UV band, where CBD shines at about $1\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. These findings underscore the crucial role of radiation on the structure and observational properties of CBDs around massive black hole binaries and have implications for detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LISA gravitational wave precursors, and for heavier binaries that are Pulsar Timing Array sources.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Electromagnetic Signatures from OGLE-2011-BLG-0462</title>

Abstract: Stellar-mass isolated black holes (IsoBHs) wandering in interstellar medium (ISM) are expected to be abundant in our Galaxy. Recently, an IsoBH, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462, was unambiguously discovered using astrometric microlensing. We examine prospects for detecting electromagnetic signatures from an accretion flow surrounding the IsoBH. The accretion rate onto the IsoBH should be highly sub-Eddington, which leads to formation of a hot accretion flow. In this paper, we evaluate the detectability of electromagnetic signals from the hot accretion flows in two accretion states: magnetically arrested disk (MAD) and classical radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAFs). For the MAD scenario, we find that the optical, infrared, and X-ray signals can be detectable by the current best facilities, such as HST, JWST, and Chandra, if the IsoBH is in a warm neutral medium. In contrast, for the classical RIAF scenario, the optical and X-ray emissions are weaker than MAD scenario, leading to unobservable signals for a typical parameter set. Future follow-up observations of OGLE-2011-BLG-0462 will provide a good test for theories of accretion processes.</description>

      <title>SN 2021hpr: A Normal Type Ia Supernova Showing Excess Emission in the Early Rising Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present extensive optical observations of a nearby Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), SN 2021hpr, located in the spiral galaxy NGC 3147 at a distance of $\sim$ 45 Mpc. Our observations cover a phase within $\sim 1-2$ days to $\sim 290$ days after the explosion. SN 2021hpr is found to be a spectroscopically normal SN Ia, with an absolute B-band peak magnitude of $M_{max}(B) \approx -19.16 \pm 0.14$ mag and a post-peak decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B)= 1.00 \pm 0.01 $ mag. Early-time light curves showed a $\sim 7.0 \%$ excess emission compared to a homogeneously expanding fireball model, likely due to SN ejecta interacting with a companion or immediate circumstellar matter. The optical spectra of SN 2021hpr are overall similar to those of normal SNe Ia, but characterized by prominent detached high-velocity features (HVFs) of Si {\sc ii} and Ca {\sc ii} in the early phase. After examining a small sample of well-observed normal SNe Ia, we find that the HVFs are likely common for the subgroup with early-excess emission. The association of early bump feature with the HVFs could be attributed to density or abundance enhancement at the outer layer of the exploding star, likely as a result of interactions with companion$/$CSM or experiencing more complete burning. Nevertheless, the redshifted Fe {\sc ii} and Ni {\sc ii} lines in the nebular-phase spectra of SN 2021hpr, contrary to the blueshift trend seen in other SNe Ia showing early bump features, indicate its peculiarity in the explosion that remains to be understood.</description>
