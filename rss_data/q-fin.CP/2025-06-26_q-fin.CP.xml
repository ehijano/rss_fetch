      <title>Quantum Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent for Sector Rotation in the Taiwan Stock Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV, QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely, the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum reinforcement learning in real-world finance.</description>

      <title>The Euler Scheme for Fractional Stochastic Delay Differential Equations with Additive Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Euler-Maruyama scheme for a class ofstochastic delay differential equations driven by a fractional Brownian motion with index $H\in(0,1)$. We establish the consistency of the scheme and study the rate of convergence of the normalized error process. This is done by checking that the generic rate of convergence of the error process with stepsize $\Delta_{n}$ is $\Delta_{n}^{\min\{H+\frac{1}{2},3H,1\}}$. It turned out that such a rate is suboptimal when the delay is smooth and $H&gt;1/2$. In this context, and in contrast to the non-delayed framework, we show that a convergence of order $H+1/2$ is achievable.</description>
