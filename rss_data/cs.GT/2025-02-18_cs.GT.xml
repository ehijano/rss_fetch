      <title>A new lower bound for multi-color discrepancy with applications to fair division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical problem in combinatorics seeks colorings of low discrepancy. More concretely, the goal is to color the elements of a set system so that the number of appearances of any color among the elements in each set is as balanced as possible. We present a new lower bound for multi-color discrepancy, showing that there is a set system with $n$ subsets over a set of elements in which any $k$-coloring of the elements has discrepancy at least $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{\ln{k}}}\right)$. This result improves the previously best-known lower bound of $\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{k}}\right)$ of Doerr and Srivastav [2003] and may have several applications. Here, we explore its implications on the feasibility of fair division concepts for instances with $n$ agents having valuations for a set of indivisible items. The first such concept is known as consensus $1/k$-division up to $d$ items (\cd$d$) and aims to allocate the items into $k$ bundles so that no matter which bundle each agent is assigned to, the allocation is envy-free up to $d$ items. The above lower bound implies that \cd$d$ can be infeasible for $d\in \Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{\ln{k}}}\right)$. We furthermore extend our proof technique to show that there exist instances of the problem of allocating indivisible items to $k$ groups of $n$ agents in total so that envy-freeness and proportionality up to $d$ items are infeasible for $d\in \Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{k\ln{k}}}\right)$ and $d\in \Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{n}{k^3\ln{k}}}\right)$, respectively. The lower bounds for fair division improve the currently best-known ones by Manurangsi and Suksompong [2022].</description>

      <title>Deploying Fair and Efficient Course Allocation Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universities regularly face the challenging task of assigning classes to thousands of students while considering their preferences, along with course schedules and capacities. Ensuring the effectiveness and fairness of course allocation mechanisms is crucial to guaranteeing student satisfaction and optimizing resource utilization. We approach this problem from an economic perspective, using formal justice criteria to evaluate different algorithmic frameworks. To evaluate our frameworks, we conduct a large scale survey of university students at University of Massachusetts Amherst, collecting over 1,000 student preferences. This is, to our knowledge, the largest publicly available dataset of student preferences. We develop software for generating synthetic student preferences over courses, and implement four allocation algorithms: the serial dictatorship algorithm used by University of Massachusetts Amherst; Round Robin; an Integer Linear Program; and the Yankee Swap algorithm. We propose improvements to the Yankee Swap framework to handle scenarios with item multiplicities. Through experimentation with the Fall 2024 Computer Science course schedule at University of Massachusetts Amherst, we evaluate each algorithm's performance relative to standard justice criteria, providing insights into fair course allocation in large university settings.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation and Pricing for Blockchain-enabled Metaverse: A Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the next-generation Internet paradigm, the metaverse can provide users with immersive physical-virtual experiences without spatial limitations. However, there are various concerns to be overcome, such as resource allocation, resource pricing, and transaction security issues. To address the above challenges, we integrate blockchain technology into the metaverse to manage and automate complex interactions effectively and securely utilizing the advantages of blockchain. With the objective of promoting the Quality of Experience (QoE), Metaverse Service Users (MSUs) purchase rendering and bandwidth resources from the Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) to access low-latency and high-quality immersive services. The MSP maximizes the profit by controlling the unit prices of resources. In this paper, we model the interaction between the MSP and MSUs as a Stackelberg game, in which the MSP acts as the leader and MSUs are followers. The existence of Stackelberg equilibrium is analyzed and proved mathematically. Besides, we propose an efficient greedy-and-search-based resource allocation and pricing algorithm (GSRAP) to solve the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) point. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our designs. The experiment results show that our algorithm outperforms the baseline scheme in terms of improving the MSP's profit and convergence speed.</description>

      <title>On the Power of Randomization for Obviously Strategy-Proof Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of designing randomized obviously strategy-proof (OSP) mechanisms in several canonical auction settings. Obvious strategy-proofness, introduced by Li [American Economic Review, 2017], strengthens the well-known concept of dominant-strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC). Loosely speaking, it ensures that even agents who struggle with contingent reasoning can identify that their dominant strategy is optimal.
  Thus, one would hope to design OSP mechanisms with good approximation guarantees. Unfortunately, Ron [SODA,2024] has shown that deterministic OSP mechanisms fail to achieve an approximation better than $\min\{m,n\}$ where $m$ is the number of items and $n$ is the number of bidders, even for the simple settings of additive and unit-demand bidders. We circumvent these impossibilities by showing that randomized mechanisms that are obviously strategy-proof in the universal sense obtain a constant factor approximation for these classes. We show that this phenomenon occurs also for the setting of a multi-unit auction with single-minded bidders. Thus, our results provide a more positive outlook on the design of OSP mechanisms and exhibit a stark separation between the power of randomized and deterministic OSP mechanisms.
  To complement the picture, we provide impossibilities for randomized OSP mechanisms in each setting. While the deterministic VCG mechanism is well known to output an optimal allocation in dominant strategies, we show that even randomized OSP mechanisms cannot obtain more than $87.5\%$ of the optimal welfare. This further demonstrates that OSP mechanisms are significantly weaker than dominant-strategy mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Tractable General Equilibrium</title>

Abstract: We study Walrasian economies (or general equilibrium models) and their solution concept, the Walrasian equilibrium. A key challenge in this domain is identifying price-adjustment processes that converge to equilibrium. One such process, t\^atonnement, is an auction-like algorithm first proposed in 1874 by L\'eon Walras. While continuous-time variants of t\^atonnement are known to converge to equilibrium in economies satisfying the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences (WARP), the process fails to converge in a pathological Walrasian economy known as the Scarf economy. To address these issues, we analyze Walrasian economies using variational inequalities (VIs), an optimization framework. We introduce the class of mirror extragradient algorithms, which, under suitable Lipschitz-continuity-like assumptions, converge to a solution of any VI satisfying the Minty condition in polynomial time. We show that the set of Walrasian equilibria of any balanced economy-which includes among others Arrow-Debreu economies-corresponds to the solution set of an associated VI that satisfies the Minty condition but is generally discontinuous. Applying the mirror extragradient algorithm to this VI we obtain a class of t\^atonnement-like processes, which we call the mirror extrat\^atonnement process. While our VI formulation is generally discontinuous, it is Lipschitz-continuous in variationally stable Walrasian economies with bounded elasticity-including those satisfying WARP and the Scarf economy-thus establishing the polynomial-time convergence of mirror extrat\^atonnement in these economies. We validate our approach through experiments on large Arrow-Debreu economies with Cobb-Douglas, Leontief, and CES consumers, as well as the Scarf economy, demonstrating fast convergence in all cases without failure.</description>

      <title>Deviation Ratings: A General, Clone-Invariant Rating Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world multi-agent or multi-task evaluation scenarios can be naturally modelled as normal-form games due to inherent strategic (adversarial, cooperative, and mixed motive) interactions. These strategic interactions may be agentic (e.g. players trying to win), fundamental (e.g. cost vs quality), or complementary (e.g. niche finding and specialization). In such a formulation, it is the strategies (actions, policies, agents, models, tasks, prompts, etc.) that are rated. However, the rating problem is complicated by redundancy and complexity of N-player strategic interactions. Repeated or similar strategies can distort ratings for those that counter or complement them. Previous work proposed ``clone invariant'' ratings to handle such redundancies, but this was limited to two-player zero-sum (i.e. strictly competitive) interactions. This work introduces the first N-player general-sum clone invariant rating, called deviation ratings, based on coarse correlated equilibria. The rating is explored on several domains including LLMs evaluation.</description>

      <title>Single-dimensional Contract Design: Efficient Algorithms and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Bayesian contract design problem in which a principal interacts with an unknown agent. We consider the single-parameter uncertainty model introduced by Alon et al. [2021], in which the agent's type is described by a single parameter, i.e., the cost per unit-of-effort. Despite its simplicity, several works have shown that single-dimensional contract design is not necessarily easier than its multi-dimensional counterpart in many respects. Perhaps the most surprising result is the reduction by Castiglioni et al . [2025] from multi- to single-dimensional contract design. However, their reduction preserves only multiplicative approximations, leaving open the question of whether additive approximations are easier to obtain than multiplicative ones. In this paper, we answer this question--to some extent--positively. In particular, we provide an additive PTAS for these problems while also ruling out the existence of an additive FPTAS. This, in turn, implies that no reduction from multi- to single-dimensional contracts can preserve additive approximations. Moreover, we show that single-dimensional contract design is fundamentally easier than its multi-dimensional counterpart from a learning perspective. Under mild assumptions, we show that optimal contracts can be learned efficiently, providing results on both regret and sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Streamlining Equal Shares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Participatory budgeting (PB) is a form of citizen participation that allows citizens to decide how public funds are spent. Through an election, citizens express their preferences on various projects (spending proposals). A voting mechanism then determines which projects will be approved. The Method of Equal Shares (MES) is the state of the art algorithm for a proportional, voting based approach to participatory budgeting and has been implemented in cities across Poland and Switzerland. A significant drawback of MES is that it is not \textit{exhaustive} meaning that it often leaves a portion of the budget unspent that could be used to fund additional projects. To address this, in practice the algorithm is combined with a completion heuristic - most often the ``add-one" heuristic which artificially increases the budget until a heuristically chosen threshold. This heuristic is computationally inefficient and will become computationally impractical if PB is employed on a larger scale. We propose the more efficient \textsc{add-opt} heuristic for Exact Equal Shares (EES), a variation of MES that is known to retain many of its desirable properties. We solve the problem of identifying the next budget for which the outcome for EES changes in $O(mn)$ time for cardinal utilities and $O(m^2n)$ time for uniform utilities, where $m$ is the number of projects and $n$ is the number of voters. Our solution to this problem inspires the efficient \textsc{add-opt} heuristic which bypasses the need to search through each intermediary budget. We perform comprehensive experiments on real-word PB instances from Pabulib and show that completed EES outcomes usually match the proportion of budget spent by completed MES outcomes. Furthermore, the \textsc{add-opt} heuristic matches the proportion of budget spend by add-one for EES.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impacts of tradable credit schemes through agent-based simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tradable credit schemes (TCS) have been attracting interest from the transportation research community as an appealing alternative to congestion pricing, due to the advantages of revenue neutrality and equity. Nonetheless, existing research has largely employed network and market equilibrium approaches with simplistic characterizations of transportation demand, supply, credit market operations, and market behavior. Agent- and activity-based simulation affords a natural means to comprehensively assess TCS by more realistically modeling demand, supply, and individual market interactions. We propose an integrated simulation framework for modeling a TCS, and implements it within the state-of-the-art open-source urban simulation platform SimMobility, including: (a) a flexible TCS design that considers multiple trips and explicitly accounts for individual trading behaviors; (b) a simulation framework that captures the complex interactions between a TCS regulator, the traveler, and the TCS market itself, with the flexibility to test future TCS designs and relevant mobility models; and (c) a set of simulation experiments on a large mesoscopic multimodal network combined with a Bayesian Optimization approach for TCS optimal design. The experiment results indicate network and market performance to stabilize over the day-to-day process, showing the alignment of our agent-based simulation with the known theoretical properties of TCS. We confirm the efficiency of TCS in reducing congestion under the adopted market behavioral assumptions and open the door for simulating different individual behaviors. We measure how TCS impacts differently the local network, heterogeneous users, the different travel behaviors, and how testing different TCS designs can avoid negative market trading behaviors.</description>

      <title>Transaction Fee Market Design for Parallel Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the low throughput of blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, scalability -- the ability to process an increasing number of transactions -- has become a central focus of blockchain research. One promising approach is the parallelization of transaction execution across multiple threads. However, achieving efficient parallelization requires a redesign of the incentive structure within the fee market. Currently, the fee market does not differentiate between transactions that access multiple high-demand resources versus a single low-demand one, as long as they require the same computational effort. Addressing this discrepancy is crucial for enabling more effective parallel execution.
  In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between the current fee market and the need for parallel execution by exploring alternative fee market designs. To this end, we propose a framework consisting of two key components: a Gas Computation Mechanism (GCM), which quantifies the load a transaction places on the network in terms of parallelization and computation, measured in units of gas, and a Transaction Fee Mechanism (TFM), which assigns a price to each unit of gas. We also introduce a set of desirable properties for a GCM, present multiple candidate mechanisms, and evaluate them against the properties. One promising candidate emerges: the weighted area GCM. Notably, this mechanism can be seamlessly composed with existing TFMs, such as EIP-1559. While our exploration primarily focuses on the execution component of the fee, which directly relates to parallel execution, we also outline how it could be integrated with fees associated with other factors, such as storage and data bandwidth, by drawing a parallel to a multi-dimensional fee market.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent coordination via communication partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coordinating the behaviour of self-interested agents in the presence of multiple Nash equilibria is a major research challenge for multi-agent systems. Pre-game communication between all the players can aid coordination in cases where the Pareto-optimal payoff is unique, but can lead to deadlocks when there are multiple payoffs on the Pareto frontier. We consider a communication partition, where only players within the same coalition can communicate with each other, and they can establish an agreement (a coordinated joint-action) if it is envy-free, credible, and Pareto-optimal. We show that under a natural assumption about symmetry, certain communication partitions can induce social optimal outcomes in singleton congestion games. This game is a reasonable model for a decentralised, anonymous system where players are required to choose from a range of identical resources, and incur costs that are increasing and convex in the total number of players sharing the same resource. The communication partition can be seen as a mechanism for inducing efficient outcomes in this context.</description>

      <title>The Role of Prescreening in Auctions with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an auction environment with i.i.d. privately known valuations. Equipped with a noisy predictor, the auction designer receives a coarse signal about each player's valuation, where the signal is fully informative with a given probability. Based on the posterior expectation of the valuations, the designer selects the top players to admit -- a procedure we call \emph{prescreening}. We show that this prescreening game is equivalent to a standard auction without prescreening but with \emph{correlated} types. Besides, when the signals are always fully informative, these correlated types are \emph{affiliated}. We characterize conditions for the existence of a symmetric and strictly monotone equilibrium strategy in both all-pay and first-price auctions. Our results reveal that prescreening can significantly improve the designer's revenue in all-pay auctions; in fact, when the prediction accuracy is one, admitting only two players is optimal. In contrast, prescreening is usually unnecessary in first-price auctions.</description>

      <title>The Relationship between No-Regret Learning and Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing algorithms for online conformal prediction -- guaranteeing marginal coverage in adversarial settings -- are variants of online gradient descent (OGD), but their analyses of worst-case coverage do not follow from the regret guarantee of OGD. What is the relationship between no-regret learning and online conformal prediction? We observe that although standard regret guarantees imply marginal coverage in i.i.d. settings, this connection fails as soon as we either move to adversarial environments or ask for group conditional coverage. On the other hand, we show a tight connection between threshold calibrated coverage and swap-regret in adversarial settings, which extends to group-conditional (multi-valid) coverage. We also show that algorithms in the follow the perturbed leader family of no regret learning algorithms (which includes online gradient descent) can be used to give group-conditional coverage guarantees in adversarial settings for arbitrary grouping functions. Via this connection we analyze and conduct experiments using a multi-group generalization of the ACI algorithm of Gibbs &amp; Candes [2021] (arXiv:2106.00170).</description>

Abstract: In ranking competitions, document authors compete for the highest rankings by modifying their content in response to past rankings. Previous studies focused on human participants, primarily students, in controlled settings. The rise of generative AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), introduces a new paradigm: using LLMs as document authors. This approach addresses scalability constraints in human-based competitions and reflects the growing role of LLM-generated content on the web-a prime example of ranking competition. We introduce a highly configurable ranking competition simulator that leverages LLMs as document authors. It includes analytical tools to examine the resulting datasets. We demonstrate its capabilities by generating multiple datasets and conducting an extensive analysis. Our code and datasets are publicly available for research.</description>

      <title>Game-Of-Goals: Using adversarial games to achieve strategic resilience</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our objective in this paper is to develop a machinery that makes a given organizational strategic plan resilient to the actions of competitor agents (adverse environmental actions). We assume that we are given a goal tree representing strategic goals (can also be seen business requirements for a software systems) with the assumption that competitor agents are behaving in a maximally adversarial fashion(opposing actions against our sub goals or goals in general). We use game tree search methods (such as minimax) to select an optimal execution strategy(at a given point in time), such that it can maximize our chances of achieving our (high level) strategic goals. Our machinery helps us determine which path to follow(strategy selection) to achieve the best end outcome. This is done by comparing alternative execution strategies available to us via an evaluation function. Our evaluation function is based on the idea that we want to make our execution plans defensible(future-proof) by selecting execution strategies that make us least vulnerable to adversarial actions by the competitor agents. i.e we want to select an execution strategy such that its leaves minimum room(or options) for the adversary to cause impediment/damage to our business goals/plans.</description>

      <title>No-regret incentive-compatible online learning under exact truthfulness with non-myopic experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an online forecasting setting in which, over $T$ rounds, $N$ strategic experts each report a forecast to a mechanism, the mechanism selects one forecast, and then the outcome is revealed. In any given round, each expert has a belief about the outcome, but the expert wishes to select its report so as to maximize the total number of times it is selected. The goal of the mechanism is to obtain low belief regret: the difference between its cumulative loss (based on its selected forecasts) and the cumulative loss of the best expert in hindsight (as measured by the experts' beliefs). We consider exactly truthful mechanisms for non-myopic experts, meaning that truthfully reporting its belief strictly maximizes the expert's subjective probability of being selected in any future round. Even in the full-information setting, it is an open problem to obtain the first no-regret exactly truthful mechanism in this setting. We develop the first no-regret mechanism for this setting via an online extension of the Independent-Event Lotteries Forecasting Competition Mechanism (I-ELF). By viewing this online I-ELF as a novel instance of Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL) with noise based on random walks with loss-dependent perturbations, we obtain $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T N})$ regret. Our results are fueled by new tail bounds for Poisson binomial random variables that we develop. We extend our results to the bandit setting, where we give an exactly truthful mechanism obtaining $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3} N^{1/3})$ regret; this is the first no-regret result even among approximately truthful mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Intersectional Fairness in Reinforcement Learning with Large State and Constraint Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional reinforcement learning (RL), the learner aims to solve a single objective optimization problem: find the policy that maximizes expected reward. However, in many real-world settings, it is important to optimize over multiple objectives simultaneously. For example, when we are interested in fairness, states might have feature annotations corresponding to multiple (intersecting) demographic groups to whom reward accrues, and our goal might be to maximize the reward of the group receiving the minimal reward. In this work, we consider a multi-objective optimization problem in which each objective is defined by a state-based reweighting of a single scalar reward function. This generalizes the problem of maximizing the reward of the minimum reward group. We provide oracle-efficient algorithms to solve these multi-objective RL problems even when the number of objectives is exponentially large-for tabular MDPs, as well as for large MDPs when the group functions have additional structure. Finally, we experimentally validate our theoretical results and demonstrate applications on a preferential attachment graph MDP.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Approximation for Road Pricing on Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a graph $G = (V, E)$ and some commuters, each specified by a tuple $(u, v, b)$ consisting of two nodes in the graph $u, v \in V$ and a non-negative real number $b$, specifying their budget. The goal is to find a pricing function $p$ of the edges of $G$ that maximizes the revenue generated by the commuters. Here, each commuter $(u, v, b)$ either pays the lowest-cost of a $u$-$v$ path under the pricing $p$, or 0, if this exceeds their budget $b$. We study this problem for the case where $G$ is a bounded-width grid graph and give a polynomial-time approximation algorithm with approximation ratio $O(\log |E|)$. Our approach combines existing ideas with new insights. Most notably, we employ a rather seldom-encountered technique that we coin under the name 'assume-implement dynamic programming.' This technique involves dynamic programming where some information about the future decisions of the dynamic program is guessed in advance and 'assumed' to hold, and then subsequent decisions are forced to 'implement' the guess. This enables computing the cost of the current transition by using information that would normally only be available in the future.</description>

      <title>Computing and Learning Mean Field Equilibria with Scalar Interactions: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field equilibrium (MFE) has emerged as a computationally tractable solution concept for large dynamic games. However, computing MFE remains challenging due to nonlinearities and the absence of contraction properties, limiting its reliability for counterfactual analysis and comparative statics. This paper focuses on MFE in dynamic models where agents interact through a scalar function of the population distribution, referred to as the \textit{scalar interaction function}. Such models naturally arise in a wide range of applications in operations and economics, including quality ladder models, inventory competition, online marketplaces, and heterogeneous-agent macroeconomic models. The main contribution of this paper is to introduce iterative algorithms that leverage the scalar interaction structure and are guaranteed to converge to the MFE under mild assumptions. Unlike existing approaches, our algorithms do not rely on monotonicity or contraction properties, significantly broadening their applicability. Furthermore, we provide a model-free algorithm that learns the MFE by employing simulation and reinforcement learning techniques such as Q-learning and policy gradient methods without requiring prior knowledge of payoff or transition functions. We establish finite-time performance bounds for this algorithm under technical Lipschitz continuity assumptions. We apply our algorithms to classic models of dynamic competition, such as capacity competition, and to competitive models motivated by online marketplaces, including ridesharing, dynamic reputation, and inventory competition, as well as to social learning models. Using our algorithms, we derive reliable comparative statics results that illustrate how key market parameters influence equilibrium outcomes in these stylized models, providing insights that could inform the design of competitive systems in these contexts.</description>

      <title>Multi-Player Resource-Sharing Games with Fair Reward Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05300v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers an online multi-player resource-sharing game with bandit feedback. Multiple players choose from a finite collection of resources in a time slotted system. In each time slot, each resource brings a random reward that is equally divided among the players who choose it. The reward vector is independent and identically distributed over the time slots. The statistics of the reward vector are unknown to the players. During each time slot, for each resource chosen by the first player, they receive as feedback the reward of the resource and the number of players who chose it, after the choice is made. We develop a novel Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm that learns the mean rewards using the feedback and maximizes the worst-case time-average expected reward of the first player. The algorithm gets within $\mathcal{O}(\log(T)/\sqrt{T})$ of optimality within $T$ time slots. The simulations depict fast convergence of the learnt policy in comparison to the worst-case optimal policy.</description>

      <title>Automated Design of Affine Maximizer Mechanisms in Dynamic Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamic mechanism design is a challenging extension to ordinary mechanism design in which the mechanism designer must make a sequence of decisions over time in the face of possibly untruthful reports of participating agents. Optimizing dynamic mechanisms for welfare is relatively well understood. However, there has been less work on optimizing for other goals (e.g. revenue), and without restrictive assumptions on valuations, it is remarkably challenging to characterize good mechanisms. Instead, we turn to automated mechanism design to find mechanisms with good performance in specific problem instances. In fact, the situation is similar even in static mechanism design. However, in the static case, optimization/machine learning-based automated mechanism design techniques have been successful in finding high-revenue mechanisms in cases beyond the reach of analytical results. We extend the class of affine maximizer mechanisms to MDPs where agents may untruthfully report their rewards. This extension results in a challenging bilevel optimization problem in which the upper problem involves choosing optimal mechanism parameters, and the lower problem involves solving the resulting MDP. Our approach can find truthful dynamic mechanisms that achieve strong performance on goals other than welfare, and can be applied to essentially any problem setting-without restrictions on valuations-for which RL can learn optimal policies.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Bayesian Utility Maximization: Tight Approximations to Welfare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the study of multidimensional Bayesian utility maximization, focusing on the unit-demand setting where values are i.i.d. across both items and buyers. The seminal result of Hartline and Roughgarden '08 studies simple, information-robust mechanisms that maximize utility for $n$ i.i.d. agents and $m$ identical items via an approximation to social welfare as an upper bound, and they prove this gap between optimal utility and social welfare is $\Theta(1+\log{n/m})$ in this setting. We extend these results to the multidimensional setting. To do so, we develop simple, prior-independent, approximately-optimal mechanisms, targeting the simplest benchmark of optimal welfare. We give a $(1- 1/e)$-approximation when there are more items than buyers, and a $\Theta(\log{n/m})$-approximation when there are more buyers than items, and we prove that this bound is tight in both $n$ and $m$ by reducing the i.i.d. unit-demand setting to the identical items setting. Finally, we include an extensive discussion section on why Bayesian utility maximization is a promising research direction. In particular, we characterize complexities in this setting that defy our intuition from the welfare and revenue literature, and motivate why coming up with a better benchmark than welfare is a hard problem itself.</description>

Abstract: We consider a truthful facility location problem in which there is a set of agents with private locations on the line of real numbers, and the goal is to place a number of facilities at different locations chosen from the set of those reported by the agents. Given a feasible solution, each agent suffers an individual cost that is either its total distance to all facilities (sum-variant) or its distance to the farthest facility (max-variant). For both variants, we show tight bounds on the approximation ratio of strategyproof mechanisms in terms of the social cost, the total individual cost of the agents.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of T\^atonnement for Linear Fisher Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: T\^atonnement is a simple, intuitive market process where prices are iteratively adjusted based on the difference between demand and supply. Many variants under different market assumptions have been studied and shown to converge to a market equilibrium, in some cases at a fast rate. However, the classical case of linear Fisher markets have long eluded the analyses, and it remains unclear whether t\^atonnement converges in this case. We show that, for a sufficiently small step size, the prices given by the t\^atonnement process are guaranteed to converge to equilibrium prices, up to a small approximation radius that depends on the stepsize. To achieve this, we consider the dual Eisenberg-Gale convex program in the price space, view t\^atonnement as subgradient descent on this convex program, and utilize last-iterate convergence results for subgradient descent under error bound conditions. In doing so, we show that the convex program satisfies a particular error bound condition, the quadratic growth condition, and that the price sequence generated by t\^atonnement is bounded above and away from zero. We also show that a similar convergence result holds for t\^atonnement in quasi-linear Fisher markets. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate that the theoretical linear convergence aligns with empirical observations.</description>

      <title>Truthful and Almost Envy-Free Mechanism of Allocating Indivisible Goods: the Power of Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of fairly and truthfully allocating $m$ indivisible items to $n$ agents with additive preferences. Specifically, we consider truthful mechanisms outputting allocations that satisfy EF$^{+u}_{-v}$, where, in an EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ allocation, for any pair of agents $i$ and $j$, agent $i$ will not envy agent $j$ if $u$ items were added to $i$'s bundle and $v$ items were removed from $j$'s bundle. Previous work easily indicates that, when restricted to deterministic mechanisms, truthfulness will lead to a poor guarantee of fairness: even with two agents, for any $u$ and $v$, EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ cannot be guaranteed by truthful mechanisms when the number of items is large enough. In this work, we focus on randomized mechanisms, where we consider ex-ante truthfulness and ex-post fairness. For two agents, we present a truthful mechanism that achieves EF$^{+0}_{-1}$ (i.e., the well-studied fairness notion EF$1$). For three agents, we present a truthful mechanism that achieves EF$^{+1}_{-1}$. For $n$ agents in general, we show that there exist truthful mechanisms that achieve EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ for some $u$ and $v$ that depend only on $n$ (not $m$).
  We further consider fair and truthful mechanisms that also satisfy the standard efficiency guarantee: Pareto-optimality. We provide a mechanism that simultaneously achieves truthfulness, EF$1$, and Pareto-optimality for bi-valued utilities (where agents' valuation on each item is either $p$ or $q$ for some $p&gt;q\geq0$). For tri-valued utilities (where agents' valuations on each item belong to $\{p,q,r\}$ for some $p&gt;q&gt;r\geq0$) and any $u,v$, we show that truthfulness is incompatible with EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ and Pareto-optimality even for two agents.</description>

      <title>Weighted Envy Freeness With Limited Subsidies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore solutions for fairly allocating indivisible items among agents assigned weights representing their entitlements. Our fairness goal is weighted-envy-freeness (WEF), where each agent deems their allocated portion relative to their entitlement at least as favorable as any other's relative to their own. In many cases, achieving WEF necessitates monetary transfers, which can be modeled as third-party subsidies. The goal is to attain WEF with bounded subsidies.
  Previous work in the unweighted setting of subsidies relied on basic characterizations of EF that fail in the weighted settings. This makes our new setting challenging and theoretically intriguing. We present polynomial-time algorithms that compute WEF-able allocations with an upper bound on the subsidy per agent in three distinct additive valuation scenarios: (1) general, (2) identical, and (3) binary. When all weights are equal, our bounds reduce to the bounds derived in the literature for the unweighted setting.</description>

      <title>Corrupted Learning Dynamics in Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning in games refers to scenarios where multiple players interact in a shared environment, each aiming to minimize their regret. An equilibrium can be computed at a fast rate of $O(1/T)$ when all players follow the optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader (OFTRL). However, this acceleration is limited to the honest regime, in which all players adhere to a prescribed algorithm -- a situation that may not be realistic in practice. To address this issue, we present corrupted learning dynamics that adaptively find an equilibrium at a rate that depends on the extent to which each player deviates from the strategy suggested by the prescribed algorithm. First, in two-player zero-sum corrupted games, we provide learning dynamics for which the external regret of $x$-player (and similarly for $y$-player) is roughly bounded by $O(\log (m_x m_y) + \sqrt{\hat{C}_y} + \hat{C}_x)$, where $m_x$ and $m_y$ denote the number of actions of $x$- and $y$-players, respectively, and $\hat{C}_x$ and $\hat{C}_y$ represent their cumulative deviations. We then extend our approach to multi-player general-sum corrupted games, providing learning dynamics for which the swap regret of player $i$ is bounded by $O(\log T + \sqrt{\sum_{k} \hat{C}_k \log T} + \hat{C}_i)$ ignoring dependence on the number of players and actions, where $\hat{C}_i$ is the cumulative deviation of player $i$ from the prescribed algorithm. Our learning dynamics are agnostic to the levels of corruption. A key technical contribution is a new analysis that ensures the stability of a Markov chain under a new adaptive learning rate, thereby allowing us to achieve the desired bound in the corrupted regime while matching the best existing bound in the honest regime. Notably, our framework can be extended to address not only corruption in strategies but also corruption in the observed expected utilities, and we provide several matching lower bounds.</description>

Abstract: Policy Space Response Oracles (PSRO) interleaves empirical game-theoretic analysis with deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to solve games too complex for traditional analytic methods. Tree-exploiting PSRO (TE-PSRO) is a variant of this approach that iteratively builds a coarsened empirical game model in extensive form using data obtained from querying a simulator that represents a detailed description of the game. We make two main methodological advances to TE-PSRO that enhance its applicability to complex games of imperfect information. First, we introduce a scalable representation for the empirical game tree where edges correspond to implicit policies learned through DRL. These policies cover conditions in the underlying game abstracted in the game model, supporting sustainable growth of the tree over epochs. Second, we leverage extensive form in the empirical model by employing refined Nash equilibria to direct strategy exploration. To enable this, we give a modular and scalable algorithm based on generalized backward induction for computing a subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) in an imperfect-information game. We experimentally evaluate our approach on a suite of games including an alternating-offer bargaining game with outside offers; our results demonstrate that TE-PSRO converges toward equilibrium faster when new strategies are generated based on SPE rather than Nash equilibrium, and with reasonable time/memory requirements for the growing empirical model.</description>

      <title>Whoever Said Money Won't Solve All Your Problems? Weighted Envy-free Allocation with Subsidy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore solutions for fairly allocating indivisible items among agents assigned weights representing their entitlements. Our fairness goal is weighted-envy-freeness (WEF), where each agent deems their allocated portion relative to their entitlement at least as favorable as any others relative to their own. Often, achieving WEF necessitates monetary transfers, which can be modeled as third-party subsidies. The goal is to attain WEF with bounded subsidies.
  Previous work relied on characterizations of unweighted envy-freeness (EF), that fail in the weighted setting. This makes our new setting challenging. We present polynomial-time algorithms that compute WEF allocations with a guaranteed upper bound on total subsidy for monotone valuations and various subclasses thereof.
  We also present an efficient algorithm to compute a fair allocation of items and money, when the budget is not enough to make the allocation WEF. This algorithm is new even for the unweighted setting.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference for Fisher Market Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Statistical inference under market equilibrium effects has attracted increasing attention recently. In this paper we focus on the specific case of linear Fisher markets. They have been widely use in fair resource allocation of food/blood donations and budget management in large-scale Internet ad auctions. In resource allocation, it is crucial to quantify the variability of the resource received by the agents (such as blood banks and food banks) in addition to fairness and efficiency properties of the systems. For ad auction markets, it is important to establish statistical properties of the platform's revenues in addition to their expected values. To this end, we propose a statistical framework based on the concept of infinite-dimensional Fisher markets. In our framework, we observe a market formed by a finite number of items sampled from an underlying distribution (the "observed market") and aim to infer several important equilibrium quantities of the underlying long-run market. These equilibrium quantities include individual utilities, social welfare, and pacing multipliers. Through the lens of sample average approximation (SSA), we derive a collection of statistical results and show that the observed market provides useful statistical information of the long-run market. In other words, the equilibrium quantities of the observed market converge to the true ones of the long-run market with strong statistical guarantees. These include consistency, finite sample bounds, asymptotics, and confidence. As an extension, we discuss revenue inference in quasilinear Fisher markets.</description>

      <title>Proof-of-randomness protocol for blockchain consensus: a case of Macau algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A proof-of-randomness (PoR) protocol is presented as a fair and low energy-cost consensus mechanism for blockchains. Each network node of a blockchain may use a true random number generator (TRNG) and hash algorism to fulfil the PoR protocol. In this paper, we give the consensus mechanism of the PoR protocol, and classify it into a new kind of randomized algorithms called Macau. The PoR protocol could generate a blockchain without any competition of computing power or stake of cryptocurrency. Besides, we give some advantages of integrating quantum random number generator (QRNG) chips into hardware wallets, and also discuss the way to cooperate with quantum key distribution (QKD) technology.</description>

      <title>The Case of FBA as a DEX Processing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01177v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the welfare loss of continuous and discrete order matching models in blockchain-based decentralized exchanges (DEX) that utilize order books to record outstanding orders. Continuous processing matches each incoming transaction against the current order book. The discrete processing model, i.e., frequent batch auction (FBA), executes transactions discretely in batches with a uniform price double auction: Orders are first matched according to price, then the exact transaction order if competing orders specify the same price.
  We find that FBA imposes less welfare loss and provides better liquidity than continuous processing in typical scenarios, e.g., when few parties are privately informed about asset valuations. Even otherwise, it achieves better social welfare and liquidity provision in the following settings: when price takers and public information reflecting asset value changes arrive sufficiently frequently compared to private information, when the priority fees (for faster transaction inclusion into blockchains) are small, or when the market is more balanced on both buy and sell sides. Our empirical analysis on the BTC-USD and ETH-USD transactions on a DEX named dYdX indicates that FBA can reduce transaction costs by $21\%-37\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a 2-player game played on an infinite grid, initially empty, where each player in turn chooses a vertex and colours it. The first player aims to create some pattern from a target set, while the second player aims to prevent it. We study the problem of deciding which player wins, and prove that it is undecidable. We also consider a variant where the turn order is not alternating but given by a balanced word, and we characterise the decidable and undecidable cases.</description>

      <title>Testing popularity in linear time via maximum matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01880v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Popularity is an approach in mechanism design to find fair structures in a graph, based on the votes of the nodes. Popular matchings are the relaxation of stable matchings: given a graph G=(V,E) with strict preferences on the neighbors of the nodes, a matching M is popular if there is no other matching M' such that the number of nodes preferring M' is more than those preferring M. This paper considers the popularity testing problem, when the task is to decide whether a given matching is popular or not. Previous algorithms applied reductions to maximum weight matchings. We give a new algorithm for testing popularity by reducing the problem to maximum matching testing, thus attaining a linear running time O(|E|).
  Linear programming-based characterization of popularity is often applied for proving the popularity of a certain matching. As a consequence of our algorithm we derive a more structured dual witness than previous ones. Based on this result we give a combinatorial characterization of fractional popular matchings, which are a special class of popular matchings.</description>

      <title>Performative Prediction on Games and Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents often have individual goals which depend on a group's actions. If agents trust a forecast of collective action and adapt strategically, such prediction can influence outcomes non-trivially, resulting in a form of performative prediction. This effect is ubiquitous in scenarios ranging from pandemic predictions to election polls, but existing work has ignored interdependencies among predicted agents. As a first step in this direction, we study a collective risk dilemma where agents dynamically decide whether to trust predictions based on past accuracy. As predictions shape collective outcomes, social welfare arises naturally as a metric of concern. We explore the resulting interplay between accuracy and welfare, and demonstrate that searching for stable accurate predictions can minimize social welfare with high probability in our setting. By assuming knowledge of a Bayesian agent behavior model, we then show how to achieve better trade-offs and use them for mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Generative Semantic Communication via Textual Prompts: Latency Performance Tradeoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an edge-device collaborative Generative Semantic Communications (Gen SemCom) framework leveraging pre-trained Multi-modal/Vision Language Models (M/VLMs) for ultra-low-rate semantic communication via textual prompts. The proposed framework optimizes the use of M/VLMs on the wireless edge/device to generate high-fidelity textual prompts through visual captioning/question answering, which are then transmitted over a wireless channel for SemCom. Specifically, we develop a multi-user Gen SemCom framework using pre-trained M/VLMs, and formulate a joint optimization problem of prompt generation offloading, communication and computation resource allocation to minimize the latency and maximize the resulting semantic quality. Due to the nonconvex nature of the problem with highly coupled discrete and continuous variables, we decompose it as a two-level problem and propose a low-complexity swap/leaving/joining (SLJ)-based matching algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over the conventional semanticunaware/non-collaborative offloading benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Misere Connect Four is Solved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connect Four is a two-player game where each player attempts to be the first to create a sequence of four of their pieces, arranged horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, by dropping pieces into the columns of a grid of width seven and height six, in alternating turns. Misere Connect Four is played by the same rules, but with the opposite objective: do not connect four. This paper announces that Misere Connect Four is solved: perfect play by both sides leads to a second-player win. More generally, this paper also announces that Misere Connect $k$ played on a $w \times h$ board is also solved, but the outcome depends on the game's parameters $k$, $w$, and $h$, and may be a first-player win, a second-player win, or a draw. These results are constructive, meaning that we provide explicit strategies, thus enabling readers to impress their friends and foes alike with provably optimal play in the misere form of a table-top game for children.</description>
