      <title>Sub-diffraction terahertz backpropagation compressive imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz single-pixel imaging (TSPI) has garnered significant attention due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However, the relatively long wavelength of THz waves limits sub-diffraction-scale imaging resolution. Although TSPI technique can achieve sub-wavelength resolution, it requires harsh experimental conditions and time-consuming processes. Here, we propose a sub-diffraction THz backpropagation compressive imaging technique. We illuminate the object with monochromatic continuous-wave THz radiation. The transmitted THz wave is modulated by prearranged patterns generated on the back surface of a 500-{\mu}m-thick silicon wafer, realized through photoexcited carriers using a 532-nm laser. The modulated THz wave is then recorded by a single-element detector. An untrained neural network is employed to iteratively reconstruct the object image with an ultralow compression ratio of 1.5625% under a physical model constraint, thus reducing the long sampling times. To further suppress the diffraction-field effects, embedded with the angular spectrum propagation (ASP) theory to model the diffraction of THz waves during propagation, the network retrieves near-field information from the object, enabling sub-diffraction imaging with a spatial resolution of ~{\lambda}0/7 ({\lambda}0 = 833.3 {\mu}m at 0.36 THz) and eliminating the need for ultrathin photomodulators. This approach provides an efficient solution for advancing THz microscopic imaging and addressing other inverse imaging challenges.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of UAV-Based RGB and Multispectral Vegetation Indices for Precision Agriculture in Palm Tree Cultivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision farming relies on accurate vegetation monitoring to enhance crop productivity and promote sustainable agricultural practices. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of UAV-based imaging for vegetation health assessment in a palm tree cultivation region in Dubai. By comparing multispectral and RGB image data, we demonstrate that RGBbased vegetation indices offer performance comparable to more expensive multispectral indices, providing a cost-effective alternative for large-scale agricultural monitoring. Using UAVs equipped with multispectral sensors, indices such as NDVI and SAVI were computed to categorize vegetation into healthy, moderate, and stressed conditions. Simultaneously, RGB-based indices like VARI and MGRVI delivered similar results in vegetation classification and stress detection. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of integrating RGB imagery into precision farming, reducing operational costs while maintaining accuracy in plant health monitoring. This research underscores the potential of UAVbased RGB imaging as a powerful tool for precision agriculture, enabling broader adoption of data-driven decision-making in crop management. By leveraging the strengths of both multispectral and RGB imaging, this work advances the state of UAV applications in agriculture, paving the way for more efficient and scalable farming solutions.</description>

      <title>Pose Estimation for Intra-cardiac Echocardiography Catheter via AI-Based Anatomical Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intra-cardiac Echocardiography (ICE) plays a crucial role in Electrophysiology (EP) and Structural Heart Disease (SHD) interventions by providing high-resolution, real-time imaging of cardiac structures. However, existing navigation methods rely on electromagnetic (EM) tracking, which is susceptible to interference and position drift, or require manual adjustments based on operator expertise. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel anatomy-aware pose estimation system that determines the ICE catheter position and orientation solely from ICE images, eliminating the need for external tracking sensors. Our approach leverages a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based deep learning model, which captures spatial relationships between ICE images and anatomical structures. The model is trained on a clinically acquired dataset of 851 subjects, including ICE images paired with position and orientation labels normalized to the left atrium (LA) mesh. ICE images are patchified into 16x16 embeddings and processed through a transformer network, where a [CLS] token independently predicts position and orientation via separate linear layers. The model is optimized using a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, balancing positional and orientational accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate an average positional error of 9.48 mm and orientation errors of (16.13 deg, 8.98 deg, 10.47 deg) across x, y, and z axes, confirming the model accuracy. Qualitative assessments further validate alignment between predicted and target views within 3D cardiac meshes. This AI-driven system enhances procedural efficiency, reduces operator workload, and enables real-time ICE catheter localization for tracking-free procedures. The proposed method can function independently or complement existing mapping systems like CARTO, offering a transformative approach to ICE-guided interventions.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Diffusion Models in Medical Imaging: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion model has recently emerged as a potent approach in computer vision, demonstrating remarkable performances in the field of generative artificial intelligence. Capable of producing high-quality synthetic images, diffusion models have been successfully applied across a range of applications. However, a significant challenge remains with the high computational cost associated with training and generating these models. This study focuses on the efficiency and inference time of diffusion-based generative models, highlighting their applications in both natural and medical imaging. We present the most recent advances in diffusion models by categorizing them into three key models: the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), and the Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM). These models play a crucial role in medical imaging, where producing fast, reliable, and high-quality medical images is essential for accurate analysis of abnormalities and disease diagnosis. We first investigate the general framework of DDPM, LDM, and WDM and discuss the computational complexity gap filled by these models in natural and medical imaging. We then discuss the current limitations of these models as well as the opportunities and future research directions in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>Highly Undersampled MRI Reconstruction via a Single Posterior Sampling of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incoherent k-space under-sampling and deep learning-based reconstruction methods have shown great success in accelerating MRI. However, the performance of most previous methods will degrade dramatically under high acceleration factors, e.g., 8$\times$ or higher. Recently, denoising diffusion models (DM) have demonstrated promising results in solving this issue; however, one major drawback of the DM methods is the long inference time due to a dramatic number of iterative reverse posterior sampling steps. In this work, a Single Step Diffusion Model-based reconstruction framework, namely SSDM-MRI, is proposed for restoring MRI images from highly undersampled k-space. The proposed method achieves one-step reconstruction by first training a conditional DM and then iteratively distilling this model. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on both publicly available fastMRI images and an in-house multi-echo GRE (QSM) subject. Overall, the results showed that SSDM-MRI outperformed other methods in terms of numerical metrics (PSNR and SSIM), qualitative error maps, image fine details, and latent susceptibility information hidden in MRI phase images. In addition, the reconstruction time for a 320*320 brain slice of SSDM-MRI is only 0.45 second, which is only comparable to that of a simple U-net, making it a highly effective solution for MRI reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection Method for Power Conversion Circuits Using Thermal Image and Convolutional Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fault detection method for power conversion circuits using thermal images and a convolutional autoencoder is presented. The autoencoder is trained on thermal images captured from a commercial power module at randomly varied load currents and augmented image2 generated through image processing techniques such as resizing, rotation, perspective transformation, and bright and contrast adjustment. Since the autoencoder is trained to output images identical to input only for normal samples, it reconstructs images similar to normal ones even when the input images containing faults. A small heater is attached to the circuit board to simulate a fault on a power module, and then thermal images were captured from different angles and positions, as well as various load currents to test the trained autoencoder model. The areas under the curve (AUC) were obtained to evaluate the proposed method. The results show the autoencoder model can detect anomalies with 100% accuracy under given conditions. The influence of hyperparameters such as the number of convolutional layers and image augmentation conditions on anomaly detection accuracy was also investigated.</description>

      <title>Skeleton-Guided Diffusion Model for Accurate Foot X-ray Synthesis in Hallux Valgus Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in providing anatomically accurate images for diagnosis and treatment. Hallux valgus, which affects approximately 19% of the global population, requires frequent weight-bearing X-rays for assessment, placing additional strain on both patients and healthcare providers. Existing X-ray models often struggle to balance image fidelity, skeletal consistency, and physical constraints, particularly in diffusion-based methods that lack skeletal guidance. We propose the Skeletal-Constrained Conditional Diffusion Model (SCCDM) and introduce KCC, a foot evaluation method utilizing skeletal landmarks. SCCDM incorporates multi-scale feature extraction and attention mechanisms, improving the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) by 5.72% (0.794) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) by 18.34% (21.40 dB). When combined with KCC, the model achieves an average score of 0.85, demonstrating strong clinical applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/midisec/SCCDM.</description>

      <title>An integrated language-vision foundation model for conversational diagnostics and triaging in primary eye care</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current deep learning models are mostly task specific and lack a user-friendly interface to operate. We present Meta-EyeFM, a multi-function foundation model that integrates a large language model (LLM) with vision foundation models (VFMs) for ocular disease assessment. Meta-EyeFM leverages a routing mechanism to enable accurate task-specific analysis based on text queries. Using Low Rank Adaptation, we fine-tuned our VFMs to detect ocular and systemic diseases, differentiate ocular disease severity, and identify common ocular signs. The model achieved 100% accuracy in routing fundus images to appropriate VFMs, which achieved $\ge$ 82.2% accuracy in disease detection, $\ge$ 89% in severity differentiation, $\ge$ 76% in sign identification. Meta-EyeFM was 11% to 43% more accurate than Gemini-1.5-flash and ChatGPT-4o LMMs in detecting various eye diseases and comparable to an ophthalmologist. This system offers enhanced usability and diagnostic performance, making it a valuable decision support tool for primary eye care or an online LLM for fundus evaluation.</description>

      <title>GNCAF: A GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework for Tertiary Lymphoid Structures Semantic Segmentation in WSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) are organized clusters of immune cells, whose maturity and area can be quantified in whole slide image (WSI) for various prognostic tasks. Existing methods for assessing these characteristics typically rely on cell proxy tasks and require additional post-processing steps. In this work, We focus on a novel task-TLS Semantic Segmentation (TLS-SS)-which segments both the regions and maturation stages of TLS in WSI in an end-to-end manner. Due to the extensive scale of WSI and patch-based segmentation strategies, TLS-SS necessitates integrating from neighboring patches to guide target patch (target) segmentation. Previous techniques often employ on multi-resolution approaches, constraining the capacity to leverage the broader neighboring context while tend to preserve coarse-grained information. To address this, we propose a GNN-based Neighboring Context Aggregation Framework (GNCAF), which progressively aggregates multi-hop neighboring context from the target and employs a self-attention mechanism to guide the segmentation of the target. GNCAF can be integrated with various segmentation models to enhance their ability to perceive contextual information outside of the patch. We build two TLS-SS datasets, called TCGA-COAD and INHOUSE-PAAD, and make the former (comprising 225 WSIs and 5041 TLSs) publicly available. Experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of GNCAF, achieving a maximum of 22.08% and 26.57% improvement in mF1 and mIoU, respectively. Additionally, we also validate the task scalability of GNCAF on segmentation of lymph node metastases.</description>

      <title>SAR-GTR: Attributed Scattering Information Guided SAR Graph Transformer Recognition Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing electromagnetic scattering information for SAR data interpretation is currently a prominent research focus in the SAR interpretation domain. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can effectively integrate domain-specific physical knowledge and human prior knowledge, thereby alleviating challenges such as limited sample availability and poor generalization in SAR interpretation. In this study, we thoroughly investigate the electromagnetic inverse scattering information of single-channel SAR and re-examine the limitations of applying GNNs to SAR interpretation. We propose the SAR Graph Transformer Recognition Algorithm (SAR-GTR). SAR-GTR carefully considers the attributes and characteristics of different electromagnetic scattering parameters by distinguishing the mapping methods for discrete and continuous parameters, thereby avoiding information confusion and loss. Furthermore, the GTR combines GNNs with the Transformer mechanism and introduces an edge information enhancement channel to facilitate interactive learning of node and edge features, enabling the capture of robust and global structural characteristics of targets. Additionally, the GTR constructs a hierarchical topology-aware system through global node encoding and edge position encoding, fully exploiting the hierarchical structural information of targets. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithm is validated using the ATRNet-STAR large-scale vehicle dataset.</description>

      <title>Towards Digital Twin in Flood Forecasting with Data Assimilation Satellite Earth Observations -- A Proof-of-Concept in the Alzette Catchment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floods pose significant risks to human lives, infrastructure, and the environment. Timely and accurate flood forecasting plays a pivotal role in mitigating these risks. This study presents a proof-of-concept for a Digital Twin framework aimed at improving flood forecasting in the Alzette Catchment, Luxembourg. The approach integrates satellite-based Earth observations, specifically Sentinel-1 flood probability maps, into a particle filter-based data assimilation (DA) process to enhance flood predictions. By combining the GloFAS global flood monitoring and GloFAS streamflow forecasts products with DA using a high-resolution LISFLOOD-FP hydrodynamic model, the Digital Twin can provide daily flood forecasts for up to 30 days with reduced prediction uncertainties. Using the 2021 flood event as a case study, we evaluate the performance of the Digital Twin in assimilating EO data to refine hydraulic model simulations and issue accurate forecasts. While some limitations, such as uncertainties in GloFAS discharge forecasts, remain large, the approach successfully improves forecast accuracy compared to open-loop simulations. Future developments will focus on constructing more adaptively the hazard catalog, and reducing inherent uncertainties related to GloFAS streamflow forecasts and Sentinel-1 flood maps, to further enhance predictive capability. The framework demonstrates potential for advancing real-time flood forecasting and strengthening flood resilience.</description>

      <title>A portable diagnosis model for Keratoconus using a smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Keratoconus (KC) is a progressive corneal disorder characterized by localized thinning and protrusion, leading to visual distortion. While Placido disc-based topography remains a standard in clinical diagnostics, its dependence on specialized equipment limits accessibility. In this paper, we propose a portable, smartphone-based diagnostic framework that captures corneal reflections of a Placido disc displayed on a phone screen and applies a two-stage detection pipeline, then validate on 3D-printed emulated eyeball models that simulate normal, moderate, and severe KC stages based on anterior chamber depth (ACD). The first step of the two-stage detection pipeline is classifying different stages of KC with features including height and width of extracted reflections using weighted support vector machine (WSVM). It achieves a maximum accuracy of 92.93%, and maintains over 90% accuracy across multiple smartphone models, including the Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 16 Pro. For the second step, we visualize the KC-affected protrusion regions on the corneas with color maps based on inter-disc distance, that provides an intuitive representation of disease severity and localization. Moreover, we validate the ability of the extracted features to differentiate between KC stages with ANOVA and Omega Squared, with significant p-values (e.g., $p &lt; 10^{-6}$) and large effect sizes ($\\omega^2$ up to 0.8398) among classes.</description>

      <title>VIViT: Variable-Input Vision Transformer Framework for 3D MR Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-supervised pretrain techniques have been widely used to improve the downstream tasks' performance. However, real-world magnetic resonance (MR) studies usually consist of different sets of contrasts due to different acquisition protocols, which poses challenges for the current deep learning methods on large-scale pretrain and different downstream tasks with different input requirements, since these methods typically require a fixed set of input modalities or, contrasts. To address this challenge, we propose variable-input ViT (VIViT), a transformer-based framework designed for self-supervised pretraining and segmentation finetuning for variable contrasts in each study. With this ability, our approach can maximize the data availability in pretrain, and can transfer the learned knowledge from pretrain to downstream tasks despite variations in input requirements. We validate our method on brain infarct and brain tumor segmentation, where our method outperforms current CNN and ViT-based models with a mean Dice score of 0.624 and 0.883 respectively. These results highlight the efficacy of our design for better adaptability and performance on tasks with real-world heterogeneous MR data.</description>

      <title>TSLFormer: A Lightweight Transformer Model for Turkish Sign Language Recognition Using Skeletal Landmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered, string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important semantic gesture information.
  Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words unfold.
  Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired individuals.</description>

      <title>Ultra Lowrate Image Compression with Semantic Residual Coding and Compression-aware Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing multimodal large model-based image compression frameworks often rely on a fragmented integration of semantic retrieval, latent compression, and generative models, resulting in suboptimal performance in both reconstruction fidelity and coding efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose a residual-guided ultra lowrate image compression named ResULIC, which incorporates residual signals into both semantic retrieval and the diffusion-based generation process. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Residual Coding (SRC) to capture the semantic disparity between the original image and its compressed latent representation. A perceptual fidelity optimizer is further applied for superior reconstruction quality. Additionally, we present the Compression-aware Diffusion Model (CDM), which establishes an optimal alignment between bitrates and diffusion time steps, improving compression-reconstruction synergy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ResULIC, achieving superior objective and subjective performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with - 80.7%, -66.3% BD-rate saving in terms of LPIPS and FID.

      <title>ReSurgSAM2: Referring Segment Anything in Surgical Video via Credible Long-term Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical scene segmentation is critical in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, referring surgical segmentation is emerging, given its advantage of providing surgeons with an interactive experience to segment the target object. However, existing methods are limited by low efficiency and short-term tracking, hindering their applicability in complex real-world surgical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce ReSurgSAM2, a two-stage surgical referring segmentation framework that leverages Segment Anything Model 2 to perform text-referred target detection, followed by tracking with reliable initial frame identification and diversity-driven long-term memory. For the detection stage, we propose a cross-modal spatial-temporal Mamba to generate precise detection and segmentation results. Based on these results, our credible initial frame selection strategy identifies the reliable frame for the subsequent tracking. Upon selecting the initial frame, our method transitions to the tracking stage, where it incorporates a diversity-driven memory mechanism that maintains a credible and diverse memory bank, ensuring consistent long-term tracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSurgSAM2 achieves substantial improvements in accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods, operating in real-time at 61.2 FPS. Our code and datasets will be available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/ReSurgSAM2.</description>

      <title>Using Few-Shot Learning to Classify Primary Lung Cancer and Other Malignancy with Lung Metastasis in Cytological Imaging via Endobronchial Ultrasound Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist early detection of lung metastases during endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures, significantly reducing follow-up time and enabling timely treatment. Due to limited cytology images and morphological similarities among cells, classifying lung metastases is challenging, and existing research rarely targets this issue directly.To overcome data scarcity and improve classification, the authors propose a few-shot learning model using a hybrid pretrained backbone with fine-grained classification and contrastive learning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning on augmented support sets enhances generalization and transferability. The model achieved 49.59% accuracy, outperforming existing methods. With 20 image samples, accuracy improved to 55.48%, showing strong potential for identifying rare or novel cancer types in low-data clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Ptychographic Image Reconstruction from Limited Data via Score-Based Diffusion Models with Physics-Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ptychography is a data-intensive computational imaging technique that achieves high spatial resolution over large fields of view. The technique involves scanning a coherent beam across overlapping regions and recording diffraction patterns. Conventional reconstruction algorithms require substantial overlap, increasing data volume and experimental time, reaching PiB-scale experimental data and weeks to month-long data acquisition times. To address this, we propose a reconstruction method employing a physics-guided score-based diffusion model. Our approach trains a diffusion model on representative object images to learn an object distribution prior. During reconstruction, we modify the reverse diffusion process to enforce data consistency, guiding reverse diffusion toward a physically plausible solution. This method requires a single pretraining phase, allowing it to generalize across varying scan overlap ratios and positions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high-fidelity reconstructions with only a 20% overlap, while the widely employed rPIE method requires a 62% overlap to achieve similar accuracy. This represents a significant reduction in data requirements, offering an alternative to conventional techniques.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Data Transformation Effects on Segment Anything 2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a critical task in the development of video perception and understanding. The Segment-Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), released by Meta AI, is the current state-of-the-art architecture for end-to-end VOS. SAM 2 performs very well on both clean video data and augmented data, and completely intelligent video perception requires an understanding of how this architecture is capable of achieving such quality results. To better understand how each step within the SAM 2 architecture permits high-quality video segmentation, a variety of complex video transformations are passed through the architecture, and the impact at each stage of the process is measured. It is observed that each progressive stage enables the filtering of complex transformation noise and the emphasis of the object of interest. Contributions include the creation of complex transformation video datasets, an analysis of how each stage of the SAM 2 architecture interprets these transformations, and visualizations of segmented objects through each stage. By better understanding how each model structure impacts overall video understanding, VOS development can work to improve real-world applicability and performance tracking, localizing, and segmenting objects despite complex cluttered scenes and obscurations.</description>

      <title>GBT-SAM: Adapting a Foundational Deep Learning Model for Generalizable Brain Tumor Segmentation via Efficient Integration of Multi-Parametric MRI Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gliomas are aggressive brain tumors that require accurate imaging-based diagnosis, with segmentation playing a critical role in evaluating morphology and treatment decisions. Manual delineation of gliomas is time-consuming and prone to variability, motivating the use of deep learning to improve consistency and alleviate clinical workload. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the information available in multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), particularly inter-slice contextual features, and typically require considerable computational resources while lacking robustness across tumor type variations. We present GBT-SAM, a parameter-efficient deep learning framework that adapts the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a large-scale vision model, to volumetric mp-MRI data. GBT-SAM reduces input complexity by selecting fewer than 2.6\% of slices per scan while incorporating all four MRI modalities, preserving essential tumor-related information with minimal cost. Furthermore, our model is trained by a two-step fine-tuning strategy that incorporates a depth-aware module to capture inter-slice correlations and lightweight adaptation layers, resulting in just 6.5M trainable parameters, which is the lowest among SAM-based approaches. GBT-SAM achieves a Dice Score of 93.54 on the BraTS Adult Glioma dataset and demonstrates robust performance on Meningioma, Pediatric Glioma, and Sub-Saharan Glioma datasets. These results highlight GBT-SAM's potential as a computationally efficient and domain-robust framework for brain tumor segmentation using mp-MRI.

      <title>Automatic quality control in multi-centric fetal brain MRI super-resolution reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quality control (QC) has long been considered essential to guarantee the reliability of neuroimaging studies. It is particularly important for fetal brain MRI, where acquisitions and image processing techniques are less standardized than in adult imaging. In this work, we focus on automated quality control of super-resolution reconstruction (SRR) volumes of fetal brain MRI, an important processing step where multiple stacks of thick 2D slices are registered together and combined to build a single, isotropic and artifact-free T2 weighted volume. We propose FetMRQC$_{SR}$, a machine-learning method that extracts more than 100 image quality metrics to predict image quality scores using a random forest model. This approach is well suited to a problem that is high dimensional, with highly heterogeneous data and small datasets. We validate FetMRQC$_{SR}$ in an out-of-domain (OOD) setting and report high performance (ROC AUC = 0.89), even when faced with data from an unknown site or SRR method. We also investigate failure cases and show that they occur in $45\%$ of the images due to ambiguous configurations for which the rating from the expert is arguable. These results are encouraging and illustrate how a non deep learning-based method like FetMRQC$_{SR}$ is well suited to this multifaceted problem. Our tool, along with all the code used to generate, train and evaluate the model are available at https://github.com/Medical-Image-Analysis-Laboratory/fetmrqc_sr/ .</description>

      <title>Deep Representation Learning for Unsupervised Clustering of Myocardial Fiber Trajectories in Cardiac Diffusion Tensor Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the complex myocardial architecture is critical for diagnosing and treating heart disease. However, existing methods often struggle to accurately capture this intricate structure from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) data, particularly due to the lack of ground truth labels and the ambiguous, intertwined nature of fiber trajectories. We present a novel deep learning framework for unsupervised clustering of myocardial fibers, providing a data-driven approach to identifying distinct fiber bundles. We uniquely combine a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory network to capture local sequential information along fibers, with a Transformer autoencoder to learn global shape features, with pointwise incorporation of essential anatomical context. Clustering these representations using a density-based algorithm identifies 33 to 62 robust clusters, successfully capturing the subtle distinctions in fiber trajectories with varying levels of granularity. Our framework offers a new, flexible, and quantitative way to analyze myocardial structure, achieving a level of delineation that, to our knowledge, has not been previously achieved, with potential applications in improving surgical planning, characterizing disease-related remodeling, and ultimately, advancing personalized cardiac care.</description>

      <title>TVC: Tokenized Video Compression with Ultra-Low Bitrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tokenized visual representations have shown great promise in image compression, yet their extension to video remains underexplored due to the challenges posed by complex temporal dynamics and stringent bitrate constraints. In this paper, we propose Tokenized Video Compression (TVC), the first token-based dual-stream video compression framework designed to operate effectively at ultra-low bitrates. TVC leverages the powerful Cosmos video tokenizer to extract both discrete and continuous token streams. The discrete tokens (i.e., code maps generated by FSQ) are partially masked using a strategic masking scheme, then compressed losslessly with a discrete checkerboard context model to reduce transmission overhead. The masked tokens are reconstructed by a decoder-only transformer with spatiotemporal token prediction. Meanwhile, the continuous tokens, produced via an autoencoder (AE), are quantized and compressed using a continuous checkerboard context model, providing complementary continuous information at ultra-low bitrate. At the Decoder side, both streams are fused using ControlNet, with multi-scale hierarchical integration to ensure high perceptual quality alongside strong fidelity in reconstruction. This work mitigates the long-standing skepticism about the practicality of tokenized video compression and opens up new avenues for semantics-aware, token-native video compression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ophthalmic surgery, developing an AI system capable of interpreting surgical videos and predicting subsequent operations requires numerous ophthalmic surgical videos with high-quality annotations, which are difficult to collect due to privacy concerns and labor consumption. Text-guided video generation (T2V) emerges as a promising solution to overcome this issue by generating ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. In this paper, we present Ophora, a pioneering model that can generate ophthalmic surgical videos following natural language instructions. To construct Ophora, we first propose a Comprehensive Data Curation pipeline to convert narrative ophthalmic surgical videos into a large-scale, high-quality dataset comprising over 160K video-instruction pairs, Ophora-160K. Then, we propose a Progressive Video-Instruction Tuning scheme to transfer rich spatial-temporal knowledge from a T2V model pre-trained on natural video-text datasets for privacy-preserved ophthalmic surgical video generation based on Ophora-160K. Experiments on video quality evaluation via quantitative analysis and ophthalmologist feedback demonstrate that Ophora can generate realistic and reliable ophthalmic surgical videos based on surgeon instructions. We also validate the capability of Ophora for empowering downstream tasks of ophthalmic surgical workflow understanding. Code is available at https://github.com/mar-cry/Ophora.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras respond to changes in log-brightness at the millisecond level, making them ideal for optical flow estimation. However, existing datasets from event cameras provide only low frame rate ground truth for optical flow, limiting the research potential of event-driven optical flow. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-latency event representation, Unified Voxel Grid, and propose EVA-Flow, an EVent-based Anytime Flow estimation network to produce high-frame-rate event optical flow with only low-frame-rate optical flow ground truth for supervision. Furthermore, we propose the Rectified Flow Warp Loss (RFWL) for the unsupervised assessment of intermediate optical flow. A comprehensive variety of experiments on MVSEC, DESC, and our EVA-FlowSet demonstrates that EVA-Flow achieves competitive performance, super-low-latency (5ms), time-dense motion estimation (200Hz), and strong generalization. Our code will be available at https://github.com/Yaozhuwa/EVA-Flow.</description>

      <title>RT-GAN: Recurrent Temporal GAN for Adding Lightweight Temporal Consistency to Frame-Based Domain Translation Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fourteen million colonoscopies are performed annually just in the U.S. However, the videos from these colonoscopies are not saved due to storage constraints (each video from a high-definition colonoscope camera can be in tens of gigabytes). Instead, a few relevant individual frames are saved for documentation/reporting purposes and these are the frames on which most current colonoscopy AI models are trained on. While developing new unsupervised domain translation methods for colonoscopy (e.g. to translate between real optical and virtual/CT colonoscopy), it is thus typical to start with approaches that initially work for individual frames without temporal consistency. Once an individual-frame model has been finalized, additional contiguous frames are added with a modified deep learning architecture to train a new model from scratch for temporal consistency. This transition to temporally-consistent deep learning models, however, requires significantly more computational and memory resources for training. In this paper, we present a lightweight solution with a tunable temporal parameter, RT-GAN (Recurrent Temporal GAN), for adding temporal consistency to individual frame-based approaches that reduces training requirements by a factor of 5. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two challenging use cases in colonoscopy: haustral fold segmentation (indicative of missed surface) and realistic colonoscopy simulator video generation. We also release a first-of-its kind temporal dataset for colonoscopy for the above use cases. The datasets, accompanying code, and pretrained models will be made available on our Computational Endoscopy Platform GitHub (https://github.com/nadeemlab/CEP).

      <title>Clinically inspired enhance Explainability and Interpretability of an AI-Tool for BCC diagnosis based on expert annotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An AI tool has been developed to provide interpretable support for the diagnosis of BCC via teledermatology, thus speeding up referrals and optimizing resource utilization. The interpretability is provided in two ways: on the one hand, the main BCC dermoscopic patterns are found in the image to justify the BCC/Non BCC classification. Secondly, based on the common visual XAI Grad-CAM, a clinically inspired visual explanation is developed where the relevant features for diagnosis are located. Since there is no established ground truth for BCC dermoscopic features, a standard reference is inferred from the diagnosis of four dermatologists using an Expectation Maximization (EM) based algorithm. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and interpretability, positioning this approach as a valuable tool for early BCC detection and referral to dermatologists. The BCC/non-BCC classification achieved an accuracy rate of 90%. For Clinically-inspired XAI results, the detection of BCC patterns useful to clinicians reaches 99% accuracy. As for the Clinically-inspired Visual XAI results, the mean of the Grad-CAM normalized value within the manually segmented clinical features is 0.57, while outside this region it is 0.16. This indicates that the model struggles to accurately identify the regions of the BCC patterns. These results prove the ability of the AI tool to provide a useful explanation.</description>

      <title>Decadal analysis of sea surface temperature patterns, climatology, and anomalies in temperate coastal waters with Landsat-8 TIRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05843</link>

Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. Due to the intricate thermal interactions between land, sea, and atmosphere, the spatial gradients of SST in coastal waters often appear at finer spatial scales than those in open ocean waters. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first analysed the spatiotemporal patterns of SST in South Australia's temperate coastal waters from 2014 to 2023 by developing an operational approach for SST retrieval from the Landsat-8 TIRS sensor. A buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to validate the quality of SST retrievals. Then the daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months. We hope these findings would be helpful in supporting the fishing and aquaculture industries in the coastal waters of South Australia.</description>

      <title>High-Quality Spatial Reconstruction and Orthoimage Generation Using Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly accurate geometric precision and dense image features characterize True Digital Orthophoto Maps (TDOMs), which are in great demand for applications such as urban planning, infrastructure management, and environmental monitoring.Traditional TDOM generation methods need sophisticated processes, such as Digital Surface Models (DSM) and occlusion detection, which are computationally expensive and prone to errors.This work presents an alternative technique rooted in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), free of explicit DSM and occlusion detection. With depth map generation, spatial information for every pixel within the TDOM is retrieved and can reconstruct the scene with high precision. Divide-and-conquer strategy achieves excellent GS training and rendering with high-resolution TDOMs at a lower resource cost, which preserves higher quality of rendering on complex terrain and thin structure without a decrease in efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction and high-precision terrain modeling. This approach provides accurate spatial data, which assists users in better planning and decision-making based on maps.</description>

      <title>Learning Phase Distortion with Selective State Space Models for Video Turbulence Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence is a major source of image degradation in long-range imaging systems. Although numerous deep learning-based turbulence mitigation (TM) methods have been proposed, many are slow, memory-hungry, and do not generalize well. In the spatial domain, methods based on convolutional operators have a limited receptive field, so they cannot handle a large spatial dependency required by turbulence. In the temporal domain, methods relying on self-attention can, in theory, leverage the lucky effects of turbulence, but their quadratic complexity makes it difficult to scale to many frames. Traditional recurrent aggregation methods face parallelization challenges.
  In this paper, we present a new TM method based on two concepts: (1) A turbulence mitigation network based on the Selective State Space Model (MambaTM). MambaTM provides a global receptive field in each layer across spatial and temporal dimensions while maintaining linear computational complexity. (2) Learned Latent Phase Distortion (LPD). LPD guides the state space model. Unlike classical Zernike-based representations of phase distortion, the new LPD map uniquely captures the actual effects of turbulence, significantly improving the model's capability to estimate degradation by reducing the ill-posedness. Our proposed method exceeds current state-of-the-art networks on various synthetic and real-world TM benchmarks with significantly faster inference speed.</description>

      <title>Inter-event Interval Microscopy for Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Event cameras, an innovative bio-inspired sensor, differ from traditional cameras by sensing changes in intensity rather than directly perceiving intensity and recording these variations as a continuous stream of "events". The intensity reconstruction from these sparse events has long been a challenging problem. Previous approaches mainly focused on transforming motion-induced events into videos or achieving intensity imaging for static scenes by integrating modulation devices at the event camera acquisition end. In this paper, for the first time, we achieve event-to-intensity conversion using a static event camera for both static and dynamic scenes in fluorescence microscopy. Unlike conventional methods that primarily rely on event integration, the proposed Inter-event Interval Microscopy (IEIM) quantifies the time interval between consecutive events at each pixel. With a fixed threshold in the event camera, the time interval can precisely represent the intensity. At the hardware level, the proposed IEIM integrates a pulse light modulation device within a microscope equipped with an event camera, termed Pulse Modulation-based Event-driven Fluorescence Microscopy. Additionally, we have collected IEIMat dataset under various scenes including high dynamic range and high-speed scenarios. Experimental results on the IEIMat dataset demonstrate that the proposed IEIM achieves superior spatial and temporal resolution, as well as a higher dynamic range, with lower bandwidth compared to other methods. The code and the IEIMat dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Feasibility of Internet-Sourced Video for Automatic Cattle Lameness Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cattle lameness is often caused by hoof injuries or interdigital dermatitis, leads to pain and significantly impacts essential physiological activities such as walking, feeding, and drinking. This study presents a deep learning-based model for detecting cattle lameness, sickness, or gait abnormalities using publicly available video data. The dataset consists of 50 unique videos from 40 individual cattle, recorded from various angles in both indoor and outdoor environments. Half of the dataset represents naturally walking (normal/non-lame) cattle, while the other half consists of cattle exhibiting gait abnormalities (lame). To enhance model robustness and generalizability, data augmentation was applied to the training data. The pre-processed videos were then classified using two deep learning models: ConvLSTM2D and 3D CNN. A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates strong classification performance. Specifically, the 3D CNN model achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with precision, recall, and f1-score of 90.9%, 90.9%, and 90.91% respectively. The ConvLSTM2D model exhibited a slightly lower accuracy of 85%. This study highlights the effectiveness of directly applying classification models to learn spatiotemporal features from video data, offering an alternative to traditional multi-stage approaches that typically involve object detection, pose estimation, and feature extraction. Besides, the findings demonstrate that the proposed deep learning models, particularly the 3D CNN, effectively classify and detect lameness in cattle while simplifying the processing pipeline.</description>
