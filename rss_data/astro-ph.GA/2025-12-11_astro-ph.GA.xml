      <title>Kinematics and physical structure of Ou 5: A bipolar planetary nebula with extreme abundance discrepancy and an eclipsing binary core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new deep imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy of the extreme-abundance-discrepancy planetary nebula Ou 5, together with photoionization modelling aimed at probing its unusual thermal and chemical structure. The nebula exhibits a nested bipolar morphology, including inner and outer shells, faint outer lobes, and polar knots. Remarkably, all these components share a dynamical age of order 10,000 yr. Thermal broadening of the H alpha line relative to heavier ions implies a hydrogen temperature 3000 K to 6000 K, in contrast to the ~ 10,000 K derived from collisionally excited line diagnostics. This provides independent support for the presence of at least two distinct temperature/metallicity phases, as previously proposed to explain extreme abundance discrepancies. Photoionization models with sinusoidally varying metallicity successfully reproduce the observed nebular spectrum and morphology. A mixture of fluctuations with both extreme and moderate metallicity contrasts is required to simultaneously fit the O II and the [O III] observations. The nebular He II emission demands a hotter and more luminous central star than previously inferred, consistent with a ~ 0.58 solar mass post-AGB progenitor evolving toward a CO white dwarf. Ou 5 thus reinforces the link between close-binary nuclei and extreme abundance discrepancies, and provides a valuable benchmark for understanding how common-envelope ejections give rise to the thermal and abundance inhomogeneities observed in planetary nebulae.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning of halo gas density profiles: a sensitivity analysis of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar and AGN-driven feedback processes affect the distribution of gas on a wide range of scales, from within galaxies well into the intergalactic medium. Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} &lt; M_{\rm 200c} &lt; 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: Understanding the ionization nature of EGSY8p7/CEERS-1019. Evidence for a star formation-driven outflow at z = 8.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical conditions and feedback mechanisms in early massive galaxies is essential to uncover how they formed and evolved during the first billion years of the Universe. In this context, the galaxy EGSY8p7/CEERS-1019 at z=8.6 provides an excellent benchmark, given its stellar mass of $10^{9.3}M_\odot$ and elevated N/O abundance despite its sub-solar metallicity. In this study, we present new JWST/NIRSpec observations offering the first spatially resolved spectroscopy of this galaxy, with higher sensitivity and spectral resolution than previous studies. We identify broad (FWHM=650km/s) H$\beta$ and [OIII] emission components whose emission is located between the two rest-frame UV clumps of the galaxy and extended over a distance of $\sim1kpc$. The morphology and kinematics of these components indicate that the broad emission arises from outflowing gas rather than from an AGN broad-line region. The kinetic energy injection rate from stellar feedback is an order of magnitude higher than that of the outflow, while the radiation pressure rate is comparable to the outflow momentum rate. These results suggest that stellar feedback alone can drive the outflow, with radiation pressure potentially providing the required momentum transfer. We derive a low mass-loading factor ($\eta=0.16$) and ionizing photon escape fraction ($f_{esc}=0.021\pm0.014$). Together with the high electron density measured ($n_e=2200cm^{-3}$), these results support the interpretation that most of the gas remains confined within the galaxy. Comparisons of diagnostic emission-line ratios with photoionization and shock models support a star-formation-driven ionization scenario, ruling out any excitation by AGN radiation. Finally, the absence of detectable Wolf-Rayet features suggests that alternative mechanisms must be considered to explain the high N/O ratio in this galaxy.</description>

      <title>Enhanced rates of stellar radial migration in gas-rich discs at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial migration and dynamical heating redistribute stars within galactic discs and thereby modify the chemo-kinematic structure of their host galaxies. Usually, these secular processes are studied in N-body and hydrodynamical simulations of Milky Way analogues with stellar-dominated discs. In contrast, discs at high redshift are gas-rich, which may qualitatively change how secular evolution proceeds. We use the Nexus framework to construct and evolve a suite of isolated galaxies with fixed halo and disc mass but varying initial disc gas fraction, from 0% to 100%. We show that in gas-rich models, the root-mean-square change in stellar angular momentum is up to a factor of two larger than in gas-poor analogues and is accompanied by stronger radial and vertical heating, leading to enhanced radial mixing. We further dissect the role of gas in specific migration channels. For bar-driven migration, corotation resonance dragging dominates in gas-poor discs, whereas in gas-rich discs, stars more readily reach and accumulate at the outer Lindblad resonance, which acts as a barrier. The high radial mixing efficiency in gas-rich phases can flatten the stellar metallicity gradient relative to that of the initial gaseous disc within only a few orbital timescales. Together, these results imply that radial mixing in early, gas-rich discs is substantially more vigorous than in late-time, gas-poor discs, naturally producing distinct evolutionary tracks for chemically bimodal discs such as that of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Core-wing transitions and the breakdown of diffusion in Lyman-$\alpha$ radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman alpha (LyA) line of neutral hydrogen plays a central role in observations of star-forming galaxies. However, resonant scattering makes it difficult to directly interpret LyA signatures. Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) calculations have become the gold standard for modeling LyA, but it becomes extremely computationally expensive in optically thick environments. Workarounds, such as core-skipping to avoid repetitive low-transport scatterings, greatly increase the efficiency of MCRT simulations but introduce errors in the solutions. While core-skipping is designed to preserve emergent spectra, the internal radiation field, most importantly, the momentum imparted, is not properly preserved. On the other hand, to make analytical and numerical progress, it is often assumed that photons diffuse in both frequency and physical space. We find that these diffusion approximations break down for frequencies near the core and positions at finite optical depths. We propose a more physically-motivated definition for the core-wing transition frequency to isolate such effects. We derive new spectral distributions of internal radiation properties and compare the results with simulations. We analyze the diffusive properties of LyA photons and demonstrate anomalous spatial diffusion behavior with fat-tailed distributions. This work deepens our understanding of diffusion in resonant-line transfer and identifies areas where simulations or analytics may be failing and how these failures may be resolved.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Photometric Redshift Training Sets I: Efficient Compression of the Galaxy Color-Redshift Relation with UMAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic datasets are essential for training and calibrating photometric redshift (photo-$z$) methods. However, spectroscopic redshifts (spec-$z$'s) constitute a biased and sparse sampling of the photometric galaxy population, which creates difficulties for the common grid-based approach for mapping color to redshift using self-organizing maps (SOMs). Instead, we utilized the uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) algorithm to compress a Rubin-Roman-like $ugrizyJH$ color space into a thin and densely-sampled manifold. Crucially, the manifold varies continuously and monotonically in redshift and specific star formation rate in roughly orthogonal directions. Using $\sim$110,000 COSMOS2020 many-band photo-$z$'s and $\sim$15,000 spec-$z$'s as representative and non-representative samples, respectively, we trained and tested redshift estimation from a SOM (SOM-$z$) and from nearest neighbors in UMAP space (UMAP-$k$NN-$z$). Compared to SOM-$z$, UMAP-$k$NN-$z$ exhibited smaller photo-$z$ scatter and fraction of outliers for the representative training set. When training with the highly biased spec-$z$ sample, UMAP-$k$NN-$z$ maintained similar performance, but the outlier fraction for SOM-$z$ increased by nearly three times. The physically-meaningful trends across the UMAP manifold allow for accurate redshift regression even in regions of color space sparsely populated by spectroscopic objects, which comprise nearly 25% of the photometric sample. This suggests that representative, spectroscopically-anchored training sets can be produced by interpolating between spectroscopic sources at the UMAP coordinates of photometric objects, maximizing the performance of photo-$z$ algorithms.</description>

      <title>A High-resolution Study of the Cold Neutral Medium in and around 30 Doradus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of evaluating the roles of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in the cloud-scale baryon cycle, we perform a high-resolution study of the CNM in and around the extreme star-forming region 30 Doradus (30 Dor). For our study, we use Galactic Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder H I Survey data and produce H I emission and absorption cubes on 7 pc scales. To examine the CNM structures toward 30 Dor, we decompose the H I absorption cube into 862 Gaussian components and find that these components are distributed at four velocity ranges (B1, B2, B3, and B4, respectively): 200$-$230 km s$^{-1}$, 230$-$260 km s$^{-1}$, 260$-$277 km s$^{-1}$, and 277$-$300 km s$^{-1}$. We derive line-of-sight average spin temperatures and opacity-corrected total H I column densities and show that the B1$-$B4 structures have systematically different properties, indicating that they are physically distinct. As for the nature of the observed CNM structures, we find that B2 is associated with the main dense structure where ionized, atomic, and molecular gases are concentrated. B3 and B4 trace inflows whose combined mass flux rate of 0.14 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is comparable to the current star formation rate, while B1 probes outflows with a much lower mass flux rate of 0.007 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. Interestingly, the H I column densities in B1$-$B4 are nearly uniform with a factor of two spatial variations, implying the presence of H I shielding layers for H$_{2}$ formation.</description>

      <title>On the connection between galaxy orientation and halo absorption properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of the azimuthal dependence of metal-line absorption in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) using a uniformly selected sample of 87 isolated galaxies at z &lt; 0.4 from the Magellan MagE MgII (M3) halo survey. High-quality archival imaging enables quantitative morphological measurements -- including disk inclination and position angle -- for every galaxy, providing a robust framework for assessing how absorber strength depends on the geometric alignment between galaxies and the QSO sightlines. All galaxies have associated constraints on MgII lambda 2796 absorption, and a subset of 56 galaxies also have measurements of CaII lambda 3934. We compare rest-frame MgII and CaII equivalent widths with both projected distance and deprojected galactocentric distance. Across the full sample, we find no statistically significant correlation between absorption strength and azimuthal angle. Restricting to the 71 galaxies with well-determined disk orientations reveals a mild excess of strong MgII absorbers near the projected major axis, but a Kendall's tau test confirms that this trend is not statistically significant. CaII absorption, which exhibits a low covering fraction of kappa_CaII = 0.18^{+0.06}_{-0.04} within 50 kpc for W_r(3934) &gt; 0.1 Ang, shows no measurable azimuthal dependence. To assess potential biases, we quantify the effects of projection, disk inclination, and variations in imaging quality. After accounting for these systematics, the spatial distribution of low-redshift MgII and CaII absorbers is consistent with arising from a randomly distributed population, with no compelling evidence for azimuthal anisotropy at d &lt;~ 50 kpc. A larger sample with robust constraints on the disk orientation will be required to uncover or rule out subtle anisotropic trends.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Kinematic Dissection of the Solar Neighborhood: Identifying Stellar Moving Groups with Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive kinematic analysis of the solar neighborhood (d &lt; 50 pc) using high-precision astrometric data from the third Gaia Data Release (DR3). By leveraging the full six dimensional phase space information (positions and velocities), we apply the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to blindly identify stellar overdensities in the Galactocentric Cartesian velocity space (U, V, W ). Our unsupervised machine learning approach successfully recovers the kinematic cores of major local moving groups, including the Hyades and Pleiades streams, without prior assumptions regarding their membership or spatial distribution. We analyze the velocity dispersion and structural properties of these associations, demonstrating that automated clustering algorithms are robust tools for mapping the complex dynamical history of the local Milky Way disk. These results confirm the hierarchical nature of stellar kinematic substructures and provide a catalog of high-probability members for future spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>High deuteration of methanol in L1544</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isotopic fractionation is a very powerful tool to follow the evolution of material from one stage to the next in the star-formation process. Pre-stellar cores exhibit some of the highest levels of deuteration because their physical conditions greatly favor deuteration processes. Deuteration maps are a measure of the effectiveness of the deuteration across the core, and they are useful to study both the deuteration as well as the formation mechanism of the main species. Methanol is the simplest O-bearing complex organic molecule (COM) detected in the interstellar medium (ISM). It represents the beginning of molecular complexity in star-forming regions, thus a complete understanding of its formation and deuteration is a necessary step to understand the development of further chemical complexity. In this paper, we use single-dish observations with the IRAM 30 m telescope and state-of-the-art chemical models to investigate the deuteration of methanol towards the prototypical pre-stellar core L1544. We also compare the results of the chemical models with previous observations of deuterated methanol towards the pre-stellar cores HMM1 and L694-2. The spectra extracted from the CHD$_2$OH map show that the emission is concentrated in the center and towards the north-west of the core. Using deep observations towards the dust and the methanol peaks of the core, we derive a very large deuterium fraction for methanol ($\sim20\%$) towards both peaks. The comparison of our observational results with chemical models has highlighted the importance of H-abstraction processes in the formation and deuteration of methanol. Deep observations combined with state-of-the-art chemical models are of fundamental importance in understanding the development of molecular complexity in the ISM. Our analysis also shows the importance of non-LTE effects when measuring the D/H ratios in methanol.</description>

      <title>The Early Maturity of High-Redshift Galaxies: Insights from sSFR, M/L and SFHs at z~7-14</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed an unexpected excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10, unaccounted for by extrapolations from pre-JWST observations and theoretical models. Understanding the physical properties and star formation histories (SFH) of high redshift systems is key to distinguish between the different proposed scenarios. We identify and analyse a sample of 2420 robust candidates at z~7-14 drawn from the ASTRODEEP-JWST dataset over ~0.2 deg^2 and model their properties with non-parametric SFHs to derive their specific star formation rate (sSFR) and stellar population properties. We find that the median sSFR and M/L remain roughly constant across the probed redshift range. We show that this result is robust against potential systematics unless a hidden population of dust-enshrouded starbursts, undetectable in current data, exists at these redshifts. In any case, the absence of observed high-sSFR systems at the highest redshifts suggests that any dust-free starburst phase must be short-lived. The observed sSFR evolution is in tension with most (though not all) theoretical models, making it a key quantity for discriminating among competing scenarios. The sample shows a wide range of physical conditions and galaxy classes, including systems with low sSFR and high mass-to-light ratios (M/L) up to z~10, indicative of already evolved galaxies only a few hundred Myr after the Big Bang, and different degrees of dust attenuation. We finally attempt to reconstruct the assembly histories of two sub-samples: a) the highest-M/L galaxies at z~7-8, which appear to have formed the bulk of their stars at least 500 Myr before observation, implying progenitors observable as UV-bright sources at z&gt;20, and b) z&gt;11 galaxies, which formed through stochastic SFH, remaining UV-faint for most of their early evolution, before undergoing recent (~50 Myr old) episodes of major growth.</description>

      <title>TiNy Titans HI: Discovering Satellites via HI Gas in an Isolated, Compact Group of Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the HI content of an isolated, compact group of 6 dwarf galaxies at a distance of 145 Mpc. The distribution and kinematics of the HI, including multiple gaseous bridges, indicate the group is a gravitationally bound system. The HI maps further reveal two newly discovered dwarf satellites easily identified by their gas but only barely visible in optical images. The four dwarf group members previously identified in SDSS have 9.06 &lt; log(Mstar/Msun) &lt; 9.43 and 9.42 &lt; log(MHI/Msun) &lt; 9.73. The two newly discovered dwarf satellites have log(Mstar/Msun) = 6.10 with log(MHI/Msun) = 8.71 and log(Mstar/Msun) = 7.07 with log(MHI/Msun) = 9.18. New Gemini optical spectra link the HI detections and their optical counterparts. The group's 3D velocity dispersion (188 km/s), mass-to-light ratio (M_L/B ~44), dynamical-to-baryonic mass ratio (Mdyn/Mbary ~ 21), size (69 kpc), and gas fraction (0.56) are all consistent with the compact dwarf groups in the TNG50 simulation. The group has a top-heavy satellite mass function that is inconsistent with predictions for LMC-sized hosts and may instead be two or more groups coming together. A Voronoi tessellation reveals the group resides in a tendril outside the intersection of two filaments. These intermediate density environments within large scale structure provide the conditions needed for groups of star forming, gas-rich dwarf galaxies to form and eventually merge. Our results further show that it is possible to uncover fainter dwarf satellites around dwarf galaxy hosts via HI maps.</description>

      <title>Double tidal disruption events or repeating partial tidal disruption events in AT 2020vdq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AT 2020vdq has been known as a candidate of repeating partial tidal disruption events (pTDEs), due to its two flares with a time interval of $\sim$1000 days. Here, a simplified method is proposed to test such repeating pTDEs scenario considering a main-sequence star tidally disrupted twice. For the two flares in AT 2020vdq if related to the repeating pTDEs scenario, theoretical TDE model determined stellar mass of the original star disrupted for the first flare should be not very different from the mass of the star (to trace the reminder of the original star) disrupted for the second flare, because a partial TDE with impact parameter $\beta$ smaller than 1 can lead to most of (probable higher than 90\%) the stellar mass also bound to the reminder of the original star. After considering theoretical TDE model applied to describe the two flares in AT 2020vdq, the model determined stellar masses are about 2${\rm M_\odot}$ and $0.36{\rm M_\odot}$ for the stars disrupted in the first flare and the second flare. The large mass difference cannot be reasonably expected by the repeating pTDEs with $\beta$ around 0.6 in AT 2020vdq. The results in this manuscript indicate that the repeating pTDEs scenario is not preferred at current stage in AT 2020vdq, but the probable double TDEs for two individual stars tidally disrupted should be currently recommended.</description>

      <title>Deblending the MIGHTEE-COSMOS survey with XID+: The resolved radio source counts to $S_{1.4}\approx 5\mu$Jy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep radio continuum surveys provide fundamental constraints on galaxy evolution, but source confusion limits sensitivity to the faintest sources. We present a complete framework for producing high-fidelity deblended radio catalogs from the confused MIGHTEE maps using the probabilistic deblending framework XID+ and prior positions from deep multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field. To assess performance, we construct MIGHTEE-like simulations based on the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) radio source population, ensuring a realistic distribution of star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) for validation. Through these simulations, we show that prior catalog purity is the dominant factor controlling deblending accuracy: a high-purity prior, containing only sources with a high likelihood of radio detection, recovers accurate flux densities and reproduces input source counts down to $\sim 3\sigma$ (where $\sigma = $ thermal noise). On the other hand, a complete prior overestimates the source counts due to spurious detections. Our optimal strategy combines the high-purity prior with a mask that removes sources detected above $50~\mu$Jy. Applied to the $\sim$1.3\,deg$^2$ area of the MIGHTEE-COSMOS field defined by overlapping multi-wavelength data, this procedure yields a deblended catalog of 89,562 sources. The derived 1.4\,GHz source counts agree with independent P(D) analyses and indicate that we resolve the radio background to $\sim 4.8\,\mu$Jy. We also define a recommended high-fidelity sample of 20,757 sources, based on detection significance, flux density, and goodness-of-fit, which provides reliable flux densities for individual sources in the confusion-limited regime.</description>

      <title>The stellar and dark matter distributions in elliptical galaxies measured by stacked weak gravitational lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stellar mass and central dark matter density profiles of photometric luminous red galaxies with stellar masses of $\sim10^{10}-10^{12}M_\odot$ using weak gravitational lensing measurements from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program data obtained with the Subaru Telescope. By stacking weak lensing signals from a large number of galaxies, we obtain average tangential shear profiles down to $\sim 10\,\mathrm{kpc}/h$, which are fitted assuming a two-component model consisting of stellar and dark matter components to constrain their central dark matter distribution. We find a preference for non-zero core radii of dark matter distributions in galaxies with stellar masses of $\sim 10^{11}M_\odot$. Our results imply a stronger feedback effect than that typically predicted by current hydrodynamical simulations. In addition, we provide a new constraint on the stellar-to-halo mass relation, where both stellar and halo masses are, for the first time, directly constrained by weak gravitational lensing. Our results prefer the stellar initial mass function (IMF) that is more bottom-heavy than the Salpeter IMF.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Analysis Of The Galactic Open Clusters' Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of 1,481 Galactic open clusters (OCs) through the application of the Limepy dynamical model, from which we derive the fundamental structural parameters of OCs. We conduct the statistical analyses on the structural parameters with clusters' ages and locations within the Milky Way. Our results reveal the higher concentration in the cluster centeris associated with the sharper truncation at the periphery of cluster, which is consistent with previous findings for globular clusters(GCs). We further find the systematic increase of the lower limit of clusters' half-mass radius (Rh) with age. Our results also show that OCs located at larger vertical distances from the Galactic plane systematically display higher central concentrations. Our findings collectively suggest that the structural characteristics of OCs are shaped by both intrinsic evolutionary processes and interactions with the Galactic environment. During the evolution of star clusters, the combined effects of mass segregation and tidal stripping lead to the systematic pattern between central concentration and outer truncation. Clusters of different ages and locations within the Milky Way undergo different evolutionary histories, resulting in correlations between the Rh and age, as well as between central concentration and galactic location.</description>

      <title>CASCADE: Filamentary accretion flows in Cygnus X DR20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We investigate the role of filaments in high-mass star formation, whether gas flows from large to small scales along them, and what their properties might reveal about the region they are found in. Methods. The Max Planck IRAM Observatory Program (MIOP), the Cygnus Allscale Survey of Chemistry and Dynamical Environments (CASCADE), includes high spatial resolution (~3'') data of HCO+(1-0) and H13CO+(1-0) emission in the star-forming DR20 region in the Cygnus X complex. In this data we identify filaments with the structure identification algorithm DisPerSE. We further analyze these filaments using Gaussian fits to the spectra to determine the line peak velocity and full width half maximum along them. The Python package FilChaP was used to determine filament widths. Results. We find projected velocity gradients inside several filaments between 0.4 to 2.4km/s over projected length-scales of 0.1pc toward star-forming cores. This can be interpreted as a sign of gas flowing along the filaments toward the cores. The filament width distributions exhibit median values between 0.06 and 0.14pc depending on the core, the tracer, and the method. Standard deviations are approximately 0.02 to 0.06pc. These values are roughly in agreement with the filament width of 0.1pc typically found in nearby low-mass star-forming regions. Conclusions. This first analysis of filamentary properties within the Cygnus X CASCADE program reveals potential signatures of gas flows along filaments onto star-forming cores. Furthermore, the characteristics of the filaments in this high-mass star-forming region can be compared to those of filaments in low-mass star-forming regions typically studied before. Extending such studies to the entire CASCADE survey will enhance our knowledge of high-mass filament properties on solid statistical grounds.</description>

      <title>Age, Chemistry, and Kinematics of the Inner Galaxy Revealed by MUSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bar/bulge and inner disk are fundamental building blocks of the Milky Way, containing a large fraction of its stellar mass. However, stars in these regions are faint, crowded, and have high extinction, which makes studying their formation and evolution challenging. Using the integral-field spectrograph MUSE with adaptive-optics on the Very Large Telescope, we overcome these limitations and measure accurate ages, chemical abundances, and line-of-sight velocities for 98 main-sequence turn-off and subgiant branch stars with $R_{gc}&lt;3.5$ kpc in Baade's Window. We find that 17% stars have ages younger than 5 Gyr, and the age distribution reveals multiple peaks at 3.1, 4.8, 7.6, and 10.8 Gyr, indicating that star formation in the inner Galaxy occurred in multiple episodes. These stars are predominantly metal-rich but span a broad metallicity range ($-1.2&lt;$[Fe/H]$&lt;+0.6$). The [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution shows both $\alpha$-rich and $\alpha$-poor sequences, with most stars being metal-rich and low-[$\alpha$/Fe]. Our results demonstrate that IFUs enable reliable measurements of stellar parameters even in the most crowded regions of the Milky Way, opening a new pathway to study the chemodynamical evolution of the inner Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Can Clump Properties Predict Core Distribution in Star Formation? A Statistical Analysis of MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense cores, the progenitors of stars, are in sub-pc scale and fragmented from pc-scale clumps. However, it is still unclear that how strongly the fragmentation process is affected by the properties of the host clumps, and how these properties influence the core distribution observed in recent millimeter (mm) and sub-mm observations. To systematically investigate this relation, we employed MHD simulations of convergent flows to generate a large sample of clumps and analyzed their properties using various techniques. Alignment parameters were used to quantify core distribution, while energy terms were calculated to assess the influence of gravity, magnetic fields, and turbulence. We found the core distribution only exhibiting weak correlations between alignment parameters and clump properties. For an individual clump, turbulence is believed to significantly contribute to these features by inducing non-homologous collapse and ongoing fragmentation. Nevertheless, for the entire population, more compact core distributions are observed due to the dominance of gravity. Overall, these factors suggest that clump properties are not sufficient to accurately determine core distribution.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the X-ray-to-UV relation of Quasars in the era of all-sky surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray--to--UV relation of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), commonly parametrized via the monochromatic luminosities at $2500\,\mathring{A}$ and $2\,keV$, reflects the energetic interplay between the accretion disc and the X-ray-emitting corona, and is key for understanding accretion physics. Previous studies suggest that disc-dominated emission becomes more prominent with increasing optical luminosity. However, the redshift evolution of this relation remains debated, and a dependence on Eddington ratio, predicted by accretion flow models, is still observationally unconstrained. We revisit this relation using a large, nearly all-sky sample by combining the SDSS DR16Q QSO catalogue with X-ray data from XMM-Newton and the SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey DR1, yielding 136,745 QSOs at redshifts $0.5 \leq z &lt; 3.0$. We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian framework that treats X-ray detections and upper limits uniformly, enabling robust inference from both parametric and non-parametric models. We confirm a tight, sublinear $\log L_X({\rm 2\,keV})$-$\log L_{\nu}({\rm 2500\,\mathring{A}})$ correlation, but with a normalization at the lower end of previous estimates. Contrary to most literature results, we detect a mild but systematic redshift evolution: the relation flattens and its intrinsic scatter decreases at higher redshift. This trend is consistent with disc emission increasingly dominated by scattering and enhanced energy transfer to the X-ray corona, potentially indicating redshift evolution in the X-ray bolometric correction. We find no significant dependence on Eddington ratio, in tension with recent accretion flow models.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of Distant Milky Way Halo RR Lyrae Stars out to 160 kpc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a kinematical study of the outer halo (r_GC approximately 60 to 160 kpc) of the Milky Way based on spectroscopy of 55 RR Lyrae stars obtained with the ESI instrument on the Keck II telescope. Our spectroscopic targets were selected from three photometric surveys: NGVS, DES, and Pan-STARRS1. We derive center-of-mass radial velocities with uncertainties of 6 to 35 km s^-1. The halo velocity dispersion measured from our sample is 70 plus/minus 7 km s^-1. The velocity field shows a possible dipole-like structure, with redshifted northern and blueshifted southern hemispheres. Fitting a Milky Way - Large Magellanic Cloud dipole perturbation model yields a weak or marginal dipole signal with amplitude -30 (+16, -20) km s^-1 and apex direction (l, b) = (-38.2 (+42.4, -31.5), -41.3 (+27.9, -23.8)) deg, along with a bulk compression velocity of -16 plus/minus 11 km s^-1. Although limited by sky coverage and sample size, our results are consistent with the presence of LMC-induced disequilibrium in the distant halo beyond 100 kpc. In addition to the 55 RR Lyrae stars, our spectroscopy reveals that 10 additional photometrically selected RR Lyrae candidates are actually quasar or blazar contaminants, highlighting the need for caution regarding such contaminants in sparsely sampled photometric surveys. Our study demonstrates that single-epoch spectroscopy of RR Lyrae stars is a viable method for probing the kinematics of the outer halo, and future surveys such as Rubin LSST and DESI-II have the potential to significantly advance this effort.</description>

      <title>Footprints in the Wind: Probing X-ray Outflows in NGC 7469 using Near-Infrared Emission Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGN winds play an important role in the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, yet their driving mechanisms and impact on star formation remain subjects of active investigation. Critically, the lack of X-ray Integral Field Units currently limits our ability to acquire spatially resolved velocity information in the X-ray regime. However, instead, this can be achieved using the James Webb Space Telescope. As part of an ongoing investigation of the nuclear feedback processes in the nearby luminous AGN NGC 7469, we present an analysis of the kinematics of the X-ray emitting outflows using near-infrared footprint lines such as [Mg VIII] 3.03 um. These high-ionization emission lines are associated with the same gas analyzed in the X-ray, and thus can be used to probe the footprint of the X-ray wind's velocity structure and ionization state. Thanks to the wide wavelength range available with JWST we also use nebular (e.g. [S IV] 10.51 um) and coronal (e.g. [Ne V] 14.32 um) emission lines to offer a comprehensive multi-phase view of the outflows. We present mass and kinetic energy outflow rates, and find that while the feedback processes in NGC 7469 are not efficient by theoretical benchmarks, the most massive and energetic component is the high ionization X-ray gas.</description>

      <title>Clumpy, dense gas in the outflow of NGC 1266</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09889v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows are one of the most spectacular mechanisms through which active galactic nuclei (AGN) impact their host galaxy, though the role of AGN-driven outflows in global star formation regulation across the galaxy population is unclear. NGC 1266 is an excellent case study for investigating the outflows and star formation quenching because it is a nearby (D\sim30 Mpc) AGN host galaxy with an outflow driving shocks through the interstellar medium (ISM) and has recently quenched its star formation outside the nucleus. While previous works have studied the molecular outflow from its CO emission, to fully characterize the impact the outflow has on the ISM observations probing the dense, cold gas are necessary. Our ALMA cycle 0 observations do not detect a molecular outflow in 13CO(2-1) and yield a lower limit 12CO/13CO \geq 250, suggesting a highly optically thin CO outflow with low 13CO abundance. In contrast, we detect substantial HCN(1-0) emission in the outflow, with an HCN(1-0)/12CO(1-0) ratio of 0.09, consistent with global measurements of many star-forming galaxies and Luminous InfraRed Galaxies (LIRGs). We conclude that the CO emission traces a diffuse component of the molecular gas with a low optical depth, whereas the HCN(1-0) traces dense clumps of gas entrained in the outflow. We measure an upper limit molecular outflow rate of &lt; 85 Msun/yr. Assuming the ongoing nuclear star formation and outflow continue at the same rates, NGC 1266 will deplete its gas reservoirs in 450 Myr or longer, indicating that relatively low-level AGN feedback is capable of gradually expelling the molecular gas reservoir after a rapid quenching event.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Annihilation and Decay with H$\alpha$ Line Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a new indirect search for dark matter (DM) using Hydrogen-$\alpha$ (H$\alpha$) recombination emission. DM annihilation or decay products can ionize neutral gas; subsequent recombination cascades generate H$\alpha$ photons through the $3\rightarrow2$ transition. In quiet gas-rich dwarf galaxies, the $n{=}2$ population is negligible, so H$\alpha$ is effectively unabsorbed and traces the DM-energy injection site. Using the non-detection of extended H$\alpha$ emission in the Leo T dwarf galaxy with Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations, I derive the first H$\alpha$-based limits on DM annihilation and decay, reaching leading sensitivity for parts of the eV-GeV mass range. Existing and upcoming telescopes can further extend this reach, establishing H$\alpha$ imaging as a powerful DM search strategy.</description>

      <title>University of Hawaii 88-inch Telescope Observations of the Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS: Spectrophotometric Blue-Sensitive Spectral Time Series Spanning Two Months from Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects are the ejected building blocks of other solar systems. As such, they enable the acquisition of otherwise inaccessible information about nascent extrasolar systems. The discovery of the third interstellar object, 3I/ATLAS, provides an opportunity to explore the properties of a small body from another solar system and to compare it to the small bodies in our own. To that end, we present spectrophotometric observations of 3I/ATLAS taken using the SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph on the University of Hawaii 2.2-m telescope. Our data includes the earliest $\lambda\leq3800$ A spectrum of 3I/ATLAS, obtained $\sim$12.5 hours after the discovery announcement. Later spectra confirm previously reported cometary activity, including Ni and CN emission. The data show wavelength-varying spectral slopes ($S\approx($0\%-29\%)/1000 A, depending on wavelength range) throughout the pre-perihelion ($r_h=4.4$-$2.5$ au) approach of 3I/ATLAS. We perform synthetic photometry on our spectra and find 3I/ATLAS shows mostly stable color evolution over the period of our observations, with $g-r$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.69-0.75 mag, $r-i$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.26-0.30 mag, and $c-o$ colors ranging from $\sim$0.50-0.55 mag. Ongoing post-perihelion observations of 3I/ATLAS will provide further insight into its potentially extreme composition.</description>

      <title>The eventful life journey of galaxy clusters. II. Impact of mass accretion on the thermodynamical structure of the ICM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The internal structure of the intracluster medium (ICM) is tightly linked to the assembly history and physical processes in groups and clusters, but the role of recent accretion in shaping these profiles has not been fully explored.
  Aims. We investigate to what extent mass accretion accounts for the variability in ICM density and thermodynamic profiles, and what can present-day structures reveal about their formation histories.
  Methods. We analyze a hydrodynamical cosmological simulation including gas cooling but no feedback, to isolate the effects of heating from structure formation. Median profiles of ICM quantities are introduced as a robust description of the bulk ICM. We then examine correlations between mass accretion rates or assembly indicators with the profiles of temperature, entropy, pressure, gas and dark-matter density, as well as their scatter.
  Results. Accretion in the last dynamical time strongly lowers central gas densities, while leaving dark matter largely unaffected, producing a distinct signature in the baryon depletion function. Pressure and entropy show the clearest dependence on accretion, whereas temperature is less sensitive. The radii of steepest entropy, temperature, and pressure shift inward by $\sim (10-20)\%$ between high- and low-accretion subsamples. Assembly-state indicators are also related to the location of these features, and accretion correlates with the parameters of common fitting functions for density, pressure, and entropy.
  Conclusions. Recent accretion leaves measurable imprints on the ICM structure, highlighting the potential of thermodynamic profiles as diagnostics of cluster growth history.</description>

      <title>Probing the origin of the kilonova candidate GRB 230307A: analysis of host galaxy and offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the host galaxy of the long gamma-ray burst GRB 230307A, which is associated with a kilonova candidate likely produced by a binary neutron-star (BNS) merger. The transient occurred at a projected offset of $\sim 40$ kpc from its spiral-galaxy host. We consider two explanations for this large distance: (i) NSs that merge inside a remote globular cluster, or (ii) a BNS that formed in the disk whose orbit was strongly modified by the NS natal kicks. Using JWST data and comparisons with known globular clusters, we show that a globular-cluster origin is extremely unlikely, ruling out case (i). Considering case (ii), using JWST and MUSE data, we derive the host galaxy morphology, stellar mass, estimate the atomic gas (HI+He) contribution, and the host rotation curve. Assuming an NFW halo and applying Bayesian inference, we obtain a mass model for the host galaxy. From this model, we compute the time required for a disk-formed BNS, with a given natal kick, to reach the observed offset while marginalizing over uncertainties and over the initial position in the disk. We compare these results with BNS-merger simulations from the SEVN population-synthesis code combined with PARSEC stellar evolutionary tracks, which provide the coalescence time and kick velocity for each realization. The two approaches have an overlap in the kick-time diagram, but only 0.1\% of the simulated systems fall within the 2$\sigma$ region of the galaxy mass model. This indicates that a disk origin is possible, but requires fine-tuned conditions for the kilonova to occur at such a large distance from the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Distance to the Globular Cluster M 3 from the Infrared Surface Brightness Technique applied to RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Infrared Surface Brightness (IRSB) technique is a specific application of the Baade-Wesselink method. Given a proper calibration, well covered optical and near-infrared photometry, as well as radial velocity curves, it allows for estimation of distances to individual pulsating stars and determination of their mean radii. The technique is fully empirical and does not depend on stellar atmosphere models.
  The goal of the work is to test the precision of distance determinations to individual RR Lyrae stars and to their host system as a whole using the IRSB technique for a relatively distant globular cluster M 3 (NGC 5272). We also aim to determine mean radii and period-radius relations for these stars in order to compare them with the existing theoretical prediction and empirical estimations for the field stars from the solar neighborhood.
  We use data available in the literature and the calibration of the IRSB technique based on the RR Lyrae stars from the solar neighborhood we published previously in order to determine distances to 14 RR Lyrae stars in the globular cluster M 3. We study the impact of the selection of the fitting procedure (bisector v.s. the LS fit) on the results. We apply five different empirical surface brightness-color relations from the literature in the analysis.
  We obtained a mean distance to M 3 of $r_{M3} = (10.07 \pm 0.19 \pm 0.29) \,kpc$ that corresponds to a distance modulus ${\mu}_{M3} = (15.015 \pm 0.041 \pm 0.063) \,mag$ and a $7\%$ scatter of individual stellar distances for 14 RR Lyrae stars in M 3. We received a very good agreement between the two fitting techniques. We also determined mean stellar radii for pulsators from the sample with a precision of $0.5\%$ and obtained excellent agreement with a theoretical prediction of the period-radius relation for RRab stars available in the literature.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Signatures of Massive Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct-collapse black holes (DCBHs) are an important component of the massive black hole population of the early universe, and their formation and early mergers will be prominent in the data stream of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). However, the population and binary properties of these early black holes are poorly understood, with masses, mass ratios, spins, and orbital eccentricities strongly dependent on the details of their formation, and the properties of the remaining exterior material (baryonic and non-baryonic), which may be substantial to the point of merger.
  We report on initial work to simulate the formation, collapse, and/or merger of such DCBH regions in order to extract the resulting gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Four Giant Planets from 2024 KMTNet Microlensing Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present analyses of four newly discovered planetary microlensing events from the 2024 KMTNet survey season: KMT-2024-BLG-0176, KMT-2024-BLG-0349, KMT-2024-BLG-1870, and KMT-2024-BLG-2087. In each case, the planetary nature was revealed through distinct types of anomalies in the lensing light curves: a positive bump near the peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0176, an asymmetric peak for KMT-2024-BLG-0349, a short-duration central dip for KMT-2024-BLG-1870, and a caustic-crossing feature for KMT-2024-BLG-2087. Detailed modeling of the light curves confirms that these anomalies are produced by planetary companions with planet-to-host mass ratios in the range of $(1.5\text{--}17.9)\times 10^{-3}$. Despite the diversity of signal morphologies, all planets detected in these events are giant planets with masses comparable to or exceeding that of Jupiter in the Solar System. Each planet orbits a host star less massive than the Sun, emphasizing the strength of microlensing in uncovering planetary systems around low-mass stellar hosts.</description>

      <title>Bimetric MOND as a framework for variable-$G$ theories -- local systems and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bimetric MOND (BIMOND) is used as a platform for variable-$G$ theories that have MOND-specific idiosyncrasies. E.g., MOND premises dictate return to standard dynamics in the high-acceleration limit, predicting the standard value of $G$ for high-acceleration systems. This automatically ensures compliance of such theories with all the constraints on inconstancy of $G$ that emerge from the study of high-acceleration systems: geophysics, solar system, pulsars, supernovae, stellar evolution, emission of gravitational waves, etc. In MOND, constraints deduced from such phenomena have no bearing on possible $G$ variability in cosmology. My guiding motivation is to see if such theories may account for some roles of dark matter in cosmology; e.g., in accounting for the expansion history of the Universe in the matter-dominated era, by having a $G_e\approx 2\pi G$ govern the later stages of the expansion, instead of invoking matter density $\approx 2\pi\times$ baryon density. Without adding degrees of freedom, or new dimensionful constants, BIMOND can be extended to a class of theories that entail what is best described as phenomenon-dependence of Newton's constant, $G$. I cannot yet present a consistent model that complies with all the observations in cosmology, including the expansion history, with all its details. Instead, I describe some examples of theories in the class that predict different values of $G_e$ in different circumstances, including one where $G$ takes its standard value for all subcosmological systems -- even if they are deep in the MOND regime. I also discuss scenarios in which $G_e\approx G$ in the early Universe, as required by constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis, but with $G_e&gt; G$ setting in at later times, where it can affect the expansion history during the matter-dominated era.</description>

      <title>SN 2022ngb: a faint, slow-evolving Type IIb Supernova with a low-mass envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An extensive photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of the Type IIb SN 2022ngb is presented in the article. Through detailed modeling of this dataset, we aim to constrain the key physical parameters of the explosion, infer the nature of the progenitor star and its environment, and probe the dynamical properties of the ejecta. We analyze photometric and spectroscopic data of SN 2022ngb. By constructing and modeling the bolometric light curve with semi-analytic models, we estimate the primary explosion parameters. The spectroscopic data are compared with those of well-studied SNe IIb and NLTE models to constrain the properties of the progenitor and the structure of the resulting ejecta. SN 2022ngb is a low-luminosity SN IIb with a peak bolometric luminosity of L_bol = 7.76 (+1.15/-1.00) x 10^41 erg/s and a V-band rising time of 24.32 +/- 0.50 days. Light curve modeling indicates an ejecta mass of ~2.9-3.2 M_sun, an explosion energy of ~1.4 x 10^51 erg, and a low synthesized 56Ni mass of ~0.045 M_sun. Nebular phase spectra exhibit asymmetric line profiles, pointing to a non-spherical explosion and an anisotropic distribution of radioactive material. Our analysis reveals a relatively compact stripped-envelope progenitor with a pre-SN mass of approximately 4.7 M_sun (corresponding to a 15-16 M_sun ZAMS star). Our analysis suggests that SN 2022ngb originated from the explosion of a moderate-mass relatively compact, stripped-envelope star in a binary system. The asymmetries inferred from the nebular phase spectral line features suggest a non-spherical explosion.</description>

      <title>Probing stellar rotation in the Pleiades with gravity-mode pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their proximity, the Pleiades are an important benchmark open cluster. Despite its status, asteroseismic analyses of its members are rare. In particular, the gravity-mode (g-mode) pulsators, which allow inference of stellar near-core properties have not been analysed yet. We aim to identify and analyse the population of g-mode pulsators in the Pleiades. Our focus lies on the internal rotation as measured from asteroseismology to obtain a well defined sample of stellar rotation on the early main sequence. Based on full-frame images from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we constructed light curves for intermediate-mass Pleiades members and searched for g-mode pulsators among them. For pulsators exhibiting period spacing patterns, we determined their near-core rotation rate and buoyancy periods. For all other g-mode pulsators, we estimated the near-core rotation rate based on the dominant mode frequency to obtain a comprehensive rotation rate distribution. Among our 105 target stars, we find 28 g-mode pulsators distributed across the entire upper main sequence, 19 of which are hybrid pulsators, but only three stars exhibit period spacing patterns in the current TESS data. The near-core rotation rates in A- and early F-type members are distributed between 1 and 3 d$^{-1}$ without any clear mass-dependence. This distribution is much broader than the one in the similar open cluster NGC 2516. A comparison of the buoyancy periods shows that the Pleiades and NGC 2516 are of similar asteroseismic age. With the large population of g-mode and hybrid pulsators, the Pleiades constitute a valuable asteroseismic benchmark cluster, reaffirming its important role in stellar astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Ultimate large-$Rm$ regime of the solar dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For more than fourty years, the quest to understand how large-scale magnetic fields emerge from turbulent flows in rotating astrophysical systems, such as the Sun, has been a major thread of computational astrophysics research. Using a parameter scan and phenomenological analysis of maximally-simplified three-dimensional cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulations of large-scale nonlinear helical turbulent dynamos, I present results in this Letter that strongly point to an asymptotic ultimate regime of the large-scale solar dynamo, at large magnetic Reynolds numbers $Rm$, involving helicity fluxes between hemispheres. I obtained corresponding numerical solutions at both $Pm&gt;1$ and $Pm&lt;1$, and show that they can currently only be achieved in clean, simplified numerical setups. The analysis further strongly suggests that all global simulations to date lie in a non-asymptotic turbulent MHD regimes highly sensitive to changes in kinetic and magnetic Reynolds numbers. Ideas are presented to attempt to reach this ultimate regime in such "realistic" global spherical models at a reasonable numerical cost. Overall, the results clarify the current state, and some hard limitations of the brute-force numerical modelling approach applied to this, and other similar astrophysical turbulence problems.</description>

      <title>No evidence for accretion around the intermediate-mass black hole in Omega Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over a decade, both theoretical predictions and observational studies have suggested that $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive Milky Way globular cluster, might harbor an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). Recently, identification of fast-moving stars in the core of $\omega$ Cen provided the strongest evidence to date for the presence of such an IMBH. One of the key questions in the study of IMBHs is their accretion efficiency, which determines their radio and X-ray signatures. We investigate the accretion signature of the IMBH in $\omega$ Cen with ultra-deep radio continuum observations of the central region of the cluster. Using approximately 170 hours of Australia Telescope Compact Array observations, we achieve a root mean square noise of 1.1 $\mu$Jy at 7.25 GHz, making this the most sensitive radio image of the cluster to date. We detect no radio emission at any of the proposed centers of the cluster, imposing stringent constraints on the presence of an accreting IMBH in $\omega$ Cen. Considering the fundamental plane of black hole activity, our findings indicate that the accretion efficiency around the black hole is exceptionally low (with a conservative 3-$\sigma$ upper limit of $\epsilon \lesssim 4\times10^{-3}$).</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Bath in a Past Supernova Gives Birth to Earth-Like Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key question in astronomy is how ubiquitous Earth-like rocky planets are. The formation of terrestrial planets in our solar system was strongly influenced by the radioactive decay heat of short-lived radionuclides (SLRs), particularly $^{26}$Al, likely delivered from nearby supernovae. However, current models struggle to reproduce the abundance of SLRs inferred from meteorite analysis without destroying the protosolar disk. We propose the `immersion' mechanism, where cosmic-ray nucleosynthesis in a supernova shockwave reproduces estimated SLR abundances at a supernova distance ($\sim$1 pc), preserving the disk. We estimate that solar-mass stars in star clusters typically experience at least one such supernova within 1 pc, supporting the feasibility of this scenario. This suggests solar-system-like SLR abundances and terrestrial planet formation are more common than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of astrophysical dynamos and applications to giant planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields pervade astrophysical systems and strongly influence their dynamics. Because magnetic diffusion is usually much faster than system evolution, ancient fields cannot explain the present magnetization of planets, stars, and galaxies. Instead, self-sustaining dynamos, which convert fluid motion into magnetic energy, offer the most robust explanation. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulations are essential to understanding this phenomenon. This thesis uses numerical models of self-excited dynamos in two contexts: the interstellar medium (ISM) and the interiors of gas giant planets. First, I use 3D MHD simulations with the Pencil Code to study magnetic growth from irrotational, subsonic expansion flows, a simplified representation of supernova-driven motions in the ISM. These curl-free flows mimic stellar explosions and winds, drive turbulence, and seed magnetic amplification. The second part examines planetary dynamos. I outline the properties of planetary magnetic fields and their modeling through convection in spherical shells. Although many exoplanets are known, their magnetic fields remain difficult to detect, but may be observable through coherent radio emission with new low-frequency instruments. Using 3D dynamo simulations with the MagIC code, coupled to thermodynamic profiles from MESA-based evolution models, I study the magnetic evolution of cold gas giants. The models show a slow decline in field strength, a shift from multipolar to dipolar states, and clear evolutionary trends in dynamo behavior. I also investigate hot Jupiters, where strong irradiation alters convection and rotation. Most remain fast rotators, but massive, distant planets may enter different regimes. When heating is concentrated in outer layers, convection in the dynamo region weakens, reducing expected field strengths and helping explain the absence of confirmed detections in past radio surveys.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent secondary cosmic microwave background anisotropies and extragalactic foregrounds in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secondary anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) contain information that can be used to test both cosmological models and models of galaxy formation. Starting from lightcone-based HEALPix maps and catalogues, we present a new set of mock CMB maps constructed in a self-consistent manner from the FLAMINGO suite of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, including CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effects, cosmic infrared background, radio point source and anisotropic screening maps. We show that these simulations reproduce a wide range of observational constraints. We also compare our simulations with previous predictions based on dark matter-only simulations which generally model the secondary anisotropies independently from one another, concluding that our hydrodynamical simulation mocks perform at least as well as previous mocks in matching the observations whilst retaining self-consistency in the predictions of the different components. Using the model variations in FLAMINGO, we further explore how the signals depend on cosmology and feedback modelling, and we predict cross-correlations between some of the signals that differ significantly from those in previous mocks. The mock CMB maps should provide a valuable resource for exploring correlations between different secondary anisotropies and other large-scale structure tracers, and can be applied to forecasts for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>SHELLQs. Bridging the Gap: JWST Unveils Obscured Quasars in the Most Luminous Galaxies at z &gt; 6</title>

Abstract: The unprecedented sensitivity of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered a surprisingly abundant population of mildly obscured, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the epoch of reionization (EoR). However, the link between these objects and classical unobscured quasars remains a mystery. Here we report the discovery of obscured quasars hosted by the most luminous galaxies at z &gt; 6, possibly bridging the gap between the two AGN populations. The 13 objects presented here were originally selected from a rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) imaging survey over &gt;1000 deg2, and were known to have luminous (&gt;10^{43} erg/s) narrow Ly-alpha emission. With JWST/NIRSpec follow-up observations, we found that 7 out of 11 objects with narrow Ly-alpha exhibit a broad component in H I Balmer lines and He I lines, but not in [O III] and other forbidden lines. Mild dust obscuration (0 &lt; Av &lt; 3) is inferred from the Balmer decrements. The estimated intrinsic luminosities suggest that our broad line (BL) objects are the long-sought UV-obscured counterparts of luminous quasars in the EoR. They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses 10^(7.8-9.1) Msun, undergoing sub-Eddington to Eddington accretion. Most of the BL objects are spatially unresolved, and are close to "little red dots" with their blue rest-UV and red rest-optical colors. We estimate the AGN number density among similarly luminous Ly-alpha emitters to be larger than 2 x 10^(-8) /Mpc3. This density is comparable to that of classical quasars with similar continuum luminosities, suggesting that a substantial fraction of active SMBHs are obscured in the EoR and have been overlooked in past rest-UV surveys.</description>

      <title>Studies of stationary features in jets: 3C 279 quasar I. On-sky scattering and dynamics</title>

Abstract: A recent study on the dynamics of the quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the jet of BL~ Lacertae highlighted its significance in evaluating the physical properties of relativistic transverse waves in the parsec-scale jet. Motivated by this finding, we selected a different type of blazar, the flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) 3C~279, which hosts a QSC at an angular median distance of 0.35~mas from the radio core, as revealed by 27 years of VLBA monitoring data at 15~GHz. We investigate the positional scatter and dynamics of a QSC in the 3C~279 jet, aiming to detect the presence of a relativistic transverse wave and estimate its characteristics. We employ an analytical statistical method to estimate the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC, while moving average and refinement methods are used to smooth its trajectory. Analysis of the QSC position scatter shows that the jet axis change its direction by about $21^{\circ}$ over 27 years and jet mean intrinsic full opening angle is $\approx 0.30^{\circ} \pm 0.03^{\circ}$. The apparent displacement vectors of the QSC exhibit strong asymmetry and anisotropy along the jet direction, indicating pronounced anisotropic displacements of the core along the jet axis. We estimated the mean intrinsic speed of the QSC to be superluminal, $\overline{\beta_{\rm s}} \approx 10$ in units of the speed of light, which, within the framework of the seagull-on-wave model, is interpreted as evidence for a relativistic transverse wave propagating through the QSC. Analysis of the reversing trajectory of the QSC enables the classification and characterisation of reversal patterns, which, in turn, allows the determination of key transverse wave parameters such as frequency, amplitude, inclination angle, and magnetic energy of the wave (abbrev.).</description>

Abstract: Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local $5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to $10^6$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds, primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about $10\%$ only. This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ (thermal prior on eccentricity) or $0.115_{-0.028}^{+0.048}$ (flat prior) for 8 binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$ representing $&gt;3.7\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton. Moreover, the inferred orbital true anomalies clearly favor modified gravity over Newton with the difference of Bayesian information criterion $&gt;10$. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring and testing gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>Double Trouble: Two spectroscopically confirmed low-mass quiescent galaxies at z&gt;5 in overdensities</title>

Abstract: We present the discovery of two low-mass, high-redshift, quiescent galaxies, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1, using JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy alongside NIRCam and MIRI photometry. Observed at a redshift of z=5.39 and z=5.11 respectively, and with stellar masses of $\rm 10^{9.6}M_\odot$ and $\rm 10^{9.5}M_\odot$, GS-z5-Q1 and COS-z5-Q1 are two of the most distant quiescent galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to-date, and are by far the least massive ($\sim10\times$ lower mass). Full spectrophotometric modelling reveals that COS-z5-Q1 appears to have quenched more than 300Myr prior to observation ($z\sim 7$) and has a formation redshift of around z$\sim$11, whilst GS-z5-Q1 formed and quenched in a single burst around 150Myr prior to observation ($z\sim6$). GS-z5-Q1 is found to lie near the centre of a known high-z overdensity in GOODS-S, as would be expected by galaxy formation models, while COS-z5-Q1 lies towards the outskirts of an overdense region. This highlights the role that environment could play in accelerating galaxy evolutionary processes and could possibly be linked to the galaxies' quiescent nature. By modelling their stellar populations, we show that these types of low-mass quiescent galaxies could potentially be descendants of the higher-z "mini-quenched" galaxies. The discovery of these two low-mass $z&gt;5$ quiescent galaxies illuminates a previously undiscovered galaxy population and motivates dedicated follow-up surveys to investigate the overall population.</description>

      <title>Orbit-based structural decomposition and stellar population recovery for edge-on barred galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10832v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we developed an orbit-superposition method for edge-on barred galaxies and constructed a set of dynamical models based on different mock observations of three galaxies from the Auriga simulations. In this study, we adopted 12 cases with side-on bars (three simulated galaxies, each with four different projections). We decomposed these galaxies into different structures combining the kinematic and morphological properties of stellar orbits. We then compared the model-predicted components to their true counterparts in the simulations. Our models can identify (BP/X-shaped) bars, spheroidal bulges, thin discs, and spatially diffuse stellar halos. The mass fractions of bars and discs are well constrained with absolute biases of $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.15$. We recovered the mass fractions of halos with $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.03$. For the bulge components, 10 out of 12 cases exhibit $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.05$, while the other two cases exhibit $|f_{\rm model}-f_{\rm true}|\le0.10$. Then, by tagging the stellar orbits with ages and metallicities, we derived the chemical properties of each structure. For the stellar ages, our models recovered the negative gradients in the bars and discs, but exhibited relatively larger uncertainties for age gradients in the bulges and halos. The mean stellar ages of all components were constrained with absolute biases $|t_{\rm model}-t_{\rm true}|\rm\lesssim1\,Gyr$. For stellar metallicities, our models reproduced the steep negative gradients of the bars and bulges, as well as all different kinds of metallicity gradients in the discs and halos. Apart from the bulge in the simulated galaxy Au-18, the mean stellar metallicities of all other components were constrained with absolute biases of $|Z_{\rm model}-Z_{\rm true}|\rm\le0.5\,Z_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Central ortho-H2D+ Depletion at Sub-kau Scales in Prestellar Core G205.46-14.56M3: The First Interferometric Evidence and Implications for Deuterium Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21158</link>

Abstract: Prestellar cores represent the initial conditions of star formation, but heavy molecules such as CO are strongly depleted in their cold, dense interiors, limiting the ability to probe core centers. Deuterated molecular ions therefore emerge as key tracers because deuterium fractionation is enhanced at low temperatures. We present the first direct observation of ortho-H2D+ depletion in the prestellar core G205.46-14.56M3 using ALMA 820um continuum and ortho-H2D+(110-111) data at ~300-au resolution. We confirm the previously reported two substructures, B1 and B2, and identify a central ortho-H2D+ depletion zone toward B1 with ~6$\sigma$ contrast and an inferred diameter $\lesssim$600au, together with a peak $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+)=$1.03^{+0.07}_{-0.56}$. The observationally inferred profiles of $x$(ortho-H2D+) and $x$(N2D+)/$x$(N2H+) are reproduced by a deuteration-focused chemo-dynamical model; however, the central ortho-H2D+ depletion is only marginally matched within the $2\sigma$ upper limit, likely suggesting additional deuteration in the depletion zone. From these models we infer a core age of ~0.42Ma, comparable to the free-fall time, suggesting that the substructures formed via rapid, turbulence-dominated fragmentation rather than slow, quasi-static contraction. Our observations also reveal that ortho-H2D+ velocity dispersions are largely subsonic in the core and nearly thermal between B1 and B2, consistent with turbulence dissipating within a few free-fall times. These results highlight the critical role of deuterated ions for both chemical evolution and dynamics in dense cores.</description>

Abstract: Astrochemical models are essential to bridge the gap between the timescales of reactions, experiments, and observations. Ice chemistry in these models experiences a large computational complexity as a result of the many parameters required for the modeling of chemistry occurring on these ices, such as binding energies and reaction energy barriers. Many of these parameters are poorly constrained, and accurately determining all would be too costly. We aim to find out which parameters describing ice chemistry have a large effect on the calculated abundances of ices for different prestellar objects. Using Monte Carlo sampled binding energies, diffusion barriers, desorption and diffusion prefactors, and reaction energy barriers, we determined the sensitivity of the abundances of the main ice species calculated with UCLCHEM, an astrochemical modeling code, on each of these parameters. We do this for a large grid of physical conditions across temperature, density, cosmic ray ionization rate and UV field strength. We find that, regardless of the physical conditions, the main sensitivities of abundances of the main ice species are the diffusion barriers of small and relatively mobile reactive species such as H, N, O, HCO, and CH$_3$. Thus, these parameters should be determined more accurately to increase the accuracy of models, paving the way to a better understanding of observations of ices. In many cases, accurate reaction energy barriers are not essential due to the treatment of competition between reactions and diffusion.</description>

      <title>The Local Group L-band Survey: Probing Cold Atomic Gas in IC10 with Neutral Hydrogen Absorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first localized detections of the cold neutral medium (CNM) in IC10, offering a rare view of dense atomic gas in a low-metallicity (0.27 solar metallicity) dwarf galaxy. As a low-metallicity starburst, IC10's interstellar medium conditions could reflect small-scale physical conditions that mirror those of early galaxies, providing a unique window into the heating and cooling processes that shaped the interstellar medium in early-Universe environments. Leveraging the high angular (&lt;5'' ~ 15pc) and spectral (0.4 km/s) resolution of the Local Group L-band Survey, we searched for HI absorption against nine continuum radio sources and detected absorption along three sightlines corresponding to internal radio emission sources within IC10. Using Gaussian decomposition and radiative transfer, we characterize the CNM, deriving spin temperatures of ~30-55 K, column densities of (0.6-3.0)x 1$0^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, cold HI fractions of ~ 21-37%, and line widths of ~ 5.6-13.6 km/s. For each individual detection of HI absorption, we find corresponding molecular emission from 12CO (J=1-0), HCO+ (J=1-0), and HCN (J=1-0) at similar velocities and with comparable linewidths, indicating a well-mixed cold atomic and molecular medium. In IC10, the CNM shows a clear kinematic connection to the high-density ISM, implying a stronger dynamical coupling with molecular gas than in the Milky Way, in line with expectations for low-metallicity environments. At the ~ 15 pc scales probed by slightly extended HII regions in IC10, unresolved CNM clouds likely contribute to line blending, so the observed broad HI linewidths may partly reflect spatial and kinematic averaging.</description>

      <title>The ensemble broad-frequency power spectrum of Stripe-82 quasars from multiple surveys</title>

Abstract: Variability is a striking features of quasars, observed at all timescales wavelengths. Studying its properties and the correlations with the physical parameters (e.g. black hole mass and accretion rate) provides significant insights into accretion physics. However, the detailed picture and the exact interplay between different emitting regions are not yet clear. We combine data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System 1 (Pan-STARRS1, PS1), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), and the Gaia space telescope to constrain the power spectrum of quasars in the Stripe-82 region over a broad frequency range, 10^{-1} to 10^{-3} day^{-1}(rest frame). Light curves are matched and cross-calibrated to reach \sim 20 years in the r-band for 4037 quasars. We split the sample into bins of the same black hole mass, accretion rate, and redshift, and measure the ensemble power spectral density (PSD) in each bin. The power spectra of SDSS, ZTF, and Gaia are measured independently. We do not measure it on PS1 data due to more erratic cadence, but we discuss the use of interpolation techniques, eventually allowing us to use the data together. We find significant evidence that the long-term UV/optical variability of quasars is stationary, as the ensemble PSD estimates from SDSS, Gaia and ZTF are consistent within the errors despite coming from different surveys and years. The PSD shape is consistent with a bending power law with spectral indices of -2.7 and -1 at high and low frequencies. A fit with the PSD associated with a damped random walk is significantly worse. The PSD amplitude below the break does not depend on black hole mass, but there is some evidence for anti-correlation with the accretion rate. The bending frequency, instead, scales with the black hole mass as $\nu_b$ \propto M_{\mathrm{BH}}^{-0.6\pm0.1} and does not depend on the accretion rate.</description>

      <title>ACES: The Magnetic Field in Large Filaments in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18029v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Galactic Center (GC) is an extreme region of the Milky Way that is host to a complex set of thermal and non-thermal structures. In particular, the GC contains high-density gas and dust that is collectively referred to as the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In this work, we study a subset of HNCO filaments identified in band 3 ALMA observations of the GC obtained by the ALMA CMZ Exploration Survey (ACES) that are comparable to high density filaments identified in the Galactic Disk. We compare the orientation of the magnetic field derived from 214 um SOFIA and 850 um JCMT observations with the filament orientation to determine which mechanisms dominate the formation of these filaments. We observe a large range of magnetic orientations in our observed filaments indicating the complex environments the filaments are located in. We also compare the observational results to synthetic data sets created using an MHD model of the GC. Our analysis reveals that the dominant mechanisms local to the HNCO filaments vary throughout the GC with some filaments being dominated by supersonic turbulence and others by subsonic turbulence. The comparison to synthetic observations indicates that the observed filaments are in magnetically dominated environments that could be supporting these filaments against collapse. Our results on the CMZ filaments are also compared to results obtained on similar filaments located in the Galactic Disk, and we find that the filaments studied here are possible CMZ analogs to the dense filamentary "bones" observed previously in the Galactic Disk.</description>

Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) abundance ratio in star-forming galaxies at redshift z~1-6, with a median redshift of z=2.7, using deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. Leveraging detections of faint auroral emission lines in 76 galaxies at z&gt;1 from both the MARTA survey and a large compilation of high-redshift literature objects, we derive direct electron temperature-based abundances for nitrogen and oxygen using rest-frame optical lines. We establish the first high-redshift calibrations of strong-line N/O diagnostics based on direct abundance measurements, finding no significant evolution for either N2O2 = [NII]6585/[OII]3727,3729 and N2S2 = [NII]6585/[SII]6717,6731 diagnostics compared to local realisations. We then investigate the N/O-O/H relation across cosmic time using both direct abundances and strong-line based measurements (additional 430 galaxies). We find evidence for mild but systematic nitrogen enhancement at high redshift: galaxies at z&gt;1 exhibit N/O ratios elevated by ~0.18 dex (median offset) at fixed O/H compared to the local relation, with a more pronounced enhancement at low metallicity (12+log(O/H) &lt; 8.1) where the offset reaches up to ~0.3-0.4 dex. We consider several scenarios to explain the observed trends, including bursty star formation, differential metal loading, and inflows of pristine gas. Our results provide the most extensive confirmation of elevated N/O ratios at high-redshift to date based on rest-optical diagnostics and within a self-consistent frame.</description>

      <title>A Short History of (Orbital) Decay: Roman's Prospects for Detecting Dying Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Roman Space Telescope Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey (GBTDS) is expected to detect ~$10^5$ transiting planets. Many of these planets will have short orbital periods and are thus susceptible to tidal decay. We use a catalog of simulated transiting planet detections to predict the yield of orbital decay detections in the Roman GBTDS. Assuming a constant stellar tidal dissipation factor, $Q^{'}_{*}$, of $10^6$, we predict ~ 5 - 10 detections. We additionally consider an empirical period-dependent parameterization of $Q^{'}_{*} \propto P^{-3}$ and find a substantially suppressed yield. We conclude that Roman will provide constraints on the rate of planet engulfment in the Galaxy and probe the physics of tidal dissipation in stars.</description>

      <title>No Metallicity Preference in Fast Radio Burst Host Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration extragalactic radio transients of unknown origin, and studying their host galaxies could offer clues to constrain progenitor models. Among host properties, gas-phase metallicity is a key factor influencing stellar evolution and transient productions. We analyze the largest uniformly selected sample of FRB host galaxies, measuring oxygen abundances (12+log(O/H)=8.04-8.85) for 31 hosts at redshifts z=0.04-0.98, using consistent emission-line diagnostics. Using a volume-limited subsample, we compare the distributions of stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and metallicity to a control sample of star-forming galaxies selected by the same criteria. We find that FRB host galaxies span a wide metallicity range and are broadly consistent with the SFR-weighted mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. We find no clear lower metallicity bound, suggesting that FRB progenitors can form in any metallicity environment through channels largely insensitive to metal abundance. Encouragingly, this implies FRBs can arise even in low-metallicity, high-redshift galaxies, supporting their potential as probes of matter distribution across cosmic time. Additionally, we find marginal ($\sim$2$\sigma$) evidence for a -0.09\pm0.04 dex metallicity offset from the fundamental metallicity relation. Despite model uncertainties, if real, this offset likely reflects suppressed SFRs at fixed mass and metallicity rather than metal deficiency. Similar offsets are observed in local post-merger galaxies and may reflect a post-starburst phase following galaxy interactions. Such systems may host FRB progenitors formed during the starburst that produce FRBs after a 100-500 Myr delay, broadly consistent with observed delay-time distributions, although further data are needed to confirm this interpretation.</description>

Abstract: There are millions of undetected black holes wandering through our galaxy. Observatories like {\it Chandra}, LIGO, and more recently, {\it Gaia}, have provided valuable insights into the configurations of these elusive objects when residing in binary systems. Motivated by these advances, we study, for the first time, the enhanced accretion of metals from the interstellar medium (ISM) onto low-mass companions in binary systems with highly unequal mass ratios, utilizing a series of hydrodynamical simulations. Our study demonstrates that a stellar companion's metal accretion history from the ISM alone, from its formation to the present, can significantly influence its surface abundances, especially when enhanced by a massive black hole companion. However, this effect is likely only measurable in stars that are still in the main sequence. Once a stellar companion evolves off the main sequence, similar to what has been observed with the {\it Gaia} BH3 companion, the initial dredge-up process are likely to erase any excess surface abundance resulting from the metals that were accreted. As we discover more unequal mass ratio binary systems, it is crucial to understand how the observed metallicity of sun-like companions may differ from their birth metallicity, especially if they are not yet evolved.</description>

      <title>The frame-dragging vector potential on galaxy scales from DM-only Newtonian $N$-body simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effects of General Relativity are usually neglected in the non-linear evolution of structures, where Newtonian $N$-body simulations are traditionally employed. In the post-Friedmann expansion framework, a weak-field relativistic approximation purpose-built for cosmology, a frame-dragging gravito-magnetic vector potential arises at leading order, sourced by momentum currents, contributing to the metric even if the dynamics of matter fields at this order is Newtonian, and can thus be extracted from $N$-body simulations. Using the Delaunay Tessellation Field Estimator code on the IllustrisTNG simulations, here we extend previous work in order to compute the power spectrum of this vector potential down to galactic scales. The magnitude of the vector potential is two orders of magnitude larger than predicted by perturbation theory, and is a $1\% \sim 0.1\%$ effect compared to the non-linear Newtonian scalar gravitational potential. In the red-shift range considered here, the gravito-magnetic effect remains subdominant, without showing any enhancement during a particular phase in the evolution of structures, aside from the continuous growth of non-linearity at low redshift. Although this seems to suggest that, within the $\Lambda$CDM model, no significant gravito-magnetic effects contribute to the non-linear evolution of cosmic structures, i.e. to the dynamics of massive particles, possible observational consequences, e.g. in lensing, deserve further exploration.</description>
