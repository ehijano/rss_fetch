      <title>Multilingual and Multi-Accent Jailbreaking of Audio LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) have significantly advanced audio understanding but introduce critical security risks, particularly through audio jailbreaks. While prior work has focused on English-centric attacks, we expose a far more severe vulnerability: adversarial multilingual and multi-accent audio jailbreaks, where linguistic and acoustic variations dramatically amplify attack success. In this paper, we introduce Multi-AudioJail, the first systematic framework to exploit these vulnerabilities through (1) a novel dataset of adversarially perturbed multilingual/multi-accent audio jailbreaking prompts, and (2) a hierarchical evaluation pipeline revealing that how acoustic perturbations (e.g., reverberation, echo, and whisper effects) interacts with cross-lingual phonetics to cause jailbreak success rates (JSRs) to surge by up to +57.25 percentage points (e.g., reverberated Kenyan-accented attack on MERaLiON). Crucially, our work further reveals that multimodal LLMs are inherently more vulnerable than unimodal systems: attackers need only exploit the weakest link (e.g., non-English audio inputs) to compromise the entire model, which we empirically show by multilingual audio-only attacks achieving 3.1x higher success rates than text-only attacks. We plan to release our dataset to spur research into cross-modal defenses, urging the community to address this expanding attack surface in multimodality as LALMs evolve.</description>

      <title>Token Pruning in Audio Transformers: Optimizing Performance and Decoding Patch Importance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across various computer vision tasks, but their high computational cost remains a challenge. Token pruning has been proposed to reduce this cost by selectively removing less important tokens. While effective in vision tasks by discarding non-object regions, applying this technique to audio tasks presents unique challenges, as distinguishing relevant from irrelevant regions in time-frequency representations is less straightforward. In this study, for the first time, we applied token pruning to ViT-based audio classification models using Mel-spectrograms and analyzed the trade-offs between model performance and computational cost: TopK token pruning can reduce MAC operations of AudioMAE and AST by 30-40%, with less than a 1% drop in classification accuracy. Our analysis reveals that while high-intensity tokens contribute significantly to model accuracy, low-intensity tokens remain important. In particular, they play a more critical role in general audio classification tasks than in speech-specific tasks.</description>

      <title>AIM: Acoustic Inertial Measurement for Indoor Drone Localization and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Acoustic Inertial Measurement (AIM), a one-of-a-kind technique for indoor drone localization and tracking. Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR). We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than commercial UWB-based systems in complex indoor scenarios, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS settings. We further demonstrate that AIM can be extended to support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts without loss of accuracy by deploying distributed microphone arrays.</description>

      <title>ICSD: An Open-source Dataset for Infant Cry and Snoring Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection and analysis of infant cry and snoring events are crucial tasks within the field of audio signal processing. While existing datasets for general sound event detection are plentiful, they often fall short in providing sufficient, strongly labeled data specific to infant cries and snoring. To provide a benchmark dataset and thus foster the research of infant cry and snoring detection, this paper introduces the Infant Cry and Snoring Detection (ICSD) dataset, a novel, publicly available dataset specially designed for ICSD tasks. The ICSD comprises three types of subsets: a real strongly labeled subset with event-based labels annotated manually, a weakly labeled subset with only clip-level event annotations, and a synthetic subset generated and labeled with strong annotations. This paper provides a detailed description of the ICSD creation process, including the challenges encountered and the solutions adopted. We offer a comprehensive characterization of the dataset, discussing its limitations and key factors for ICSD usage. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on the ICSD dataset to establish baseline systems and offer insights into the main factors when using this dataset for ICSD research. Our goal is to develop a dataset that will be widely adopted by the community as a new open benchmark for future ICSD research.</description>

      <title>SAV-SE: Scene-aware Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement with Selective State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speech enhancement plays an essential role in various applications, and the integration of visual information has been demonstrated to bring substantial advantages. However, the majority of current research concentrates on the examination of facial and lip movements, which can be compromised or entirely inaccessible in scenarios where occlusions occur or when the camera view is distant. Whereas contextual visual cues from the surrounding environment have been overlooked: for example, when we see a dog bark, our brain has the innate ability to discern and filter out the barking noise. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel task, i.e. SAV-SE. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposal to use rich contextual information from synchronized video as auxiliary cues to indicate the type of noise, which eventually improves the speech enhancement performance. Specifically, we propose the VC-S$^2$E method, which incorporates the Conformer and Mamba modules for their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments are conducted on public MUSIC, AVSpeech and AudioSet datasets, where the results demonstrate the superiority of VC-S$^2$E over other competitive methods. We will make the source code publicly available. Project demo page: https://AVSEPage.github.io/</description>

      <title>DGSNA: prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To ensure the reliable operation of speech systems across diverse environments, noise addition methods have emerged as the prevailing solution. However, existing methods offer limited coverage of real-world noisy scenes and depend on pre-existing scene-based information and noise. This paper presents prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition (DGSNA), a novel noise addition methodology that integrates Dynamic Generation of Scene-based Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Speech (SNAS). This integration facilitates automated scene-based noise addition by transforming clean speech into various noise environments, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of diverse noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSNA significantly enhances the robustness of speech recognition and keyword spotting models across various noise conditions, achieving a relative improvement of up to 11.21%. Furthermore, DGSNA can be effectively integrated with other noise addition methods to enhance performance. Our implementation and demonstrations are available at https://dgsna.github.io.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Spike Encoding Methods for Environmental Sound Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising approach to reduce energy consumption and computational demands, making them particularly beneficial for embedded machine learning in edge applications. However, data from conventional digital sensors must first be converted into spike trains to be processed using neuromorphic computing technologies. The classification of environmental sounds presents unique challenges due to the high variability of frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events. Despite these challenges, most studies on spike-based audio encoding focus on speech processing, leaving non-speech environmental sounds underexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of widely used spike encoding techniques, evaluating their effectiveness on the ESC-10 dataset. By understanding the impact of encoding choices on environmental sound processing, researchers and practitioners can select the most suitable approach for real-world applications such as smart surveillance, environmental monitoring, and industrial acoustic analysis. This study serves as a benchmark for spike encoding in environmental sound classification, providing a foundational reference for future research in neuromorphic audio processing.</description>

      <title>Medical Spoken Named Entity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to extract named entities from speech and categorise them into types like person, location, organization, etc. In this work, we present VietMed-NER - the first spoken NER dataset in the medical domain. To our knowledge, our Vietnamese real-world dataset is the largest spoken NER dataset in the world regarding the number of entity types, featuring 18 distinct types. Furthermore, we present baseline results using various state-of-the-art pre-trained models: encoder-only and sequence-to-sequence; and conduct quantitative and qualitative error analysis. We found that pre-trained multilingual models generally outperform monolingual models on reference text and ASR output and encoders outperform sequence-to-sequence models in NER tasks. By translating the transcripts, the dataset can also be utilised for text NER in the medical domain in other languages than Vietnamese. All code, data and models are publicly available: https://github.com/leduckhai/MultiMed/tree/master/VietMed-NER.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Can Transcribe Speech in Multi-Talker Scenarios with Versatile Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings. The code, model, and samples are available at https://github.com/cuhealthybrains/MT-LLM.</description>
