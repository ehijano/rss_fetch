      <title>An innovating approach to teaching applied to database design. Improvement of Action Learning in Lifelong Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For now 10 years, the Action Learning has allowed employees of University of Angers, private and public Companies to be initiated with the design of database, on projects financed by professional structures. These innovating training periods are carried out within the framework of the University College of Further Education of the University of Angers. Database design is a process initially reserved to the professional data processing specialists, coming from French Level-2 technological courses (2-year degrees) or Engineer Schools (Master). The pedagogical model of technological courses has integrated for more than 20 years transverse semester projects, in order to give the students the opportunity to apply newly acquired knowledge, coordinated by teachers. Action Learning requires teachers to assume the role of supervisors for the project management. The objective of Action Learning is to transmit not only knowledge from teachers, but also the experience of consultants to trainees having no competence in data processing, but who have the knowledge of their business process. The present paper shows that Action Learning puts together the factors for success of French technological courses, the adaptability of pedagogy provided to the vocational training, and finally the competence of service provider, Keeping the best parts of those three complementary approaches makes it possible for this kind of formation to achieve teaching and professional, assessable and long lasting goals. Action Learning belongs to the French policy that aims to improve the volume and the quality of the contracts between Universities and companies.</description>

      <title>Discovering High-utility Sequential Rules with Increasing Utility Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utility-driven mining is an essential task in data science, as it can provide deeper insight into the real world. High-utility sequential rule mining (HUSRM) aims at discovering sequential rules with high utility and high confidence. It can certainly provide reliable information for decision-making because it uses confidence as an evaluation metric, as well as some algorithms like HUSRM and US-Rule. However, in current rule-growth mining methods, the linkage between HUSRs and their generation remains ambiguous. Specifically, it is unclear whether the addition of new items affects the utility or confidence of the former rule, leading to an increase or decrease in their values. Therefore, in this paper, we formulate the problem of mining HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio. To address this, we introduce a novel algorithm called SRIU for discovering all HUSRs with an increasing utility ratio using two distinct expansion methods, including left-right expansion and right-left expansion. SRIU also utilizes the item pair estimated utility pruning strategy (IPEUP) to reduce the search space. Moreover, for the two expansion methods, two sets of upper bounds and corresponding pruning strategies are introduced. To enhance the efficiency of SRIU, several optimizations are incorporated. These include utilizing the Bitmap to reduce memory consumption and designing a compact utility table for the mining procedure. Finally, extensive experimental results from both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, to better assess the quality of the generated sequential rules, metrics such as confidence and conviction are employed, which further demonstrate that SRIU can improve the relevance of mining results.</description>

      <title>High-utility Sequential Rule Mining Utilizing Segmentation Guided by Confidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the domain of data mining, one critical objective is the discovery of sequential rules with high utility. The goal is to discover sequential rules that exhibit both high utility and strong confidence, which are valuable in real-world applications. However, existing high-utility sequential rule mining algorithms suffer from redundant utility computations, as different rules may consist of the same sequence of items. When these items can form multiple distinct rules, additional utility calculations are required. To address this issue, this study proposes a sequential rule mining algorithm that utilizes segmentation guided by confidence (RSC), which employs confidence-guided segmentation to reduce redundant utility computation. It adopts a method that precomputes the confidence of segmented rules by leveraging the support of candidate subsequences in advance. Once the segmentation point is determined, all rules with different antecedents and consequents are generated simultaneously. RSC uses a utility-linked table to accelerate candidate sequence generation and introduces a stricter utility upper bound, called the reduced remaining utility of a sequence, to address sequences with duplicate items. Finally, the proposed RSC method was evaluated on multiple datasets, and the results demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>COL-Trees: Efficient Hierarchical Object Search in Road Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Location-based services rely heavily on efficient methods that search for relevant points-of-interest (POIs) near a given location. A k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) query is one such example that finds the k closest POIs from an agent's location. While most existing techniques focus on retrieving nearby POIs for a single agent, these search heuristics do not translate to many other applications. For example, Aggregate k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) queries require POIs that are close to multiple agents. k Farthest Neighbor (kFN) queries require POIs that are the antithesis of nearest. Such problems naturally benefit from a hierarchical approach, but existing methods rely on Euclidean-based heuristics, which have diminished effectiveness in graphs such as road networks. We propose a novel data structure, COL-Tree (Compacted Object-Landmark Tree), to address this gap by enabling efficient hierarchical graph traversal using a more accurate landmark-based heuristic. We then present query algorithms that utilize COL-Trees to efficiently answer AkNN, kFN, and other queries. In our experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that our techniques significantly outperform existing approaches, achieving up to 4 orders of magnitude improvement. Moreover, this comes at a small pre-processing overhead in both theory and practice.</description>

      <title>SilentWood: Private Inference Over Gradient-Boosting Decision Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient boosting decision forests, used by XGBoost or AdaBoost, offer higher accuracy and lower training times than decision trees for large datasets. Protocols for private inference over decision trees can be used to preserve the privacy of the input data as well as the privacy of the trees. However, naively extending private inference over decision trees to private inference over decision forests by replicating the protocols leads to impractical running times. In this paper, we propose an efficient private decision inference protocol using homomorphic encryption. We present several optimizations that identify and then remove (approximate) duplication between the trees in a forest, thereby achieving significant improvements in communication and computation cost over the naive approach. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first private inference protocol for highly scalable gradient boosting decision forests. Our protocol's (SilentWood) inference time is faster than the baseline of parallel running the RCC-PDTE protocol by Mahdavi et al. by up to 42.5x, and faster than Zama's Concrete ML XGBoost by up to 27.8x, and faster than SoK-GGG's two-party garbled circuit protocol by 2.94x.</description>
