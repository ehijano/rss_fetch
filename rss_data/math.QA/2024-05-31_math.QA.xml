      <title>Yangian for cotangent Lie algebras and spectral $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a canonical quantization of Lie bialgebra structures on the formal power series $\mathfrak{d}[\![t]\!]$ with coefficients in the cotangent Lie algebra $\mathfrak{d} = T^*\mathfrak{g} = \mathfrak{g} \ltimes \mathfrak{g}^*$ to a simple complex Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. We prove that these quantizations produce twists to the natural analog of the Yangian for $\mathfrak{d}$. Moreover, we construct spectral $R$-matrices for these twisted Yangians as compositions of twisting matrices.
  The motivation for the construction of these twisted Yangians over $\mathfrak{d}$ comes from certain 4d holomorphic-topological gauge theory. More precisely, we show that pertubative line operators in this theory can be realized as representations of these Yangians. Moreover, the comultiplications of these Yangians correspond to the monodial structure of the category of line operators.</description>

      <title>On the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for spin chains with simple $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new framework for the nested algebraic Bethe ansatz for a closed, rational spin chain with $\mathfrak{g}$-symmetry for any simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. Starting the nesting process by removing a single simple root from $\mathfrak{g}$, we use the residual $U(1)$ charge and the block Gauss decomposition of the $R$-matrix to derive many standard results in the Bethe ansatz, such as the nesting of Yangian algebras, and the AB commutation relation.</description>

      <title>Binomial ideals in quantum tori and quantum affine spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article targets binomial ideals in quantum tori and quantum affine spaces. First, noncommutative analogs of known results for commutative (Laurent) polynomial rings are obtained, including the following: Under the assumption of an algebraically closed base field, it is proved that primitive ideals are binomial, as are radicals of binomial ideals and prime ideals minimal over binomial ideals. In the case of a quantum torus $\mathcal{T}_{\bf{q}}$, the results are strongest: In this situation, the binomial ideals are parametrized by characters on sublattices of the free abelian group whose group algebra is the center of $\mathcal{T}_{\bf{q}}$; the sublattice-character pairs corresponding to primitive ideals as well as to radicals and minimal primes of binomial ideals are determined. As for occurrences of binomial ideals in quantum algebras: It is shown that cocycle-twisted group algebras of finitely generated abelian groups are quotients of quantum tori modulo binomial ideals. Another appearance is as follows: Cocycle-twisted semigroup algebras of finitely generated commutative monoids, as well as quantum affine toric varieties, are quotients of quantum affine spaces modulo certain types of binomial ideals.</description>

      <title>Extended Baxter relations and QQ-systems for quantum affine algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized Baxter's TQ-relations and the QQ-system are systems of algebraic relations in the category O of representations of the Borel subalgebra of the quantum affine algebra U_q(g^), which we established in our earlier works arXiv:1308.3444 and arXiv:1606.05301. In the present paper, we conjecture a family of analogous relations labeled by elements of the Weyl group W of g, so that the original relations correspond to the identity element. These relations are closely connected to the W-symmetry of q-characters established in arXiv:2211.09779. We prove these relations for all w in W if g has rank two, and we prove the extended TQ-relations if w is a simple reflection. We also generalize our results and conjectures to the shifted quantum affine algebras.</description>

      <title>Topological-Holomorphic ${\mathcal N} =4$ Gauge Theory: From Langlands Duality of Holomorphic Invariants to Mirror Symmetry of Quasi-topological Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a topological-holomorphic twist of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric gauge theory on a four-manifold of the form $M_4=\Sigma_1 \times \Sigma_2$ with Riemann surfaces $\Sigma_{1,2}$, and unravel the mathematical implications of its physics. In particular, we consider different linear combinations of the resulting scalar supercharges under $S$-duality, where this will allow us to derive novel topological and holomorphic invariants of $M_4$ and their Langlands duals. As the twisted theory can be topological along $\Sigma_1$ whence we can dimensionally reduce it to 2d, via the effective sigma-model on $\Sigma_2$, we can also relate these 4d invariants and their Langlands duals to the mirror symmetry of Higgs bundles and that of quasi-topological strings described by the sheaf of chiral differential operators. As an offshoot, we would be able to obtain a fundamental understanding from 4d gauge theory, why chiral differential operators are purely perturbative objects.</description>

      <title>Meromorphic CFTs have central charges c = 8$\mathbb{N}$: a proof based on the MLDE approach and Rademacher series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we present a simple and elementary proof that meromorphic conformal field theories (CFTs) have central charges of the form: $c=8N$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}$ (the set of natural numbers) using the modular linear differential equations (MLDEs) approach. We first set up the 1-character MLDE for arbitrary value of the Wronskian index: $\ell$. From this we get the general form of the meromorphic CFT's character. We then study its modular transformations and the asymptotic value of it's Fourier coefficients -- using Rademacher series -- to conclude that odd values of $\ell$ make the character in-admissible implying that the central charge for admissible character has to be a multiple of 8.</description>

      <title>Non-commutative divergence and the Turaev cobracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16566v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The divergence map, an important ingredient in the algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a connected oriented compact surface with boundary, is reformulated in the context of non-commutative geometry using a flat connection on the space of 1-forms on a formally smooth associative algebra. We then extend this construction to the case of associative algebras with any finite cohomological dimension, which allows us to give a similar algebraic description of the Turaev cobracket on a closed surface. We also look into a relation between the Satoh trace and the divergence map on a free Lie algebra via geometry over Lie operad.</description>
