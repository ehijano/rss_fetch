      <title>On the Hyperbolic Sombor Index and Its Counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ with edge set $E$, let $d(w)$ denote the degree of a vertex $w$ in $G$. The hyperbolic Sombor index of $G$ is defined by $$HSO(G)=\sum_{uv\in E}(\min\{d(u),d(v)\})^{-1}\sqrt{(d(u))^2+(d(v))^2}.$$ If $\min\{d(u),d(v)\}$ is replaced with $\max\{d(u),d(v)\}$ in the formula of $HSO(G)$, then the complementary diminished Sombor (CDSO) index is obtained. For two non-adjacent vertices $v$ and $w$ of $G$, the graph obtained from $G$ by adding the edge $vw$ is denoted by $G+vw$. In this paper, we attempt to correct some inaccuracies in the recent work [J. Barman, S. Das, Geometric approach to degree-based topological index: hyperbolic Sombor index, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 95 (2026) 63-94]. We establish a sufficient condition under which $HSO(G+vw) &gt; HSO(G)$ holds, and also provide a sufficient condition guaranteeing $HSO(G+vw) &lt; HSO(G)$. In addition, we give a lower bound on $HSO(G)$ in terms of the order and size of $G$. Furthermore, we obtain similar results for the CDSO index.</description>

      <title>Minimal Graph Embeddings via Point Deletions in Steiner triple systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game Nofil is a two-player combinatorial game in which players take turns marking points of a design such that the set of marked points does not contain a block. Equivalently, we can think of the points as being deleted from the design and points that are on singleton sets can no longer be marked. Every game play eventually results in the design becoming a graph. Previous work has shown that every graph is reachable from some Steiner triple system (STS), although the order of the constructed STS is often far from the known lower bounds. In this paper we give embeddings of complete graphs and star graphs into a $\STS$ that is minimal or very nearly meets the bounds. We further discuss possible minimal embeddings of empty graphs, paths, and cycles.</description>

      <title>Deduction with $k$ moves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deduction game may be thought of as a variant on the classical game of cops and robber in which the cops (searchers) aim to capture an invisible robber (evader); each cop is allowed to move at most once, and cops situated on different vertices cannot communicate to co-ordinate their strategy. In this paper, we extend the deduction game to allow each searcher to make $k$ moves, where $k$ is a fixed positive integer. We consider the value of the $k$-move deduction number on several classes of graphs including paths, cycles, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, and Cartesian and strong products of paths.</description>

      <title>Bounded ratios for Lorentzian matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multiplicative inequalities among entries of Lorentzian matrices, referred to as bounded ratios. These inequalities can be viewed as generalizations of the classical Alexandrov--Fenchel inequalities for mixed volumes. Our main structural result identifies the cone of all bounded ratios on Lorentzian matrices with the dual of the cut cone, a finitely generated integral polyhedral cone extensively studied in metric geometry and graph theory. We examine in detail the pentagonal ratio, which first appears for Lorentzian matrices of size at least five. For Lorentzian matrices of size three, we determine the optimal bounding constants across the entire cone of bounded ratios, obtaining an explicit entropy-like formula. We conjecture that any normalized bounded ratio is, in fact, bounded by 2.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal roots, quantum Hafnians, and generalized Rothe diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $U$ be a set of positive roots of type $ADE$, and let $\Omega_U$ be the set of all maximum cardinality orthogonal subsets of $U$. For each element $R \in \Omega_U$, we define a generalized Rothe diagram whose cardinality we call the level, $\rho(R)$, of $R$. We define the generalized quantum Hafnian of $U$ to be the generating function of $\rho$, regarded as a $q$-polynomial in $U$. Several widely studied algebraic and combinatorial objects arise as special cases of these constructions, and in many cases, $\Omega_U$ has the structure of a graded partially ordered set with rank function $\rho$. A motivating example of the construction involves a certain set of $k^2$ roots in type $D_{2k}$, where the elements of $\Omega_U$ correspond to permutations in $S_k$, the generalized Rothe diagrams are the traditional Rothe diagrams associated to permutations, the level of a permutation is its length, the generalized quantum Hafnian is the $q$-permanent, and the partial order is the Bruhat order. We exhibit many other natural examples of this construction, including one involving perfect matchings, two involving labelled Fano planes, and one involving the invariant cubic form in type $E_6$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a formula for a $q$-analogue of Boyadzhiev-Mneimneh-type binomial sums of finite multi-polylogarithms. In the limit as $q\to 1$, this formula reduces to an identity equivalent to the Sakugawa-Seki identities. We also give a formula for Boyadzhiev-Mneimneh-type sums corresponding to the Cauchy binomial theorem.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue bounds for combinatorial Laplacians and an application to random complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes new eigenvalue bounds for combinatorial Laplacians of simplicial complexes, extending previous results for flag complexes by Lew (2024) and general complexes by Shukla and Yogeshwaran (2020). Using elementary matrix-theoretic methods, we derive lower bounds for the eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian in terms of the graph Laplacian spectrum and combinatorial parameters that measure the deviation from a flag complex. As a consequence, we obtain upper bounds on the dimension of cohomology groups. We also generalize an eigenvalue comparison inequality between a simplicial complex and its subcomplexes to arbitrary eigenvalues. As an application of the dimension bounds, we refine a result by Kahle (2007) on the vanishing of cohomology and connectivity in the neighborhood complex of the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Andrews and EI Bachraoui obtained several iden tities on two-colored partitions. While solving open problems they posed, Chen and Zhou derived a number of identities using analytic methods and asked for combinatorial proofs.

      <title>Rook placements and orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25106v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n\times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space consisting of all $n\times m$ complex matrices, and let $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n\times m}]$ be its coordinate ring. For $0\le r\le\min\{m,n\}$, we apply the orbit harmonics method to the finite matrix loci $\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r}$ of rook placements with exactly $r$ rooks, yielding a graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We find one signed and two sign-free graded character formulae for $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$. We also exhibit some applications of these formulae, such as proving a concise presentation of $R(\mathcal{Z}_{n,m,r})$, and proving some module injections and isomorphisms. Some of our techniques are still valid for involution matrix loci.</description>

      <title>A Tight Lower Bound on Cubic Vertices and Upper Bounds on Thin and Non-thin edges in Planar Braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a subset $X$ of the vertex set $\VV(\GG)$ of a graph $\GG$, we denote the set of edges of $\GG$ which have exactly one end in $X$ by $\partial(X)$ and refer to it as the cut of $X$ or edge cut $\partial(X)$. A graph $\GG=(\VV,\EE)$ is called matching covered if $\forall e \in \EE(\GG), ~\exists \text{a perfect matching }M \text{ of }\GG \text{ s. t. } e \in M$. A cut $C$ of a matching covered graph $\GG$ is a separating cut if and only if, given any edge $e$, there is a perfect matching $M_{e}$ of $\GG$ such that $e \in M_{e}$ and $|C \cap M_{e}| = 1$. A cut $C$ in a matching covered graph $\GG$ is a tight cut of $\GG$ if $|C \cap M| = 1$ for every perfect matching $M$ of $\GG$. For, $X, Y \subseteq \VV(\GG)$, we denote the set of edges of $\EE(\GG)$ which have one endpoint in $X$ and the other endpoint in $Y$ by $E[X,Y]$. Let $\partial(X)=E[X,\overline{X}]$ be an edge cut, where $\overline{X}=\VV(\GG) \setminus X$. An edge cut is trivial if $|X|=1$ or $|\overline{X}|=1$. A matching covered graph, which is free of nontrivial tight cuts, is a brace if it is bipartite and is a brick if it is non-bipartite. An edge $e$ in a brace $\GG$ is \emph{thin} if, for every tight cut $\partial(X)$ of $\GG - e$, $|X| \le 3$ or $|\overline{X}| \le 3$.
  Carvalho, Lucchesi and Murty conjectured that there exists a positive constant $c$ such that every brace $\GG$ has $c|\VV(\GG)|$ thin edges \cite{DBLP:journals/combinatorics/LucchesiCM15}. He and Lu \cite{HE2025153} showed a lower bound of thin edges in a brace in terms of the number of cubic vertices. We asked whether any planar brace exists that does not contain any cubic vertices. We answer negatively by showing that such set of planar braces is empty. We have been able to show a quantitively tight lower bound on the number of cubic vertices in a planar brace. We have proved tight upper bounds of nonthin edges and thin edges in a planar brace.</description>

      <title>Voronoi Games on the Discrete Hypercube: Four-Player Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a four-player game on the discrete hypercube $Q_n = \{0,1\}^n$, where each of the four players has chosen a single vertex of the hypercube. Such a position is called a profile. Imagine there is a voter at every vertex, and each voter gives their vote to whichever player is closest to them, in terms of Hamming distance. If multiple players are tied for this smallest distance, the vote is divided equally between them. The score of a player is the total number of votes they get. (This has a natural interpretation in terms of voting theory: imagine there are $n$ binary issues and that voters are uniformly distributed in their positions on these issues, and view the players as political candidates competing for vote share.) We say that a profile is an equilibrium if no player can strictly increase their score by moving to a different vertex, while the other players maintain their original positions. Moreover, a profile is balanced if, in each of the $n$ coordinates, two players have chosen 0, and two players have chosen 1. We prove that a four-player profile is an equilibrium if and only if it is balanced, proving a conjecture of Day and Johnson.</description>

      <title>Substring compatibility of permutation statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permutation statistic is substring-compatible if its value on a permutation determines its value on every substring of that permutation. We construct the substring coalgebra of such a statistic, an analog of the shuffle algebra of a shuffle-compatible statistic introduced by Gessel and Zhuang. Furthermore, we show that for substring-compatible statistics that also satisfy a weak form of shuffle compatibility, the shuffle algebra and substring coalgebra can be combined to yield a Hopf algebra. Finally, we conjecture that the only nontrivial permutation statistics that are both shuffle-compatible and substring-compatible are the descent set, the peak set, and the valley set, and we describe our progress towards proving this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Covering large-dimensional Euclidean spaces by random translates of a given convex body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the minimum density of a covering of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ by Euclidean unit balls as $n\to\infty$ is a major open problem, with the best known results being the lower bound of $\left(\mathrm{e}^{-3/2}+o(1)\right)n$ by Coxeter, Few and Rogers [Mathematika 6, 1959] and the upper bound of $\left(1/2+o(1) \right)n \ln n$ by Dumer [Discrete Comput. Geom. 38, 2007].
  We prove that there are ball coverings of $\mathbb{R}^n$ attaining the asymptotically best known density $\left(1/2+o(1) \right)n \ln n$ such that, additionally, every point of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is covered at most $\left(1.79556... + o(1)\right) n \ln n$ times. This strengthens the result of Erd\H{o}s and Rogers [Acta Arith. 7, 1961/62] who had the maximum multiplicity at most $\left(\mathrm{e} + o(1)\right) n \ln n$.
  On the other hand, we show that the method that was used for the best known ball coverings (when one takes a random subset of centres in a fundamental domain of a suitable lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and extends this periodically) fails to work if the density is less than $(1/2+o(1))n\ln n$; in fact, this result remains true if we replace the ball by any convex body $K$. Also, we observe that a ``worst'' convex body $K$ here is a cube, for which the packing density coming from random constructions is only $(1+o(1))n\ln n$.</description>

      <title>The Szeged Index of Power Graph of Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Szeged index of a graph is an invariant with several applications in chemistry. The power graph of a finite group $G$ is a graph having vertex set as $G$ in which two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $v=u^m$ or $u=v^n$ for some $m,n\in \mathbb{N}$. In this paper, we first obtain a formula for the Szeged index of the generalized join of graphs. As an application, we obtain the Szeged index of the power graph of the finite cyclic group $\mathbb Z_n$ for any $n&gt;2$. We further obtain a relation between the Szeged index of the power graph of $\mathbb Z_n$ and the Szeged index of the power graph of the dihedral group $\mathrm{D}_n$. We also provide SAGE codes for evaluating the Szeged index of the power graph of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathrm{D}_n$ at the end of this paper.</description>

      <title>Degree Sum Conditions for Graph Rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sufficient conditions for the generic rigidity of a graph $G$ expressed in terms of (i) its minimum degree $\delta(G)$, or (ii) the parameter $\eta(G)=\min_{uv\notin E}(\deg(u)+\deg(v))$. For each case, we seek the smallest integers $f(n,d)$ (resp.\ $g(n,d)$) such that every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq f(n,d)$ (resp.\ $\eta(G)\geq g(n,d)$) is rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$. Krivelevich, Lew, and Michaeli conjectured that there is a constant $K&gt;0$ such that $f(n,d)\leq \frac{n}{2}+Kd$ for all pairs $n,d$. We give an affirmative answer to this conjecture by proving that $K=1$ suffices. For $n\geq 29d$, we obtain the exact result $f(n,d)=\lceil\frac{n+d-2}{2} \rceil$. Next, we prove that $g(n,d)\leq n+3d$ for all pairs $n,d$, and establish $g(n,d)=n+d-2$ when $n\geq d(d+2)$. For $d=2,3,$ we determine the exact values of $f(n,d)$ and $g(n,d)$ for all $n$, confirming another conjecture of Krivelevich, Lew, and Michaeli in these low-dimensional special cases. As an application, we prove that the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n,1/2)$ is a.a.s.\ rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $d=d(n)\sim \frac{7}{32} n$. This result provides the first linear lower bound for $d(n)$, and it answers a question of Peled and Peleg.</description>

      <title>The complex of $r$-co-connected subgraphs, chordality and Fr\"oberg's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of pure simplicial complexes, called the $r$-co-connected complex of $G$ with respect to $A$, $\Sigma_r(A,G)$, where $r\geq 1$ is a natural number, $G$ is a simple graph, and $A$ is a subset of vertices. Interestingly, when $A$ is empty, this complex is precisely the Alexander dual of the $r$-independence complex of $G$. We focus on uncovering the relationship between the topological and combinatorial properties of the complex and the algebraic and homological properties of the Stanley-Reisner ideal of the dual complex. First, we prove that $\Sigma_r(A,G)$ is vertex decomposable whenever the induced subgraph $G[A]$ is connected and nonempty, yielding a versatile deletion-link calculus for higher independence via Alexander duality. Furthermore, when $A=\emptyset$ and $r \ge 2$, we establish that for several significant classes of graphs - including chordal, co-chordal, cographs, cycles, complements of cycles, and certain grid graphs - the properties of vertex decomposability, shellability, and Cohen-Macaulayness are equivalent and precisely characterized by the co-chordality of the associated clutter $\mathrm{Con}_r(G)$. These results extend Fr\"oberg's theorem to the setting of $r$-connected ideals for these graph classes and motivate a conjecture concerning the linear resolution property of $r$-connected ideals in general. We also construct examples separating shellability from vertex decomposability.</description>

Abstract: We define the $r\textit{-Kneser Ramsey number}$ $R^{\textrm{KG}}_{r}(s, t)$ as the minimum integer $n$ such that every red/blue edge-coloring of the Kneser graph $\textrm{KG}(n,r)$ contains a red $s$-clique or a blue $t$-clique. We obtain general bounds on the numbers $R^{\textrm{KG}}_{r}(s, t)$, and make progress on two related Ramsey-type problems, one raised by Holmsen, Hrusak, and Rold\'an-Pensado, and the other posted by P\'alv\"olgyi.</description>

      <title>Modular Periodicity of Random Initialized Recurrences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical studies of the Fibonacci sequence focus on its periodicity modulo m (the Pisano periods) with canonical initialization. We investigate instead the complete periodic structure arising from all m^2 possible initializations in $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. We discover perfect chiral symmetry between the Fibonacci recurrence $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ and its parity transform $a_n = -a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$, and observe fractal self-similarity in the extension from prime to prime power moduli. Additionally, we classify prime moduli due to their periodicity, and show that they exhibit weight preservation under modular extension. Furthermore, we define a minima distribution $P(n)$ governed by Lucas ratios, which satisfies the symmetric relation $P(n)=P(1-n)$. For cyclotomic recurrences, we conjecture explicit counting functions for the number of distinct periods, with connections to necklace enumeration. These findings suggest potential links to Viswanath's random recurrence, modular forms and $L$-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show equivalences between several high-dimensional problems in extremal combinatorics and parallel repetition of multiplayer (multiprover) games over large answer alphabets. This extends the forbidden-subgraph technique, previously studied by Verbitsky (Theoretical Computer Science 1996), Feige and Verbitsy (Combinatorica 2002), and H\k{a}z{\l}a , Holenstein and Rao (2016), to all $k$-player games, and establishes new connections to problems in combinatorics. We believe that these connections may help future progress in both fields.</description>

      <title>The Dual Burnside Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Burnside process is a classical Markov chain for sampling uniformly from group orbits. We introduce the dual Burnside process, obtained by interchanging the roles of group elements and states. This dual chain has stationary law $\pi(g)\propto |X_g|$, is reversible, and admits a matrix factorization $Q=AB$, $K=BA$ with the classical Burnside kernel $K$. As a consequence the two chains share all nonzero eigenvalues and have mixing times that differ by at most one step. We further establish universal Doeblin floors, orbit and conjugacy-class lumpings, and transfer principles between $Q$ and $K$. We analyze explicit examples: the value-permutation model $S_k$ acting on $[k]^n$ and the coordinate-permutation model $S_n$ acting on $[k]^n$. These results show that the dual chain provides both a conceptual mirror to the classical Burnside process and practical advantages for symmetry-aware Markov chain Monte Carlo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly regular graphs are regular graphs with a constant number of common neighbours between adjacent vertices, and a constant number of common neighbours between non-adjacent vertices. These graphs have been of great interest over the last few decades and often give rise to interesting groups of automorphisms. In this paper we take a reverse approach, and leverage strong classification results on rank four permutation groups to classify the strongly regular graphs which yield such groups as a group of automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Minimizing point configurations for tensor product energies on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study point configurations on the torus $\mathbb T^d$ that minimize interaction energies with tensor product structure which arise naturally in the context of discrepancy theory and quasi-Monte Carlo integration. Permutation sets on $\mathbb T^2$ and Latin hypercube sets in higher dimensions (i.e. sets whose projections onto coordinate axes are equispaced points) are natural candidates to be energy minimizers. We show that such point configurations that have only one distance in the vector sense minimize the energy for a wide range of potentials, in other words, such sets satisfy a tensor product version of universal optimality. This applies, in particular, to three- and five-point Fibonacci lattices. We also characterize all lattices with this property and exhibit some non-lattice sets of this type. In addition, we obtain several further structural results about global and local minimizers of tensor product energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multidimensional codes capable of correcting a burst error of weight at most $2$. When two positions are in error, the burst limits their relative position. We study three such limitations: the $L_\infty$ distance between the positions is bounded, the $L_1$ distance between the positions is bounded, or the two positions are on an axis-parallel line with bounded distance between them. In all cases we provide explicit code constructions, and compare their excess redundancy to a lower bound we prove.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12501v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Webs give a diagrammatic calculus for spaces of tensor invariants. We introduce hourglass plabic graphs as a new avatar of webs, and use these to give the first rotation-invariant $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_4)$-web basis, a long-sought object. The characterization of our basis webs relies on the combinatorics of these new plabic graphs and associated configurations of a symmetrized six-vertex model. We give growth rules, based on a novel crystal-theoretic technique, for generating our basis webs from tableaux and we use skein relations to give an algorithm for expressing arbitrary webs in the basis. We also discuss how previously known rotation-invariant web bases can be unified in our framework of hourglass plabic graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{S}_h$ denote a sphere with $h$ holes. Given a triangulation $G$ of a surface $\mathbb{M}$, we consider the question of when $G$ contains a spanning subgraph $H$ such that $H$ is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_h$. We give a new short proof of a theorem of Nevo and Tarabykin that every triangulation $G$ of the torus contains a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated cylinder. For arbitrary surfaces, we prove that every high facewidth triangulation of a surface with $h$ handles contains a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_{2h}$. We also prove that for every $0 \leq g' &lt; g$ and $w \in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a triangulation of facewidth at least $w$ of a surface of Euler genus $g$ that does not have a spanning subgraph which is a triangulated $\mathbb{S}_{g'}$. Our results are motivated by, and have applications for, rigidity questions in the plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A question at the intersection of Barnette's Hamiltonicity and Neumann-Lara's dicoloring conjecture is: Can every Eulerian oriented planar graph be vertex-partitioned into two acyclic sets? A CAI-partition of an undirected/oriented graph is a partition into a tree/connected acyclic subgraph and an independent set. Consider any plane Eulerian oriented triangulation together with its unique tripartition, i.e. partition into three independent sets. If two of these three sets induce a subgraph G that has a CAI-partition, then the above question has a positive answer. We show that if G is subcubic, then it has a CAI-partition, i.e. oriented planar bipartite subcubic 2-vertex-connected graphs admit CAI-partitions. We also show that series-parallel 2-vertex-connected graphs admit CAI-partitions. Finally, we present a Eulerian oriented triangulation such that no two sets of its tripartition induce a graph with a CAI-partition. This generalizes a result of Alt, Payne, Schmidt, and Wood to the oriented setting.</description>

Abstract: This article resolves two related problems in Ramsey theory on the integers. We show that for any finite coloring of the set of natural numbers, there exist numbers $a$ and $b$ for which the configuration $\{a, b, ab, (a+1)b\}$ is monochromatic. This finding has two main consequences: first, it disproves a conjecture proposed by J. Sahasrabudhe; second, it establishes a variant of the long-standing Hindman's conjecture, which asks for a monochromatic set of the form $\{a, b, ab, a+b\}$.</description>

Abstract: We study two games proposed by Erd\H{o}s, and one game by Bensmail and Mc Inerney, all sharing a common setup: two players alternately colour edges of a complete graph, or in the biased version, they colour $p$ and $q$ edges respectively on their turns, aiming to maximise a graph parameter determined by their respective induced subgraphs. In the unbiased case, we give a first reduction towards confirming the conjecture of Bensmail and Mc Inerney, propose a conjecture for Erd\H{o}s' game on maximum degree, and extend the clique and maximum-degree versions to edge-transitive and regular graphs. In the biased case, the maximum-degree and vertex-capturing games are resolved, and we prove the clique game with $(p,q)=(1,3)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1984, Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits conjectured the following: given a bipartite graph $H$, there exist constants $\beta, C &gt; 0$ such that any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $pn^2\geq C \mathrm{ex}(n, H)$ edges contains at least $\beta n^{\mathrm{v}(H)} p^{\mathrm{e}(H)}$ copies of $H$. We show that edge-gluing preserves the satisfiability of this conjecture under some mild symmetry conditions. Namely, if two graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ satisfy this conjecture, and if furthermore, gluing them along a fixed edge produces a unique graph then the resulting graph satisfies the conjecture as well.
  In the same paper, Erd\H{o}s and Simonovits conjectured a weaker statement: for every $H$, there is some $\alpha, \beta, C &gt; 0$ such that any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $pn^2\geq C n^{1+ \alpha}$ edges contains at least $\beta n^{\mathrm{v}(H)} p^{\mathrm{e}(H)}$ copies of $H$. We show that if $H$ satisfies this conjecture then by gluing several copies of labeled $H$ along the same copy of a subforest of $H$ produces a graph that also satisfies the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Divergent Infinite Series -- Ramanujan's Initial Intuition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</description>

      <title>On a sequence of Kimberling and its relationship to the Tribonacci word</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Clark Kimberling defined an interesting sequence ${\bf B} = 0100101100 \cdots$ of $0$'s and $1$'s by certain inflation rules, and he made a number of conjectures about this sequence and some related ones. In this note we prove his conjectures using, in part, the Walnut theorem-prover. We show how his word is related to the infinite Tribonacci word, and we determine both the subword complexity and critical exponent of $\bf B$.</description>

      <title>An extension of Viennot's shadow to rook placements via orbit harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For fixed positive integers $n,m,r$ with $r \leq \min(n,m)$, let $\mathrm{Mat}_{n \times m}(\mathbb{C})$ be the affine space of $n \times m$ complex matrices with coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]$. We define a homogeneous ideal $I_{n,m,r}$, where the graded quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ carries an action of the group $\mathfrak{S}_n \times \mathfrak{S}_m$ by independent permutations of rows and columns. This quotient ring is obtained by applying the orbit harmonics method to matrix loci corresponding to all rook placements of size at least $r$. We show that the quotient $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$ admits a standard monomial basis, which is determined by extending rook placements to an element in $\mathfrak{S}_{n+m-r}$ and applying Viennot's shadow line avatar of the Schensted correspondence. We also determine the graded $\mathfrak{S}_n\times\mathfrak{S}_m$-module structure of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{x}_{n \times m}]/I_{n,m,r}$.</description>

      <title>Geometry of multidimensional Farey summation algorithm and frieze patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a new geometric approach to subtractive continued fraction algorithms in high dimensions. We adapt a version of Farey summation to the geometric techniques proposed by F. Klein in 1895. More specifically we introduce Farey polyhedra and their sails that generalise respectively Klein polyhedra and their sails, and show similar duality properties of the Farey sail integer invariants. The construction of Farey sails is based on the multidimensional generalisation of the Farey tessellation provided by a modification of the continued fraction algorithm introduced by R. W. J. Meester. We classify Farey polyhedra in the combinatorial terms of prismatic diagrams. Prismatic diagrams extend boat polygons introduced by S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko in the two-dimensional case. As one of the applications of the new theory we get a multidimensional version of Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns. We show that multidimensional frieze patterns satisfy generalised Ptolemy relations.</description>

      <title>Discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature through Jack generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers for random discrete $N$-particle systems with the deformation (inverse temperature) parameter $\theta$, as their size $N$ tends to infinity simultaneously with the inverse temperature going to zero. Our conditions are expressed in terms of the Jack generating functions, and our analysis is based on the asymptotics of the action of Cherednik operators obtained via Hecke relations. We apply the general framework to obtain the LLN for a large class of Markov chains of $N$ nonintersecting particles with interaction of log-gas type, and the LLN for the multiplication of Jack polynomials, as the inverse temperature tends to zero. We express the answer in terms of novel one-parameter deformations of cumulants and their description provided by us recovers previous work by Bufetov--Gorin on quantized free cumulants when $\theta=1$, and by Benaych-Georges--Cuenca--Gorin after a deformation to continuous space of random matrix eigenvalues. Our methods are robust enough to be applied to the fixed temperature regime, where we recover the LLN of Huang.</description>

      <title>The GroebnerWalk.jl package for OSCAR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing Gr\"obner bases is known to have a very high upper bound on computation time with respect to input length. Due to the connection between polyhedral geometry and Gr\"obner bases through the Gr\"obner fan, one can attempt an incremental approach to compute Gr\"obner bases. First computing a Gr\"obner basis with respect to an `easy' term order and transforming that result to a Gr\"obner basis with respect to the desired term order by using information about this polyhedral fan is done by a family of algorithms termed as Gr\"obner walk. We implemented two variants of the Gr\"obner walk in the computer algebra system OSCAR and compared their performance with classical Gr\"obner basis methods already found in OSCAR.</description>

      <title>Quiver superconformal index and giant gravitons: asymptotics and expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study asymptotics of the $d=4$, $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal index for toric quiver gauge theories. Using graph-theoretic and algebraic factorization techniques, we obtain a cycle expansion for the large-$N$ index in terms of the $R$-charge-weighted adjacency matrix. Applying saddle-point techniques at the on-shell $R$-charges, we determine the asymptotic degeneracy in the univariate specialization for $\hat{A}_{m}$, and along the main diagonal for the bivariate index for $\mathcal{N}=4$ and $\hat{A}_{3}$. In these cases we find $\ln |c_{n}| \sim \gamma n^{\frac{1}{2}}+ \beta \ln n + \alpha$ (Hardy-Ramanujan type). We also identify polynomial growth for $dP3$, $Y^{3,3}$ and $Y^{p,0}$, and give numerical evidence for $\gamma$ in further $Y^{p,p}$ examples. Finally, we generalize Murthy's giant graviton expansion via the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and Borodin-Okounkov formula to multi-matrix models relevant for quivers.</description>

      <title>Crystallization of discrete $N$-particle systems at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the global asymptotics of discrete $N$-particle systems with inverse temperature parameter $\theta$ in the high temperature regime. In the first paper, we established necessary and sufficient conditions for the Law of Large Numbers at high temperature in terms of Jack generating functions. In this paper, we derive a functional equation for the moment generating function of the limiting measure, which enables its analysis using analytic tools. We apply this functional equation to compute the densities of the high temperature limits of the pure Jack measures. As a special case, we obtain the high temperature limit of the large fixed-time distribution of the discrete-space $\beta$-Dyson Brownian motion of Gorin-Shkolnikov.
  Two special cases of our densities are the high temperature limits of discrete versions of the G$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Guionnet in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109 (2012), 094102; arXiv:1205.3598], and L$\beta$E, computed by Allez-Bouchaud-Majumdar-Vivo in [J. Phys. A, vol. 46, no. 1 (2013), 015001; arXiv:1209.6171]. Moreover, we prove the following crystallization phenomenon of the particles in the high temperature limit: the limiting measures are uniformly supported on disjoint intervals with unit gaps and their locations correspond to the zeros of explicit special functions with all roots located in the real line. We also show that these zeros correspond to the spectra of certain unbounded Jacobi operators.</description>
