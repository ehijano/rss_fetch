      <title>System-size dependence of charged-particle suppression in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21325v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy partons lose energy while propagating through the hot, strongly interacting medium produced in ultrarelativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions, leading to a suppression of particle production at high transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$). The dependence of this energy loss on the size of the colliding nuclear system has yet to be firmly established experimentally. This Letter presents a systematic study of charged-particle suppression across four different nucleus-nucleus collision systems using nuclear modification factors ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) measured by the CMS Collaboration at the CERN LHC. Previous CMS measurements of $R_\mathrm{AA}$ in oxygen-oxygen, xenon-xenon, and lead-lead collisions are recast with identical $p_\mathrm{T}$ intervals and are complemented by the first measurement of the charged-particle $R_\mathrm{AA}$ in neon-neon collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.36 TeV. The neon-neon data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 0.76 nb$^{-1}$. The $R_\mathrm{AA}$ in all collision systems examined show similar qualitative trends, but have a magnitude which is ordered with the nucleon number A. The $R_\mathrm{AA}$ feature a downward slope at low $p_\mathrm{T}$, a local minimum at around 5$-$7 GeV, and an upward slope with increasing $p_\mathrm{T}$. The $R_\mathrm{AA}$ are also compared in terms of A$^{1/3}$, which is proportional to the nuclear radius. Models including only initial-state nuclear effects fail to reproduce the observed trends, whereas energy loss models reproduce the trends in the region $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\gt$ 9.6 GeV.</description>

      <title>Extending direct measurements of argon nuclear recoils into the sub-keV regime with ReD and ReD+</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct searches for dark matter in the form of WIMPs with argon-based detectors require precise measurements of the ionization yield \Qy\ for nuclear recoils at low energies. Prior to this work, direct experimental data were available only above 6.7 keV, leaving a critical gap in the energy region most relevant for low-mass WIMP searches. The Recoil Directionality (ReD) experiment addressed this limitation by measuring the argon \Qy\ for nuclear recoils between 2 and 10 keV using a dual-phase TPC irradiated with neutrons from a \Cf\ fission source. The results extend existing direct measurements to lower energies, show consistency with previous data above 7 keV, and indicate an enhanced ionization yield at low recoil energies. These measurements provide essential input for next-generation argon-based dark matter searches and directly motivate the upgraded ReD+ phase, designed to further extend sensitivity into the sub-keV recoil-energy regime.</description>

      <title>Development of Micromegas-based Active-Target Time Projection Chamber for Nuclear Astrophysics Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Micromegas-based active-target detector named SAT-TPC (Saha Active Target TPC) has been designed and fabricated at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics. The SAT-TPC was tested with Ar-CO2 (90:10) and Ar-iC4H10 (95:5) at atmospheric pressure. The Micromegas detector was first characterized in a small test chamber to optimize the ratio between the drift and amplification fields to maximise electron transparency. After establishing the optimal operating parameters, the same Micromegas detector was employed as the readout plane of the SAT-TPC prototype. The energy resolution for 55Fe and 241Am was estimated. A straightforward analysis of {\alpha}-particle tracks has been carried out, demonstrating the pad plane's capability to accurately reconstruct the direction and length of trajectories. A hydrodynamic model based on Geant4, Garfield++ and COMSOL was used to emulate the reconstructed {\alpha}-tracks in the active gas volume. The results show good agreement with simulations, confirming the accuracy of the models employed for {\alpha}-particles in Ar-CO2 (90:10) and Ar-iC4H10(95:5) gas.</description>

      <title>Using Neural Networks to Accelerate TALYS-2.0 Nuclear Reaction Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent efforts to improve the predictability of TALYS-2.0 calculated charged-particle residual product cross sections have focused on adjusting parameters related to the optical model potential and pre-equilibrium process. Although adjusted TALYS-2.0 outputs show marked improvements in agreement with experimental data over the default parameters, the procedure is generally time-consuming due to the need for sequential TALYS-2.0 calculations. Since the models and model parameters must be defined and constrained prior to adjustment, we show in this work that an artificial neural network can serve as a surrogate model to successfully predict TALYS-2.0 outputs within this domain of input parameters. No practical differences were observed in the trained model's performance between uniform random, Latin hypercube and Sobol sequence sampling for generating the training datasets. Once validated, trained neural network models were used to adjust TALYS-2.0 nuclear model parameters, where a multi-parameter fitting procedure was not only feasible but optimal for this process. The neural network approach is &gt;1000x faster at generating residual product cross sections than using TALYS-2.0 directly, and a high-fidelity surrogate model could be implemented with about 1500 TALYS-2.0 files to achieve adjusted cross sections comparable to the previous publication.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Data Needs for Microcalorimetry and Non-destructive Assay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic microcalorimeters are state-of-the-art radiation detectors using superconducting and quantum technologies. They can resolve complex X-ray and low-energy {\gamma}-ray spectra with ultra-high energy resolution of an order of 10 eV at 100 keV, enabling high-precision non-destructive assay (NDA) analysis of nuclear materials containing uranium, plutonium and other actinides. With significant technical advancements in microcalorimetry technology, microcalorimeters are now deployable to end-users such as the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for improved NDA. However, the accuracy of microcalorimetry analysis can be limited by nuclear data. There are several cases that the current nuclear data obtained by conventional radiation detector technologies is not sufficient to support microcalorimetry analysis. To address the growing need for improved nuclear data in microcalorimetry, the U.S. Department of Energy Office of International Nuclear Safeguards hosted a workshop on Microcalorimetry and Nuclear Data (MiND) in June 2023. Microcalorimetry experts and users, and nuclear structure evaluators and managers, and program sponsors attended the workshop with the main objective of identifying a roadmap for priority nuclear data, stakeholders, partnerships, and opportunities. This paper summarizes the outcome of the MiND workshop, including the priority list of nuclear data for microcalorimetry and a multi-laboratory measurement campaign to improve such nuclear data.</description>

      <title>Surrogate neutron-capture studies with fission detection in inverse kinematics at the ESR storage ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NECTAR (Nuclear rEaCTions At storage Rings) experiment at the ESR heavy-ion storage ring at GSI Darmstadt is dedicated to surrogate reaction studies of neutron-induced reactions on heavy nuclei in inverse kinematics. In this work, we report on the implementation and performance of a newly developed fission-fragment detection system integrated into the NECTAR experimental setup. The upgraded detector configuration enables, for the first time in a surrogate experiment, the simultaneous detection of \(\gamma\)-decay residues, multi-neutron-emission residues, and fission fragments. The full setup was used for the first time in an experiment where a stored beam of bare \(^{238}\)U\(^{92+}\) ions at 17.24~MeV/u interacted with a gaseous deuterium target, populating excited \(^{238}\)U and \(^{239}\)U nuclei via the \(^{238}\)U(d,d') and \(^{238}\)U(d,p) reactions. We describe the fission detector geometry, design constraints, and simulation-based efficiency determination. The target-like particle identification and beam-like residue spectra demonstrating the performance of the complete setup are also shown.</description>

      <title>Ab initio calculations of nuclear charge radii across and beyond ${}^{132}$Sn: Putting chiral EFT nuclear interactions to the test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge radii are investigated along the Tin isotopic chain via ab initio Bogoliubov coupled cluster calculations at the singles and doubles level. In addition to the reproduction of absolute radii, the parabolic behavior of isotopic shifts between the N = 50 and N = 82 magic numbers and the kink through ${}^{132}$Sn are shown to provide stringent tests for state-of-the-art chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) inter-nucleon interactions. Indeed, none of the employed fine-tuned interactions can capture all such key characteristics. Eventually, the pronounced sensitivity of the results to the employed Hamiltonian beyond ${}^{132}$Sn provides a unique playground to pin down critical attributes of $\chi$EFT inter-nucleon interactions in the future. This calls for measuring isotopic shifts both towards ${}^{100}$Sn and beyond ${}^{134}$Sn, as well as for performing high-accuracy ab initio calculations of mean-square radii in heavy open-shell nuclei by adding both triples corrections to the many-body wave function and the two-body charge density correction to the operator</description>

      <title>Measurement of the near-threshold J$/\psi$ photoproduction cross section with the CLAS12 experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present measurements of the total and differential cross sections for near-threshold J/$\psi$ photoproduction obtained with the CLAS12 detector at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. The results are based on data collected during the Fall 2018 and Spring 2019 running periods, using electron beams with energies of 10.6 and 10.2 GeV, respectively, scattered off a liquid-hydrogen target. Near-threshold J$/\psi$ photoproduction offers a unique sensitivity to the strong interaction in the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). The energy dependence of the cross section constrains the underlying J$/\psi$ production mechanisms, including multi-gluon exchange and potential baryonic excitations. Additionally, the $t$-dependence of the differential cross section can be related to the transverse spatial distribution of gluons in the proton, providing critical input for theoretical descriptions of the gluonic structure of the proton. An interpretation of the results in terms of the gluon content of the proton is presented, providing new experimental constraints on QCD-inspired models of the proton structure and the role of gluonic degrees of freedom in hadronic mass generation.</description>

      <title>Opportunities for Imaging Light Nuclei with a Second Interaction Region at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will address several outstanding puzzles in modern nuclear physics. Key questions-such as the partonic structure of nucleons and nuclei and the origin of their mass and spin-can be explored through high-energy electron-proton and electron-nucleus collisions. To maximize its scientific reach, the EIC community has advocated for the addition of a second interaction region equipped with a detector complementary to the EIC general purpose collider detector, ePIC. The pre-conceptual design of this interaction region aims to provide a different configuration from the first interaction region, which enhances forward acceptance at very small scattering angles ($\theta \sim 0$ mrad). This machine configuration would significantly benefit exclusive, tagging, and diffractive physics programs, complementing those of the ePIC experiment. In particular, accessing coherent diffractive processes on light nuclei by tagging of the full, intact nucleus is essential for mapping their spatial parton distributions. In this work, we present an exploratory study of the detection capabilities for light nuclei at a second EIC interaction region, with a detailed discussion of the accessible kinematic phase space and its implications for imaging.</description>

      <title>Near-Threshold J/$\psi \to \mu^+\mu^-$ Photoproduction and the Gluonic Gravitational Form Factors of the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the measurement of the two-dimensional differential cross section for near-threshold J/$\psi \to \mu^+\mu^-$ photoproduction from the J/$\psi$-007 experiment in Hall C at Jefferson Lab. Our results agree with the previously published J/$\psi \to e^+e^-$ results. We extract the integrated photoproduction cross section and find no evidence for open-charm contributions. A combined analysis of both decay channels following a Holographic QCD approach yields improved experimental constraints on the gluonic gravitational form factor $\mathcal{C}_g(t)$. Our results agree with recent lattice QCD calculations and we obtain $\mathcal{C}_g(t)$ with a comparable statistical precision to lattice QCD. Our results support a spatial picture where gluons dominate at larger radii with a confining inward pressure. This work provides new input for exploring the mechanical properties of gluons inside the proton.</description>
