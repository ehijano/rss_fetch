      <title>Evaluation of SiC detector performances for energy and timing measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of new detectors based on Silicon Carbide (SiC) is currently a topic of interest within the scientific community. The significant features of SiC make it highly promising for detecting charged particles, neutrons, and $\gamma$/X radiation. In this framework, within the SAMOTHRACE (Sicilian Micro and Nano Technology Research and Innovation Center) ecosystem, an array of new-generation SiC detectors is under development, specifically designed for nuclear and medical investigations using radioactive ion beams. This paper describes the results obtained in the characterization of SiC prototypes regarding energy and timing measurements. A new method, based on coincidence data analysis, is employed to evaluate the timing performances of SiC detectors. The obtained results have been compared with tests performed using a micro-channel plate as a start detector reference for timing measurements.</description>

      <title>Scintillation of liquid nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid nitrogen is commonly used in cryogenic applications and is a promising medium for the direct immersion cooling of sensors used for nuclear and particle physics experiments. The scintillation properties of gaseous nitrogen are well-documented, but little is known about the scintillation of liquid nitrogen. If present, scintillation light from interactions of ambient radioactivity could produce backgrounds for rare event searches such as the direct detection of dark matter. Using a coincidence-tagged alpha decay, we demonstrate that liquid nitrogen exhibits measurable, albeit very faint, scintillation. Assuming the same scintillation wavelength spectrum as gaseous nitrogen, we estimate a relative scintillation yield of $Y_{\text{LN}}/Y^{\text{STP}}_{\text{GN}} = 0.0142 \pm 0.0005\text{(stat)} \pm 0.0030\text{(sys)}$ with respect to gaseous nitrogen at standard temperature and pressure. Considering the average scintillation yield from alpha decays in gaseous nitrogen, this implies a scintillation yield for alpha decays in liquid nitrogen of $Y_{\text{LN}} = 2.39 \pm 0.56$ photons per MeV. To our knowledge this is the first measurement of scintillation in liquid nitrogen.</description>

      <title>Search for Invisible Decay Modes in Nuclear Gamma Cascades of a ${}^{46}$Sc Source Using a CsI (Tl) Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter remains one of the most compelling open questions in modern physics, motivating extensive searches for new light, weakly coupled particles beyond the Standard Model. Numerous experiments have probed a variety of dark matter candidates using diverse detector technologies, yet large regions of parameter space remain unexplored. In this work, we present a novel high-statistics search for invisible decay modes in nuclear $\gamma$ cascades, employing approximately 100~kg of CsI(Tl) scintillators at Texas A\&amp;M University. The key feature of this experiment is the use of a high-activity ${}^{46}$Sc radioactive source combined with a "missing gamma" technique, in which the absence of a photon in a well-identified cascade serves as a signature of new physics. Unlike appearance--disappearance experiments, this approach requires only a single photon conversion into a dark-sector particle, thereby enabling sensitivity to weaker couplings. With approximately 1000~hours of data collected using the current setup, no statistically significant excess was observed, consistent with existing constraints on dark-sector candidates such as axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), dark scalars, and dark photons in the sub-MeV mass range. This result highlights the sensitivity of the missing-gamma technique and motivates the development of a larger-scale detector with improved systematic control to extend dark-sector searches into previously unexplored regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Validation of field cage and cathode for low radioactivity operation with the CYGNO experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter, which is considered to account for approximately the 27% of the Universe's energy-mass content, remains an open issue in modern particle physics along with its composition. The CYGNO Experiment aims to exploit an innovative approach applied to the direct detection search of low energy nuclear recoils possibly induced by cold particle-like dark matter candidates. CYGNO employs a directional detector based on a Time Projection Chamber (TPC) filled with a He:CF$_{4}$ gas mixture and equipped with an optical readout. Currently, the CYGNO Collaboration is constructing the detector demonstrator, CYGNO-04, in Hall F at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). This 0.4 m$^3$ detector has the goal of proving the scalability of the technology and assessing the physics and radiopurity capabilities. Given the low radioactivity requirements, especially in internal components such as field cage and cathode, the reduction of material while keeping the correct electrical behavior is paramount. In this paper, we present the validation of several internal components, mainly focusing on the field cage material and support structure. The tests included geometrical asymmetries in the electric field response, collection efficiency as well as measurement of known physical quantities. A preferred configuration is found with a structure based on Nylon material which supports a PET or Kapton sheet with copper strips deposited on.</description>

      <title>Filling the Gap: Atom Probe Tomography of Porous Structures Enabled by Site Specific SEMGlu Curing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous microstructures, while central to many functional materials, remain difficult to characterize quantitatively by atom probe tomography (APT). Although several strategies have been proposed over the past decade, most remain constrained by significant practical or technical limitations. Here, we introduce an in situ pore filling approach that integrates seamlessly into conventional specimen preparation workflows. The method employs a vacuum compatible resin that is rapidly cured by the electron beam during standard ion beam based preparation, eliminating the need for additional instrumentation or extensive sample handling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a porous SnSe + MXene electrode, a material system otherwise difficult to analyze via APT characterisation. This method offers a robust, accessible solution for extending APT analysis to porous materials</description>

      <title>Method for restoring the orientation of ocean bottom seismometers using distant earthquakes records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for determining the vertical direction relative to the axes of seismometers installed in seafloor observatories. The method is based on the linear relationship between the vertical component of seafloor acceleration and pressure variations at the ocean bottom, which follows directly from Newton's second law and holds within the frequency range of forced oscillations. The method's performance was validated using data from ocean bottom seismometers (accelerometers) and pressure gauges of six S-net stations during three seismic events: Gulf of Alaska Mw 7.9 (23.01.2018), Chignik Mw 8.2 (29.07.2021) and Noto Mw 7.5 (01.01.2024). The results were compared with an independent alternative method, showing discrepancies within 1 degree for most stations. A key advantage of the proposed method is its applicability not only to accelerometers but as well to velocimeters.</description>

      <title>First non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports the first non-zero measurement of a nuclear electric dipole moment using a novel method based on the rate of change of a supercurrent first proposed in 2016~\cite{https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.1604.02152} and fleshed out in this current paper. The theory, experimental concept and implementation are described in detail. The non-zero nuclear electric dipole moment measured with over 1000 hours of data was that of $^{181}$Ta producing a best value $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm0.31_\text{stat})\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}$ and $|d_\text{e}^\text{Ta}|=(3.39\pm3.18)\cdot10^{-32}e\cdot\text{cm}&gt;0$ at 99.985\%CL. There is an uncertainty on the value of overall multiplicative parameters such as the self-inductance of the superconducting circuit ($\pm4\%$), the mutual inductance between the SQUID pickup coil and the sample wire ($\pm15\%$), and the magnitude of the solenoid current ($\pm5\%$). An upper-limit was estimated for the control element, $^{207}$Pb, $|d_\text{e}^\text{Pb}|\lesssim1.2\cdot10^{-31}e\cdot\text{cm}$ at 95\%CL.</description>

      <title>Exploring the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion quality.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Digital Synthetic Wavelength Optical Absolute Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of optical range and time-of-flight are crucial for a variety of high-precision technologies. Competitive optical measurement techniques have been developed that balance precision with accuracy and system complexity. Here, we present a continuous-wave synthetic wavelength interferometry technique that employs digitally tunable electro-optic frequency combs. With a software-defined radio, our approach can dynamically sweep the synthetic wavelength and measure absolute optical range. We demonstrate this digital approach over a free-space optical delay line of 1 m and over an 40 km fiber link. The best obtained precision over the delay line is better than 60 nm (0.2 fs). Through a 40 km fiber spool, this precision degrades to 15 um (50 fs), which is a fractional error on the order of 2e-10 m/m. Our design is simple to implement, and only relies on continuous-wave interference, decreasing system complexity.</description>

      <title>Photon-starved imaging through turbulence at the diffraction limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving diffraction-limited resolution through atmospheric turbulence is a fundamental challenge for ground-based imaging systems, especially in the photon-starved regime. Conventional methods, such as adaptive optics and speckle imaging, struggle to achieve optimal performance when turbulence is severe and photons are limited. We present Turbulence-Aware Poisson Blind Deconvolution (TAP-BD), a framework designed for robust image recovery in these extreme conditions. TAP-BD exploits phase modulations on the incoming photons coupled with physics-informed optimization to extract more information from the available signal than traditional methods. Experimentally, our approach achieves a target PSNR of 24 dB with just tens of noisy measurements, under severe turbulence up to D/r0~24. This robust performance in photon-starved conditions unlocks new capabilities in space situational awareness and remote sensing.</description>

      <title>Neutron capture measurement of the 165Ho at the CSNS Backn facility in the resonance energy region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutron capture yield of 165Ho have been measured at the Back-streaming White neutron beam line (Back-n) of the China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) using a 4{\pi} BaF2 Gamma Total Absorption Facility (GTAF). The resonance shapes in the 1eV to 1.0keV region were analyzed with the Bayesian R-matrix code SAMMY. For 18 s-wave resonances below 100eV, the resonance energy ER, neutron width {\Gamma}n, and radiative width {\Gamma}{\gamma} were extracted. The statistical analyses of the resonance parameters show that the nearest-neighbour level-spacing distribution follows a Wigner-Dyson form with mean spacing D0 = 4.53(3)eV,indicating chaotic compound-nucleus behaviour; Using the extracted parameters, the s-wave neutron strength function for 165Ho was derived to be 10-4S0 = 2.01(1), in excellent agreement with the values reported in both the Atlas of Neutron Resonances and ENDF/B-VIII.0 data.</description>

      <title>THz mixing of high-order harmonics using $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\delta}}$ nanobridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting materials are a key for technologies enabling a large number of devices including THz wave mixers and single photon detectors, though limited at very low temperatures for conventional superconductors. High temperature operation could in principle be offered using cuprate superconductors. However, the complexity of the material in thin film form, the extremely short coherence length and material stability, have hindered the realization of THz devices working at liquid nitrogen temperatures. $YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-{\delta}}$ (YBCO) nanodevices have demonstrated non-linear properties typical of Josephson-like behavior, which have the potential for the mixing of AC signals in the THz range due to the large superconducting energy gap. Here, we present AC Josephson functionalities for terahertz waves utilizing Abrikosov vortex motion in nanoscale-confined fully planar YBCO thin film bridges. We observe Shapiro step-like features in the current voltage characteristics when irradiating the device with monochromatic sub-THz waves (100 GHz to 215 GHz) at 77 K. We further explore these nonlinear effects by detecting THz high-order harmonic mixing for signals from 200 GHz up to 1.4 THz using a local oscillator at 100 GHz. Our results open a path to an easy-fabricated HTS nonlinear nanodevice based on dimensional confinement suitable for terahertz applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01023v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Persistent photon and single-electron emissions - in the form of "electron trains" and localized "hot spots" - have been observed in multiple dual-phase liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), often persisting long after ionizing events. We show that these phenomena are naturally explained by photon-triggered single-electron emission from resistive mixed-oxide films on stainless-steel wires, which behave as leaky capacitors with long RC time constants at LXe temperature. Positive ions landing on these oxides can further enhance local fields and drive Malter-like electron emission. We outline the materials physics (Cr2O3 / Cr2O3-x / Cr(OH)3 mosaics), quantify expected time scales (~1 second under illumination), and demonstrate how small damaged regions with enhanced QE can produce persistent hot spots.</description>

      <title>Bayesian approach for spatial super-resolution of heterodyne wind lidars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wind speed measurements using heterodyne lidars are limited in spatial resolution because of the current signal processing methods. This limit is equal to c $\tau$ ( c is the speed of light and $\tau$ is the laser pulse duration) corresponding to the length of the atmosphere contributing to the wind speed measurement at one distance. To go beyond this limit, we use an inverse problem approach based on a model of the spectrogram (concatenation of periodograms of each range) and prior distributions on our unknowns: backscattering amplitude and wind speed at each range. We apply our inversion method to simulated and experimental spectrograms, demonstrating a gain in resolution by a factor of 2 to 2.5 depending on the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>CHRONOS: Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detector, the Cryogenic sub-Hz cROss torsion-bar detector with quantum NOn-demolition Speed meter (CHRONOS), optimized for the unexplored 0.1-10Hz band bridging the gap between the space-based LISA and future ground-based detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope. CHRONOS combines a ring-cavity Sagnac interferometer with torsion-bar test masses to realize the first quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement of angular momentum in a macroscopic system. By implementing a speed-meter readout in the rotational degree of freedom, CHRONOS coherently cancels quantum radiation-pressure noise and enables sub-Hz observations. We show that detuned power recycling and cavity-length optimization can simultaneously relax technical requirements on both torsion bars and speed meters. Assuming a realistic optical design with a 1m torsion bar, we estimate strain sensitivities of $h \simeq 1 \times 10^{-18}\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$ at 1Hz for detectors with arm lengths of 2.5m, 40m, and 300m. These sensitivities enable (i) direct detection of intermediate-mass black hole binaries up to 380Mpc with ${\rm SNR}=3$, (ii) probing stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds down to $\Omega_{\rm GW} \sim 3.2 \times 10^{-9}$ at 0.2Hz with 5yr accumulation. Furthermore, CHRONOS enables prompt detection of gravity-gradient signals from magnitude-5.5 earthquakes even with a 2.5m prototype. CHRONOS thus opens new opportunities for quantum-limited geophysical observation and multi-band, multi-messenger gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Light shift suppression in a CPT magnetometer using linear polarization and double frequency interrogation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a suppression of the light shift in a Coherent-Population-Trapping (CPT) atomic magnetometer by using linearly polarized light and a differential measurement between magnetic resonances. The radio frequency that creates the optical sidebands for CPT quickly switches between two magnetic sensitive transitions and the magnetic field is extrapolated from the difference of the center frequencies of the magnetic resonances. Light shifts and common drifts like collisional shifts can be suppressed through careful choice of measured resonances and we show the light shift reduction by more than a factor of 20 compared to excitation with circular polarized light. Various limitations to the method are discussed.</description>
