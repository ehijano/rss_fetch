      <title>Turbulence in protoplanetary disks: A systematic analysis of dust settling in 33 disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The level of dust vertical settling and radial dust concentration in disks is of critical importance for understanding the efficiency of planet formation. We present the first uniform analysis of the vertical extent of millimeter dust for a representative sample of 33disks. We used radiative transfer modeling of archival high-angular-resolution (&lt;=0.1") ALMA dust observations of inclined and ringed disks to estimate their vertical dust scale height, which was compared to estimated gas scale heights to characterize the level of vertical sedimentation. In all 23systems for which constraints could be obtained, we find that the outer parts of the disks are vertically settled. 5disks allow for the characterization of the dust scale height both within and outside approximately half the dust disk radius, showing a lower limit on their dust heights at smaller radii. This implies that the ratio between vertical turbulence and the Stokes number, $\alpha_z/\St$, decreases radially in these sources. For 21rings in 15disks, we also constrained the level of radial concentration of the dust, finding that about half of the rings are compatible with strong radial trapping. In most of these rings, vertical turbulence is found to be comparable to or weaker than radial turbulence, which is incompatible with the turbulence generated by the vertical shear instability at these locations. We further used our dust settling constraints to estimate the turbulence level under the assumption that the dust size is limited by fragmentation, finding typical upper limits around $\alpha_\text{frag}\leq10^{-3}$. In a few sources, we find that turbulence cannot be the main source of accretion. In the context of pebble accretion, we identify several disk regions that have upper limits on their dust concentration that would allow core formation to proceed efficiently, even at wide orbital distances outside of 50au.</description>

      <title>Investigating the metallicity dependence of the mass-loss rate relation of red supergiants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs) are cool and evolved massive stars exhibiting enhanced mass loss compared to their main sequence phase, affecting their evolution and fate. However, the theory of the wind-driving mechanism is not well-established and the metallicity dependence has not been determined. We aim to uniformly measure the mass-loss rates of large samples of RSGs in different galaxies with $-0.7\lesssim[Z]\lesssim0$ to investigate whether there is a potential correlation with metallicity. We collected photometry from the ultraviolet to the mid-infrared for all our RSG candidates to construct their spectral energy distribution (SED). Our final sample includes 893 RSG candidates in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), 396 in NGC 6822, 527 in the Milky Way, 1425 in M31, and 1854 in M33. Each SED was modelled using the radiative transfer code DUSTY under the same assumptions to derive the mass-loss rate. The mass-loss rates range from approximately $10^{-9} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to $10^{-5} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ with an average value of $1.5\times10^{-7} \ M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. We provided a new mass-loss rate relation as a function of luminosity and effective temperature for both the SMC and Milky Way and compared our mass-loss rates with those derived in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). The turning point in the mass-loss rate vs. luminosity relation differs by around 0.2 dex between the LMC and SMC. The mass-loss rates of the Galactic RSGs at $\log(L/L_\odot)&lt;4.5$ were systematically lower than those determined in the other galaxies, possibly due to uncertainties in the interstellar extinction. We found 30-40% of the RSGs not to have any dust. The results for M31 and M33 are inconclusive because of source blending at distances above 0.5 Mpc given the resolution of Spitzer. Overall, we found similar mass-loss rates among the galaxies, indicating no strong correlation with metallicity.</description>

      <title>Two Phases of Particle Acceleration of a Solar Flare Associated with in situ Energetic Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How impulsive solar energetic particle (SEP) events are produced by magnetic-reconnection-driven processes during solar flares remains an outstanding question. Here we report a short-duration SEP event associated with an X-class eruptive flare on July 03, 2021, using a combination of remote sensing observations and in situ measurements. The in situ SEPs were recorded by multiple spacecraft including the Parker Solar Probe. The hard X-ray (HXR) light curve exhibits two impulsive periods. The first period is characterized by a single peak with a rapid rise and decay, while the second period features a more gradual HXR light curve with a harder spectrum. Such observation is consistent with in situ measurements: the energetic electrons were first released during the early impulsive phase when the eruption was initiated. The more energetic in situ electrons were released several minutes later during the second period of the impulsive phase when the eruption was well underway. This second period of energetic electron acceleration also coincides with the release of in situ energetic protons and the onset of an interplanetary type III radio burst. We conclude that these multi-messenger observations favor a two-phase particle acceleration scenario: the first, less energetic electron population was produced during the initial reconnection that triggers the flare eruption, and the second, more energetic electron population was accelerated in the above-the-looptop region below a well-developed, large-scale reconnection current sheet induced by the eruption.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Infrared Excess of SIPS J2045-6332: Evidence for a Young Stellar Object with Potential Low-Mass Companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Disk Detective project, a citizen science initiative, aims to identify circumstellar discs around stars by detecting objects with infrared (IR) excess using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). In this study, we investigate SIPS J2045-6332, a potential brown dwarf with significant IR excess in WISE and 2MASS bands, initially identified by project volunteers. Despite early indicators of a circumstellar disc, discrepancies between observed brightness and expected Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) models suggested unusual properties. To explore potential explanations, we created SED templates for spectral types M9 to L4 and compared them with SIPS J2045-6332's photometric data, revealing an excess brightness that points to either an unresolved low-mass companion or a young, inflated primary star. Further analysis of infrared spectral features and surface gravity indicators supports a youthful classification, estimating the object's age at 26-200 million years. Observations also suggest the presence of a mid L-type companion at a projected distance of 6.7 AU. This study highlights SIPS J2045-6332 as an intriguing system with unique IR characteristics and recommends follow-up observations with high-resolution telescopes to confirm the companion hypothesis and further characterize the system.</description>

      <title>X-ray and radio data obtained by XMM-Newton and VLA constrain the stellar wind of the magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star in HD45166</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a powerful magnetic field was discovered in the hot helium star classified as a quasi-Wolf-Rayet star of ~2Msun, member of the HD45166 system. Upon its explosion as a core-collapse supernova, it is expected to produce a strongly magnetic neutron star, a magnetar. Among the key parameters governing the pre-supernova evolution is the amount of mass lost via stellar wind. However, the magnetic nature of this helium star is expected to affect its stellar wind making the estimation of the wind parameters uncertain. We report the first observations of HD45166 in X-rays with the XMM-Newton telescope and in radio with the VLA interferometer array. By placing the observation results in a theoretical framework, we aim to provide a reliable estimate of the wind strength of the magnetic qWR star. The X-ray properties are explained in the framework of the MCWS scenario, and the semi-analytic XADM model is applied to reproduce the X-ray emission. The thermal radio emission of the wind and its absorption effect on possible gyro-synchrotron emission from the underlying dipolar magnetosphere, sampled in 3D, are computed by integrating the radiative transfer equation. We did not detect radio emissions, this enabled us to set sensitive upper limits on the radio luminosity. The magnetic qWR star is a slow rotator, comparison with models reveals that the possible acceleration mechanisms occurring within its dynamical magnetosphere are not as efficient as in fast-rotating magnetic ApBp-type stars. In contrast, the system is detected in X-rays with log(L_X/L_bol)~ -5.6. Using suitable models, we constrain the mass lost from this magnetic quasi-Wolf-Rayet star as dot{M}~3e-10 Msun/yr. This novel empirical estimate of the mass-loss rate in a ~2Msun helium star confirms that it maintains super-Chandrasekhar mass till collapse and can produce a magnetar as its final evolutionary product.</description>

      <title>Searching for lambda Boo stars in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal is to find new candidate lambda Boo stars that belong to binary systems. A detailed abundance determination of some candidates could confirm their true lambda Boo nature, while the composition of eventual late-type companions could be used as a proxy for the initial composition of the lambda Boo stars. Results. We obtained a group of 19 newly identified binary systems which contain a candidate lambda Boo star, allowing to duplicate the number of lambda Boo stars currently known in multiple systems. This important group could be used in further studies of lambda Boo stars. For the first time, we performed a detailed abundance analysis of three of these binary systems which includes a candidate lambda Boo star and a late-type companion. We confirmed the true lambda Boo nature of the three early-type stars (HD 87304, HD 98069 and HD 153747), and obtained mostly a solar-like composition for their late-type components. Adopting as a proxy the late-type stars, we showed that the three lambda Boo stars were initially born with a solar-like composition. This is an important constraint for any scenario trying to explain the origin of lambda Boo stars. Also, the solar-like composition of the late-type stars supports the idea that lambda Boo stars are Population I objects, however, we caution that other explanations are also possible. Conclusions. We performed, for the first time, a detailed abundance analysis of binary systems including a lambda Boo star and a late-type companion. We obtained a solid indication that lambda Boo stars born from a solar-like composition and established an important constraint to test formation models of lambda Boo stars.[abridged]</description>

      <title>Clustering analysis of Ca {\sc i} 4227 line polarization using magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ca {\sc i} 4227 \AA\, line is a strong resonance line formed in the Solar chromosphere. At the limb, it produces the largest scattering polarization signal. So far, modeling the linear polarization in this line has been limited to the use of one-dimensional semi-empirical models of the solar atmosphere. In this paper, we use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere as well as 1.5D radiative transfer to understand the formation of linear polarization profiles due to resonance scattering in this line at a near limb position. Using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical models of the solar atmosphere, in this paper, we perform 1.5D radiative transfer calculations to understand the formation of linear polarization profiles due to resonance scattering in this line at a near limb position. We focus on studying the sensitivity of the resonance scattering polarization to the temperature and the density structures in the atmosphere. We do not include the effects of magnetic and velocity fields in this study. We use clustering analysis to identify linear polarization profiles with similar shape and group them accordingly for our study. We analyze the structure of the linear polarization profiles across 14 clusters, each representing different realizations of the solar atmosphere. Using source function ratio plots at various wing and core wavelength positions, we provide a qualitative explanation of linear polarization profiles in these clusters.</description>

Abstract: We present a dataset of high resolution spectra of the Sun and ten bright stars of the domains [6297-6303] and [6361-6367] Angtr{\"o}m. Solar spectra were obtained in the quiet Sun at various distances from disk centre with the ground based Meudon Solar Tower and Themis telescope (12 m{\AA} resolution) and with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Hinode satellite (21 m{\AA} resolution). Spectra of 10 bright stars (magnitude \&lt; 2) were also got with Themis at 12 m{\AA} resolution. These spectral domains contain the faint and forbidden OI lines (6300.31 {\AA} and 6363.79 {\AA}) that are useful for the research of Oxygen abundance. The spectra shown here are freely available in FITS format to the research community.</description>

      <title>10 Years of Archival High-Resolution NIR Spectra: The Raw and Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) is a compact, high-resolution (R~45,000) near-infrared spectrograph spanning 1.45 to 2.45 um in a single exposure. We introduce the Raw and Reduced IGRINS Spectral Archive (RRISA), which provides public data access for all non-proprietary IGRINS data taken at McDonald Observatory's Harlan J. Smith Telescope, the Lowell Discovery Telescope (formerly Discovery Channel Telescope), and Gemini South. RRISA provides access to raw files, reduced data products, and cross-matched IGRINS targets with the SIMBAD, 2MASS, Gaia DR3, APOGEE2 DR17, and PASTEL catalogs. We also introduce version 3 of the IGRINS data reduction pipeline, IGRINS PLP v3, which implements an improved cosmic ray correction, pattern noise removal, and a new flexure correction that reduces telluric residuals. RRISA and supporting information can be found at http://igrinscontact.github.io.</description>

      <title>Crystal nucleation rates in one-component Yukawa systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleation in the supercooled Yukawa system is relevant for addressing current challenges in understanding a range of crystallizing systems including white dwarf (WD) stars. We use both brute force and seeded molecular dynamics simulations to study homogeneous nucleation of crystals from supercooled Yukawa liquids. With our improved approach to seeded simulations, we obtain quantitative predictions of the crystal nucleation rate and cluster size distributions as a function of temperature and screening length. These quantitative results show trends towards fast nucleation with short-ranged potentials. They also indicate that for temperatures $T &gt; 0.9T_m$, where $T_m$ is the melt temperature, classical homogeneous nucleation is too slow to initiate crystallization but transient clusters of around 100 particles should be common. We apply these general results to a typical WD model and obtain a delay of approximately 0.6 Gyr in the onset of crystallization that may be observable.</description>

      <title>First detection of variable radio emission originating from the infant planetary system V1298 Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V1298 Tau is a very young and magnetically active star which hosts a benchmark multi-planetary system to study planet formation and evolutionary history at the earliest stages. We selected V1298 Tau for a first targeted follow-up at radio frequencies with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Telescope (JVLA), the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), and the Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT), to search for emission in the overall frequency range 0.55-7.2 GHz. Detecting radio emission from such a very active star is key to characterise its magnetosphere, allowing in principle to probe the strength of the coronal magnetic field and plasma density. Observations were carried out between Oct 2023 and Sept 2024: three epochs with uGMRT band-4 (0.55-0.75 GHz), 12 epochs with the JVLA using L (1-2 GHz) and C (4.5-6.5 GHz) bands, and three epochs with SRT using C-high band (6-7.2 GHz). We report the first detection of radio emission from V1298 Tau at different epochs using the JVLA. The emission has maximum peak flux densities of 91$\pm$10 and 177$\pm$6 $\mu$Jy/beam in the L- and C-band, respectively. From a comparison with contemporary optical photometry, we found that the detected emission with the highest fluxes are located around a phase of minimum of the photospheric light curve. Although the uGMRT and SRT observations could not detect the source, we measured 3$\sigma$ flux density upper limits in the range ~41-56 $\mu$Jy/beam using uGMRT, while with SRT we reached upper limits down to 13 mJy. The lack of a significant fraction of circular polarisation indicates that the observed flux is not due to electron cyclotron maser emission from star-planet interaction, and it is likely produced by gyrosynchroton/cyclotron emission from the corona triggered by stellar magnetic activity, although we cannot exclude thermal emission due to a lack of constraints on the brightness temperature.</description>

Abstract: Stars form from dense cores in turbulent molecular clouds. According to the standard scenario of star formation, dense cores are created by cloud fragmentation. However, the physical mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood from an observational standpoint. However, the physical mechanisms driving this process are still not fully understood from an observational standpoint. Our goal is to investigate the process of cloud fragmentation using observational data from nearby clouds. Specifically, we aim to examine the role of self-gravity and turbulence, both of which are key to the dynamical evolution of clouds. We applied astrodendro to the Herschel H2 column density maps to identify dense cores and determine their mass and separation in two nearby low-mass clouds: the Polaris Flare and Lupus I clouds. We then compared the observed core masses and separations with predictions from models of gravitational and turbulent fragmentation. For turbulent fragmentation, the key scales are the cloud sonic scale and its corresponding mass. The average core masses are estimated to be 0.242 Msun for Lupus I and 0.276 Msun for the Polaris Flare. The core separations peak at 0.1 - 0.2 pc in both clouds. These separations are significantly smaller than the Jeans length but agree well with the cloud sonic scale. Additionally, the density probability distribution functions of the dense cores follow log-normal distributions, which is consistent with the predictions of turbulent fragmentation. These findings suggest that the primary process driving core formation in the observed low-mass star-forming regions is not gravitational fragmentation but rather turbulent fragmentation. We found no evidence that filament fragmentation plays a significant role in the formation of dense cores.</description>

      <title>Testing for Markovian character of transfer of fluctuations in solar wind turbulence on kinetic scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply statistical analysis to search for processes responsible for turbulence in physical systems. In our previous studies, we have shown that solar wind turbulence in the inertial range of large magnetohydrodynamic scales exhibits Markov properties. We have recently extended this approach on much smaller kinetic scales. Here we are testing for the Markovian character of stochastic processes in a kinetic regime based on magnetic field and velocity fluctuations in the solar wind, measured onboard the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission: behind the bow shock, inside the magnetosheath, and near the magnetopause. We have verified that the Chapman-Kolmogorov necessary conditions for Markov processes is satisfied for local transfer of energy between the magnetic and velocity fields also on kinetic scales. We have confirmed that for magnetic fluctuations, the first Kramers-Moyal coefficient is linear, while the second term is quadratic, corresponding to drift and diffusion processes in the resulting Fokker-Planck equation. It means that magnetic self-similar turbulence is described by generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. We show that for the magnetic case, the Fokker-Planck equation leads to the probability density functions of the kappa distributions, which exhibit global universal scale invariance with a linear scaling and lack of intermittency. On the contrary, for velocity fluctuations, higher order Kramers-Moyal coefficients should be taken into account and hence scale invariance is not observed. However, the nonextensity parameter in Tsallis entropy provides a robust measure of the departure of the system from equilibrium. The obtained results are important for a better understanding of the physical mechanism governing turbulent systems in space and laboratory.</description>

      <title>Predicted Neutrino Signal Features of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the neutrino signals from 24 initially non-rotating, three-dimensional core-collapse supernova (CCSN) simulations carried to late times. We find that not only does the neutrino luminosity signal encode information about each stage of the CCSN process, but that the monotonic dependence of the luminosity peak height with compactness enables one to infer the progenitor core structure from the neutrino signal. We highlight a systematic relationship between the luminosity peak height with its timing. Additionally, we emphasize that the total energy radiated in neutrinos is monotonic with progenitor compactness, and that the mean neutrino energy contains a unique spiral SASI signature for nonexploding, BH-forming models. We also find that neutrino emissions are not isotropic and that the anisotropy increases roughly with progenitor compactness. To assess the detectability of these neutrino signal features, we provide examples of the event rates for our models for the JUNO, DUNE, SK, and IceCube detectors using the SNEWPY software, and find that many of the trends in the luminosity signal can be detectable across several detectors and oscillation models. Finally, we discuss correlations between the radiated neutrino energy and the evolution of the gravitational-wave f-mode.</description>

      <title>Identification of a turnover in the initial mass function of a young stellar cluster down to 0.5 M$_{J}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A successful theory of star formation should predict the number of objects as a function of their mass produced through star-forming events. Previous studies in star-forming regions and the solar neighborhood identify a mass function increasing from the hydrogen-burning limit down to about 10 M$_{J}$. Theory predicts a limit to the fragmentation process, providing a natural turnover in the mass function down to the opacity limit of turbulent fragmentation thought to be near 1-10 M$_{J}$. Programs to date have not been sensitive enough to probe the hypothesized opacity limit of fragmentation. We present the first identification of a turnover in the initial mass function below 12 M$_{J}$ within NGC 2024, a young star-forming region. With JWST/NIRCam deep exposures across 0.7-5 $\mu$m, we identified several free floating objects down to roughly 3 M$_{J}$ with sensitivity to 0.5 M$_{J}$. We present evidence for a double power law model increasing from about 60 M$_{J}$ to roughly 12 M$_{J}$, consistent with previous studies, followed by a decrease down to 0.5 M$_{J}$. Our results support the predictions of star and brown dwarf formation theory, identifying the theoretical turnover in the mass function and suggest the fundamental limit of turbulent fragmentation near 3 M$_{J}$.</description>

      <title>The impact of rotation on the stochastic excitation of stellar acoustic modes in solar-like pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observational results from asteroseismic studies show that an important fraction of solar-like stars do not present detectable stochastically excited acoustic oscillations. This non-detectability seems to correlate with a high rotation rate in the convective envelope and a high surface magnetic activity. At the same time, the properties of stellar convection are affected by rotation and magnetism. We investigate the role of rotation in the excitation of acoustic modes in the convective envelope of solar-like stars, to evaluate its impact on the energy injected in the oscillations. We derive theoretical prescriptions for the excitation of acoustic waves in the convective envelope of rotating solar-like stars. We adopt the Rotating Mixing-Length Theory to model the influence of rotation on convection. We use the MESA stellar evolution code and the GYRE stellar oscillation code to estimate the power injected in the oscillations from our theoretical prescriptions. We demonstrate that the power injected in the acoustic modes is insensitive to the rotation if a Gaussian time-correlation function is assumed, while it can decrease by up to 60 % for a Lorentzian time-correlation function, for a $20 \Omega_{\odot}$ rotation rate. This result can allow us to better constrain the properties of stellar convection by studying observationally acoustic modes excitation. These results demonstrate how important it is to take into account the modification of stellar convection by rotation when evaluating the amplitude of the stellar oscillations it stochastically excites. They open the path for understanding the large variety of observed acoustic-mode amplitudes at the surface of solar-like stars as a function of surface rotation rates.</description>

      <title>Electron-only reconnection and inverse magnetic-energy transfer at sub-ion scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive, and validate numerically, an analytical model for electron-only magnetic reconnection applicable to strongly magnetized plasmas. Our model predicts sub-ion-scale reconnection rates significantly higher than those pertaining to large-scale reconnection, aligning with recent observations and simulations. We apply this reconnection model to the problem of inverse magnetic energy transfer at sub-ion scales. We derive time-dependent scaling laws for the magnetic energy decay and the typical magnetic structure dimensions that differ from those previously found in the MHD regime. These scaling laws are validated via two- and three-dimensional simulations, demonstrating that sub-ion scale magnetic fields can reach large, system-size scales via successive coalescence.</description>

      <title>Occurrence rates of accreting companions from a new method to compute emission-line survey sensitivity: application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01491v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alphaline luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-7 &lt; log MMdot &lt;-3) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Using our two accretion models, we find consistent protoplanet rates, with median and 68% credible intervals of 0.16 (+0.19, -0.10) and 0.22 (+0.26, -0.14) accreting companions per star, respectively. Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The period-luminosity relation of long-period variables in the Large Magellanic Cloud observed with ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Period-luminosity relations of long period variables (LPVs) are a powerful tool to map the distances of stars in our galaxy, and are typically calibrated using stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Recent results demonstrated that these relations show a strong dependence on the amplitude of the variability, which can be used to greatly improve distance estimates. However, one of the only highly sampled catalogs of such variables in the LMC is based on OGLE photometry, which does not provide all-sky coverage. Here, we provide the first measurement of the period-luminosity relation of long-period variables in the LMC using photometry from the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS). We derive conversions between ugriz, Gaia, and ATLAS c and o passbands with a precision of approximately 0.02 mag, which enable the measurement of reliable amplitudes with ATLAS for crowded fields. We successfully reproduce the known PL sequences A through E, and show evidence for sequence F using the ratios of amplitudes observed in both ATLAS pass-bands. Our work demonstrates that the ATLAS survey can recover variability in evolved red giants and lays the foundation for an all-sky distance map of the Milky Way using long-period variables.</description>

      <title>SIROCCO: A Publicly Available Monte Carlo Ionization and Radiative Transfer Code for Astrophysical Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Outflows are critical components of many astrophysical systems, including accreting compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These outflows can significantly affect a system's evolution and alter its observational appearance by reprocessing the radiation produced by the central engine. Sirocco (Simulating Ionization and Radiation in Outflows Created by Compact Objects - or "the code formerly known as Python") is a Sobolev-based Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. It is designed to simulate the spectra produced by any system with an azimuthally-symmetric outflow, from spherical stellar winds to rotating, biconical accretion disc winds. Wind models can either be parametrized or imported, e.g. from hydrodynamical simulations. The radiation sources include an optically thick accretion disc and various central sources with flexible spectra and geometries. The code tracks the "photon packets" produced by the sources in any given simulation as they traverse and interact with the wind. The code assumes radiative near-equilibrium, so the thermal and ionization state can be determined iteratively from these interactions. Once the physical properties in the wind have converged, Sirocco can be used to generate synthetic spectra at a series of observer sightlines. Here, we describe the physical assumptions, operation, performance and limitations of the code. We validate it against tardis, cmfgen and cloudy, finding good agreement, and present illustrative synthetic spectra from disc winds in cataclysmic variables, tidal disruption events, AGN and X-ray binaries. Sirocco is publicly available on GitHub, alongside its associated data, documentation and sample input files covering a wide range of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Gone with the wind: the outward migration of eccentric giant planets in windy disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies indicate that circumstellar disks exhibit weak turbulence, with their dynamics and evolution being primarily influenced by magnetic winds. However, most numerical studies have focused on planet-disk interactions in turbulent disk models. We aim to explore how wind-driven accretion affects the orbital and eccentricity evolution of a Jovian planet within a magnetized disk. Conversely, we seek to determine in what extent such a planet can modify the accretion behavior and the wind dynamics. We perform high-resolution 3D global non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a massive gap-carving planet interacting with a wind-launching disk, using the accelerated code IDEFIX. We consider the influence of the gap shape on planet migration by restarting a "fixed-planet" simulation at three different times, from which the planet evolves freely in the disk. For a strong initial magnetization and a sufficiently deep planet gap, we find that the planet becomes moderately eccentric, and its migration is slow, unsteady and mostly outward. This migration pattern is due to the gap's radial asymmetry which enhances the inner Lindblad torque while reducing the outer Lindblad torque. We show that eccentricity can grow up to 6-8% and is likely driven by a finite-amplitude instability triggered by first-order external Lindblad resonances. These moderate eccentricity values periodically modulate the gap accretion rate and wind mass loss rate, possibly leading to the formation of discrete structures in CO outflows. Slow outward migration and eccentricity growth appear to be common outcomes of planet-disk-wind interactions, which may contribute significantly to both the long orbital periods and the moderate eccentricities of warm jupiters. Additionally, eccentric massive protoplanets embedded in circumstellar disks could play a role in generating structured outflows.</description>

      <title>Computing Anharmonic Infrared Spectra of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons Using Machine-Learning Molecular Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are key contributors to interstellar aromatic infrared (IR) bands. However, current spectral databases for IR emission analysis are limited by the omission of vibrational anharmonicity and temperature effects, primarily because of the high computational cost of conventional quantum chemical calculations (QCCs). In this work, we present a machine learning-based molecular dynamics (MLMD) approach that efficiently computes anharmonic IR spectra while incorporating temperature effects. MLMD achieves predictive accuracy comparable to that of QCCs but with significantly reduced computational cost, scaling linearly with the number of atoms in the system. We applied MLMD to calculate the anharmonic spectra of 1704 PAHs in the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic Database with up to 216 carbon atoms, demonstrating its capability for high-throughput spectral calculations of large molecular systems. Our results highlight MLMD's potential to enable the development of extensive molecular spectral datasets, enhancing data-driven analyses of astronomical IR spectra, particularly in anticipation of upcoming data from the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>
