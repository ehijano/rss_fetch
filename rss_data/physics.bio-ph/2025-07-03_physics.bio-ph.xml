      <title>An in-silico lung phantom to assess the performance of pulmonary artery segmentation using angiogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) can lead to significant vascular remodeling, resulting in altered pulmonary blood flow. Estimating the patient-specific contributions of each remodeling event is necessary to optimize and individualize clinical intervention strategies. In-silico modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to simulate pulmonary hemodynamics, and one of the primary requirements for robust in-silico modeling is an accurate representation of the pulmonary vasculature structure. Computed tomography (CT) imaging can be used to segment and reconstruct the proximal vasculature. However, contrast-enhanced imaging, such as CT pulmonary angiography, is required to obtain a comprehensive and high-fidelity view of the pulmonary vasculature. The clinical use of CT pulmonary angiography is limited by the complications associated with the injection of contrast agents. Machine learning (ML) approaches have emerged to effectively segment and reconstruct the pulmonary vasculature without the need for contrast-enhanced imaging. We have developed a method to create in-silico pulmonary angiogram phantoms with varying simulated contrast levels. The results indicated that adding simulated contrast can allow for successful segmentation of the pulmonary vasculature. We expect this method to assist with developing and training ML-based segmentation frameworks and aid in their validation, thereby improving the capability to segment and reconstruct pulmonary vasculature without using contrast-enhanced imaging.</description>

      <title>Orthotropic Viscoelastic Creep in Cellular Scaffolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of Norway spruce have revealed stress-state-dependent normalized creep behavior, highlighting a gap in our fundamental understanding. This study examines whether the anisotropic response originates from the micro-structural, cellular nature of composite cell walls with varying tracheid types. Cell wall creep parameters are identified via surrogate-based inverse parameter identification, applied to hierarchical micro-mechanical and FEM models of increasing topological complexity up to the growth ring scale. Despite microstructural disorder, simulated creep curves converge toward a universal set of proportionality factors. The results indicate that directional creep behavior cannot be attributed solely to tissue-scale topology, and that realistic predictions require the inclusion of non-linear material responses at stress concentration sites.</description>

      <title>Universal features of epidemic and vaccine models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic model that includes an additional immigration process. In the presence of multiplicative noise, generated by environmental perturbations, the model exhibits noise-induced transitions. The bifurcation diagram has two distinct regions of unimodality and bimodality in which the steady-state probability distribution has one and two peaks, respectively. Apart from first-order transitions between the two regimes, a critical-point transition occurs at a cusp point with the transition belonging to the mean-field Ising universality class. The epidemic model shares these features with the well-known Horsthemke-Lefever model of population genetics. The effect of vaccination on the spread/containment of the epidemic in a stochastic setting is also studied. We further propose a general vaccine-hesitancy model, along the lines of Kirman's ant model, with the steady-state distribution of the fraction of the vaccine-willing population given by the Beta distribution. The distribution is shown to give a good fit to the COVID-19 data on vaccine hesitancy and vaccination. We derive the steady-state probability distribution of the basic reproduction number, a key parameter in epidemiology, based on a beta-distributed fraction of the vaccinated population. Our study highlights the universal features that epidemic and vaccine models share with other dynamical models.</description>

      <title>Phototactic Decision-Making by Micro-Algae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how simple eukaryotic organisms make decisions in response to competing stimuli in the context of phototaxis by the unicellular alga $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$. While negatively phototactic cells swim directly away from a collimated light beam, when presented with two beams of adjustable intersection angle and intensities, we find that cells swim in a direction given by an intensity-weighted average of the two light propagation vectors. This geometrical law is a fixed point of an adaptive model of phototaxis and minimizes the average light intensity falling on the anterior pole of the cell. At large angular separations, subpopulations of cells swim away from one source or the other, or along the direction of the geometrical law, with some cells stochastically switching between the three directions. This behavior is shown to arise from a population-level distribution of photoreceptor locations that breaks front-back symmetry of photoreception.</description>

      <title>More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>

      <title>Midveins regulate the shape formation of drying leaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dried leaves in nature often exhibit curled and crumpled morphologies, typically attributed to internal strain gradients that produce dome-like shapes. However, the origin of these strain gradients remains poorly understood. Although leaf veins--particularly the midvein--have been suggested to influence shape formation, their mechanical role has not been systematically investigated. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical constraints imposed by the midvein play a crucial role in generating the diverse morphologies that emerge during leaf drying. Combining numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we show that a uniformly shrinking leaf lamina constrained by a non-shrinking midvein gives rise to two distinct types of configurations: curling-dominated and folding-dominated morphologies. In the curling-dominated regime, both S-curled and C-curled shapes emerge, with C-curled configurations more commonly observed due to their lower elastic energy. In contrast, the folding-dominated regime features folding accompanied by edge waviness. Theoretical modeling reveals a linear relationship between midvein curvature and mismatch strain, consistent with simulation results. Moreover, we find that the morphological outcome is governed by the ratio of bending stiffnesses between the lamina and the midvein. We construct a comprehensive phase diagram for the transitions between different configurations. These findings provide a mechanical framework for understanding shape formation in drying leaves, offering new insights into natural morphing processes and informing the design of bio-inspired morphable structures.</description>

      <title>Residual U-Net for accurate and efficient prediction of hemodynamics in two-dimensional asymmetric stenosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents residual U-Net (U-ResNet), a deep learning surrogate model for predicting steady hemodynamic fields in two-dimensional asymmetric stenotic channels at Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 800. By integrating residual connections with multi-scale feature extraction, U-ResNet achieves exceptional accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs compared to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches. Comprehensive evaluation against U-Net, Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), and U-Net enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) demonstrates U-ResNet superior performance in capturing sharp hemodynamic gradients and complex flow features. For pressure prediction, U-ResNet achieves a normalized mean absolute error (NMAE) of 1.10%. Similarly, the performance of U-ResNet for wall shear stress (NMAE: 0.56%), velocity (NMAE: 1.06%), and vorticity (NMAE: 0.69%) consistently surpasses alternative architectures. Notably, U-ResNet demonstrates robust generalization to interpolated Reynolds numbers without retraining - a capability rarely achieved in existing models. From a computational perspective, U-ResNet delivers a 180-fold acceleration over CFD, reducing simulation time from approximately 30 minutes to 10 seconds per case. The model with non-dimensional formulation ensures scalability across vessel sizes and anatomical locations, enhancing its applicability to diverse clinical scenarios. These advances position U-ResNet as a promising auxiliary tool to complement CFD simulations for real-time clinical decision support, treatment planning, and medical device optimization. Future work will focus on extending the framework to three-dimensional geometries and integrating it with patient-specific data.</description>

      <title>BoltzNCE: Learning Likelihoods for Boltzmann Generation with Stochastic Interpolants and Noise Contrastive Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution defined by an energy function is a key challenge in modeling physical systems such as molecules. Boltzmann Generators tackle this by leveraging Continuous Normalizing Flows that transform a simple prior into a distribution that can be reweighted to match the Boltzmann distribution using sample likelihoods. However, obtaining likelihoods requires computing costly Jacobians during integration, making it impractical for large molecular systems. To overcome this, we propose learning the likelihood of the generated distribution via an energy-based model trained with noise contrastive estimation and score matching. By using stochastic interpolants to anneal between the prior and generated distributions, we combine both the objective functions to efficiently learn the density function. On the alanine dipeptide system, we demonstrate that our method yields free energy profiles and energy distributions comparable to those obtained with exact likelihoods. Additionally, we show that free energy differences between metastable states can be estimated accurately with orders-of-magnitude speedup.</description>
