      <title>Gemini &amp; Physical World: Large Language Models Can Estimate the Intensity of Earthquake Shaking from Multi-Modal Social Media Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for estimating the ground shaking intensity using social media data and CCTV footage. Employing the Gemini Pro (Reid et al. 2024) model, a multi-modal language model, we demonstrate the ability to extract relevant information from unstructured data utilizing generative AI and natural language processing. The model output, in the form of Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) values, align well with independent observational data. Furthermore, our results suggest that beyond its advanced visual and auditory understanding abilities, Gemini appears to utilize additional sources of knowledge, including a simplified understanding of the general relationship between earthquake magnitude, distance, and MMI intensity, which it presumably acquired during its training, in its reasoning and decision-making processes. These findings raise intriguing questions about the extent of Gemini's general understanding of the physical world and its phenomena. The ability of Gemini to generate results consistent with established scientific knowledge highlights the potential of LLMs like Gemini in augmenting our understanding of complex physical phenomena such as earthquakes. More specifically, the results of this study highlight the potential of LLMs like Gemini to revolutionize citizen seismology by enabling rapid, effective, and flexible analysis of crowdsourced data from eyewitness accounts for assessing earthquake impact and providing crisis situational awareness. This approach holds great promise for improving early warning systems, disaster response, and overall resilience in earthquake-prone regions. This study provides a significant step toward harnessing the power of social media and AI for earthquake disaster mitigation.</description>

      <title>PT and anti-PT symmetries for astrophysical waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Discrete symmetries have found numerous applications in photonics and quantum mechanics, but remain little studied in fluid mechanics, particularly in astrophysics. Aims: We aim to show how PT and anti-PT symmetries determine the behaviour of linear perturbations in a wide class of astrophysical problems. They set the location of Exceptional Points in the parameter space and the associated transitions to instability, and are associated to the conservation of quadratic quantities that can be determined explicitly. Methods: We study several classical local problems: the gravitational instability of isothermal spheres and thin discs, the Schwarzschild instability, the Rayleigh-B\'enard instability and acoustic waves in dust-gas mixtures. We calculate the locations and the order of the Exceptional Points with a method of resultant, as well as the conserved quantities in the different regions of the parameter space using Krein theory. Results: All problems studied here exhibit discrete symmetries, even though Hermiticity is broken by different physical processes (self-gravity, buoyancy, diffusion, drag). This analysis provides genuine explanations for certain instabilities, and for the existence of regions in the parameter space where waves do not propagate. Those correspond to breaking of PT and anti-PT symmetries respectively. Not all instabilities are associated to symmetry breaking (e.g. the Rayleigh-Benard instability).</description>

      <title>Homogenized Lattice Boltzmann Model for Simulating Multi-Phase Flows in Heterogeneous Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new homogenization approach for the simulation of multi-phase flows in heterogeneous porous media is presented. It is based on the lattice Boltzmann method and combines the grayscale with the multi-component Shan-Chen method. Thus, it mimics fluid-fluid and solid-fluid interactions also within pores that are smaller than the numerical discretization. The model is successfully tested for a broad variety of single- and two-phase flow problems. Additionally, its application to multi-scale and multi-phase flow problems in porous media is demonstrated using the electrolyte filling process of realistic 3D lithium-ion battery electrode microstructures as an example. The new method shows advantages over comparable methods from literature. The interfacial tension and wetting conditions are independent and not affected by the homogenization. Moreover, all physical properties studied here are continuous even across interfaces of porous media. The method is consistent with the original multi-component Shan-Chen method. It is accurate, efficient, easy to implement, and can be applied to many research fields, especially where multi-phase fluid flow occurs in heterogeneous and multi-scale porous media.</description>

      <title>A hyperbolic-elliptic PDE model and conservative numerical method for gravity-dominated variably-saturated groundwater flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Richards equation is often used to represent two-phase fluid flow in an unsaturated porous medium when one phase is much heavier and more viscous than the other. However, it cannot describe the fully saturated flow for some capillary functions without specialized treatment due to degeneracy in the capillary pressure term. Mathematically, gravity-dominated variably saturated flows are interesting because their governing partial differential equation switches from hyperbolic in the unsaturated region to elliptic in the saturated region. Moreover, the presence of wetting fronts introduces strong spatial gradients often leading to numerical instability. In this work, we develop a robust, multidimensional mathematical model and implement a well-known efficient and conservative numerical method for such variably saturated flow in the limit of negligible capillary forces. The elliptic problem in saturated regions is integrated efficiently into our framework by solving a reduced system corresponding only to the saturated cells using fixed head boundary conditions in the unsaturated cells. In summary, this coupled hyperbolic-elliptic PDE framework provides an efficient, physics-based extension of the hyperbolic Richards equation to simulate fully saturated regions. Finally, we provide a suite of easy-to-implement yet challenging benchmark test problems involving saturated flows in one and two dimensions. These simple problems, accompanied by their corresponding analytical solutions, can prove to be pivotal for the code verification, model validation (V&amp;V) and performance comparison of simulators for variably saturated flow. Our numerical solutions show an excellent comparison with the analytical results for the proposed problems. The last test problem on two-dimensional infiltration in a stratified, heterogeneous soil shows the formation and evolution of multiple disconnected saturated regions.</description>

      <title>General hydrodynamic features of elastoviscoplastic fluid flows through randomised porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A numerical study of yield-stress fluids flowing in porous media is presented. The porous media is randomly constructed by non-overlapping mono-dispersed circular obstacles. Two class of rheological models are investigated: elastoviscoplastic fluids (i.e. Saramito model) and viscoplastic fluids (i.e. Bingham model). A wide range of practical Weissenberg and Bingham numbers is studied at three different levels of porosities of the media. The emphasis is on revealing some physical transport mechanisms of yield-stress fluids in porous media when the elastic behaviour of this kind of fluids is incorporated. Thus, computations of elastoviscoplastic fluids are performed and are compared with the viscoplastic fluid flow properties. At a constant Weissenberg number, the pressure drop increases both with the Bingham number and the solid volume fraction of obstacles. However, the effect of elasticity is less trivial. At low Bingham numbers, the pressure drop of an elastoviscoplastic fluid increases compared to a viscoplastic fluid, while at high Bingham numbers we observe drag reduction by elasticity. At the yield limit (i.e. infinitely large Bingham numbers), elasticity of the fluid systematically promotes yielding: elastic stresses help the fluid to overcome the yield stress resistance at smaller pressure gradients. We observe that elastic effects increase with both Weissenberg and Bingham numbers. In both cases, elastic effects finally make the elastoviscoplastic flow unsteady, which consequently can result in chaos and turbulence.
