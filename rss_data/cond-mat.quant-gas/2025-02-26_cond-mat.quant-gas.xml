      <title>The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in molecular dynamics, state preparation, and quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Phonon thermal Hall as a lattice Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a growing list of insulators, experiments find a misalignment between the heat flux and the thermal gradient vectors induced by magnetic field. This phenomenon, known as the phonon thermal Hall effect, implies energy flow without entropy production along the orientation perpendicular to the temperature gradient. Experiments find that the thermal Hall angle is maximal at the temperature at which the longitudinal thermal conductivity peaks. At this temperature, $T_{max}$, Normal phonon-phonon collisions (which do not produce entropy) dominate Umklapp and boundary scattering events (which do). In the presence of a magnetic field, Born-Oppenheimer approximated molecular wave functions are known to acquire a geometric [Berry] phase. I will argue here that the survival of this phase in a crystal implies a complex amplitude for transverse phonons. This modifies three-phonon interference patterns, twisting the quasi-momentum of the outgoing phonon. The rough amplitude of the thermal Hall angle expected in this picture is set by the wavelength, $\lambda_{max}$, and the crest displacement amplitude, $u_m$, of transverse acoustic phonons at $T_{max}$. Combined with the interatomic distance, $a$ and the magnetic length, $\ell_B$, it yields: $\Theta_H \approx \lambda_{max}^2u_m^2a^{-2}\ell_B^{-2}$. This is surprisingly close to what has been experimentally found in black phosphorus, germanium and silicon.</description>

      <title>Reaction-diffusion dynamics of the weakly dissipative Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional Fermi gas subject to dissipative reactions. The dynamics is governed by the quantum master equation, where the Hamiltonian describes coherent motion of the particles, while dissipation accounts for irreversible reactions. For lattice one-dimensional fermionic systems, emergent critical behavior has been found in the dynamics in the reaction-limited regime of weak dissipation. Here, we address the question whether such features are present also in a gas in continuum space. We do this in the weakly dissipative regime by applying the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble method. We show that for two body $2A\to \emptyset$ and three $3A\to \emptyset$ body annihilation, as well as for coagulation $A+A\to A$, the density features an asymptotic algebraic decay in time akin to the lattice problem. In all the cases, we find that upon increasing the temperature of the initial state the density decay accelerates, but the asymptotic algebraic decay exponents are not affected. We eventually consider the competition between branching $A\to A+A$ and the decay processes $A\to \emptyset$ and $2A\to \emptyset$. We find a second-order absorbing-state phase transition in the mean-field directed percolation universality class. This analysis shows that emergent behavior observed in lattice quantum reaction-diffusion systems is present also in continuum space, where it may be probed using ultra-cold atomic physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Frustration Effects of Strongly Interacting Bosons via the Hall Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the Hall response of hardcore bosonic atoms on a triangular ladder in a magnetic field. To access the dynamical properties of this many-body quantum system, we employ matrix product states numerical methods. We show that the behavior of the Hall polarization, both in its saturation value and in the short-time dynamics, correlates with the features of the underlying phase diagram, which stem from the interplay of interactions and geometric frustration. This paves the way to employ the Hall response as a sensitive probe of many-body chiral quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of bosonic Bogoliubov quasiparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12981v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bosonic Bogoliubov de Gennes (BBdG) Hamiltonians describe the excitations of weakly interacting Bose condensates as well as photonic systems under parametric driving. Their topological features have been studied mainly by utilizing a generalized symplectic version of the Berry curvature and related Chern numbers. However, a full characterization of geometrical features in BBdG systems is still lacking. Here, we propose a symplectic quantum geometric tensor (SQGT), whose imaginary part leads to the previously studied symplectic Berry curvature, while the real part gives rise to a symplectic quantum metric, providing a natural distance measure in the space of bosonic Bogoliubov modes. The SQGT is directly related to observable properties of BBdG systems. We show how to measure all components of the SQGT by extracting excitation rates in response to periodic modulations of the systems' parameters. Moreover, we connect the symplectic Berry curvature to a generalized symplectic anomalous velocity term for Bogoliubov-Bloch wave packets. We test our results for a bosonic Bogoliubov-Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Simulating Chemistry with Fermionic Optical Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that quantum number preserving Ans\"{a}tze for variational optimization in quantum chemistry find an elegant mapping to ultracold fermions in optical superlattices. Using native Hubbard dynamics, trial ground states of molecular Hamiltonians can be prepared and their molecular energies measured in the lattice. The scheme requires local control over interactions and chemical potentials and global control over tunneling dynamics, but foregoes the need for optical tweezers, shuttling operations, or long-range interactions. We describe a complete compilation pipeline from the molecular Hamiltonian to the sequence of lattice operations, thus providing a concrete link between quantum simulation and chemistry. Our work enables the application of recent quantum algorithmic techniques, such as Double Factorization and quantum Tailored Coupled Cluster, to present-day fermionic optical lattice systems with significant improvements in the required number of experimental repetitions. We provide detailed quantum resource estimates for small non-trivial hardware experiments.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic modulation of driving protocols in periodically driven quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06651v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a periodically driven system where the high-frequency driving protocol consists of a sequence of potentials switched on and off at different instants within a period. We explore the possibility of introducing an adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol by considering a slow evolution of the instants when the sequence of potentials is switched on/off. We examine how this influences the long-term dynamics of periodically driven quantum systems. By assuming that the slow and fast timescales in the problem can be decoupled, we derive the stroboscopic (effective) Hamiltonian for a four-step driving sequence up to the first order in perturbation theory. We then apply this approach to a spin-$1/2$ system, where the adiabatic modulation of the driving protocol is chosen to produce an evolving emergent magnetic field that interacts with the spin. We study the emergence of diabolical points and diabolical loci in the parameter space of the effective Hamiltonian. Further, we study the topological properties of the maps of the adiabatic paths in the parameter space to the eigenspace of the effective Hamiltonian. In effect, we obtain a technique for tuning the topological properties of the eigenstates by selecting different adiabatic evolutions of the driving protocol, characterized by distinct paths in parameter space. This technique can be applied to any periodic driving protocol to achieve desirable topological effects.</description>
