      <title>Gravitational wave pulse and memory effects for hairy Kiselev black hole and its analogy with Bondi-Sachs formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of non-vacuum cosmological backgrounds containing black holes is greatly enhanced by the Kiselev solution. This solution plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of the background and its relationship with the features of the black hole. Consequently, the gravitational memory effects at large distances from the black hole offer a valuable means of obtaining information about the surrounding field parameter N and parameters related to the hair of the hairy Kiselev Black hole. This paper investigates the gravitational memory effects in the context of the Kiselev solution through two distinct approaches. At first, the gravitational memory effect at null infinity is explored by utilizing the Bondi-Sachs formalism by introducing a gravitational wave (GW) pulse to the solution. The resulting Bondi mass is then analyzed to gain further insight. Therefore, the Kiselev solution is being examined to determine the variations in Bondi mass caused by the pulse of GWs. The study of changes in Bondi mass is motivated by the fact that it is dynamic and time-dependent, and it measures mass on an asymptotically null slice or the densities of energy on celestial spheres. In the second approach, the investigation of displacement and velocity memory effects is undertaken in relation to the deviation of two neighboring geodesics and the deviation of their derivative influenced by surrounding field parameter N and the hair of hairy Kiselev black hole. This analysis is conducted within the context of a gravitational wave pulse present in the background of a hairy Kiselev black hole surrounded by a field parameter N.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity matters: Impact of eccentricity on inferred binary black hole populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW), emanating from binary black holes (BBH), encode vital information about their source. GW signals enable us to deduce key properties of the BBH population across the universe, including mass, spin, and eccentricity distribution. While the masses and spins of binary components are already recognized for their insights into formation, eccentricity stands out as a distinct and quantifiable indicator of formation and evolution. Yet, despite its significance, eccentricity is notably absent from most parameter estimation (PE) analyses associated with GW signals. To evaluate the precision with which the eccentricity distribution can be deduced, we generated two synthetic populations of eccentric binary black holes (EBBH) characterized by non-spinning, non-precessing dynamics and mass ranges between $10 M_\odot$ and $50 M_\odot$. This was achieved using an eccentric power law model, encompassing $100$ events with eccentricity distributions set at $\sigma_\epsilon = 0.05$ and $\sigma_\epsilon = 0.15$. This synthetic EBBH ensemble was contrasted against a circular binary black holes (CBBH) collection to discern how parameter inferences would vary without eccentricity. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, we constrained vital model parameters, including the event rate ($\mathcal{R}$), mass distribution, minimum mass ($m_{min}$), maximum mass ($m_{max}$), and the eccentricity distribution ($\sigma_\epsilon$). Our analysis demonstrates that eccentric population inference can identify the signatures of even modest eccentricities, given sufficiently many events. Conversely, our study shows that an analysis neglecting eccentricity may draw biased conclusions about population parameters for populations with the optimistic values of eccentricity distribution used in our research.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic topology of Phantom AdS Black Holes in Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the thermodynamic topology of phantom AdS black holes in the context of massive gravity. To this end, we evaluate these black holes in two distinct ensembles: the canonical and grand canonical ensembles (GCE). We begin by examining the topological charge linked to the critical point and confirming the existence of a conventional critical point $(CP_{1})$ in the canonical ensemble (CE), this critical point has a topological charge of $-1$ and acts as a point of phase annihilation, this situation can only be considered within the context of the classical Einstein-Maxwell (CEM) theory $(\eta=1)$, while no critical point is identified in the GCE. Furthermore, we consider black holes as a topological defect within the thermodynamic space. To gain an understanding of the local and global topological configuration of this defect, we will analyze its winding numbers, and observe that the total topological charge in the CE consistently remains at $1$. When the system experiences a pressure below the critical threshold, it gives rise to the occurrence of annihilation and generation points. The value of electric potential determines whether the total topological charge in the GCE is zero or one. As a result, we detect a point of generation point or absence of generation/annihilation point. Based on our analysis, it can be inferred that ensembles significantly impact the topological class of phantom AdS black holes in massive gravity.</description>

      <title>Detecting a Gravitational-Wave Background from Null Energy Condition Violation: Prospects for Taiji</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The null energy condition (NEC) is a fundamental principle in general relativity, and its violation could leave discernible signatures in gravitational waves (GWs). A violation of the NEC during the primordial era would imprint a blue-tilted spectrum on the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nanohertz frequencies, potentially accounting for the recently detected signal by pulsar timing arrays. Remarkably, models of NEC violation during inflation also predict a nearly scale-invariant GW spectrum in the millihertz frequency range, which could be detectable by upcoming space-based GW detectors such as Taiji. The observation of this distinctive spectrum would provide compelling evidence for new physics beyond the standard cosmological paradigm. In this study, we explore Taiji's ability to detect an SGWB arising from NEC violation during inflation, considering various foregrounds and noise sources, including an extragalactic foreground from binary black hole mergers throughout the universe, a galactic foreground from white dwarf binaries, and the intrinsic noise of the Taiji detector. Employing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques to analyze simulated Taiji data, we demonstrate a remarkable precision improvement of three orders of magnitude compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data set for measuring the tensor power spectrum amplitude, $P_{T,2}$, during the second inflationary stage. This substantial enhancement in measurement capabilities underscores Taiji's potential as a powerful probe for investigating the NEC violation in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detection of ultra high frequency gravitational waves from hyperbolic encounters with resonant cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this brief note, we pursue the systematic investigation of possible gravitational wave sources in the gigahertz band. We focus on hyperbolic encounters of light black holes and evaluate precisely the expected signal when accounting for the detailed characteristics of haloscope experiments. Considering the GraHal setup as a benchmark, we insist on the correct signal-to-noise ratio expression taking into account the appropriate timescales. The associated maximum distance - of the order of a few hundreds of astronomical units - at which an event can be detected is calculated for optimal, sub-optimal, and general trajectories.</description>

      <title>Influence of the cosmological constant on $\kappa$-deformed Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a model of the neutron star in $\kappa$-deformed space-time in the presence of the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$). The Einstein tensor and the energy-momentum tensor are generalized to $\kappa$-deformed space-time and we construct the field equations with the cosmological constant. Considering the interior of the star to be a perfect fluid as in the commutative case, we find the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations with the inclusion of the cosmological constant in $\kappa$-deformed space-time. The behavior of the maximum allowed mass of the star and its radius are studied with the variation in the cosmological constant as well as the deformation parameter. We see that the non-commutativity enhances the mass of the star and its maximum mass increases with a decrease in the cosmological constant. The maximum mass varies from $3.44M_{\odot}$ to $3.68M_{\odot}$ as $\Lambda$ varies from $10^{-10}m^{-2}$ to $10^{-15}m^{-2}$. We also obtain the compactness factor and surface redshift of the star. We observe that the compactness of the star increases as the cosmological constant decreases, whereas the surface redshift of the star decreases with a decrease in the cosmological constant. The compactness factor and surface redshift corresponding to the maximum mass of the neutron star remains almost constant as $\Lambda$ decreases.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves for eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals of self-dual spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the frequencies of geodesic orbits in self-dual spacetime on the equatorial plane and obtain the leading-order effects of loop quantum parameters $P$ on the energy flux and angular momentum flux in eccentric extreme mass ratio inspirals. The gravitational waveform under different eccentricity is carried out by improved "analytic-kludge" method. Through the calculation of waveform mismatches for the LISA detector, the constraints on loop quantum parameters will be improved by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, compared to the weak field experiments in the solar system, and can reach the level of $10^{-8}$.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the concept of the curvature in the momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the history of the curved momentum space from Max Born to the recent relative locality, \k{appa}-Poincare and noncommutative geometric proposals. We found that the concept of the curvature in the momentum space and motivations has been evolved during 80 years from the Max Born time. Motivations has been evolved from introducing general relativistic like equation for the momentum space to the relaxation of the concept of locality in special relativity and non-commutativity. This study can help us for a better understanding of this concept in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>A Coordinate-Independent Formalism for Detecting High-Frequency Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an external electric or magnetic field, a gravitational wave (GW) may be converted into electromagnetic radiation. We present a coordinate-invariant framework to describe the GW signal in a detector that is based on this effect, such as cavities for axion searches. In this framework, we pay special attention to the definition of manifestly coordinate-independent expressions for the electromagnetic fields that an external observer would detect. A careful assessment of the detector's perceived motion allows us to treat both its mechanical and its electromagnetic response to the GW consistently. We further introduce well-defined approximations for which this motion may be neglected, and hence provide suggestions on which coordinate frame is suitable to characterise the GW signal in practice. We illustrate our findings in two examples, an infinitesimally thin rod and a spherical electromagnetic cavity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic variance of the Hellings and Downs correlation for ensembles of universes having non-zero angular power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induce correlated perturbations to the arrival times of pulses from an array of galactic millisecond pulsars. The expected correlations, obtained by averaging over many pairs of pulsars having the same angular separation (pulsar averaging) and over an ensemble of model universes (ensemble averaging), are described by the Hellings and Downs curve. As shown by Allen {\tt arXiv:2205.05637v7 [gr-qc]}, the pulsar-averaged correlation will not agree exactly with the expected Hellings and Downs prediction if the gravitational-wave sources interfere with one another, differing instead by a "cosmic variance" contribution. The precise shape and size of the cosmic variance depends on the statistical properties of the ensemble of universes used to model the background. Here, we extend the calculations of the cosmic variance for the standard Gaussian ensemble to an ensemble of model universes which collectively has rotationally-invariant correlations in the GW power on different angular scales (described by an angular power spectrum, $C_\ell$ for $\ell=0,1,\cdots$.). We obtain an analytic form for the cosmic variance in terms of the $C_\ell$'s and show that for realistic values $C_{\ell}/C_0\lesssim 10^{-3}$, there is virtually no difference in the cosmic variance compared to that for the standard Gaussian ensemble (which has zero angular power spectra).</description>

      <title>Fast Waveform Generation for Gravitational Waves using Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave analyses depend heavily on waveforms that model the evolution of compact binary coalescences as seen by observing detectors. In many cases these waveforms are given by waveform approximants, models that approximate the power of the waveform at a set of frequencies. Because of their omnipresence, improving the speed at which approximants can generate waveforms is crucial to accelerating the overall analysis of gravitational-wave detections. An optimisation algorithm is proposed that can select at which frequencies in the spectrum an approximant should compute the power of a waveform, and at which frequencies the power can be safely interpolated at a minor loss in accuracy. The algorithm used is an evolutionary algorithm modeled after the principle of natural selection, iterating frequency arrays that perform better at every iteration. As an application, the candidates proposed by the algorithm are used to reconstruct signal-to-noise ratios. It is shown that the IMRPhenomXPHM approximant can be sped up by at least 30% at a loss of at most 2.87% on the drawn samples, measured by the accuracy of the reconstruction of signal-to-noise ratios. The behaviour of the algorithm as well as lower bounds on both speedup and error are explored, leading to a proposed proof of concept candidate that obtains a speedup of 46% with a maximum error of 0.5% on a sample of the parameter space used.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although General Relativity predicts the presence of a singularity inside of a Black Hole, it is not a complete theory of gravity. A real structure of a Black Hole interior near an expected singularity depends on the UV completion of gravity. In this paper, we establish that the question whether singular spherically symmetric solutions are absent is governed by the functional form of a non-perturbative graviton propagator. We explicitly show in a framework of a ghost-free infinite derivative gravity that for the graviton propagator of an exponential form favored by the unitarity a singularity is not possible unless an unphysical situation when the total mass of the Black Hole is infinite is considered.</description>

      <title>A non-Perturbative and Background-Independent Formulation of Quadratic Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A non-perturbative and background-independent quantum formulation of quadratic gravity is provided. A canonical quantization procedure introduced in previous works, named after Dirac and Pauli, is here applied to quadratic gravity to obtain, as required by consistency, a well-defined Euclidean path integral. The theory is unitary: all probabilities are non negative and they sum up to one. We obtain path-integral expressions for the transition amplitudes, Green's functions and generic matrix elements of time-ordered products of the metric. As a byproduct, similar results are also obtained for a scalar-field four-derivative interacting model. In this way, among other things, previous perturbative and background-dependent calculations are justified. The (quantum) quadratic gravity effective action, whose field equations determine the vacuum expectation value of the metric in the presence of a generic energy-momentum tensor, is constructed. The classical limit of the effective action turns out to be equivalent to the starting classical action of quadratic gravity, whose runaway rates were previously shown to be slow enough to be compatible with observations. Finally, the constructed non-perturbative and background-independent quantum quadratic gravity is applied to quantum cosmology to obtain a path-integral expression for the wave function of the universe, which satisfies a sort of Wheeler-DeWitt equation. This application allows us to understand at the quantum level why our universe is nearly homogeneous and isotropic.</description>

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy couples matter with geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theory for coupling matter fields with discrete geometry on higher-order networks, i.e. cell complexes. The key idea of the approach is to associate to a higher-order network the quantum entropy of its metric. Specifically we propose an action given by the quantum relative entropy between the metric of the higher-order network and the metric induced by the matter and gauge fields. The induced metric is defined in terms of the topological spinors and the discrete Dirac operators. The topological spinors, defined on nodes, edges and higher-dimensional cells, encode for the matter fields. The discrete Dirac operators act on topological spinors, and depend on the metric of the higher-order network as well as on the gauge fields via a discrete version of the minimal substitution. We derive the coupled dynamical equations for the metric, the matter and the gauge fields, providing an information theory principle to obtain the field theory equations in discrete curved space.</description>

      <title>A Radical Solution to the Hubble Tension Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble tension has proven to be stubbornly persistent, despite widespread efforts to relax it. As a possible resolution of this problem we propose a radical alternative to the way in which cosmological models are viewed. Specifically, we consider building cosmological models from spaces that exhibit intrinsic symmetries, rather than as space-times with explicit symmetry. This change in perspective allows statistical homogeneity and isotropy to be maintained, while relaxing some strong mathematical constraints that the standard approach imposes. We show that a Hubble tension arises naturally in our new approach, and that (as a corollary) a prediction can be made for the radial component of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations. Our prediction appears to be consistent with the DESI first-year data release, which has otherwise been interpreted as evidence for dynamical dark energy.</description>

      <title>Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.668^{+0.180}_{-0.169}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We show that redshift bins of DESI constraints allow $\Omega_m$ to wiggle at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ level with increasing effective redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian quantum cosmology with torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the Lorentzian gravitational path integral in the presence of non-vanishing torsion with the application of the Picard-Lefschetz theory for minisuperspaces corresponding to a number of phenomenological bouncing cosmological models as well as for the inflationary paradigm. It turns out that the semi-classical wave function derived from the saddle points of the path integral formalism coincides with the solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Intriguingly, our analysis showed that the relative probability, derived using these semi-classical wave functions favors universes with smaller values of torsion. Moreover, we find that in the inflationary case, non-zero values of a certain parity-violating component of the torsion enhance the power in the large physical length scales, which can have important observational implications. On the other hand, in the case of bouncing models, the power spectrum is characterized by an initial region of growth, an intermediate oscillatory region, and then again a final region of growth. The shape of the power spectrum in the initial and intermediate regions is sensitive to the abundance of the bounce-enabling matter and torsion, along with the initial wave function of the universe, while the final size modifies the behavior of the power spectrum in the smaller length scales.</description>

      <title>Constraining an Early Dark Energy Motivated Quintessential $\alpha$-Attractor Inflaton Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new model of quintessential $\alpha$ attractor inflation in conjunction with the features of non-oscillating early dark energy (EDE). Slow-roll plateau of this model is obtained, and analyzed in $k$-space, through the inflaton field and its first-order perturbation over a quasi de-Sitter metric fluctuation in the range $k=0.001-0.009$ Mpc$^{-1}$. The estimated cosmological parameters are found to obey Planck+BICEP2/Keck bounds with $68\%$ CL with the required trend of spectral tilts in the $n_s-r$ parametric space. We verify that, the inclusion of the EDE does not significantly affect the observed parameters. Its presence manifests in obtaining \textit{improved values} of the energy scale of inflation ($M$) and the present-day vacuum density ($V_{\Lambda}$). They are found to be $M=5.58\times 10^{-4}-4.57\times 10^{-3} M_P$ and $V_{\Lambda}=1.042\times 10^{-119}-4.688\times 10^{-116} M_P^4$.
  However, the $\alpha$-parameter is drastically constrained in two ways. Its lower end is fixed by the consistency analysis of the $k$-mode equations, while the upper end is evaluated as a derived expression of $\alpha$-cut-off through the aspects of EDE \textit{viz.,} the effects of \textit{Enhanced Symmetry Point} (ESP) in the potential during inflation. Improvised range of $\alpha$ is found to be $0.001\leq\alpha&lt;0.1$ for the model parameters $\gamma$ and $n$ lying within $0.01\leq\gamma\leq 0.09$ and $8\leq n\leq 10$ respectively. These ranges are shown to be essential for satisfying the COBE/Planck normalized energy scale of inflation and the Planck-value of present-day vacuum density. If we choose $\gamma=0.0818$ and $n=8$, then we get $0.001\leq\alpha\leq 0.0186$. Thus, the lower and upper limits of $\alpha$ are diminished substantially, compared with those in the earlier studies.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the analysis of some new static black hole solutions of Lovelock gravity with nonconstant curvature transverse section is presented. It will be shown that the finiteness of the charges and the action principle rely on the existence of constraints on the geometry of the transverse sections. Finally, in this context, some new sound solutions with nonconstant curvature transverse sections that deviate from the previously known geometries are discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the thermal properties of black holes using a new class of generalized entropy functions [K. Ourabah, Class. Quantum Grav., 41, 015010 (2024)]. At the fundamental level, these entropic forms are associated with alternative gravitational laws, within an entropic gravity framework. Our investigation revolves around three distinct entropy functions associated with the Yukawa Potential Correction, Non-local Gravity Correction, and Gradient Field Gravity Correction. Through comparative analysis, we study how such entropic constructs impact the thermodynamic behavior of black holes. For each case, we derive the stability thermodynamic conditions associated with the respective entropic constructs.</description>

      <title>Probing Baryogenesis in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of matter domination in the Universe is one of the most exciting open puzzles in particle physics and cosmology. Despite many theoretical developments, the actual reason behind baryon-antibaryon asymmetry is still unknown. Our aim here is to examine this phenomenon in the framework of modified gravity theories, which have impressively elucidated the contemporary accelerated expansion of the universe as well as the early phase. Consequently, this letter sets its sights on the task of constraining a specific variant of modified gravity, namely, $f(Q)$ gravity, in conjunction with gravitational baryogenesis. The Power Law model and recently proposed DGP-like $f(Q)$ models are considered to find the baryon-to-entropy ratio and compare them with the observed value, that is ${n_B}/s=9.42\times 10^{-11}$. Furthermore, we impose constraints on the additional degrees of freedom introduced by this modified theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>Horizon-penetrating form of parametrized metrics for static and stationary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rezzolla-Zhidenko (RZ) and Konoplya-Rezzolla-Zhidenko (KRZ) frameworks provide an efficient approach to characterize agnostically spherically symmetric or stationary black-hole spacetimes in arbitrary metric theories. In their original construction, these metrics were defined only in the spacetime region outside of the event horizon, where they can reproduce any black-hole metric with percent precision and a few parameters only. At the same time, numerical simulations of accreting black holes often require metric functions that are regular across the horizon, so that the inner boundary of the computational domain can be placed in a region that is causally disconnected from the exterior. We present a novel formulation of the RZ/KRZ parametrized metrics in coordinate systems that are regular at the horizon and defined everywhere in the interior. We compare the horizon-penetrating form of the KRZ and RZ metrics with the corresponding forms of the Kerr metric in Kerr-Schild coordinates and of the Schwarzschild metric in Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates, remarking the similarities and differences. We expect the horizon-penetrating formulations of the RZ/KRZ metrics to represent new tools to study via simulations the physical processes that occur near the horizon of an arbitrary black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the isotropic Universe in the presence of a free massless scalar field, playing the role of a physical clock. The Hilbert space is constructed via a direct analogy between the Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the minisuperspace and a relativistic scalar one in physical space. In particular, we show how the introduction of a "turning point" in the Universe evolution allows to overcome an intrinsic ambiguity in representing the expanding and collapsing Universe. In this way, the positive and negative frequencies are simply identified with time reversed states. The main subject of the present analysis is the construction of a horizon operator, whose quantum behavior is investigated when Polymer Quantum Mechanics is implemented to describe the asymptotic evolution near the initial singularity. The reason of this choice is motivated by the intrinsic spreading of localized wavepackets when the polymer dispersion relation governs the quantum dynamics. The evidence that the mean value of the quantum horizon operator follows its semiclassical behavior (corrected for polymerization) is a clear indication that a concept of causality can be restored also in the quantum cosmological picture.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes from collapsing antimatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:1704.01750v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper a simple (i.e. free of fine-tuning, etc.) new mechanism for primordial black hole formation based on the collapse of large antimatter systems in the early Universe is introduced. A peculiarity of this process is that, compared to their material counterparts, the collapse of large antimatter systems takes much less time due to the reversed thermodynamics of antimatter, an idea which has been proposed in our earlier paper.
  This model has several testable predictions. The first is that the photon-baryon ratio is roughly computable and is equal to $1.95\times 10^9$ which is quite close to its experimentally confirmed value. The second is that the mass of black holes arising from this mechanism is at least $10^5$-$10^6M_\odot$ hence they contribute to the super- or hypermassive end of the primordial black hole mass spectrum. The third prediction is that these sort of primordial black holes constitute at least $20\%$ of dark matter. Last but not least the observed current asymmetry of matter and antimatter, even if their presence in the Universe was symmetric in the beginning, acquires a natural explanation, too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the work of [2008.03319], we define a generally covariant max-entanglement wedge of a boundary region $B$, which we conjecture to be the bulk region reconstructible from $B$. We similarly define a covariant min-entanglement wedge, which we conjecture to be the bulk region that can influence the state on $B$. We prove that the min- and max-entanglement wedges obey various properties necessary for this conjecture, such as nesting, inclusion of the causal wedge, and a reduction to the usual quantum extremal surface prescription in the appropriate special cases. These proofs rely on one-shot versions of the (restricted) quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) that we conjecture to hold. We argue that these QFCs imply a one-shot generalized second law (GSL) and quantum Bousso bound. Moreover, in a particular semiclassical limit we prove this one-shot GSL directly using algebraic techniques. Finally, in order to derive our results, we extend both the frameworks of one-shot quantum Shannon theory and state-specific reconstruction to finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras, allowing nontrivial centers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\phi$CDM models provide an alternative to the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, while being physically better motivated. These models lead to a time-dependent speed of sound for dark energy that is difficult to replicate by $w$CDM parametrizations. We review the most up-to-date status of observational evidence for the $\phi$CDM models in this paper. We start with an overview of the motivation behind these classes of models, the basic mathematical formalism, and the different classes of models. We then present a compilation of recent results of applying different observational probes to constraining $\phi$CDM model parameters. Over the last twenty years, the precision of observational data has increased immensely, leading to ever tighter constraints. A combination of the recent measurements favors the spatially flat $\Lambda$CDM model, but a large class of $\phi$CDM models is still not ruled out.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound and scalar spectral index: Reconstructing inflation and reheating in a non-canonical theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we analyze the reconstruction of inflation in the framework of a non-canonical theory. In this sense, we study the viability of reconstructing the background variables assuming a non-lineal kinetic term given by $K(X,\phi)=X+g(\phi)X^2$, with $X$ the standard kinetic term associated to the scalar field $\phi$ and $g(\phi)$ an arbitrary coupling function. In order to achieve this reconstruction in the context of inflation, we assume the slow-roll approximation together with the parametrization of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the speed of sound $c_s$ as a function of the number of $e-$folds $N$. By assuming the simplest parametrizations for $n_s-1=-2/N$ and $c_s\propto N^{-\beta}$ with $\beta$ a constant, we find the reconstruction of the effective potential $V(\phi)$ and the coupling function $g(\phi)$ in terms of the scalar field. Besides, we study the reheating epoch by considering a constant equation of state parameter, where we determine the temperature and number of $e-$folds during the reheating epoch in terms of the reconstructed variables and the observational parameters. In this way, the parameter-space related to the reconstructed inflationary model are constrained during the epochs of inflation and reheating by assuming the current astronomical data from Planck and BICEP/Keck results.</description>

Abstract: The DESI year one observations can help probe new physics on cosmological scales. In light of the latest DESI BAO measurements, we constrain five popular cosmological scenarios including inflation, modified gravity, annihilating dark matter and interacting dark energy. Using a data combination of BICEP/Keck array, cosmic microwave background and DESI, we obtain the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ constraints on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r_{0.05}= 0.0176^{+0.0070}_{-0.0130}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.018^{+0.020}_{-0.017}$ indicating a beyond $2\sigma$ evidence of primordial gravitational waves. Using the combination of cosmic microwave background and DESI, we find a $2.4\sigma$ evidence for gravitational theories beyond the general relativity, shrink the dark matter annihilation cross-section by $12\%$ relative to cosmic microwave background, obtain a $1.6\sigma$ hint of the positive interaction between dark matter and dark energy implying that energy may be transferred from dark matter to dark energy in the dark sector of the universe, and give a clue of massive sterile neutrinos via the $2\sigma$ constraint on the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{eff}=3.16^{+0.26}_{-0.11}$ and the effective mass $m^{eff}_{\nu, sterile}&lt;0.52$ eV. Future DESI observations could go a step further to explore the nature of inflation, dark matter, dark energy and neutrinos, and test the validity of general relativity on cosmological scales.</description>
