      <title>Gravothermal collapse of self-interacting dark-matter halos with anisotropic velocity distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-gravitating galactic halos composed of self-interacting dark matter exhibit the formation of a highly dense core at the galactic center--a gravothermal collapse. Analytic models to describe this evolution have been developed and calibrated to numerical simulations initialized with isotropic particle velocity distributions, an assumption not necessarily warranted by the theory of halo formation. Here we study the dependence of the timescale for gravothermal collapse on the velocity distribution. To do so, we consider self-consistent initial conditions for halos with the same density distribution but with different velocity distributions. We consider models with constant anisotropy and with an anisotropy that increases with radius. The velocity distributions that we explore have collapse times that differ from that assuming isotropic distributions by more than a factor of two. We argue that these variations may depend on the global changes in velocity-dispersion profiles in these anisotropic models and not just on the degree of anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Clustering properties of the CatWISE2020 quasar catalogue and their impact on the cosmic dipole anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic dipole anomaly -- the observation of a significant mismatch between the dipole observed in the matter distribution and that expected given the kinematic interpretation of the cosmic microwave background dipole -- poses a serious challenge to the Cosmological Principle upon which the standard model of cosmology rests. Measurements of the dipole ($\ell=1$) in a given sample crucially depend on having control over other large-scale power ($\ell &gt; 1$) so as to avoid biases, in particular those potentially caused by correlations among multipoles during fitting, and those by local source clustering. Currently, the most powerful catalogue that exhibits the cosmic dipole anomaly is the sample of 1.6~million mid-infrared quasars derived from CatWISE2020. We therefore analyse clustering properties of this catalogue by performing an inference analysis of large-scale multipoles in real space, and by computing its angular power spectrum on small scales to test for convergence with $\Lambda$CDM. After accounting for the known trend of the quasar number counts with ecliptic latitude, we find that any other large-scale power is consistent with noise, find no evidence for the presence of an octupole ($\ell=3$) in the data, and quantify the clustering dipole's proportion to be marginal. Our results therefore reaffirm the anomalously high dipole in the distribution of quasars.</description>

      <title>The Local Distance Network: a community consensus report on the measurement of the Hubble constant at 1% precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct, empirical determination of the local value of the Hubble constant (H0) has markedly advanced thanks to improved instrumentation, measurement techniques, and distance estimators. However, combining determinations from different estimators is non-trivial, due to correlated calibrations and different analysis methodologies. Using covariance weighting and leveraging the broad and comprehensive community of experts, we constructed a rigorous and transparent Distance Network (DN) to find a consensus value and uncertainty for the local H0. All critically reviewed the available data sets, spanning parallaxes, detached eclipsing binaries, masers, Cepheids, the TRGB, Miras, JAGB stars, SN Ia, Surface Brightness Fluctuations, SN II, the Fundamental Plane, and Tully-Fisher relations and voted for indicators to define a `baseline' DN and others to assess robustness and sensitivity of the results. We provide open-source software and data products to support full transparency and future extensions of this effort. Our conclusions: 1) Local H0 is robustly determined, with first-rank indicators internally consistent within their uncertainties; 2) A covariance-weighted combination yields an uncertainty of 1.1% (baseline) or 0.9% (all estimators); 3) The contribution from SNe Ia is consistent across four current compilations of optical magnitudes or using NIR-only magnitudes; 4) Removing either Cepheids or TRGB has minimal effect; 5) Replacing SNe Ia with galaxy-based indicators changes H0 by less than 0.1 km/s/Mpc, while doubling its uncertainty; 6) The baseline result is H0=73.50+/-0.81 km/s/Mpc. Compared to early Universe results, our result differs by 7.1sigma from flat {\Lambda}CDM with Planck+SPT+ACT and 5.0 sigma with BBN+BAO (DESI2). A networked approach is invaluable for enabling further progress in accuracy and precision without overreliance on any single method, sample or group.</description>

      <title>No Evidence for a Dynamically Evolving Dark Energy Scenario: Tomographic Alcock-Paczy\'nski Test with Redshift-Space Correlation Function II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply an extended Alcock-Paczy\'nski (AP) test to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data to constrain the dark energy models with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy equation of state. The extended AP test method uses the full shape of redshift-space two-point correlation funcion(CF) as the standard shape in order to measure the expansion history of the universe. We calibrate the standard shape by using the cosmology-dependent nonlinear evolution of the CF shape in the Multiverse simulations. Further validation of the method and calibration of possible systematics are performed based on mock samples from the Horizon Run 4 simulation. Using the AP test alone, we constrain the flat CDM plus CPL-type dark energy model (flat $w^{\rm CPL}$CDM) to have $\Omega_m=0.289_{-0.029}^{+0.031}$, $w_0=-0.798_{-0.102}^{+0.192}$ and $w_a=-0.165_{-0.945}^{+0.610}$. The result does not show evidence for a dynamically evolving dark energy model. When combined with other results from the low-redshift universe, such as the PantheonPlus supernova compilation and DESI BAO data, the constraint on $w_a$ becomes $w_a=-0.124_{-0.368}^{+0.334}$, which is still consistent with zero.</description>

      <title>Bridging Simulators with Conditional Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new field-level emulator that bridges two simulators using unpaired simulation datasets. Our method leverages a flow-based approach to learn the likelihood transport from one simulator to the other. Since multiple transport maps exist, we employ Conditional Optimal Transport Flow Matching (COT-FM) to ensure that the transformation minimally distorts the underlying structure of the data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by bridging weak lensing simulators: a Lagrangian Perturbation Theory (LPT) to a N-body Particle-Mesh (PM). We demonstrate that our emulator captures the full correction between the simulators by showing that it enables full-field inference to accurately recover the true posterior, validating its accuracy beyond traditional summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Towards constraining cosmological parameters with SPT-3G observations of 25% of the sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The South Pole Telescope (SPT), using its third-generation camera, SPT-3G, is conducting observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) in temperature and polarization across approximately 10 000 deg$^2$ of the sky at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. This comprehensive dataset should yield stringent constraints on cosmological parameters. In this work, we explore its potential to address the Hubble tension by forecasting constraints from temperature, polarization, and CMB lensing on Early Dark Energy (EDE) and the variation in electron mass in spatially flat and curved universes. For this purpose, we investigate first whether analyzing the distinct SPT-3G observation fields independently, as opposed to as a single, unified region, results in a loss of information relevant to cosmological parameter estimation. We develop a realistic temperature and polarization likelihood pipeline capable of analyzing these fields in these two ways, and subsequently forecast constraints on cosmological parameters. Our findings indicate that any loss of constraining power from analyzing the fields separately is primarily concentrated at low multipoles ($\ell$ &lt; 50) and the overall impact on the relative uncertainty on standard $\Lambda$CDM parameters is minimal (&lt; 3%). Our forecasts suggest that SPT-3G data should improve by more than a factor of 200 and 3000 the Figure of Merit (FoM) of the EDE and the varying electron mass models, respectively, when combined with Planck data. The likelihood pipeline developed and used in this work is made publicly available online.</description>

      <title>The Harrison-Zeldovich attractor: From Planck to ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of Planck cosmology, the inflationary paradigm is best fitted towards the cosmological attractor scenarios, including the induced inflation, universal attractors, conformal attractors, and special attractors that are cataloged as $\xi$-models and $\alpha$-models. The recent hint from the ACT results pushes the scalar spectral index closer to the scale-invariant Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum, calling for a theoretical paradigm shift towards a Harrison-Zeldovich attractor, which is difficult to realize in the standard single-field slow-roll inflationary scenario. In this Letter, we achieve the Harrison-Zeldovich attractor scenario via nonminimal derivative coupling, attracting the monomial inflation, hilltop inflation, and $\alpha$-attractor E-model towards the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Heavy QCD Axions from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraints on heavy QCD axions. BBN offers a powerful probe of new physics that modifies the neutron-to-proton ratio during the process, thanks to the precisely measured primordial Helium-4 abundance. A heavy QCD axion provides an attractive target for this probe, because not only is it a well-motivated hypothetical particle by the strong CP problem, but also it dominantly decays to hadrons if kinematically allowed. A range of its lifetime is thus excluded where the hadronic decays would significantly alter the neutron-to-proton ratio. We compute axion-induced modification of the neutron-to-proton ratio, and obtain robust upper bounds on the axion lifetimes, as low as 0.017 s for the axion mass higher than 300 MeV. Remarkably, this is stronger than projected future CMB bounds via $N_{\rm eff}$. Our bounds are largely insensitive to uncertainties in hadronic cross sections and the axion's branching fractions into various hadrons, as well as to the precise value of the initial axion abundance. We also incorporate, for the first time, several key improvements, such as scattering processes by energetic $K_L$ and secondary hadrons, that can also be important for studying general hadronic injections during BBN, not limited to those from axion decays.</description>

      <title>Glimpsing Physics of Nano-Hz Gravitational Waves in Neutrinos from Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing evidence for nano-hertz gravitational waves, from NANOGrav and other observations, may be pointing to a cosmological first-order phase transition at temperatures of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)\;\mathrm{MeV}$. Such an interpretation requires dynamics beyond the Standard Model in this energy range. If so, it may well be the case that core-collapse supernova explosions would recreate the first-order phase transition leaving a unique imprint on the spectrum of neutrinos emitted in the initial few seconds. This scenario is also suggestive of a low-mass seesaw mechanism to explain neutrino masses. We outline the prospects for future observations of Galactic supernovae to uncover the signals of this scenario, which could get further confirmation with additional pulsar timing array data establishing the primordial origin of the observed nano-hertz gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Higher Curvature Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scalar potentials that arise from higher curvature corrections in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity and their connection to a dynamical species scale. Starting from general considerations in arbitrary dimensions, we show that at large field values, the scalar potential generated by an infinite series of curvature terms and the field dependent species scale arising from circle compactification both decay exponentially, in complementary ways. We identify conditions under which these two effects precisely balance out, giving rise to exponentially flat, plateau-like potentials. We additionally find a precise embedding of Starobinsky inflation consistent with the Swampland program, and we discuss possible implications the mechanism proposed could have for M and string theory.</description>

      <title>String Decomposition and Gravitational Waves in High-quality Axion Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion can successfully solve the strong CP problem under the condition that the Peccei-Quinn symmetry is respected to extremely high standard. We explore a class of gauge theories that accommodate a high-quality axion, known as the Barr-Seckel models, paying special attention to the cosmology of topological defects. In models with domain wall number equal to unity, we show that axion strings with winding number larger than one can always be decomposed into a number of unit-winding axion strings and pure gauge strings. This mechanism enables the axion string-wall network to be destroyed timely to render a viable cosmology. The subsequent decay of gauge strings into gravitational waves generically produces a double-plateau in frequency space allowing the mechanism to be tested by upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Spin Alignment with Tidal Fields in the SDSS-IV MaNGA Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal torque theory (TTT) predicts that galaxy spins are correlated with the surrounding tidal field, reflecting how angular momentum is acquired during structure formation. We present a new observational test of this prediction using the final data release of the SDSS-IV MaNGA integral field spectroscopy survey, which enables direct spin measurements from stellar and ionized gas kinematics for nearly 10,000 galaxies. Unlike previous studies that relied on filament orientations, we directly utilize the three-dimensional tidal field reconstructed from the galaxy distribution, providing a physically defined reference frame for the analysis. We find that massive galaxies tend to align their spins parallel to the intermediate axis of the tidal field, consistent with the prediction of the TTT. They also tend to orient perpendicular to the major axis, hinting at the possible influence of baryonic processes. In contrast, low-mass galaxies exhibit the opposite trend, with a transition mass of $M_*\sim10^{10}-10^{10.5}\,M_\odot$. No significant alignment is detected with respect to the minor axis across all stellar masses. We further examine the dependence on morphology and environment, finding that S0 and early-type spiral galaxies exhibit stronger alignment signals than late-type spirals. The alignment trend becomes particularly pronounced in regions of high tidal anisotropy and high overdensity. A mutual information analysis identifies these environmental factors as the dominant drivers of the observed trends. Our results provide the most direct empirical evidence to date for the connection between galaxy spins and the cosmic tidal field.</description>

      <title>Imperfect dark matter with higher derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a higher-derivative action for dark matter whose energy-momentum tensor describes an imperfect fluid with nonzero pressure, energy flux, and anisotropic stress. In the limit where the higher-derivative couplings are switched off, the energy-momentum tensor reduces to pressureless dust. A systematic derivation follows from extending the singular conformal transformation used in the mimetic dark matter scenario to include higher-derivative terms while the resulting action is general and does not rely on the mimetic framework. On a homogeneous cosmological background, the dynamics coincides with that of pressureless dust, while in the presence of inhomogeneities the higher-derivative terms generate nonzero acceleration and vorticity, making it possible to avoid the formation of caustic singularities even if the strong energy condition satisfies. In particular, within the mimetic realization these terms resolve the usual caustic pathology of mimetic dark matter.</description>

      <title>A Viable New Model for Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new model of the dark sector involving Dirac fermion dark matter, with axial coupling to a dark photon which provides a portal to Standard Model particles. In the non-relativistic limit, this implies that the dominant effective operator relevant to direct detection is ${\cal O}_8$. The resulting event rate for direct detection is suppressed by either the dark matter velocity or the momentum transfer. In this scenario there are much wider regions of the dark parameter space that are consistent with all of the existing constraints associated with thermal relic density, direct detection and collider searches.</description>

      <title>The luminosity function and clustering of bright quasars in the FLAMINGO cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are essential tools for studying the formation and evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. While they reproduce many key observed properties of galaxies, their limited volumes have hindered comprehensive studies of the AGN and quasar populations. In this work, we leverage the FLAMINGO simulation suite, focusing on its large $(2.8$ $\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ volume, to investigate two key observables of quasar activity: the quasar luminosity function (QLF) and quasar clustering. FLAMINGO reproduces the observed QLF at low redshift ($z \lesssim 1$) and for faint quasars ($L_\mathrm{bol} \lesssim 10^{45}$ $\mathrm{erg s^{-1}}$), but significantly underpredicts the abundance of bright quasars at $z \approx 1$-$3$. Introducing a 0.75 dex log-normal luminosity scatter to represent unresolved small-scale variability boosts the number of bright quasars by upscattering lower-luminosity systems, thereby improving agreement with observations at the bright end. A decomposition of the QLF by black hole mass reveals that this boost is primarily driven by low-mass black holes radiating above the Eddington limit. Nevertheless, limitations remain in fully reproducing the rise and decline of the bright quasar population over cosmic time and in matching the black hole masses inferred from quasar spectra. Thanks to FLAMINGO's large volume, we can robustly sample rare, luminous quasars and measure their spatial clustering for $\log_{10} L_\mathrm{bol}/\mathrm{erg s^{-1}} \gtrsim 45.5$. The simulation reproduces the observed clustering across $0 \lesssim z \lesssim 3$, and the reduced luminosity dependence introduced by scatter aligns with observational trends. However, it underpredicts the clustering strength at $z \approx 4$, consistent with other models and possibly reflecting high-redshift observational uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Modified Gravity with Nonminimal Curvature-Matter Couplings: A Framework for Gravitationally Induced Particle Creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modified gravity theories with a nonminimal coupling between curvature and matter offer a compelling alternative to dark energy and dark matter by introducing an explicit interaction between matter and curvature invariants. Two of the main consequences of such an interaction are the emergence of an additional force and the non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor, which can be interpreted as an energy exchange between matter and geometry. By adopting this interpretation, one can then take advantage of many different approaches in order to investigate the phenomenon of gravitationally induced particle creation. One of these approaches relies on the so-called irreversible thermodynamics of open systems formalism. By considering the scalar--tensor formulation of one of these theories, we derive the corresponding particle creation rate, creation pressure, and entropy production, demonstrating that irreversible particle creation can drive a late-time de Sitter acceleration through a negative creation pressure, providing a natural alternative to the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized second law of thermodynamics holds: the total entropy, from both the apparent horizon and enclosed matter, increases monotonically and saturates in the de Sitter phase, imposing constraints on the allowed particle production dynamics. Furthermore, we present brief reviews of other theoretical descriptions of matter creation processes. Specifically, we consider approaches based on the Boltzmann equation and quantum-based aspects and discuss the generalization of the Klein--Gordon equation, as well as the problem of its quantization in time-varying gravitational fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical instability of a self-gravitating thermal system in the quantum regime, where Fermi degeneracy pressure becomes significant. Using a truncated Fermi-Dirac distribution and solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, we identify marginally stable configurations following Chandrasekhar's criterion. While Fermi pressure stabilizes a system against gravitational collapse in Newtonian gravity, in general relativity it can instead drive the instability, enabling collapse even at low temperatures. We discuss implications for the formation of massive black holes in the early Universe through the gravothermal collapse of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation: Particle Factory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cosmological gravitational particle production (CGPP) in Higgs inflation, wherein the inflaton is a scalar field with quartic self-coupling $\lambda$ and a nonminimal coupling to gravity $\xi$, and which may, but need not be, the Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM). We find an explosive particle production peaked on a characteristic comoving wavenumber $k\sim \xi^{2/3} a H$ with a peak occupation number that scales with $\xi$. This new peak in production can easily dominate over the conventional (minimally coupled inflation) CGPP even for modest values of $\xi$. The results apply for a wide range of $\xi$, e.g., as low as $\xi=10$, which can be realized for the Standard Model Higgs given suitable RG flow of the quartic coupling. We discuss implications for late time relics such as dark matter.</description>

      <title>Lost in the FoG: Pitfalls of Models for Large-Scale Hydrogen Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01956v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale HI surveys and their cross-correlations with galaxy distributions have immense potential as cosmological probes. Interpreting these measurements requires theoretical models that must incorporate redshift-space distortions (RSDs), such as the Kaiser and fingers-of-God (FoG) effect, and differences in the tracer and matter distributions via the tracer bias. These effects are commonly approximated with assumptions that should be tested on simulated distributions. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical simulation suite IllustrisTNG to assess the performance of models of $z \leq 1$ HI auto and HI-galaxy cross-power spectra, finding that the models employed by recent observations introduce errors comparable to or exceeding their measurement uncertainties. In particular, neglecting FoG causes $\gtrsim 10\%$ deviations between the modeled and simulated power spectra at $k \gtrsim 0.1$ $h$ / Mpc, larger than assuming a constant bias which reaches the same error threshold at slightly smaller scales. However, even without these assumptions, models can still err by $\sim 10\%$ on relevant scales. These remaining errors arise from multiple RSD damping sources on HI clustering, which are not sufficiently described with a single FoG term. Overall, our results highlight the need for an improved understanding of RSDs to harness the capabilities of future measurements of HI distributions.</description>

      <title>The Topology of Rayleigh-Levy Flights in Two Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rayleigh-L\'evy flights are simplified cosmological tools which capture certain essential statistical properties of the cosmic density field, including hierarchical structures in higher-order correlations, making them a valuable reference for studying the highly non-linear regime of structure formation. Unlike standard Markovian processes, they exhibit long-range correlations at all orders. Following on recent work on one dimensional flights, this study explores the one-point statistics and Minkowski functionals (density PDF, perimeter, Euler characteristic) of Rayleigh-L\'evy flights in two dimensions. We derive the Euler characteristic in the mean field approximation and the density PDF and iso-field perimeter $W_{1}$ in beyond mean field calculations, and validate the results against simulations. The match is excellent throughout, even for fields with large variances, in particular when finite volume effects in the simulations are taken into account and when the calculation is extended beyond the mean field.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Redshift from Galaxy Clusters -- a Relativistic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The light that we receive from clusters of galaxies is redshifted by the presence of the clusters' gravitational potential. This effect, known as gravitational redshift, was first detected from a sample of stacked clusters in 2011, by taking redshift differences between the centre of each cluster and the respective member galaxies. However, the interpretation of this result was later challenged by several studies, which emphasised the possible influence of additional kinematic effects on the observed signal, like the transverse Doppler effect. In this work, we present the first derivation of all such effects within a relativistic framework, accurate to third order in the weak-field approximation. This framework allows us to correctly capture the hierarchy of terms on the scale of clusters and at the same time account for all relativistic effects. We compare our result with previous literature and show that some terms of the same order of the transverse Doppler effect were not properly included, leading to an overestimation of the kinematic contamination. In particular, we do not find any contribution arising from the so-called light-cone effect and obtain a larger correction due the motion of the central galaxy. Our derivation is independent of the Euler equation, providing a straightforward framework to test the weak equivalence principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a simple coupling between dark energy and dark matter can simultaneously address two distinct hints at new physics coming from cosmological observations. The first is the recent evidence from the DESI project and supernovae observations that the dark energy equation of state~$w$ is evolving over cosmic time from an earlier value that is~$&lt;-1$ to a present-day value~$&gt;-1$. The second observation is the so-called~$S_8$ tension, describing the suppression of the growth of matter overdensities compared to that expected in the~$\Lambda$CDM model. We propose a stable, technically natural particle physics implementation of this idea, in which dark matter consists of dark baryons in a strongly-coupled hidden sector, and the dark energy field is the associated dark axion. The time-variation of the dark matter mass results in an effective dark energy equation of state that exhibits a phantom crossing behavior consistent with recent results. It also results in a slight delay in matter-radiation equality, which suppresses the overall growth of density perturbations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Modelling of Lyman-{\alpha} opacity fluctuations during late reionization epoch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyman-$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations observed from high-redshift quasar spectra have been proven to be extremely successful in order to probe the late phase of the reionization epoch. For ideal modeling of these opacity fluctuations, one of the main challenges is to satisfy the extremely high dynamic range requirements of the simulation box, resolving the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest while probing the large cosmological scales. In this study, we adopt an efficient approach to model Lyman-$\alpha$ opacity fluctuations in a coarse simulation volume, utilizing the semi-numerical reionization model SCRIPT (including inhomogeneous recombination and radiative feedback) integrated with a realistic photoionization background fluctuation generating model. Our model crucially incorporates ionization and temperature fluctuations, which are consistent with the reionization model. After calibrating our method with respect to high-resolution full hydrodynamic simulation, Nyx, we compared the models with available observational data at the redshift range, $z=5.0-6.1$. With a fiducial reionization model (reionization end at $z=5.8$), we demonstrated that the observed scatter in the effective optical depth can be matched reasonably well by tuning the free parameters of our model, i.e., the effective ionizing photon mean free path and mean photoionization rate. We further pursued an MCMC-based parameter space exploration, utilizing the available data to put constraints on the above free parameters. Our estimation prefers a slightly higher photoionization rate and slightly lower mean free path than the previous studies, which is also a consequence of temperature fluctuations. This study holds significant promise for efficiently extracting important physical information about the Epoch of Reionization, utilizing the wealth of available and upcoming observational data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14077v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility of using galaxy cluster catalogues to provide redshift support for a gravitational-wave dark standard siren measurement of the Hubble constant $H_0$. We adapt the cosmology inference pipeline gwcosmo to handle galaxy cluster catalogues. Together with binary black holes from the GWTC-3, we use galaxy cluster data from the PSZ2 and the eRASS catalogues. With these catalogues, we obtain $H_0 = 77^{+10}_{-10}$ and $81^{+8}_{-8}\, \text{km}\, \text{s}^{-1}\, \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ respectively, which demonstrates improvements on precision by factors of 10% and 38% respectively over the traditional galaxy catalogue result. This exploratory work paves the way towards precise and accurate cosmography making use of distant compact binary mergers from upcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network and future gravitational-wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Addressing $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions within $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative framework to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions in cosmology. Focusing on three representative $f(Q)$ models, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using a combination of cosmological observations, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and CMB distance priors. Our results demonstrate that most of these models can yield higher values of $H_0$ than those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM, offering a partial alleviation of the tension. In addition, one model satisfies the condition $G_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt; G$, making it a promising candidate for addressing the $S_8$ tension. However, these improvements are accompanied by mild internal inconsistencies between different subsets of data, which limit the overall statistical preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Despite this, $f(Q)$ gravity remains a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, and our results motivate further exploration of extended or hybrid models that may reconcile all observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Braneworld Dark Energy in light of DESI DR2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observational results from the DESI collaboration reveal tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and favour a scenario in which dark energy (DE) decays over time. The DESI DR2 data also suggest that the DE equation of state (EoS) may have been phantom-like ($w &lt; - 1$) in the past, evolving to $w &gt; - 1$ at present, implying a recent crossing of the phantom divide at $w = - 1$. Scalar field models of DE naturally emerge in ultraviolet-complete theories such as string theory, which is typically formulated in higher dimensions. In this work, we investigate a broad class of $thawing~scalar~field~models$, including the simple quadratic, quartic, exponential, symmetry-breaking and axion potentials, propagating on a (4+1)-dimensional ghost-free phantom braneworld, and demonstrate that their effective EoS exhibits a phantom-divide crossing. Alongside the Hubble parameter and EoS of DE, we also analyse the evolution of the $Om$ diagnostic, and demonstrate that the time dependence of these quantities is in excellent agreement with the DESI DR2 observations. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive parameter estimation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the $\chi^2$ values for all our models are remarkably close to that of the widely used CPL parametrisation, indicating that our models fit the data very well.</description>

      <title>oLIMpus: An Effective Model for Line Intensity Mapping Auto- and Cross- Power Spectra in Cosmic Dawn and Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is emerging as a powerful probe of the high-redshift Universe, with a growing number of LIM experiments targeting various spectral lines deep into the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn. A key remaining challenge is the consistent and efficient modeling of the diverse emission lines and of the observables of different surveys. Here, we present oLIMpus, a fully analytical effective model to study LIM auto- and cross- power spectra. Our work builds on the 21-cm effective model presented in Zeus21, applying it to star-forming lines and improving it in different aspects. Our code accounts for shot noise and linear redshift-space distortions and it includes by default prescriptions for OII, OIII, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, CII, CO line luminosities, together with the 21-cm model inherited from Zeus21. Beyond auto- and cross-power spectra, oLIMpus can produce mock coeval boxes and lightcones, and with a computational time of $\sim s$ it is ideal for parameter-space exploration and inference. Its modular implementation makes it easy to customize and extend, enabling various applications, such as MCMC analyses and consistent multi-line cross-correlations.</description>

      <title>Prospects for searching for sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy cosmologies using joint observations of gravitational waves and $\gamma$-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, GW standard siren observations from binary neutron star mergers provide a powerful tool for probing the expansion history of the universe. Since sterile neutrinos can influence cosmic evolution by modifying the radiation content and suppressing structure formation, GW standard sirens offer promising prospects for constraining sterile neutrino properties within a cosmological framework. Building on this, we investigate the prospects for detecting sterile neutrinos in dynamical dark energy (DE) models using joint observations from 3G GW detectors and a future short gamma-ray burst detector, such as a THESEUS-like telescope. We consider three DE models: the $w$CDM, holographic DE (HDE), and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) models. Our results show that the properties of DE can influence the constraints on sterile neutrino parameters. Moreover, the inclusion of GW data significantly improves constraints on both sterile neutrino parameters and other cosmological parameters across all three models, compared to the current limits derived from CMB+BAO+SN (CBS) observations. When GW data are included into the CBS dataset, a preference for $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$ emerges at approximately the $1\sigma$ level in the $w$CDM and CPL models, and reaches about $3\sigma$ in the HDE model. Moreover, the upper limits on $m_{\nu,{\rm sterile}}^{\rm eff}$ are reduced by approximately 13%, 75%, and 3% in the $w$CDM, HDE, and CPL models, respectively.</description>

      <title>A smooth filament origin for distant prolate galaxies seen by JWST and HST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial gravitational collapse of Dark Matter and gas forms a universal filamentary network where the first galaxies form, with shapes and sizes that depend on the choice of Dark Matter. Claims from deep space imaging surveys that elongated galaxies predominate at $z &gt; 3$ are examined here by comparison with detailed hydrodynamical simulations of Cold Dark Matter (CDM), Warm Dark Matter (WDM), and Wave/Fuzzy Dark Matter, $\psi$DM. For CDM and WDM we have sufficient volume, $10^{3}\,\mathrm{Mpc/h}^{3}$, to generate galaxies with stellar masses $&gt; 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ at $z &gt; 2$, allowing comparison with the CEERS and CANDELS surveys. We find the observed tendency towards elongated, prolate-shaped young galaxies is well matched by WDM, from material accreted along smooth filaments during the first $\simeq 500\,\mathrm{Myr}$, with little dependence on stellar mass. This contrasts with CDM, where the stellar morphology is mainly spheroidal, formed from merging of fragmented filaments. For CDM, several subhalos are predicted to be visible, whereas for WDM and $\psi$DM, early merging is rare. Our findings show how the shapes and sizes of early galaxies are sensitive to the smoothness of the underlying filament network, providing a new constraint on the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid. We have shown that the minimal size $r$ that the ellipsoid can reach during collapse depends on its initial eccentricity $e_0$ as $r\propto e_0^\nu$, where $\nu \approx 15/8$, and this dependence is very universal. We have estimated the parameters (in particular, the initial eccentricity) of a homogeneous pressureless ellipsoid, whereat it collapses directly into a black hole.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of long-duration gravitational wave signals originating from Galactic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of quasi-monochromatic, long-duration (continuous) gravitational wave radiation emitted by, e.g., asymmetric rotating neutron stars in our Galaxy requires a long observation time to distinguish it from the detector's noise. If this signal is additionally microlensed by a lensing object located in the Galaxy, its magnitude would be temporarily magnified, which may lead to its discovery and allow probing of the physical nature of the lensing object and the source. We study the observational effect of microlensing of continuous gravitational wave signals for Galactic sources and lenses in the point mass lens approximation. In particular, we examine the regions of the parameter space that are promising for lensed CW searches, and perform example simulations to demonstrate how the lensing effect affects the continuous-wave signal. We show that an analytical lensing pattern can be identified from the lensed continuous wave signal using the Time-Domain F-statistic search, as the estimated signal-to-noise ratio in each time-domain segment scales directly with the amplification factor.</description>

      <title>Environmental dependence of galaxy properties in the southern GAMA regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using data from the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, we investigate how galaxy properties correlate with the local environment, focusing on the two southern regions of the survey (G02 and G23) that have not previously been examined in this context. We employ two-point and marked correlation functions to quantify the environmental dependence of galaxy color, stellar mass, luminosity across the $u$, $g$, $r$, $J$, and $K$ bands, as well as star formation rate (SFR) and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We also assess the impact of redshift incompleteness and cosmic variance on these clustering measurements. Our results show that $u-r$ and $g-r$ colors are most strongly correlated with local overdensity, followed by stellar mass. The sSFR exhibits a clear inverse relationship with density of the environment, consistent with the trend observed for $u$-band luminosity, which traces young stellar populations. In contrast, galaxies brighter in the $g$, $J$, and $K$ bands preferentially inhabit denser regions. By comparing our measurements from the southern regions with those from the equatorial regions of GAMA, we find that cosmic variance does not significantly influence our conclusions. However, redshift incompleteness affects the clustering measurements, as revealed through comparisons of subsets within the G02 region. The measured correlations provide key constraints for models of galaxy assembly across mass and environment, while the environmental trends in color and near-infrared luminosity offer a means to trace stellar mass growth and quenching with redshift.</description>

      <title>Collisionless relaxation to equilibrium distributions in cold dark matter halos: origin of the NFW profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems such as cold dark matter halos are known to harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. The origin of such states has been a persistent mystery, particularly because the physics of collisionless relaxation has remained poorly understood. To solve this long-standing problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation that describes the secular evolution of the mean coarse-grained distribution function $f_0$ of accreted matter in the fluctuating force field of a spherical isotropic halo. The diffusion coefficient not only depends on the fluctuation power spectrum but also on the evolving potential of the system, which reflects the self-consistency of the problem. Diffusive heating in the pre-assembled halo develops an $r^{-\gamma}$ inner density cusp, accretion and relaxation in which develops an $r^{-\beta}$ outer fall-off with $\beta \approx 5 - 2\gamma$ in the quasi-steady state. Spherical collapse theory dictates that a quasi-steady outer halo must settle to $\beta \approx 3$, for which the mass enclosed within a shell barely changes with time. This implies that $\gamma\approx 1$, which is possible in the quasilinear framework only if (i) the pre-assembled halo harbors an $r^{-\gamma_{\mathrm{P}}}$ profile with $\gamma_{\mathrm{P}} \gtrsim 0.5$, (ii) its fluctuations are correlated in time (red noise), and (iii) the initial value of $\gamma$ is smaller than $1$, implying that the $r^{-1}$ cusp is a neutral equilibrium. We demonstrate for the first time how the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile emerges as a quasi-steady state of collisionless relaxation.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of dark matter models in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates using five years of microlensing data from the OGLE survey. While the majority of OGLE's $\sim\!2000$ microlensing events are well-explained by stellar populations such as brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and compact remnants, a subset of six ultrashort-timescale events ($t_E \sim 0.1\text{--}0.3~\mathrm{days}$) may signal the presence of PBHs. Building upon prior work that adopted the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) DM profile, we examine how alternative DM halo models -- specifically the Einasto and Burkert profiles, affect microlensing predictions and the constraints on PBH abundance. In light of kinematic data of Milky Way, we could obtain the range of ($r_s, \rho_s$) for both profiles. We computed differential microlensing event rates for both profiles, using the main-sequence star rate as an observational benchmark. Our results show that neither the Einasto nor Burkert profiles reproduce the distribution of main-sequence star events, yet both allow for viable explanations of the ultrashort-timescale events with PBH masses $M_{\mathrm{PBH}} \sim 10^{-5} M_\odot$. Using a Poisson likelihood analysis under the null hypothesis that no PBH is observed in OGLE dataset, we derive $95\%~\text{C.L.}$ upper and lower bounds on $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ for both profiles, finding that the constraints are significantly relaxed under Burkert profiles compared to the NFW case. These results show the sensitivity of PBH constraints to the assumed DM halo structure and highlight the importance of accurately modeling the inner Galactic density profile to robustly assess PBH dark matter scenarios.</description>

      <title>Inflation Model Based on Virasoro Squeezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for realizing slow-roll inflation that is fully consistent with observational data, based on conformal transformations acting exclusively on a complex scalar field -- without coupling to the gravitational sector. These transformations generically produce a plateau in the inflaton potential, as guaranteed by the maximum modulus theorem, thereby naturally satisfying the slow-roll conditions.
  Our framework utilizes squeezing operations generated by the Virasoro algebra without central extension, as developed in our earlier work. The resulting inflationary potentials depend on the Virasoro mode $n$, the power $m$ of the original potential, and the squeezing parameter $\theta$.
  We present approximate analytical expressions at leading order for the special case $n=-2$, and perform numerical analyses for both $n=-2$ and other values of $n$. These reveal parameter regimes in which the predicted cosmological observables $(n_{s},r)$ align remarkably well with current CMB measurements.</description>

      <title>On the observation of cosmic strings via gravitational-wave lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for detecting gravitational-wave signals lensed by cosmic strings (CSs), addressing a key gap in current searches. CSs, whose detection would provide a unique probe of high-energy physics and the early Universe, possess distinct topological and geometric features that require a dedicated search strategy. Our approach employs a full-wave transmission factor, expressed analytically via Fresnel integrals, which captures the characteristic diffraction and interference effects of the conical spacetime around a straight CS. We contrast CS lensing with the well-studied point mass lens (PML) model, highlighting their fundamental differences: CS lensing depends on cosmological distances, string tension $\Delta$, and wavelength $\lambda$, and produces two non-amplified images set by the global conical geometry. In contrast, PML lensing is governed by the distance-independent ratio $\sim M_{Lz}/\lambda$, where $M_{Lz}$ represents the redshifted mass of the lens, with image properties derived from the lens equation. For BBH mergers lensed by CSs, we show that the waveforms exhibit a characteristic beating pattern or time-separated, exact replicas. We derive a detectability bound on the string tension and, using Bayesian model selection, demonstrate that CS lensing is distinguishable from both unlensed and PML-lensed signals across a wide region of parameter space.</description>
