      <title>DBTuneSuite: An Extendible Experimental Suite to Test the Time Performance of Multi-layer Tuning Options on Database Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DBTuneSuite is a suite of experiments on four widely deployed free database systems to test their performance under various query/upsert loads and under various tuning options. The suite provides: (i) scripts to generate data and to install and run tests, making it expandable to other tests and systems; (ii) suggestions of which systems work best for which query types; and (iii) quantitative evidence that tuning options widely used in practice can behave very differently across systems. This paper is most useful for database system engineers, advanced database users and troubleshooters, and students.</description>

      <title>Delta Fair Sharing: Performance Isolation for Multi-Tenant Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern storage systems, often deployed to support multiple tenants in the cloud, must provide performance isolation. Unfortunately, traditional approaches such as fair sharing do not provide performance isolation for storage systems, because their resources (e.g., write buffers and read caches) exhibit high preemption delays. These delays lead to unacceptable spikes in client tail latencies, as clients may be forced to wait arbitrarily long to receive their fair share of resources.
  We introduce Delta Fair Sharing, a family of algorithms for sharing resources with high preemption delays. These algorithms satisfy two key properties: $\delta$-fairness, which bounds a client's delay in receiving its fair share of resources to $\delta$ time units, and $\delta$-Pareto-efficiency, which allocates unused resources to clients with unmet demand. Together, these properties capture resource-acquisition delays end-to-end, bound well-behaved clients' tail-latency spikes to $\delta$ time units, and ensure high utilization. We implement such algorithms in FAIRDB, an extension of RocksDB. Our evaluation shows that FAIRDB isolates well-behaved clients from high-demand workloads better than state-of-the-art alternatives.</description>

      <title>ConStruM: A Structure-Guided LLM Framework for Context-Aware Schema Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Column matching is a central task in reconciling schemas for data integration. Column names and descriptions are valuable for this task. LLMs can leverage such natural-language schema metadata. However, in many datasets, correct matching requires additional evidence beyond the column itself. Because it is impractical to provide an LLM with the entire schema metadata needed to capture this evidence, the core challenge becomes to select and organize the most useful contextual information.
  We present ConStruM, a structure-guided framework for budgeted evidence packing in schema matching. ConStruM constructs a lightweight, reusable structure in which, at query time, it assembles a small context pack emphasizing the most discriminative evidence. ConStruM is designed as an add-on: given a shortlist of candidate targets produced by an upstream matcher, it augments the matcher's final LLM prompt with structured, query-specific evidence so that the final selection is better grounded. For this purpose, we develop a context tree for budgeted multi-level context retrieval and a global similarity hypergraph that surfaces groups of highly similar columns (on both the source and target sides), summarized via group-aware differentiation cues computed online or precomputed offline. Experiments on real datasets show that ConStruM improves matching by providing and organizing the right contextual evidence.</description>

      <title>ALER: An Active Learning Hybrid System for Efficient Entity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entity Resolution (ER) is a critical task for data integration, yet state-of-the-art supervised deep learning models remain impractical for many real-world applications due to their need for massive, expensive-to-obtain labeled datasets. While Active Learning (AL) offers a potential solution to this "label scarcity" problem, existing approaches introduce severe scalability bottlenecks. Specifically, they achieve high accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs by re-training complex models from scratch or solving NP-hard selection problems in every iteration. In this paper, we propose ALER, a novel, semi-supervised pipeline designed to bridge the gap between semantic accuracy and computational scalability. ALER eliminates the training bottleneck by using a frozen bi-encoder architecture to generate static embeddings once and then iteratively training a lightweight classifier on top. To address the memory bottleneck associated with large-scale candidate pools, we first select a representative sample of the data and then use K-Means to partition this sample into semantically coherent chunks, enabling an efficient AL loop. We further propose a hybrid query strategy that combines "confused" and "confident" pairs to efficiently refine the decision boundary while correcting high-confidence errors.Extensive evaluation demonstrates ALER's superior efficiency, particularly on the large-scale DBLP dataset: it accelerates the training loop by 1.3x while drastically reducing resolution latency by a factor of 3.8 compared to the fastest baseline.</description>

      <title>The Monotone Priority System: Foundations of Contract-Specific Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern blockchain applications benefit from the ability to specify sequencing constraints on the transactions that interact with them. This paper proposes a principled and axiomatically justified way of adding sequencing constraints on smart contract function calls that balances expressivity with the tractability of block production. Specifically, we propose a system in which contract developers are allowed to set an integer global priority for each of their calls, so long as that the call's chosen priority is no higher than the priority of any of its referenced calls. Block builders must then simply sequence transactions in priority order (from high to low priority), breaking ties however they would like. We show that this system is the unique system that satisfies five independent axioms.</description>

      <title>GPU-Augmented OLAP Execution Engine: GPU Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern OLAP systems have mitigated I/O bottlenecks via storage-compute separation and columnar layouts, but CPU costs in the execution layer (especially Top-K selection and join probe) are emerging as new bottlenecks at scale. This paper proposes a hybrid architecture that augments existing vectorized execution by selectively offloading only high-impact primitives to the GPU. To reduce data movement, we use key-only transfer (keys and pointers) with late materialization. We further introduce a Risky Gate (risk-aware gating) that triggers offloading only in gain/risk intervals based on input size, transfer, kernel and post-processing costs, and candidate-set complexity (K, M). Using PostgreSQL microbenchmarks and GPU proxy measurements, we observe improved tail latency (P95/P99) under gated offloading compared to always-on GPU offloading. This work extends the risk-aware gating principle used for optimizer-stage GPU-assisted measurement (arXiv:2512.19750) to execution-layer OLAP primitives.</description>

      <title>[Extended Version] ArceKV: Towards Workload-driven LSM-compactions for Key-Value Store Under Dynamic Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Key-value stores underpin a wide range of applications due to their simplicity and efficiency. Log-Structured Merge Trees (LSM-trees) dominate as their underlying structure, excelling at handling rapidly growing data. Recent research has focused on optimizing LSM-tree performance under static workloads with fixed read-write ratios. However, real-world workloads are highly dynamic, and existing workload-aware approaches often struggle to sustain optimal performance or incur substantial transition overhead when workload patterns shift. To address this, we propose ElasticLSM, which removes traditional LSM-tree structural constraints to allow more flexible management actions (i.e., compactions and write stalls) creating greater opportunities for continuous performance optimization. We further design Arce, a lightweight compaction decision engine that guides ElasticLSM in selecting the optimal action from its expanded action space. Building on these components, we implement ArceKV, a full-fledged key-value store atop RocksDB. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ArceKV outperforms state-of-the-art compaction strategies across diverse workloads, delivering around 3x faster performance in dynamic scenarios.</description>
