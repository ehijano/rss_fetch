      <title>The stellar halo of the Milky Way traced by blue horizontal-branch stars in the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We select blue-horizontal branch stars (BHBs) from the internal data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program to reveal the global structure of the Milky Way (MW) stellar halo. The data are distributed over $\sim 1,100$~deg$^2$ area in the range of $18.5&lt;g&lt;24.5$~mag, so that candidate BHBs are detectable over a Galactocentric radius of $r \simeq 36-575$~kpc. In order to select most likely BHBs by removing blue straggler stars and other contaminants in a statistically significant manner, we develop and apply an extensive Bayesian method, as described in \citet{Fukushima2019}. Our sample can be fitted to either a single power-law profile with an index of $\alpha=4.11^{+0.18}_{-0.18}$ or a broken power-law profile with an index of $\alpha_{\rm in}=3.90^{+0.24}_{-0.30}$ at $r$ below a broken radius of $r_{\rm b}=184^{+118}_{-66}$ kpc and a very steep slope of $\alpha_{\rm out}=9.1^{+6.8}_{-3.6}$ at $r&gt;r_{\rm b}$; the statistical difference between these fitting profiles is small. Both profiles are found to show prolate shapes having axial ratios of $q=1.47^{+0.30}_{-0.33}$ and $1.56^{+0.34}_{-0.23}$, respectively. We also find a signature of the so-called "splashback radius" for the candidate BHBs, which can reach as large as $r \sim 575$~kpc, although it is still inconclusive owing to rather large distance errors in this faintest end of the sample. Our results suggest that the MW stellar halo consists of the two overlapping components: the {\it in situ} inner halo showing a relatively steep radial density profile and the {\it ex situ} outer halo with a shallower profile, being characteristic of a component formed from accretion of small stellar systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the fate of primordial discs in Milky Way-sized galaxies with the GigaEris simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations with JWST and ALMA have unveiled galaxies with regular discs at significantly higher redshifts than previously expected. This appears to be in contrast with constraints on the stellar populations of the Milky Way, suggesting that the bulk of the Galactic thin disc formed after $z=1$, and raises questions about the history, evolution, and survivability of primordial discs. Here, we use GigaEris, a state-of-the-art $N$-body, hydrodynamical, cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation with a billion particles within the virial radius, to delve into the formation of the early kinematically cold discs (KCDs), defined by their ratio between the mean rotational velocity and the radial velocity dispersion, of a Milky Way-sized galaxy at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4$. Our analysis reveals a primarily inward migration pattern for disc stars formed at $z \gtrsim 6$, turning into a mix of inward and outward migration at later times. Stars migrating outwards undergo minimal kinematic heating, and might be identified as part of the thin disc forming at much later epochs. We find that approximately 76 per cent of all stars formed in the KCD at $z \sim 7$ become part of a pseudo-bulge by $z = 4.4$. This proportion decreases to below 10 per cent for KCD stars formed at $z \lesssim 5$. The inward migration of stars born in our KCDs at $z \gtrsim 4$ deviates from the expected inside-out formation scenario of thin discs at lower redshifts. Our results suggest a novel ``two-phase'' disc formation process, whereby the early disc transforms primarily into the pseudo-bulge within less than a billion years, whereas the present-day disc forms subsequently from higher-angular momentum material accreted at later times.</description>

      <title>The properties of AGN in dwarf galaxies identified via SED fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given their dominance of the galaxy number density, dwarf galaxies are central to our understanding of galaxy formation. While the incidence of AGN and their impact on galaxy evolution has been extensively studied in massive galaxies, much less is known about the role of AGN in the evolution of dwarfs. We search for radiatively-efficient AGN in the nearby (0.1 &lt; z &lt; 0.3) dwarf (10^8 MSun &lt; M &lt; 10^10 MSun) population, using SED fitting (via Prospector) applied to deep ultraviolet to mid-infrared photometry of 508 dwarf galaxies. Around a third (32 +/- 2 per cent) of our dwarfs show signs of AGN activity. We compare the properties of our dwarf AGN to control samples, constructed from non-AGN, which have the same distributions of redshift and stellar mass as their AGN counterparts. KS tests between the AGN and control distributions indicates that the AGN do not show differences in their distances to nodes, filaments and nearby massive galaxies from their control counterparts. This indicates that AGN triggering in the dwarf regime is not strongly correlated with local environment. The fraction of AGN hosts with early-type morphology and those that are interacting are also indistinguishable from the controls within the uncertainties, suggesting that interactions do not play a significant role in inducing AGN activity in our sample. Finally, the star formation activity in dwarf AGN is only slightly lower than that in their control counterparts, suggesting that the presence of radiatively-efficient AGN does not lead to significant, prompt quenching of star formation in these systems.</description>

      <title>[OIII] emission in z=2 quasars with and without Broad Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the links between different phases of outflows from active galactic nuclei is a key goal in extragalactic astrophysics. Here we compare [OIII] $\lambda\lambda$4960,5008 outflow signatures in quasars with and without Broad Absorption Lines (BALs), aiming to test how the broad absorption troughs seen in the rest-frame ultraviolet are linked to the narrow line region outflows seen in the rest-frame optical. We present new near-infrared spectra from Magellan/FIRE which cover [OIII] in 12 quasars with 2.1 &lt; z &lt; 2.3, selected to have strong outflow signatures in CIV $\lambda$1550. Combining with data from the literature, we build a sample of 73 BAL, 115 miniBAL and 125 non-BAL QSOs with 1.5 &lt; z &lt; 2.6. The strength and velocity width of [OIII] correlate strongly with the CIV emission properties, but no significant difference is seen in the [OIII] emission-line properties between the BALs, non-BALs and miniBALs once the dependence on CIV emission is taken into account. A weak correlation is observed between the velocities of CIV BALs and [OIII] emission, which is accounted for by the fact that both outflow signatures correlate with the underlying CIV emission properties. Our results add to the growing evidence that BALs and non-BALs are drawn from the same parent population and are consistent with a scenario wherein BAL troughs are intermittent tracers of persistent quasar outflows, with a part of such outflow becoming optically thick along our line-of-sight for sporadic periods of time within which BALs are observed.</description>

      <title>SDSS1335+0728: The awakening of a $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy SDSS1335+0728, which had exhibited no prior optical variations during the preceding two decades, began showing significant nuclear variability in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) alert stream from December 2019 (as ZTF19acnskyy). Its behaviour suggests that SDSS1335+0728 hosts a $\sim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ black hole (BH) that is currently in the process of `turning on'. We present a multi-wavelength photometric analysis and spectroscopic follow-up performed with the aim of better understanding the origin of the nuclear variations detected in SDSS1335+0728. We used archival photometry and spectroscopic data to study the state of SDSS1335+0728 prior to December 2019, and new observations from Swift, SOAR/Goodman, VLT/X-shooter, and Keck/LRIS taken after its turn-on to characterise its current state. We find that: (a) since 2021, the UV flux is four times brighter than the flux reported by GALEX in 2004; (b) since June 2022, the mid-infrared flux has risen more than two times, and the W1-W2 WISE colour has become redder; (c) since February 2024, the source has begun showing X-ray emission; (d) the narrow emission line ratios are now consistent with a more energetic ionising continuum; (e) broad emission lines are not detected; and (f) the [OIII] line increased its flux $\sim 3.6$ years after the first ZTF alert, which implies a relatively compact narrow-line-emitting region. We conclude that the variations observed in SDSS1335+0728 could be either explained by an AGN that is just turning on or by an exotic tidal disruption event (TDE). If the former is true, SDSS1335+0728 is one of the strongest cases of an AGN observed in the process of activating. If the latter, it would correspond to the longest and faintest TDE ever observed (or another class of still unknown nuclear transient). Future observations of SDSS1335+0728 are crucial to further understand its behaviour.</description>

      <title>The Nearly Universal Disk Galaxy Rotation Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Universal Rotation Curve (URC) of disk galaxies was originally proposed to predict the shape and amplitude of any rotation curve (RC) based solely on photometric data. Here, the URC is investigated with an extensive set of spatially-resolved rotation curves drawn from the PROBES-I, PROBES-II, and MaNGA data bases with matching multi-band surface brightness profiles from the DESI-LIS and WISE surveys for 3,846 disk galaxies. Common URC formulations fail to achieve an adequate level of accuracy to qualify as truly universal over fully sampled RCs. We develop neural network (NN) equivalents for the proposed URCs which predict RCs with higher accuracy, showing that URC inaccuracies are not due to insufficient data but rather non-optimal formulations or sampling effects. This conclusion remains even if the total RC sample is pruned for symmetry. The latest URC prescriptions and their NN equivalents trained on our sub-sample of 579 disk galaxies with symmetric RCs perform similarly to the URC/NN trained on the complete data sample. We conclude that a URC with an acceptable level of accuracy ($\Delta V_{\rm circ} \lesssim15$ per cent) at all radii would require a detailed modelling of a galaxy's central regions and outskirts (e.g., for baryonic effects leading to contraction or expansion of any dark-matter-only halo).</description>

      <title>Advancing Stellar Streams as a Dark Matter Probe -- I: Evolution of the CDM subhalo population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams, long thin streams of stars, have been used as sensitive probes of dark matter substructure for over two decades. Gravitational interactions between dark matter substructures and streams lead to the formation of low density "gaps" in streams, with any given stream typically containing no more than a few such gaps. Prior models for the statistics of such gaps have relied on several simplifying assumptions for the properties of the subhalo population in the cold dark matter scenario. With the expected forthcoming increase in the number of streams, and gaps, observed, in this work we develop a more detailed model for the statistics of subhalos interacting with streams, and test some of the assumptions made in prior works. Instead of using simple fits to N-body estimates of subhalo population statistics at z = 0 as in previous work, we make use of realizations of time-dependent subhalo populations generated from a fully physical model, incorporating structure formation, and subhalo orbital evolution, including tidal heating and stripping physics, which has been carefully calibrated to match results of cosmological N-body simulations. We find that this model predicts up to 60% more gaps on average in Pal-5-like streams than prior works.</description>

      <title>JADES: Physical properties of Ly$\alpha$ and non-Ly$\alpha$ emitters at z ~ 4.8-9.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs) and non-Lyman-alpha emitters (non-LAEs) at z$\sim$4.8--9.6 via a stacking analysis of 253 JWST/NIRSpec spectra of galaxies observed as part of the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). We identify a sample of 42 LAEs with the equivalent width of Ly$\alpha$ $\gtrsim$20\AA and a sample of 211 non-LAEs, divide each sample further via the median redshift of the LAEs (z~6.3), and create composite spectra using the low and medium resolution spectra from NIRSpec. We estimate physical quantities such as dust extinction, UV continuum slope $\beta$, electron temperatures, ionization parameter, escape fraction of Ly$\alpha$ and Lyman Continuum, and the photon production rate for each bin/stack. The existing dust-extinction laws do not appear to be valid at these epochs. The emission line ratio analyses show that active galactic nuclei might dominate all sub-samples, irrespective of Ly$\alpha$ emission. LAEs show much higher [OIII]/[OII] and low [OII]/H$\delta$ at z$\lesssim$6.3 compared to non-LAEs, but these line ratios are not sufficient to distinguish the two populations at z$&gt;$6.3. However, the LAEs samples show large EW([OIII]4959, 5007) ($&gt;$1000\AA) compared to the non-LAEs sample at all redshifts. CIV/Ly$\alpha$ and CIV/CIII] for LAE population at z$\lesssim$6.3 is $\sim$a factor of 5 larger than that for LAE population at z$&gt;$6.3. The ionizing radiation for LAEs is hard, as revealed from several diagnostics, including CIV detection, high [OIII]/[OII] ($&gt;$8), and large values of $\xi^{\star}_{ion}$.</description>

      <title>A 260 pc resolution ALMA map of HCN(1-0) in the galaxy NGC 4321</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star formation rate (SFR) is tightly connected to the amount of dense gas in molecular clouds. However, it is not fully understood how the relationship between dense molecular gas and star formation varies within galaxies and in different morphological environments. In this work, we study dense gas and star formation in the nearby spiral galaxy NGC 4321 to test how the amount of dense gas and its ability to form stars varies with environmental properties at 260 pc scales. We present new ALMA observations of HCN(1-0) line emission. Combined with existing CO(2-1) observations from ALMA, and H-alpha from MUSE, as well as F2100W from JWST to trace the SFR, we measure the HCN/CO line ratio, a proxy for the dense gas fraction and SFR/HCN, a proxy for the star formation efficiency of the dense gas. Towards the centre of the galaxy, HCN/CO systematically increases while SFR/HCN decreases, but these ratios stay roughly constant throughout the disc. Spiral arms, interarm regions, and bar ends show similar HCN/CO and SFR/HCN. On the bar, there is a significantly lower SFR/HCN at a similar HCN/CO. We conclude that the centres of galaxies show the strongest environmental influence on dense gas and star formation, suggesting either that clouds couple strongly to the surrounding pressure or that HCN is tracing more of the bulk molecular gas that is less efficiently converted into stars. On the contrary, across the disc of NGC 4321, where the ISM pressure is typically low, SFR/HCN does not show large variations (&lt; 0.3 dex) in agreement with Galactic observations of molecular clouds. Despite the large variations across environments and physical conditions, HCN/CO is a good predictor of the mean molecular gas surface density at 260 pc scales.</description>

      <title>An Imaging and Spectroscopic Exploration of the Dusty Compact Obscured Nucleus Galaxy Zw~049.057</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zw~049.057 is a moderate mass, dusty, early-type galaxy that hosts a powerful compact obscured nucleus (CON, L$_{FIR,CON} \geq$10$^{11}$~L$_{\odot}$). The resolution of HST enabled measurements of the stellar light distribution and characterization of dust features. Zw~049.057 is inclined with a prominent three zone disk; the R$\approx$ 1kpc star forming inner dusty disk contains molecular gas, a main disk with less dust and an older stellar population, and a newly detected outer stellar region at R$&gt;$6~kpc with circular isophotes. Previously unknown polar dust lanes are signatures of a past minor merger that could have warped the outer disk to near face-on. Dust transmission measurements provide lower limit gas mass estimates for dust features. An extended region with moderate optical depth and M$\geq$ 2$\times$10$^8$~M$_{\odot}$ obscures the central 2~kpc. Optical spectra show strong interstellar Na~D absorption with a constant velocity across the main disk, likely arising in this extraplanar medium. Opacity measurements of the two linear dust features, pillars, give a total mass of $\geq$10$^6$~M$_{\odot}$, flow rates of $\geq$2~M$_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$, and few Myr flow times. Dust pillars are associated with the CON and are visible signs of its role in driving large-scale feedback. Our assessments of feedback processes suggest gas recycling sustains the CON. However, radiation pressure driven mass loss and efficient star formation must be avoided for the AGN to retain sufficient gas over its lifespan to produce substantial mass growth of the central black hole.</description>

      <title>The Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury: Triangulum Extended Region (PHATTER). VI. The High-Mass Stellar Initial Mass Function of M33</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the high-mass stellar initial mass function (IMF) from resolved stars in M33 young stellar clusters. Leveraging \textit{Hubble Space Telescope's} high resolving power, we fully model the IMF probabilistically. We first model the optical CMD of each cluster to constrain its power-law slope $\Gamma$, marginalized over other cluster parameters in the fit (e.g., cluster age, mass, and radius). We then probabilistically model the distribution of MF slopes for a highly strict cluster sample of 9 clusters more massive than log(Mass/M$_{\odot}$)=3.6; above this mass, all clusters have well-populated main sequences of massive stars and should have accurate recovery of their MF slopes, based on extensive tests with artificial clusters. We find the ensemble IMF is best described by a mean high-mass slope of $\overline{\Gamma} = 1.49\pm0.18$, with an intrinsic scatter of $\sigma^{2}_{\Gamma} = 0.02^{+0.16}_{0.00}$, consistent with a universal IMF. We find no dependence of the IMF on environmental impacts such as the local star formation rate or galactocentric radius within M33, which serves as a proxy for metallicity. This $\overline{\Gamma}$ measurement is consistent with similar measurements in M31, despite M33 having a much higher star formation rate intensity. While this measurement is formally consistent with the canonical Kroupa ($\Gamma = 1.30$) IMF, as well as the Salpeter ($\Gamma = 1.35)$) value, it is the second Local Group cluster sample to show evidence for a somewhat steeper high-mass IMF slope. We explore the impacts a steeper IMF slope has on a number of astronomical sub-fields.</description>

      <title>Exploring Galaxy Evolution Time-Scales in Clusters: Insights from the Projected Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies infalling into clusters undergo both star-formation quenching and morphological transformation due to environmental effects. We investigate these processes and their timescales using a local sample of 20,191 cluster and 11,674 field galaxies from SDSS. By analysing morphology as a function of distance from the star-formation main sequence, we show that environmental influence is especially pronounced for low-mass galaxies, which emerge from the green valley with early-type morphologies before their star formation is fully suppressed. Using the galaxies' positions in the clusters' Projected Phase Space, we examine the evolution of blue cloud, green valley, and red sequence fractions as a function of time since infall. Interestingly, the green valley fraction remains constant with time since infall, suggesting a balanced flow of galaxies in and out of this class. We estimate that galaxies less massive than $10^{10}\rm M_{\odot}$ spend approximately 0.4 Gyr in the green valley. By comparing quenched and early-type populations, we provide further evidence for the ``slow-then-rapid'' quenching model and suggest that it can also be applied to morphological transitions. Our results indicate that morphological transformation occurs at larger radii than complete star-formation quenching. About 75% of galaxies undergoing morphological transition in clusters are spirals evolving into S0s, suggesting that infalling galaxies retain their disks, while massive ellipticals are relics of early merger events. Finally, we show it takes approximately 2.5 and 1.2 Gyr after the delay-time ($\sim 3.8 {\rm Gyr}$) for the population of low mass galaxies in clusters to reach a 50% threshold in quenched and early-type fraction, respectively. These findings suggest morphological transition precedes full star formation quenching, with both processes possibly being causally linked.</description>

      <title>Light curve's recovery with Rubin-LSST: II. UnVEiling the darknesS of The gAlactic buLgE (VESTALE) with RR Lyrae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is part of VESTALE, a project initiated within the Rubin-LSST Cadence Strategy Optimization Process . Its goal is to explore the potential of Rubin-LSST observations aimed at the Galaxy's bulge (Bulge) for studying RR Lyrae stars (RRL). Observation and analysis of RR Lyrae stars in the Bulge are crucial for tracing the old population of the central part of our galaxy and reconstructing the history of Bulge formation. Based on observations conducted with CTIO/DECam by Saha et al. 2019 towards the Baade Window, our simulations demonstrate that early Rubin-LSST observations will enable the recovery of RR Lyrae light curves at Galactic center distances with sufficient precision. This will allow us to utilize theoretical relations from Marconi et al. 2022 to determine their distances and/or metallicity, following the REDIME algorithm introduced in Bono et al. 2019. We show how reddening and crowding affect our simulations and highlight the importance of considering these effects when deriving pulsation parameters (luminosity amplitudes, mean magnitudes) based on the light curves especially if the goal is to explore the opposite side of the Bulge through the observation of its RRL. The simulations discussed in this investigation were conducted to support the SCOC's decision to observe this important sky region since it has only recently been decided to include part of the Bulge as a target within the LSST main survey.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field and kinetic helicity evolution in simulations of interacting disk galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a parameter study of interacting disk galaxies with impact parameters ranging from central collisions to weakly interacting scenarios. The orientations of the disks are also varied. In particular, we investigate how magnetic field amplification depends on the these parameters. We use magnetohydrodynamics for gas disks in combination with live dark matter halos in adaptive mesh refinement simulations. The disks are initialized using a setup for isolated disks in hydrostatic equilibrium. Small-scale filtering of the velocity and magnetic field allows us to estimate the turbulent electromotive force (EMF) and kinetic helicity. Time series of the average magnetic field in central and outer disk regions show pronounced peaks during close encounters and mergers. This agrees with observed magnetic fields at different interaction stages. The central field strength exceeds 10 microgauss (corresponding to an amplification factor of 2 to 3) for small impact parameters. As the disks are increasingly disrupted and turbulence is produced by tidal forces, the small-scale EMF reaches a significant fraction of the total EMF. The small-scale kinetic helicity is initially antisymmetric across the disk plane. Albeit its evolution is sensitive to both the impact parameter and inclinations of the rotation axes with respect to the relative motion of the disks, antisymmetry is generally broken through interactions and the merger remnant has lost most of the initial helicity. The EMF and the magnetic field also decay rapidly after coalescence. The strong amplification during close encounters of the interacting galaxies are mostly driven by helical flows and a mean-field dynamo. The small-scale dynamo contributes significantly in post-interaction phases. However, the amplification of the magnetic field cannot be sustained.</description>

      <title>Explanations for the two-component spectral energy distributions of gravitationally lensed stars at high redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of gravitationally lensed, high-mass stars at redshifts $\gtrsim1$ occasionally reveal spectral energy distributions that contain two components with different effective temperatures. Given that two separate stars are involved, it suggests that both stars have simultaneously reached very high magnification, as expected for two stars in a binary system close to the caustic curve of the foreground galaxy-cluster lens. The inferred effective temperatures and luminosities of these stars are, however, difficult to reconcile with known binaries, or even with isolated stars of the same age. Here, we explore three alternative explanations for these cases: circumstellar dust around the cooler of the two stars; age differences of a few Myr among stars in the same star cluster, and a scenario in which the stars originate in two separate star clusters of different age along the lensing caustic. While all of these scenarios are deemed plausible in principle, dust solutions would require more circumstellar extinction than seen in local observations of the relevant super/hypergiant stars. Hence, we argue that age differences between the two stars are the most likely scenario, given the current data.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Stellar Radiative Feedback on Formation of Young Massive Clusters via Fast HI Gas Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars and are often speculated as potential precursors to globular clusters. However, the formation mechanism of massive and compact gas clumps that precede YMCs remains unknown. In this paper, we study the formation of such massive clumps via fast HI gas collisions (~100 km/s) as suggested by recent observations and their subsequent evolution into YMCs by using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics simulations involving self-gravity and detailed thermal/chemical processes. In particular, the impact of ionization feedback from stellar radiation is included in an approximate fashion where the temperature within the HII regions is elevated to 10,000 K, while supernova feedback is not included. We examine whether the resulting massive clumps can survive this ionization feedback and evolve into YMCs. Our simulations reveal the emergence of gas clumps that do not only possess substantial mass (~10^5 M_sun) but also sufficient compactness (~5 pc). Notably, these clumps exhibit significantly higher escape velocities compared to the sound speed of the HII region, indicating effective gravitational retention of gas against feedback-induced evaporation. Consequently, these conditions foster efficient star formation within the massive gas clumps, ultimately leading to their evolution into YMCs. We also perform simulations involving lower-velocity gas collisions, approximately 15 km/s, typical shock velocities induced by galactic superbubbles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical traceback age of the Octans young stellar association</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Octans is one of the most distant ($d\sim150$pc) young stellar associations of the solar neighbourhood. Its age is still poorly constrained in the literature and requires further investigation. We take advantage of the state-of-the-art astrometry delivered by the third data release of the Gaia space mission combined with radial velocity measurements obtained from high-resolution spectroscopy to compute the 3D positions and 3D spatial velocities of the stars and derive the dynamical traceback age of the association. We performed an extensive traceback analysis using different subsamples of stars, different metrics to define the size of the association, and different models for the Galactic potential to integrate the stellar orbits in the past. We derive a dynamical age of $34^{+2}_{-2}$Myr that is independent from stellar models and represents the most precise age estimate currently available for the Octans association. After correcting the radial velocity of the stars for the effect of gravitational redshift, we obtain a dynamical age of $33^{+3}_{-1}$Myr, which is in very good agreement with our first solution. This shows that the effect of gravitational redshift is small for such a distant young stellar association. Our result is also consistent with the less accurate age estimates obtained in previous studies from lithium depletion (30-40Myr) and isochrones (20-30Myr). By integrating the stellar orbits in time, we show that the members of Octans and Octans-Near had different locations in the past, which indicates that the two associations are unrelated despite the close proximity in the sky. Our results confirm that it is possible to derive precise dynamical ages via the traceback method for $\sim30$Myr old stellar clusters at about $\sim150$pc with the same precision level that has been achieved in other studies for young stellar groups within 50pc of the Sun.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Inner 0.1 pc of a Supermassive Black Hole Environment with the Tidal Disruption Event and Extreme Coronal Line Emitter AT 2022upj</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme coronal line emitters (ECLEs) are objects showing transient high-ionization lines in the centers of galaxies. They have been attributed to echoes of high-energy flares of ionizing radiation, such as those produced by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but have only recently been observed within hundreds of days after an optical transient was detected. AT 2022upj is a nuclear UV-optical flare at z=0.054 with spectra showing [Fe X] {\lambda}6375 and [Fe XIV] {\lambda}5303 during the optical peak, the earliest presence of extreme coronal lines during an ongoing transient. AT 2022upj is also the second ever ECLE (and first with a concurrent flare) to show broad He II {\lambda}4686 emission, a key signature of optical/UV TDEs. We also detect X-ray emission during the optical transient phase, which may be related to the source of ionizing photons for the extreme coronal lines. Finally, we analyze the spectroscopic evolution of each emission line and find that [Fe X] and [Fe XIV] weaken within 400d of optical peak, while [Fe VII] {\lambda}5720, [Fe VII] {\lambda}6087, and [O III] {\lambda}{\lambda}4959,5007 emerge over the same period. The velocities of the iron lines indicate circumnuclear gas within 0.1pc of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), while a dust echo inferred from NEOWISE data indicates that circumnuclear dust lies at a minimum of 0.4pc away, providing evidence of stratified material around a SMBH. AT 2022upj is the first confirmed ECLE-TDE with clear signatures of both classes. This event's spectroscopic evolution on a $\sim$year unveils the impact of highly energetic flares such as TDEs on the complex environments around SMBHs.</description>

      <title>Ultra-low frequency LOFAR spectral indices of cluster radio halos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fraction of galaxy clusters harbor diffuse radio sources known as radio halos. The currently adopted scenario for their formation is based on second-order Fermi re-acceleration of seed electrons that is driven by merger-driven turbulence in the intra-cluster medium. This mechanism is expected to be inefficient, which implies that a significant fraction of halos should have very steep ($\alpha &lt; -1.5$) energy spectra. We start investigating the potential and current limitations of the combination of the two surveys conducted by LOFAR, LoTSS (144 MHz) and LoLSS (54 MHz), to probe the origin of radio halos. We follow up the 20 radio halos detected in the DR1 of LoTSS, which covers the HETDEX field, with the LoLSS survey, and we study their spectral properties between 54 and 144 MHz. After the removal of compact sources, 9 halos were excluded due to unreliable halo flux density measurements at 54 MHz. Our main finding is that 7 out of 11 ($\sim$ 64%) exhibit an ultra-steep spectrum ($\alpha &lt; -1.5$), which is a key prediction of turbulent re-acceleration models. We also note a tentative trend for more massive systems to host flatter halos, although the currently poor statistics does not allow for a deeper analysis. Our sample suffers from low angular resolution at 54 MHz, which limits the accuracy of the compact-sources subtraction. Nevertheless, this study is the first step towards providing compelling evidence for the existence of a large fraction of radio halos with very steep spectrum, which is a fundamental prediction of turbulent re-acceleration models. In this regard, the forthcoming second data release of LoLSS, along with the integration of LOFAR international stations and the instrumental upgrade to LOFAR2.0, will improve both the statistics and the low-frequency angular resolution, allowing to conclusively determine the origin of radio halos in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>The XMM-Newton and NuSTAR view of IRASF11119+3257. I Detection of multiple UFO components and a very cold corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IRASF11119 is an ultra-luminous IR galaxy with post-merger morphology, hosting a type-1 QSO at z=0.189. Its 2013 Suzaku spectrum shows a prominent Ultra Fast Outflow (UFO) absorption feature (v_out~0.25c). In 2021, we obtained the first XMM-Newton long look of the target, coordinated with a simultaneous NuSTAR observation. The new high-quality data allow us to detect at P&gt;99.8% c.l. multiple absorption features associated with the known UFO. Furthermore, an emission plus absorption feature at 1.1-1.3 keV reveals the presence of a blueshifted P-Cygni profile in the soft band. We associate the hard band features with blends of FeXXV and FeXXVI He$\alpha$-Ly$\alpha$ and He$\beta$-Ly$\beta$ line pairs and infer a large column (N$_H$~$10^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) of highly ionized (log$\xi$~5) gas outflowing at v_out=0.27c. The 1 keV feature can be associated with a blend of Fe and Ne transitions, produced by a lower column (N$_H$~$10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) and ionization (log$\xi$~2.6) gas component outflowing at the same speed. Using a radiative-transfer disk wind model to fit the highly ionized UFO, we derive a large mass outflow rate, comparable with the mass accretion rate (M$_{out}$=4.25 M$_{Sun}$/yr, ~1.6 M$_{acc}$), and kinetic energy and momentum flux among the highest reported in the literature. We measure an extremely low high-energy cut-off (E$_c$~25 keV). Several other cases in the literature suggest that a steep X-ray continuum may be related to the formation of powerful winds. The lack of a significant momentum boost between the nuclear UFO and the different phases of the large-scale outflow, observed in IRASF11119 and in a growing number of sources with powerful UFOs, can be explained by (i) a momentum-driven expansion, (ii) an inefficient coupling of the UFO with the host ISM, or (iii) by repeated energy-driven expansion episodes with low duty-cycle, that average out on long time-scales.</description>

      <title>Precisely Measuring the Cosmic Reionization History from IGM Damping Wings Towards Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for analyzing the IGM damping wings imprinted on the proximity zones of quasars in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whereas past work has typically forgone the additional constraining power afforded by the blue side continuum ($1216\,\r{A} \lesssim \lambda \lesssim 1280\,\r{A}$) and/or opted not to model the large correlated IGM transmission fluctuations in the proximity zone ($\lambda \lesssim 1216\,\r{A}$), we construct a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum accounting for all sources of error - the stochasticity induced by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, the unknown intrinsic spectrum of the quasar, and spectral noise. This principled Bayesian method allows us to marginalize out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar's radiation and its unknown intrinsic spectrum to precisely measure the IGM neutral fraction, $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$. A key element of our analysis is the use of dimensionality reduction (DR) to describe the intrinsic quasar spectrum via a small number of nuisance parameters. Using a large sample of $15,559$ SDSS/BOSS quasars at $z \gtrsim 2.15$ we trained and quantified the performance of six distinct DR methods, and find that a six parameter PCA model (five coefficients plus a normalization) performs best, with complex machine learning approaches providing no advantage. By conducting statistical inference on 100 realistic mock EoR quasar spectra, we demonstrate the reliability of the credibility contours that we obtain on $\langle x_{\rm HI}\rangle$ and the quasar lifetime, $t_{\rm Q}$. The new method introduced here will transform IGM damping wings into a precision probe of reionization, on the same solid methodological and statistical footing as other precision cosmological measurements.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Precision of IGM Damping Wing Measurements Towards Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the precision with which the Lyman-$\alpha$ damping wing signature imprinted on the spectra of high-redshift quasars (QSOs) by the foreground neutral intergalactic medium (IGM) can measure the history of cosmic reionization. We leverage a novel inference pipeline based on a generative probabilistic model for the entire spectrum (both red- and blueward of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line), accounting for all relevant sources of uncertainty - the stochasticity caused by patchy reionization, the impact of the quasar's ionizing radiation on the IGM, it's unknown intrinsic spectrum, and spectral noise. Performing fast JAX-based Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC) parameter inference, we precisely measure the underlying global IGM neutral fraction as well as the lifetime of the quasar. Running a battery of tests on over a thousand mocks, we find optimal precision when running the pipeline with a six parameter PCA continuum model (five coefficients and a normalization) on $\mathrm{S}/\mathrm{N} \sim 10$ spectra, binned to a $\sim 500\,\mathrm{km}/\mathrm{s}$ velocity pixel scale, and extending at least out to the C IV $\lambda\,1549\,\text{\r{A}}$ emission line. After marginalizing out nuisance parameters associated with the quasar continuum, a single spectrum constrains the IGM neutral fraction to $28.0_{-8.8}^{+8.2}\,\%$ and the quasar lifetime to $0.80_{-0.55}^{+0.22}\,\mathrm{dex}$, improving notably towards spectra with a stronger IGM damping wing imprint. Higher precision can be achieved by averaging over statistical quasar samples. We identify two primary sources of uncertainty that contribute approximately equally to the total error budget: the uncertain quasar continuum model and the stochastic distribution of neutral regions arising from both the reionization topology and the location of the quasar's ionization front.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Changing-Look AGNs from Accretion Disk-Induced Tidal Disruption Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of changing-look (CL) behavior in active galactic nuclei (AGN) is characterized by dramatic changes in luminosity and/or emission line profiles over relatively short periods, ranging from months to years. The origin of CL-AGNs remains a mystery, but one proposed explanation involves the response of the inner AGN disk to tidal disruption events (TDEs) around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this Letter, we calculate the predicted frequency of AGN TDEs as a function of SMBH mass and compare the results to the observed CL-AGN distribution. We find that if the fraction of CL-AGNs caused by AGN-TDEs is high, then: (1) most SMBHs in CL-AGN are near maximal spin, with the dimensionless spin parameter $a&gt;0.9$; (2) AGN inner disks have a high surface density ($\geq 10^{7}\, {\rm g\, cm^{-2}}$); (3) typical AGN lifetimes are $\sim 10$-$100$ Myr; and (4) a nuclear star cluster initial mass function (IMF) that scales as $\sim m_*^{-1.6}$ is preferred. Future observations of CL-AGN will help constrain the fraction of CL-AGNs caused by AGN-TDEs, SMBH spins, AGN lifetimes, and the nuclear star cluster IMF.</description>

      <title>The Absolute Age of NGC 3201 derived from Detached Eclipsing Binaries and the Hess Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We estimate the absolute age of the globular cluster NGC 3201 using $10,000$ sets of theoretical isochrones constructed through Monte Carlo simulation using the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Program. These isochrones take into consideration of uncertainty introduced by the choice of stellar evolution parameters. We fit isochrones with 3 detached eclipsing binaries and obtained an age independent of distance. We also fit isochrones with differential reddening corrected HST photometry data utilizing two different Hess diagram based fitting methods. Results from 3 different methods analyzing 2 different types of data agree to within $1 \sigma$, and we find the absolute age of NGC 3201 $= 11.85 \pm 0.74$ Gyr. We also perform variable importance analysis to study the uncertainty contribution from individual parameters and we find the distance is the dominance source of uncertainty in photometry based analysis while total metallicity, Helium abundance, $\alpha$-element abundance, mixing length, and treatment of helium diffusion are important source of uncertainties for all 3 methods.</description>

      <title>A two-minute burst of highly polarised radio emission originating from low Galactic latitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several sources of repeating coherent bursts of radio emission with periods of many minutes have now been reported in the literature. These ``ultra-long period'' (ULP) sources have no clear multi-wavelength counterparts and challenge canonical pulsar emission models, leading to debate regarding their nature. In this work we report the discovery of a bright, highly-polarised burst of radio emission at low Galactic latitude as part of a wide-field survey for transient and variable radio sources. ASKAP\,J175534.9$-$252749.1 does not appear to repeat, with only a single intense two-minute $\sim 200$\,mJy burst detected from 60~hours of observations. The burst morphology and polarisation properties are comparable to those of classical pulsars but the duration is more than one hundred times longer, analogous to ULPs. No comparable bursts are detected in the rest of our widefield survey to date. Combined with the existing ULP population, this suggests that these sources have a strong Galactic latitude dependence and hints at an unexplored population of transient and variable radio sources in the thin disk of the Milky Way. The resemblance of this burst with both ULPs and pulsars calls for a unified coherent emission model for objects with spin periods from milliseconds to tens of minutes. However, whether or not these are all neutron stars or have the same underlying power source remains open for debate.</description>

      <title>Ariel stellar characterisation II. Chemical abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen for 181 planet-host FGK dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the ultimate goals of the ESA Ariel space mission is to shed light on the formation pathways and evolution of planetary systems in the Solar neighbourhood. Such an endeavour is only possible by performing a large chemical survey of not only the planets, but also their host stars, inasmuch as stellar elemental abundances are the cipher key to decode the planetary compositional signatures. This work aims at providing homogeneous abundances of C, N, and O of a sample of 181 stars belonging to the Tier 1 of the Ariel Mission Candidate Sample. We applied the spectral synthesis and the equivalent width methods to a variety of atomic and molecular indicators (C I lines at 5052 and 5380.3 A, [O I] forbidden line at 6300.3 A, C_2 bands at 5128 and 5165 A, and CN band at 4215 A) using high-resolution and high S/N spectra collected with several spectrographs. We provide carbon abundances for 180 stars, nitrogen abundances for 105 stars, and oxygen abundances for 89 stars. We analyse the results in the light of the Galactic chemical evolution, and in terms of the planetary companions properties. Our sample basically follows the typical trends with metallicity expected for the [C/Fe], [N/Fe], and [O/Fe] abundance ratios. The fraction between C and O abundances, both yields of primary production, is consistent with a constant ratio as [O/H] increases, whereas the abundance of N tends to increase with the increasing of the O abundance, supporting the theoretical assumption of a secondary production of nitrogen. The [C/N], [C/O], and [N/O] ratios are also correlated with [Fe/H], which might introduce biases in the interpretation of the planetary compositions and formation histories if host stars of different metallicity are compared. We provide relations that can be used to qualitatively estimate whether the atmospheric composition of planets is enriched or not with respect to the host stars.</description>

      <title>Period-luminosity and period-luminosity-metallicity relations for Galactic RR Lyrae stars in the Sloan bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RR Lyrae stars are excellent tracers of the old population II due to their period-luminosity (PL) and period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations. While these relations have been investigated in detail in many photometric bands, there are few comprehensive studies about them in Sloan-like systems. We present PL and PLZ relations (as well as their counterparts in Wesenheit magnitudes) in the Sloan-Pan-STARSS gP1rP1iP1 bands obtained for Galactic RR Lyrae stars in the vincinity of the Sun. The data used in this paper were collected with the network of 40 cm telescopes of the Las Cumbres Observatory, and geometric parallaxes were adopted from Gaia Data Release 3. We derived PL and PLZ relations separately for RRab and RRc-type stars, as well as for the mixed population of RRab+RRc stars. To our knowledge, these are the first PL and PLZ relations in the Sloan bands determined using RR Lyrae stars in the Galactic field.</description>

      <title>Fine Structure of the Age-Chromospheric Activity Relation in Solar-Type Stars: II. H$\alpha$ Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excess chromospheric emissions within deep photospheric lines are effective proxies of stellar magnetism for FGK stars. This emission decays with stellar age and is a potential determinant of this important stellar quantity. We report absolutely calibrated H$\alpha$ chromospheric fluxes for 511 solar-type stars in a wide interval of precisely determined masses, $[$Fe/H$]$, ages, and evolution states from high S/N, moderately high$-$resolution spectra. The comparison of H$\alpha$ and H+K chromospheric fluxes reveals a metallicity bias (absent from H$\alpha$) affecting Ca II H+K fluxes thereby metal-rich stars with deep line profiles mimic low chromospheric flux levels, and vice versa for metal-poor stars. This bias blurs the age-activity relation, precluding age determinations for old, inactive stars unless mass and $[$Fe/H$]$ are calibrated into the relation. The H+K lines being the most widely studied tool to quantify magnetic activity in FGK stars, care should be exercised in its use whenever wide ranges of mass and $[$Fe/H$]$ are involved. The H$\alpha$ age-activity-mass-metallicity calibration appears to be in line with the theoretical expectation that (other parameters being equal) more massive stars possess narrower convective zones and are less active than less massive stars, while more metal-rich stars have deeper convective zones and appear more active than metal-poorer stars. If regarded statistically in tandem with other age diagnostics, H$\alpha$ chromospheric fluxes may be suitable to constrain ages for FGK stars with acceptable precision.</description>

      <title>A JWST project on 47 Tucanae. NIRSpec spectroscopy of multiple populations among M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first spectroscopic estimates of the chemical abundance of M dwarf stars in a globular cluster (GC), namely 47 Tucanae. By exploiting NIRSpec on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) we gathered low-resolution spectra for 28 stars with masses in the range ~0.4-0.5 solar masses. The spectra are strongly affected by the H2O water vapour bands which can be used as indicators of the oxygen abundance. The spectral analysis reveals that the target stars feature a different O abundance, with a difference of ~0.40 dex between first and the most-polluted second population. The observed range is similar to that observed among red giant stars. This result reinforces previous findings based on the analysis of photometric diagrams, including the ``chromosome maps'', providing a first, and more direct, evidence of light element variations in the M dwarfs' mass regime. The observation that the multiple populations, with their variations in light elements, exhibit the same patterns from the lower main sequence all the way to the red giant branch further strengthens the notion that multiple stellar populations in globular clusters formed in a series of bursts of star formation.</description>

      <title>The Enigma of Li-Rich Giants and its Relation with Temporal Variations Observed in Radial Velocity and Stellar Activity Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the large number of studies focused on the characterization of Li-rich stars and understanding of the mechanisms leading to such enrichment, their origin remains a mystery. Magnetic activity, in particular the phenomena usually associated with it, such as spots and plages, and the Li abundance (A(Li)) of stars, are in general thought to be connected. However, as of today it is unclear just how. In this work, we study a sample of young but evolved intermediate mass red giants, inhabitants of open clusters where planets have been searched. We aim at using radial velocity (RV) and stellar activity indicator signals to look for relations between Li abundances and stellar activity/variability. We explore how the standard deviation (STD), peak to peak amplitude (PTP), mean and median of typical stellar activity indicators (BIS, FWHM, $T_\textrm{eff}$, and H$\alpha$ index) change as a function of the Li content of 82 red giants. Furthermore, we compute weighted Pearson Correlation Coefficients ($\rho_w$) between time series of RV measurements and the stellar activity indicators for the stars in our sample. To aid our results, we also study Generalized Lomb-Scargle Periodograms (GLSP) to capture possible significant periodic temporal variations in our data. Our analysis indicates that the STD and PTP of BIS and FWHM, the mean and median of the H$\alpha$ index and $v\sin(i)$ increase exponentially with A(Li) in our sample of red giants. Significant temporal variations and correlations between RVs and activity indicators also tend to be found preferentially for stars where high A(Li) is observed. Most of the Li-rich stars in our sample either show strong correlations of RV with at least one of the stellar activity indicators or reveal significant periodic temporal variations in their stellar activity indicators GLSPs consistent with those found for RV.</description>

      <title>Modelling predicts a molecule-rich disk around the AGB star L2 Puppis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nearby oxygen-rich AGB star L2 Pup hosts a well-studied nearly edge-on disk. To date, disks around AGB stars have not been chemically studied in detail. By combining a parameterisation commonly used for protoplanetary disks and archival ALMA observations, we retrieved an updated density and temperature structure of this disk. This physical model was then used as input to the first chemical model of an AGB disk. The model shows that the physical structure of the disk has a large impact on its chemistry, with certain species showing large changes in column density relative to a radial outflow, indicating that chemistry could be used as a tracer of disks that cannot be directly imaged. Despite its oxygen-rich nature, the daughter species formed within the disk are surprisingly carbon-rich. Two chemical regimes can be distinguished: cosmic-ray induced chemistry in the midplane and photochemistry induced by the interstellar radiation field in the outer regions. Certain complex organic molecules are formed in the midplane. This occurs via gas-phase chemistry only, as the disk is too warm for dust-gas chemistry. The photochemistry in the outer regions leads to the efficient formation of (long) carbon-chains. The predictions of the model allow us to tentatively put the disk's age $\lesssim 10^5$ yr. Additional observations are necessary to better constrain the physical structure of L2 Pup's disk and are essential to test the predictions made by the chemical model. Our exploratory work paves the way for a more general study of the chemistry of AGB disks.</description>

Abstract: We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</description>

      <title>Resolving cosmic star formation histories of present-day bulges, disks, and spheroids with ProFuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02788v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first look at star formation histories of galaxy components using ProFuse, a new technique to model the 2D distribution of light across multiple wavelengths using simultaneous spectral and spatial fitting of purely imaging data. We present a number of methods to classify galaxies structurally/morphologically, showing the similarities and discrepancies between these schemes. We show the variation in component-wise mass functions that can occur simply due to the use of a different classification method, which is most dramatic in separating bulges and spheroids. Rather than identifying the best-performing scheme, we use the spread of classifications to quantify uncertainty in our results. We study the cosmic star formation history (CSFH), forensically derived using ProFuse with a sample of ~7,000 galaxies from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Remarkably, the forensic CSFH recovered via both our method (ProFuse) and traditional SED fitting (ProSpect) are not only exactly consistent with each other over the past 8 Gyr, but also with the in-situ CSFH measured using ProSpect. Furthermore, we separate the CSFH by contributions from spheroids, bulges and disks. While the vast majority (70%) of present-day star formation takes place in the disk population, we show that 50% of the stars that formed at cosmic noon (8-12 Gyr ago) now reside in spheroids, and present-day bulges are composed of stars that were primarily formed in the very early Universe, with half their stars already formed ~12 Gyr ago.</description>

      <title>Nebular dominated galaxies: insights into the stellar initial mass function at high redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02051v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a low-metallicity ($12+\log({\rm O}/{\rm H})=7.59$) Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxy at $z=5.943$ with evidence of a strong Balmer jump, arising from nebular continuum. While Balmer jumps are sometimes observed in low-redshift star-forming galaxies, this galaxy also exhibits a steep turnover in the UV continuum. Such turnovers are typically attributed to absorption by a damped Ly$\alpha$ system (DLA); however, the shape of the turnover and the high observed Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction ($f_{\rm esc,Ly\alpha}~\sim27\%$) is also consistent with strong nebular two-photon continuum emission. Modelling the UV turnover with a DLA requires extreme column densities ($N_{\rm HI}&gt;10^{23}$~cm$^{-2}$), and simultaneously explaining the high $f_{\rm esc,Ly\alpha}$ requires a fine-tuned geometry. In contrast, modelling the spectrum as primarily nebular provides a good fit to both the continuum and emission lines, motivating scenarios in which (a) we are observing only nebular emission or (b) the ionizing source is powering extreme nebular emission that outshines the stellar emission. The nebular-only scenario could arise if the ionising source has `turned off' more recently than the recombination timescale ($\sim$1,000~yr), hence we may be catching the object at a very specific time. Alternatively, hot stars with $T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim10^5$~K (e.g. Wolf-Rayet or low-metallicity massive stars) produce enough ionizing photons such that the two-photon emission becomes visible. While several stellar SEDs from the literature fit the observed spectrum well, the hot-star scenario requires that the number of $\gtrsim50~{\rm M}_\odot$ stars relative to $\sim5-50~{\rm M}_\odot$ stars is significantly higher than predicted by typical stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The identification of more galaxies with similar spectra may provide evidence for a top-heavy IMF at high redshift.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: The Relation between Strong (Hb+[OIII]) Emission, Star Formation and Burstiness Around the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12691v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of strong (Hb+[OIII]) emitters before and after the end of the Epoch of Reionization from z=8 to z=5.5. We make use of ultra-deep JWST/NIRCam imaging in the Parallel Field of the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) in the Hubble eXtreme Deep Field (P2-XDF), in order to select prominent (Hb+[OIII]) emitters (with rest EW_0 &gt; 100 Angstroms) at z=5.5-7, based on their flux density enhancement in the F356W band with respect to the spectral energy distribution continuum. We complement our selection with other (Hb+[OIII]) emitters from the literature at similar and higher (z=7-8) redshifts. We find (non-independent) anti-correlations between EW_0(Hb+[OIII]) and both galaxy stellar mass and age, in agreement with previous studies, and a positive correlation with specific star formation rate (sSFR). On the SFR-M* plane, the (Hb+[OIII]) emitters populate both the star-formation main sequence and the starburst region, which become indistinguishable at low stellar masses (log10(M*) &lt; 7.5). We find tentative evidence for a non-monotonic relation between EW_0(Hb+[OIII]) and SFR, such that both parameters correlate with each other at SFR &gt; 1 Msun/yr, while the correlation flattens out at lower SFRs. This suggests that low metallicities producing high EW_0(Hb+[OIII]) could be important at low SFR values. Interestingly, the properties of the strong emitters and other galaxies (33% and 67% of our z=5.5-7 sample, respectively) are similar, including, in many cases, high sSFR. Therefore, it is crucial to consider both emitters and non-emitters to obtain a complete picture of the cosmic star formation activity around the Epoch of Reionization.</description>

Abstract: A sample of SiO-masing late-type stars located in the inner Galaxy is analyzed with the goal of better constraining their obscuration. This reference sample allows us to define mathematical relations between their dereddened infrared colours and the observed colours (e.g. \Ks-[8], \Ks-[24]). The derived equations define a property (a locus) of these late-type stars. Therefore, they enable us to derive the interstellar extinction. With estimated spectral types, it is possible to decompose the total extinction in the two components (interstellar and envelope extinction). These relations are very useful to classify extremely obscured late-type stars located in the inner Galaxy. Estimating the two extinction components is performable on an individual late-type star, independently of its surrounding, and also when a few mid-infrared measurements are available.</description>

      <title>A deep learning model for the density profiles of subhaloes in IllustrisTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning-based model for the total density profiles of subhaloes with masses $M \gtrsim 7\times 10^8\,h^{-1}{\rm M}_\odot$ in the IllustrisTNG100 simulation. The model is based on an interpretable variational encoder (IVE) which returns the independent factors of variation in the density profiles within a low-dimensional representation, as well as the predictions for the density profiles themselves. The IVE returns accurate and unbiased predictions on all radial ranges, including the outer region profile where the subhaloes experience tidal stripping; here its fit accuracy exceeds that of the commonly used Einasto profile. The IVE discovers three independent degrees of freedom in the profiles, which can be interpreted in terms of the formation history of the subhaloes. In addition to the two parameters controlling the normalization and inner shape of the profile, the IVE discovers a third parameter that accounts for the impact of tidal stripping onto the subhalo outer profile; this parameter is sensitive to the mass loss experienced by the subhalo after its infall onto its parent halo. Baryonic physics in the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation model does not impact the number of degrees of freedom identified in the profile compared to the pure dark matter expectations, nor their physical interpretation. Our newly proposed profile fit can be used in strong lensing analyses or other observational studies which aim to constrain cosmology from small-scale structures.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of an ionized bubble: NIRCam grism spectroscopy of the $z=6.6$ double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter COLA1 and its environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasingly neutral intergalactic gas at $z&gt;6$ impacts the Lyman-$\alpha$ flux observed from galaxies. One luminous galaxy, COLA1, stands out because of its unique double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ line at $z=6.6$, unseen in any simulation of reionization. Here we present JWST/NIRCam wide-field slitless spectroscopy in a 21 arcmin$^2$ field centered on COLA1. We find 141 galaxies spectroscopically-selected through the [OIII]($\lambda4969,5008$) doublet at $5.35&lt;z&lt;6.95$, with 40 of these sources showing H$\beta$. For COLA1 we additionally detect [OIII]$_{4363}$ and H$\gamma$. We measure a systemic redshift of $z=6.5917$ for COLA1, confirming the double-peak nature of the Ly$\alpha$ profile. This implies that it resides in a highly ionized bubble and that it is leaking ionizing photons with a high escape fraction $f_{\rm esc}{\rm (LyC)}=20$-$50$%, making it a prime laboratory to study Lyman continuum escape in the Epoch of Reionization. COLA1 shows all the signs of a prolific ionizer with a Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction of $81\pm5\%$, Balmer decrement indicating no dust, a steep UV slope ($\beta_{\rm UV}=-3.2\pm 0.4$), and a star-formation surface density $\gtrsim 10\times$ that of typical galaxies at similar redshift. We detect 5 galaxies in COLA1's close environment ($\Delta z&lt;0.02$). Exploiting the high spectroscopic completeness inherent to grism surveys, and using mock simulations that mimic the selection function, we show the that number of detected companions is very typical for a similarly UV-bright ($M_{\rm{UV}}\sim-21.3$) galaxy; that is, the ionized bubble around COLA1 is unlikely due to an excessively large over-density. Instead, the measured ionizing properties suggest that COLA1 by itself might be powering the bubble required to explain its double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ profile ($R_{\rm ion}\approx0.7$ pMpc), with minor contribution from detected neighbours ($-17.5&gt;M_{\rm UV}&gt;-19.5$).</description>

      <title>Applying machine learning to Galactic Archaeology: how well can we recover the origin of stars in Milky Way-like galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present several machine learning (ML) models developed to efficiently separate stars formed in-situ in Milky Way-type galaxies from those that were formed externally and later accreted. These models, which include examples from artificial neural networks, decision trees and dimensionality reduction techniques, are trained on a sample of disc-like, Milky Way-mass galaxies drawn from the ARTEMIS cosmological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations. We find that the input parameters which provide an optimal performance for these models consist of a combination of stellar positions, kinematics, chemical abundances ([Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe]) and photometric properties. Models from all categories perform similarly well, with area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) scores of $\simeq 0.6$. Beyond a galactocentric radius of $5$~kpc, models retrieve $&gt;90\%$ of accreted stars, with a sample purity close to $60\%$, however the purity can be increased by adjusting the classification threshold. For one model, we also include host galaxy-specific properties in the training, to account for the variability of accretion histories of the hosts, however this does not lead to an improvement in performance. The ML models can identify accreted stars even in regions heavily dominated by the in-situ component (e.g., in the disc), and perform well on an unseen suite of simulations (the Auriga simulations). The general applicability bodes well for application of such methods on observational data to identify accreted substructures in the Milky Way without the need to resort to selection cuts for minimising the contamination from in-situ stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field in mini starburst complex Sgr B2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first arcsecond-resolution observations of the magnetic field in the mini starburst complex Sgr B2. SMA polarization observations revealed magnetic field morphology in three dense cores of Sgr B2 N(orth), M(ain), and S(outh). The total plane-of-sky magnetic field strengths in these cores are estimated to be 4.3-10.0 mG, 6.2-14.7 mG, and 1.9-4.5 mG derived from the angular dispersion function method after applying the correction factors of 0.21 and 0.5. Combining with analyses of the parsec-scale polarization data from SOFIA, we found that a magnetically supercritical condition is present from the cloud-scale ($\sim$10 pc) to core-scale ($\sim$0.2 pc) in Sgr B2, which is consistent with the burst of star formation activities in the region likely resulted from a multi-scale gravitational collapse from the cloud to dense cores.</description>

      <title>Rapidly growing primordial black holes as seeds of the massive high-redshift JWST Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A group of massive galaxies at redshifts of $z\gtrsim 7$ have been recently detected by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which were unexpected to form so early within the framework of standard Big Bang cosmology. In this work, we propose that this puzzle can be explained by the presence of some primordial black holes (PBHs) with a mass of $\sim 1000 M_\odot$. These PBHs, clothed in dark matter halo and undergoing super-Eddington accretion, serve as seeds for the early galaxy formation with masses of $\sim 10^{8}-10^{10}~M_\odot$ at high redshift, thus accounting for the JWST observations. Using a hierarchical Bayesian inference framework to constrain the PBH mass distribution models, we find that the Lognormal model with $M_{\rm c}\sim 750M_\odot$ is preferred over other hypotheses. These rapidly growing BHs are expected to emit strong radiation and may appear as high-redshift compact objects, similar to those recently discovered by JWST. Although we focuse on PBHs in this work, the bound on the initial mass of the seed black holes remains robust even if they were formed through astrophysical channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Next Generation Very Large Array (ngVLA) is a planned radio interferometer providing unprecedented sensitivity at wavelengths between 21 cm and 3 mm. Its 263 antenna element array will be spatially distributed across North America to enable both superb low surface brightness recovery and sub-milliarcsecond angular resolution imaging. The project was developed by the international astronomy community under the lead of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), and is anticipated to be built between 2027 and 2037. Two workshops have been held in 2022 and 2023 with the goal to discuss and consolidate the scientific interests in the ngVLA within the German astronomical community. This community paper constitutes a collection of 48 science ideas which the German community aims to pursue with the ngVLA in the 2030s. This is not a complete list and the ideas are not developed at the level of a "Science Book", such that the present document is mainly meant provide a basis for further discussion within the community. As such, additional contributions are welcome, and will be considered for inclusion in future revisions.</description>

      <title>Class Symbolic Regression: Gotta Fit 'Em All</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce 'Class Symbolic Regression' (Class SR) a first framework for automatically finding a single analytical functional form that accurately fits multiple datasets - each realization being governed by its own (possibly) unique set of fitting parameters. This hierarchical framework leverages the common constraint that all the members of a single class of physical phenomena follow a common governing law. Our approach extends the capabilities of our earlier Physical Symbolic Optimization ($\Phi$-SO) framework for Symbolic Regression, which integrates dimensional analysis constraints and deep reinforcement learning for unsupervised symbolic analytical function discovery from data. Additionally, we introduce the first Class SR benchmark, comprising a series of synthetic physical challenges specifically designed to evaluate such algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel approach by applying it to these benchmark challenges and showcase its practical utility for astrophysics by successfully extracting an analytic galaxy potential from a set of simulated orbits approximating stellar streams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tentative identification of approximately ten relativistic anti-helium cosmic-ray events at AMS-02 would, if confirmed, challenge our understanding of the astrophysical synthesis of heavy anti-nuclei. We propose a novel scenario for the enhanced production of such anti-nuclei that is triggered by isolated, catastrophic injections of large quantities of energetic Standard Model (SM) anti-quarks in our galaxy by physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM). We demonstrate that SM anti-nucleosynthetic processes that occur in the resulting rapidly expanding, thermalized fireballs of SM plasma can, for a reasonable range of parameters, produce the reported tentative $\sim 2:1$ ratio of anti-helium-3 to anti-helium-4 events at AMS-02, as well as their relativistic boosts. Moreover, we show that this can be achieved without violating anti-deuterium or anti-proton flux constraints for the appropriate anti-helium fluxes. A plausible BSM paradigm for the catastrophic injections is the collision of macroscopic composite dark-matter objects carrying large net anti-baryon number. Such a scenario would require these objects to be cosmologically stable, but to destabilize upon collision, promptly releasing a fraction of their mass energy into SM anti-particles within a tiny volume. We show that, in principle, the injection rate needed to attain the necessary anti-helium fluxes and the energetic conditions required to seed the fireballs appear possible to obtain in such a paradigm. We leave open the question of constructing a BSM particle physics model to realize this, but we suggest two concrete scenarios as promising targets for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planet formation occurs over a few Myr within protoplanetary discs of dust and gas, which are often assumed to evolve in isolation. However, extended gaseous structures have been uncovered around many protoplanetary discs, suggestive of late-stage in-fall from the interstellar medium (ISM). To quantify the prevalence of late-stage in-fall, we apply an excursion set formalism to track the local density and relative velocity of the ISM over the disc lifetime. We then combine the theoretical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion rate with a simple disc evolution model, anchoring stellar accretion time-scales to observational constraints. Disc lifetimes, as well as masses, stellar accretion rates and approximate gas radii as a function of stellar mass and age are remarkably well-reproduced by our simple model that includes only ISM accretion. If BHL accretion is the origin of the initial disc material, then $20{-}70$ percent of discs are mostly composed of material accreted in the most recent half of their lifetime, suggesting that disc properties are not a direct test of isolated evolution models. The ISM also deposits sufficient energy to drive observed turbulence in protoplanetary discs with viscous $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}- 10^{-1}$, although we emphasise that angular momentum transport may still be driven internal processes. Overall, our findings represent a compelling case for regulation of planet formation by galactic-scale turbulence, with broad consequences for planet formation theory. Our simple approach can be easily applied to semi-analytic models, and our results represent urgent motivation for an unbiased survey to confirm or refute our findings.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Production Mechanism of High-Energy Neutrinos from NGC 1068</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of high-energy neutrino signals from the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 provides us with an opportunity to study nonthermal processes near the center of supermassive black holes. Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than about 1-10 percent of the Eddington luminosity, and the emission radius should be less than about 15 Schwarzschild radii in low-beta plasma and less than about 3 Schwarzschild radii in high-beta plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints especially when the Bethe-Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered. Our results rule out the leptonic and beta decay scenarios in a nearly model-independent manner, and support hadronic mechanisms in magnetically-powered coronae if NGC 1068 is a source of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Jet formation in post-AGB binaries: Confronting cold magnetohydrodynamic disc wind wind models with observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aims: We consider cold self-similar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disc wind solutions to describe jets that are launched from the circumcompanion accretion discs in post-AGB binaries. Resulting predictions are matched to observations for five different post-AGB binaries. This both tests the physical validity of the MHD disc wind paradigm and reveals the accretion disc properties. Results: Many of the time-series' properties are reproduced well by the models, though systematic mismatches, such as overestimated rotation, remain. Four targets imply accretion discs that reach close to the secondary's stellar surface, while one is fitted with an unrealistically large inner radius of about 20 stellar radii. Some fits imply inner disc temperatures over 10 000 K, seemingly discrepant with a previous observational estimate from H band interferometry. This estimate is, however, shown to be biased. Fitted mass-accretion rates range from about 10^-6 to 10^-3 solar masses per year. Relative to the jets launched from young stellar objects (YSOs), all targets prefer winds with higher ejection efficiencies, lower magnetizations and thicker discs. Conclusions: Our models show that current cold MHD disc wind solutions can explain many of the jet-related Balmer alpha features seen in post-AGB binaries, though systematic discrepancies remain. This includes, but is not limited to, overestimated rotation and underestimated post-AGB circumbinary disc lifetimes. The consideration of thicker discs and the inclusion of irradiation from the post-AGB primary, leading to warm magnetothermal wind launching, might alleviate these.</description>
