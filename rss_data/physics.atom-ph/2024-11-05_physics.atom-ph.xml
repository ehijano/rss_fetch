      <title>On matrix elements of the vector physical quantities and methods of angular momentum in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods of angular momenta are modified and used to solve some actual problems in quantum mechanics. In particular, we re-derive some known formulas for analytical and numerical calculations of matrix elements of the vector physical quantities. These formulas are applied to a large number of quantum systems which have an explicit spherical symmetry. Multiple commutators of different powers of the angular momenta $\hat{\bf J}^{2}$ and vector-operator $\hat{\bf A}$ are determined in the general form. Calculations of the expectation values averaged over orbital angular momenta are also described in detail. This effective and elegant old technique, which was successfully used by E. Fermi and A. Bohr, is almost forgotten in modern times. We also discuss quantum systems with additional relations (or constraints) between some vector-operators and orbital angular momentum. For similar systems such relations allow one to obtain some valuable additional information about their properties, including the bound state spectra, correct asymptotics of actual wave functions, etc. As an example of unsolved problems we consider applications of the algebras of angular momenta to investigation of the one-electron, two-center (Coulomb) problem $(Q_1, Q_2)$. For this problem it is possible to obtain the closed analytical solutions which are written as the `correct' linear combinations of products of the two one-electron wave functions of the hydrogen-like ions with the nuclear charges $Q_1 + Q_2$ and $Q_1 - Q_2$, respectively. However, in contrast with the usual hydrogen-like ions such hydrogenic wave functions must be constructed in three-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean space with the metric (-1,-1,1).</description>

      <title>Associative ionization in a dilute ultracold $^7$Li gas probed with a hybrid trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of Li$_2^+$ and subsequently Li$^+$ ions, during the excitation of $^7$Li atoms to the $3S_{1/2}$ state in a $^7$Li magneto optical trap (MOT), is probed in an ion-atom hybrid trap. Associative ionization occurs during the collision of Li($2P_{3/2}$) and Li($3S_{1/2}$) ultracold atoms, creating Li$_2^+$ ions. Photodissociation of Li$_2^+$ by the MOT lasers is an active channel for the conversion of Li$_2^+$ to Li$^+$. A fraction of the Li$_2^+$ ions is long lived even in the presence of MOT light. Additionally, rapid formation of Li$^+$ from Li$_2^+$ in the absence of MOT light is observed. Resonant excitation of ultracold atoms, resulting in intricate molecular dynamics, reveals important processes in ultracold dilute gases.</description>

      <title>QED calculations of intra-$L$-shell singly excited states in Be-like ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \textit{ab initio} approach is used to evaluate the excitation energies of the $2s2p \, ^{2S+1}P_J$ states from the ground state as well as the $2s2p \, ^3P_1 \rightarrow 2s2p \, ^3P_0$ and $2s2p \, ^3P_2 \rightarrow 2s2p \, ^3P_1$ transition energies for selected Be-like highly-charged ions over a wide range: from ${\rm Ar}^{14+}$ to ${\rm U}^{88+}$. The issue of a strong level mixing due to the proximity of states with the same symmetry is addressed by applying the QED perturbation theory for quasidegenerate levels. The employed approach combines a rigorous perturbative QED treatment up to the second order with electron-electron correlation contributions of the third and higher orders calculated in the Breit approximation. The higher-order QED effects are estimated using the model-QED-operator approach. The nuclear-recoil and nuclear-polarization effects are taken into account as well. The performed calculations are accompanied with a thorough analysis of uncertainties due to uncalculated effects. The most accurate theoretical predictions for the excitation and transition energies in Be-like ions are obtained, which, in general, are in perfect agreement with the available experimental data.</description>

      <title>Theory of Laser Induced Strong-Field Ionization Tomographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced strong-field ionization tomography (LISFIT) is an emerging space-time tomographic modality with the potential to revolutionize imaging capabilities. To fully harness its power, a robust theoretical framework is essential. This work delves into the fundamental physics of strong-field ionization and its implications for tomographic imaging.
  Our analysis reveals an operational regime with significant resolution enhancement and unique intensity-resolution coupling, alongside localization phenomena rooted in the physics of strong-field interactions. We further identify a trade-off between resolution, localization extent, and signal-to-noise ratio, providing critical insights for optimizing experimental parameters.</description>

      <title>eTraj.jl: Trajectory-Based Simulation for Strong-Field Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of light-matter interactions in the realm of strong-field ionization has been a focal point and has attracted widespread interest. We present the eTraj$.$jl program package, designed to implement established classical/semiclassical trajectory-based methods to determine the photoelectron momentum distribution resulting from strong-field ionization of both atoms and molecules. The program operates within a unified theoretical framework that separates the trajectory-based computation into two stages: initial-condition preparation and trajectory evolution. For initial-condition preparation, we provide several methods, including the Strong-Field Approximation with Saddle-Point Approximation (SFA-SPA), SFA-SPA with Non-adiabatic Expansion (SFA-SPANE), and the Ammosov-Delone-Krainov theory (ADK), with atomic and molecular variants, as well as the Weak-Field Asymptotic Theory (WFAT) for molecules. For trajectory evolution, available options are Classical Trajectory Monte-Carlo (CTMC), which employs purely classical electron trajectories, and the Quantum Trajectory Monte-Carlo (QTMC) and Semi-Classical Two-Step model (SCTS), which include the quantum phase during trajectory evolution. The program is a versatile, efficient, and out-of-the-box solution for trajectory-based simulations for strong-field ionization. It is designed with user-friendliness in mind and is expected to serve as a valuable and powerful tool for the community of strong-field physics.</description>

      <title>Strong parity-violation effects induced by large-amplitude motions: A quantum-dynamics study of substituted chiral methanols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.1 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic superposition of vortex states in a matter wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating the vortex-state superposition in a matter wave is demanded in many quantum processes such as quantum memory and quantum metrology. Here we report the experimental generation of macroscopic superposition of vortex states in ultracold quantum gases. By transferring an optical vortex-state superposition to the center-of-mass rotational state of ultracold atoms using the Raman coupling technique, we realize two-vortex and three-vortex superposition states in quantum gases, demonstrating the high dimensionality of the vortex state. We show the controllability of the superposition states on the Bloch sphere. The lifetime of the vortex superposition state in quantum gases is as large as 25 ms, about two orders of magnitude longer than the storage time in atomic ensembles. This work paves the way for high dimensional quantum processing in matter waves.</description>

      <title>Spin migration in density functional theory: energy, potential and density perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flip, magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange-correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals, the KS potentials and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze five standard exchange-correlation functionals and find three main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, and the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Covariance Analysis of Impulsive Streaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive framework of modeling covariance in angular streaking experiments is presented. Within the impulsive streaking regime, the displacement of electron momentum distribution (MD) provides a tight connection between the dressing-free MD and the dressed MD. Such connection establishes universal structures in the composition of streaking covariance that are common across different MDs, regardless of their exact shape. Building on this robust framework, we have developed methods for retrieving temporal information from angular streaking measurements. By providing a detailed understanding of the covariance structure in angular streaking experiments, our work enables more accurate and robust temporal measurements in a wide range of experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a Chern insulator: topological signature and long-range repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Casimir-Polder interaction between a two-level atomic system and a Chern insulator for both the resonant and nonresonant channels. For a right circularly polarized excited atomic state near a Chern insulator with a negative Chern number $C$, the resonant Casimir-Polder force can be monotonically repulsive over a large range of separations. In the presence of the same Chern insulator, a right circularly polarized metastable atomic state is expected to experience a repulsive nonresonant Casimir-Polder force over a certain range of atom-surface separations in the far-field region. At still greater separations, the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force is expected to become attractive and exhibit a topological signature, being proportional to $(C\alpha)^2/(1+(C\alpha)^2)$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for Optical Quantum Memories Using Long-Lived Noble-Gas Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.08770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear spins of noble gases exhibit exceptionally long coherence times and can potentially serve as a long-lived storage medium for quantum information. We analyze and compare the performance of two mechanisms for mapping the quantum state of light onto the collective spin state of noble gases. The first mechanism utilizes collisional exchange with the electronic spin state of metastable noble-gas atoms, while the second relies on spin-exchange collisions with ground-state alkali-metal atoms. We describe the operation of an optical quantum memory relying on these two mechanisms using a compact model and study strategies that optimize the memory storage efficiency. Through numerical simulations, we identify optimal sequences for storing optical signals with different signal bandwidths and electronic spin relaxation rates. This work highlights the qualitative difference between the two approaches for using noble gases as long-lived quantum memories at non-cryogenic conditions and outlines the regimes in which they are expected to be efficient.</description>

      <title>Scalable architecture for trapped-ion quantum computing using RF traps and dynamic optical potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01168v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubits based on ions trapped in linear radio-frequency traps form a successful platform for quantum computing, due to their high fidelity of operations, all-to-all connectivity and degree of local control. In principle there is no fundamental limit to the number of ion-based qubits that can be confined in a single 1D register. However, in practice there are two main issues associated with long trapped-ion crystals, that stem from the 'softening' of their modes of motion, upon scaling up: high heating rates of the ions' motion, and a dense motional spectrum; both impede the performance of high-fidelity qubit operations. Here we propose a holistic, scalable architecture for quantum computing with large ion-crystals that overcomes these issues. Our method relies on dynamically-operated optical potentials, that instantaneously segment the ion-crystal into cells of a manageable size. We show that these cells behave as nearly independent quantum registers, allowing for parallel entangling gates on all cells. The ability to reconfigure the optical potentials guarantees connectivity across the full ion-crystal, and also enables efficient mid-circuit measurements. We study the implementation of large-scale parallel multi-qubit entangling gates that operate simultaneously on all cells, and present a protocol to compensate for crosstalk errors, enabling full-scale usage of an extensively large register. We illustrate that this architecture is advantageous both for fault-tolerant digital quantum computation and for analog quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Adiabatons in a double tripod coherent atom-light coupling scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical adiabatons are specific shape-invariant pulse pairs propagating at the reduced group velocity and without optical absorption in the medium. The purpose of this study is to analyze and demonstrate adiabaton formation in many level atomic systems. Here we focus on the analysis of five level M-type and double tripod systems. It is found that M-type atomic systems are prone to intensity dependent group velocity and pulse front steepening which prevents the formation of long range optical adiabatons. In contrast, the double tripod atomic system is quite favorable for the formation of optical adiabatons leading to two different optical field configurations propagating with invariant shape.</description>
