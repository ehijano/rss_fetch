      <title>Prototype acoustic positioning system for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design and initial performance characterization of the prototype acoustic positioning system intended for the Pacific Ocean Neutrino Experiment. It comprises novel piezo-acoustic receivers with dedicated filtering- and amplification electronics installed in P-ONE instruments and is complemented by a commercial system comprised of cabled and autonomous acoustic pingers for sub-sea installation manufactured by Sonardyne Ltd. We performed an in-depth characterization of the acoustic receiver electronics and their acoustic sensitivity when integrated into P-ONE pressure housings. These show absolute sensitivities of up to $-125\,$dB re V$^2/\mu$Pa$^2$ in a frequency range of $10-40\,$kHz. We furthermore conducted a positioning measurement campaign in the ocean by deploying three autonomous acoustic pingers on the seafloor, as well as a cabled acoustic interrogator and a P-ONE prototype module deployed from a ship. Using a simple peak-finding detection algorithm, we observe high accuracy in the tracking of relative ranging times at approximately $230-280\,\mu$s at distances of up to $1600\,$m, which is sufficient for positioning detectors in a cubic-kilometer detector and which can be further improved with more involved detection algorithms. The tracking accuracy is further confirmed by independent ranging of the Sonardyne system and closely follows the ship's drift in the wind measured by GPS. The absolute positioning shows the same tracking accuracy with its absolute precision only limited by the large uncertainties of the deployed pinger positions on the seafloor.</description>

      <title>Exploring unique design features of the Monolithic Stitched Sensor with Timing (MOST): yield, powering, timing, and sensor reverse bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic stitched CMOS sensors are explored for the upgrade of Inner Tracking System of the ALICE experiment (ITS3) and the R&amp;D of the CERN Experimental Physics Department. To learn about stitching, two 26 cm long stitched sensors, the Monolithic Stitched Sensor (MOSS), and the Monolithic Stitched Sensor with Timing (MOST), were implemented in the Engineering Round 1 (ER1) in the TPSCo 65nm ISC technology. Contrary to the MOSS, powered by 20 distinct power domains accessible from separate pads, the MOST has one global analog and digital power domain to or from which small fractions of the matrix can be connected or disconnected by conservatively designed power switches to prevent shorts or defects from affecting the full chip. Instead of the synchronous readout in the MOSS, the MOST immediately transfers hit information upon a hit, preserving timing information. The sensor reverse bias is also applied through the bias of the front-end rather than by a reverse substrate bias. This paper presents the first characterization results of the MOST, with the focus on its specific characteristics, including yield analysis, precise timing measurements, and the potential of its alternative biasing approach for improved sensor performance.</description>

      <title>Lessons from commissioning of the cryogenic system for the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector at Fermilab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Results from commissioning and first year of operations of the cryogenic system of the Short-Baseline Neutrino Detector (SBND) and its membrane cryostat installed at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory are described. The SBND detector is installed in a 200 m$^3$ membrane cryostat filled with liquid argon, which serves both as target and as active media. For the correct operation of the detector, the liquid argon must be kept in very stable thermal conditions while the contamination of electronegative impurities must be consistently kept at the level of small fractions of parts per billion. The detector is operated in Booster Neutrino Beams (BNB) at Fermilab for the search of sterile neutrinos and measurements of neutrino-argon cross sections. The cryostat and the cryogenic systems also serve as prototypes for the much larger equipment to be used for the LBNF/DUNE experiment. Since its installation in 2018-2023 and cooldown in spring of 2024, the cryostat and the cryogenic system have been commissioned to support the detector operations. The lessons learned through installation, testing, commissioning, cooldown, and initial operations are described.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Neutron Whispering Gallery States Using a Pulsed Neutron Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A neutron whispering gallery state is a quantum state localized on a material surface bound by the centrifugal force and the material potential. Precise measurements of such quantum states enable tests of quantum mechanics in non-inertial frames, characterization of the surface potential, and searches for hypothetical short-range interactions at the nanometer scale. We observed a neutron whispering gallery state on a $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ concave mirror using a pulsed cold neutron beam. The measured results agree with theoretical calculations within $1.9\%$ for the centrifugal acceleration $a \approx 7\times 10^7\,\mathrm{m/s^2}$, which is due to unmodeled deviations of the shape of the concave mirror edge from an ideal one. We found that the sensitivity itself was $1\times 10^{-4}$, which is two orders of magnitude better than the above agreement.</description>
