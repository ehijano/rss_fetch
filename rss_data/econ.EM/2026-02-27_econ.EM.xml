      <title>Forecasting on the Accuracy-Timeliness Frontier: Two Novel `Look Ahead' Predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the traditional Mean-Squared Error (MSE) forecasting paradigm by formally integrating an accuracy-timeliness trade-off: accuracy is defined by MSE (or target correlation) and timeliness by advancement (or phase excess). While MSE-optimized predictors are accurate in tracking levels, they sacrifice dynamic lead, causing them to lag behind changing targets. To address this, we introduce two `look-ahead' frameworks--Decoupling-from-Present (DFP) and Peak-Correlation-Shifting (PCS)--and provide closed-form solutions for their optimization. Notably, the classical MSE predictor is shown to be a special case within these frameworks. Dually, our methods achieve maximum advancement for any given accuracy level, so our approach reveals the complete efficient frontier of the accuracy-timeliness trade-off, whereas MSE represents only a single point. We also derive a universal upper bound on lead over MSE for any linear predictor under a consistency constraint and prove that our methods hit this ceiling. We validate this approach through applications in forecasting and real-time signal extraction, introducing a leading-indicator criterion and tailored linear benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Randomization Tests in Switchback Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Switchback experiments--alternating treatment and control over time--are widely used when unit-level randomization is infeasible, outcomes are aggregated, or user interference is unavoidable. In practice, experimentation must support fast product cycles, so teams often run studies for limited durations and make decisions with modest samples. At the same time, outcomes in these time-indexed settings exhibit serial dependence, seasonality, and occasional heavy-tailed shocks, and temporal interference (carryover or anticipation) can render standard asymptotics and naive randomization tests unreliable. In this paper, we develop a randomization-test framework that delivers finite-sample valid, distribution-free p-values for several null hypotheses of interest using only the known assignment mechanism, without parametric assumptions on the outcome process. For causal effects of interests, we impose two primitive conditions--non-anticipation and a finite carryover horizon m--and construct conditional randomization tests (CRTs) based on an ex ante pooling of design blocks into "sections," which yields a tractable conditional assignment law and ensures imputability of focal outcomes. We provide diagnostics for learning the carryover window and assessing non-anticipation, and we introduce studentized CRTs for a session-wise weak null that accommodates within-session seasonality with asymptotic validity. Power approximations under distributed-lag effects with AR(1) noise guide design and analysis choices, and simulations demonstrate favorable size and power relative to common alternatives. Our framework extends naturally to other time-indexed designs.</description>

      <title>Identification and estimation of dynamic random coefficient models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study linear panel data models with predetermined regressors (such as lagged dependent variables) where coefficients are individual-specific, allowing for heterogeneity in the effects of the regressors on the dependent variable. I show that the model is not point-identified in a short panel context but rather partially identified, and I characterize the identified sets for the mean, variance, and CDF of the coefficient distribution. This characterization is general, accommodating discrete, continuous, and unbounded data, and it leads to computationally tractable estimation and inference procedures. I apply the method to study lifecycle earnings dynamics among U.S. households using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) dataset. The results suggest the presence of unobserved heterogeneity in earnings persistence, implying that households face varying levels of earnings risk which, in turn, contribute to heterogeneity in their consumption and savings behaviors.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity Analysis with Heterogeneous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analysis of effect heterogeneity at the group level is standard practice in empirical treatment evaluation. However, treatments analyzed are often aggregates of multiple underlying treatments which are themselves heterogeneous, e.g. different modules of training programs. In these settings, conventional approaches such as comparing (adjusted) differences-in-means across groups can produce misleading conclusions when underlying treatment propensities differ systematically between groups. This paper develops a novel decomposition framework that disentangles contributions of effect heterogeneity and distinct components of treatment heterogeneity to observed group-level differences. We propose debiased machine learning estimators that adapt to many discrete and/or continuous treatments and limited overlap. We revisit a widely documented gender gap in training returns of an active labor market policy. The decomposition reveals that it is almost entirely driven by women being treated differently rather than different returns from identical treatments. In particular, women are disproportionately targeted towards vocational training tracks with lower unconditional returns.</description>

      <title>Functional Network Autoregressive Models for Panel Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel functional vector autoregressive framework for analyzing network interactions of functional outcomes in panel data settings. In this framework, an individual's outcome function is influenced by the outcomes of others through a simultaneous equation system. To estimate the functional parameters of interest, we need to address the endogeneity issue arising from these simultaneous interactions among outcome functions. This issue is carefully handled by developing a novel functional moment-based estimator. We establish the consistency, convergence rate, and pointwise asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator. Additionally, we discuss the estimation of marginal effects and impulse response analysis. As an empirical illustration, we analyze the demand for a bike-sharing service in the U.S. The results reveal statistically significant spatial interactions in bike availability across stations, with interaction patterns varying over the time of day.</description>
