      <title>Huge-Scale Assortment Optimization with Customer Choice: A Parallel Primal-Dual Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study huge-scale assortment optimization problems to maximize expected revenue under customer choice, addressing a fundamental challenge in industries such as transportation, retail, and healthcare. The choice-based linear programming (CBLP) formulation provides a powerful framework for optimizing sales allocations across customer segments, yet traditional approaches often fail to solve CBLPs of huge scale (involving millions of customer choices) due to the lack of algorithmic designs that exploit problem structure. To overcome this computational bottleneck, we propose a first-order primal-dual method, SPFOM, which requires only a small computational cost per iteration, achieves a provably near-optimal convergence rate, and can be readily extended to parallel computing environments. Computational experiments demonstrate the computational and practical superiority of SPFOM over state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale linear programs. The framework is extended to a multi-period assortment optimization setting with inventory constraints, where SPFOM estimates global shadow prices that enhance classical bid-price control policies compared with benchmark methods such as market segment decomposition. Numerical experiments and a case study using real-world data from the ZOZOTOWN platform validate the practical effectiveness of SPFOM, highlighting its advantages in improving revenue performance while maintaining balanced inventory levels.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control for output tracking with prescribed performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers a versatile framework for constraint handling and multi-objective optimisation, yet practical application faces challenges regarding initial and recursive feasibility, robustness against model mismatches, and sampled-data constraints. This thesis develops a novel MPC framework for a class of non-linear continuous-time systems governed by functional differential equations. It targets output tracking within prescribed error bounds while systematically overcoming these challenges.
  First, we introduce funnel MPC, an algorithm eliminating reliance on terminal conditions or restrictive long prediction horizons. Utilising funnel penalty functions -- state costs penalising tracking error deviations from time-varying boundaries -- this framework ensures feasibility while rigorously enforcing tracking performance guarantees.
  Next, we unify funnel MPC with model-free funnel feedback into a hybrid architecture. This synergises model-based optimisation with adaptive feedback compensation, achieving prescribed tracking performance despite structural model-plant mismatches, unmodelled dynamics, and unknown disturbances.
  To further enhance predictive accuracy, we integrate a data-driven learning framework that iteratively refines the model using system measurements, improving long-term performance without compromising robustness.
  Finally, we formalise the transition to sampled-data implementations. We derive explicit bounds on sampling rates and control effort to guarantee stability under piecewise constant control signals, a critical step for digital hardware deployment.
  By addressing feasibility, robustness, learning, and sampling, this thesis establishes a cohesive framework for output tracking within prescribed bounds, paving the way for future advances in learning-enhanced and robust MPC.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Practical Column Generation Approach for Identifying Carcinogenic Multi-Hit Gene Combinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cancer is often driven by specific combinations of an estimated two to nine gene mutations, known as multi-hit combinations. Identifying these combinations is critical for understanding carcinogenesis and designing targeted therapies. We formalise this challenge as the Multi-Hit Cancer Driver Set Cover Problem (MHCDSCP), a binary classification problem that selects gene combinations to maximise coverage of tumor samples while minimising coverage of normal samples. Existing approaches typically rely on exhaustive search and supercomputing infrastructure. In this paper, we present constraint programming and mixed integer programming formulations of the MHCDSCP. Evaluated on real-world cancer genomics data, our methods achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while running on a single commodity CPU in under a minute. Furthermore, we introduce a column generation heuristic capable of solving small instances to optimality. These results suggest that solving the MHCDSCP is less computationally intensive than previously believed, thereby opening research directions for exploring modelling assumptions.</description>

      <title>Computing Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz exponents via composition and symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise calculus rules for the Kurdyka-\L{}ojasiewicz (KL) exponent using the rank theorem and Lie group actions. They apply to a wide class of composite and invariant functions, and are particularly suitable for handling nonisolated local minima. Notably, smoothness plays no role, eschewing gradient and Hessian computations. This provides a unified framework for establishing linear convergence of various algorithms in matrix factorization, $\ell_1$-matrix factorization, matrix sensing, and linear neural networks.</description>

      <title>Directional first order approach for a class of bilevel programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of bilevel optimization program (BP), where the feasible set of the lower level program is independent of the upper level variable. For bilevel programs it is known that the first order approach requires the convexity of the lower level program while reformulations involving the value function results in difficult optimization problems. In this paper we propose a directional first order approach which does not require the convexity of the lower level program. First, under some reasonable assumptions, we show that the lower level program can be equivalently characterized by its first order condition over a directional neighborhood. Next, for the resulting single level optimization problem, under common constraint qualifications, we establish directional necessary optimality conditions. Finally, an example of BP with nonconvex lower level program is given, where we demonstrate the failure of the classical first order approach and derive necessary optimality conditions using its directional counterpart.</description>

      <title>Gradient Dominance in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: A Unified Analysis for Continuous-Time and Discrete-Time Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its nonconvexity, policy optimization for the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) admits a favorable structural property known as gradient dominance, which facilitates linear convergence of policy gradient methods to the globally optimal gain. While gradient dominance has been extensively studied, continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs have largely been analyzed separately, relying on slightly different assumptions, proof strategies, and resulting guarantees. In this paper, we present a unified gradient dominance property for both continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs under mild stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Our analysis is based on a convex reformulation derived from a common Lyapunov inequality representation and a unified change-of-variables procedure. This convex-lifting perspective yields a single proof framework applicable to both time models. The unified treatment clarifies how differences between continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics influence theoretical guarantees and reveals a deeper structural symmetry between the two formulations. Numerical examples illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Dantzig-Wolfe and Arc-Flow Reformulations: A Systematic Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is a widely used technique for obtaining stronger relaxations in the context of branch-and-bound methods for solving integer optimization problems. Arc-Flow reformulations are a lesser known technique related to dynamic programming that has experienced a resurgence as result of the recent popularization of decision diagrams as a tool for solving integer programs. Although these two reformulation techniques arose independently, the recently proposed solution paradigm known as column elimination has revealed that they are in fact closely connected. Building on a unified formulation and notation, this study clarifies the theoretical connections and computational trade-offs between these two reformulations.
  We first revisit the known fact that the LP relaxations of these two reformulations yield the same dual bound. We then dig deeper, establishing conditions under which valid inequalities in the original, Dantzig-Wolfe, or Arc-Flow spaces can be translated across reformulations without loss of strength, and reinterpreting iterative strengthening methods, such as decremental state-space relaxation and column elimination, through the lens of cutting planes. To assess the potential impact of these insights empirically, we benchmark both reformulations under identical conditions on the vehicle routing problem with time windows using state-of-the-art column- and cut-generation techniques. The results identify clear contrasts: the Arc-Flow reformulation benefits from faster convergence and performs best when subproblems are highly relaxed or low-dimensional, whereas the Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is more efficient when the master problem remains compact. Overall, our study provides a unified perspective and practical guidelines for choosing between Dantzig-Wolfe and Arc-Flow reformulations in large-scale integer optimization.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds for Linear Minimization Oracle Methods Optimizing over Strongly Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the oracle complexity of constrained convex optimization given access to a Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) for the constraint set and a gradient oracle for the $L$-smooth, strongly convex objective. This model includes Frank-Wolfe methods and their many variants. Over the problem class of strongly convex constraint sets $S$, our main result proves that no such deterministic method can guarantee a final objective gap less than $\varepsilon$ in fewer than $\Omega(\sqrt{L\, \mathrm{diam}(S)^2/\varepsilon})$ iterations. Our lower bound matches, up to constants, the accelerated Frank-Wolfe theory of Garber and Hazan (2015). Together, these establish this as the optimal complexity for deterministic LMO methods over strongly convex constraint sets. Second, we consider optimization over $\beta$-smooth sets, finding that in the modestly smooth regime of $\beta=\Omega(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$, no complexity improvement for span-based LMO methods is possible against either compact convex sets or strongly convex sets.</description>

      <title>Efficient exact sequential lifting algorithm for binary knapsack set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifting is a crucial technique in mixed integer programming (MIP) for generating strong valid inequalities, which serve as cutting planes to improve the branch-and-cut algorithm. We first propose an exact sequential lifting algorithm for the binary knapsack set, which employs the dominance list structure to remove redundant storage and computation in the dynamic programming (DP) array. This structure preserves scale invariance and effectively handles constraints with non-integer coefficients. Then, a reduction method is developed for the lifting procedure under some conditions, further enhancing computational efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms DP with arrays in terms of both efficiency and stability, particularly for large-scale and large-capacity instances. Moreover, it enables exact sequential lifting for binary knapsack sets with non-integer weights and large capacities, making it directly applicable in modern MIP solvers.</description>

      <title>Robust Distributed Nonconvex Optimization Enabling Communication Acceleration and Privacy Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses a distributed nonconvex optimization problem over multi-agent networks, where each agent exchanges its local information solely with its neighbors. Given that most existing distributed nonconvex optimization algorithms are susceptible to information leakage during inter agent communications, we propose a Robust Proximal Primal dual algorithm, referred to as RPP, to enhance the security of information transmission. In contrast to many existing approaches that directly transmit local variables throughout the network, we introduce carefully designed random noises to obfuscate sensitive local information. This not only preserves privacy but also demonstrates the noise robustness of our proposed algorithm. We establish a sublinear rate at which RPP converges to a stationary solution. Moreover, by incorporating Chebyshev acceleration, an accelerated variant of RPP is developed and achieves the optimal communication complexity bound for the algorithms that allow for exchanging local deci sions at each iteration. The superior convergence performance of RPP is validated through a few numerical experiments, which also indicate that, within an appropriate range, the introduced perturbations do not impede the convergence speed of RPP.</description>

      <title>Generalized fluctuation bounds for stochastic algorithms in the presence of compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a convergence result for sequences of random variables taking values in a metric space that satisfy a stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotonicity condition, in the context of a (local) compactness assumption. Our result is quantitative in that we derive an explicit and effective construction which, in terms of only a few moduli representing quantitative witnesses to key properties of the sequence of random variables and the underlying metric space involved, provides a metastable rate of pointwise convergence, a type of generalized fluctuation bound. That quantitative result in particular relies on the development of a finitary theory of martingales, culminating in a fully finitary Robbins-Siegmund theorem. We outline how this result particularises to the circumstances of the seminal work of Combettes and Pesquet on stochastic quasi-Fej\'er monotone sequences in separable Hilbert spaces, and we provide an initial application by illustrating how these results can be used to provide a metastable rate of pointwise convergence for a stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann scheme solving a stochastic common fixed point problem for nonexpansive maps over proper Hadamard spaces. This work is set in the context of recent applications of the logic-based methodology of proof mining to probability theory, and represents its most sophisticated case study to date.</description>

      <title>Existence of Quantum Splines via Fourth-Order Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a rigorous existence theory for the quantum splines introduced by Brody, Holm, and Meier in Physical Review Letters (2012). These curves arise as solutions of a variational problem on the unitary group describing optimally controlled quantum evolutions. By formulating the problem within a geometric gradient flow framework for Riemannian spline interpolation, we construct a well-posed fourth order evolution whose asymptotic limits realize the desired quantum splines. The analysis requires adapting the variational structure to boundary conditions dictated by the physical model, which are not directly amenable to the setting in our recently developed framework for gradient flows of Riemannian spline interpolation. We show that, despite these difficulties, the modified system admits a rigorous analytical treatment, yielding both existence and a constructive procedure for generating quantum splines. Our results provide a mathematical foundation for the variational description of smooth quantum control trajectories and clarify the analytical structure underlying their formation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Frank-Wolfe (FW) methods for constrained bilevel optimization when the lower-level problem is solved only approximately, yielding biased and inexact hypergradients. We analyze inexact variants of vanilla FW as well as away-step and pairwise FW, and provide convergence rates in the nonconvex setting under gradient errors. By combining these results with recent bounds on hypergradient errors from iterative and approximate implicit differentiation, we derive overall iteration complexity guarantees for bilevel FW. Experiments on two real-world applications validate the theory and demonstrate practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Differential Inclusions driven by Maximal Monotone Operators with empty interiors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the long-time behavior of stochastic differential inclusions driven by maximal monotone operators, motivated by continuous-time models of first-order optimization methods under noisy or approximate operator information. We first address well-posedness and show that existence and uniqueness can be established without the customary requirement that the operator's domain has nonempty interior, by adopting an appropriate notion of solution. We then analyze asymptotic properties of the resulting stochastic dynamics, extending convergence guarantees beyond previously studied settings that rely on smooth potentials, full-domain subdifferentials, or Lipschitz monotone operators. In addition, we consider a Tikhonov-type regularization of the stochastic inclusion and prove corresponding well-posedness and long-time convergence results.</description>

      <title>Operator learning for prescribed-time stabilization of reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses boundary prescribed-time stabilization of a one-dimensional heat equation with spatially and temporally varying coefficients. In contrast to asymptotic or exponential stabilization, prescribed-time stabilization ensures convergence to equilibrium within a user-defined time that is independent of the initial condition, a property that is particularly attractive in applications with stringent transient performance requirements. The backstepping design for this problem requires solving, at each time instant, a two-dimensional time-dependent kernel Partial Differential Equation (PDE) whose solution continuously varies with the plant coefficients. The repeated numerical solution of this parabolic kernel PDE results in a prohibitive computational burden, thereby limiting real-time applicability. To overcome this limitation, we propose a neural-operator-based approximation of the mapping from the time-varying system coefficient to the corresponding backstepping kernel. The operator is trained offline using representative solutions of the kernel PDE and subsequently deployed online to generate the required time-varying kernels in real time. We establish, via Lyapunov analysis, that the resulting neural-operator-based controller preserves prescribed-time stability provided that the operator approximation error satisfies an explicit bound. Furthermore, we investigate a direct approximation of the full feedback law mapping the plant parameter functions and state measurements to the boundary control input. For this setting, we prove semiglobal practical prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the computational cost of kernel generation by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling real-time prescribed-time stabilization for heat equations with spatially and temporally varying coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We study free orthotropic material optimization for two-dimensional plane-stress compliance minimization with two well-ordered isotropic phases, motivated by the gap between tensors admissible in classical free-material optimization and tensors realizable by composites. To reduce this gap, we construct a hierarchy of realizability-aware admissible sets induced by zeroth-order, Voigt, and Hashin--Shtrikman (HS) energy bounds, moving from convex relaxations to a tighter nonconvex model. In the convex zeroth-order and Voigt settings, the Voigt set is strictly tighter for intermediate volume fractions and coincides with the zeroth-order set at pure-phase endpoints, and the Voigt model reduces to an isotropic variable-thickness-sheet formulation. In the single-loadcase continuum zeroth-order problem, at least one optimal solution can be chosen orthotropic. For HS constraints, we rewrite the bound as a Voigt term minus a nonnegative correction, clarifying strict tightening for interior volume fractions and local nonconvexity. We further prove that the convex hull of the HS feasible set equals the Voigt set and derive reduced formulations via active-constraint analysis and explicit elementwise volume characterization, including reductions specialized to orthotropic effective tensors. In the single-loadcase continuum setting, the HS relaxation is tight with the Allaire--Kohn relaxed problem, attained in the relaxation sense by sequential laminates, whereas in generic multi-loadcase settings it provides a lower bound on optimal compliance over general microstructures. The resulting nonconvex orthotropic HS problem is solved by sequential global programming, and numerical results confirm the predicted compliance hierarchy and show close agreement with finite-rank laminate references.</description>

      <title>Efficient Interior-Point Methods for Hyperbolic Programming via Straight-Line Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperbolic (HB) programming generalizes many popular convex optimization problems, including semidefinite and second-order cone programming. Despite substantial theoretical progress on HB programming, efficient computational tools for solving large-scale hyperbolic programs remain limited. This paper presents DDS 3.0, a new release of the Domain-Driven Solver, which provides an efficient interior-point implementation tailored for hyperbolic programming. A key innovation lies in a new straight-line program (SLP) representation that enables compact representation and efficient computation of hyperbolic polynomials, their gradients, and Hessians. The SLP structure significantly reduces computational cost, allowing the Hessian to be computed in the same asymptotic complexity as the gradient through a batched reverse-over-forward differentiation scheme. We further introduce an improved corrector step for the primal-dual interior-point method, enhancing stability and convergence on convex sets where only the primal self-concordant barrier is efficiently computable. We create a comprehensive benchmark library beyond the elementary symmetric polynomials, using several different techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial performance gains of DDS 3.0 compared to first-order Frank-Wolfe algorithm, homotopy method, and SDP software utilizing SDP relaxations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Large-Scale Adversarial Swarm Engagements using Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optimal control of large-scale autonomous systems under explicitly adversarial conditions, incorporating the probabilistic destruction of agents over time. In many such systems, adversarial interactions arise as different agents or groups compete against one another. A crucial yet often overlooked factor in existing theoretical and modeling frameworks is the random attrition of agents during operation. Effective modeling and control strategies must therefore account for both agent attrition and spatial dynamics.
  Given the inherently random nature of agent survival, directly solving this problem is challenging. To address this, we propose and evaluate three approximate numerical modeling approaches in which agent survival probabilities decrease deterministically over time based on their relative positions. We apply these schemes to a scenario where agents defend a high-value unit against an attacking swarm. Our results demonstrate that these models can effectively capture the dynamics of such interactions, provided that attrition and spatial positioning are tightly integrated. These findings are relevant to a broad range of adversarial autonomy scenarios where both agent positioning and survival probabilities play a critical role.</description>

      <title>Anchoring and Mixed-Norm Contractions in Averaging-Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single informed agent can draw an arbitrarily large network to the ground truth. This is the sharpest consequence of the "Averaging plus Learning" framework studied here, where agents update opinions by socially averaging neighbours while some receive private feedback at heterogeneous rates. The key is a graph-theoretic property we call condensely anchored, which implies convergence to the correct consensus on fixed networks. In the original framework of Popescu and Vaidya (2023), every agent was required to learn. Removing that requirement changes the problem fundamentally: the underlying graph must now carry the signal from a handful of anchors to everyone else. When learning rates decay to zero, a persistence condition on the rates alone suffices, with no uniform connectivity or aperiodicity assumed. The hardest case is intermittent connectivity, where no single time step contracts in any standard norm. A mixed-operator-norm framework is developed that extracts two-step contraction from the interplay between aggregate learning mass and entrywise diffusion of influence, a mechanism new to consensus literature. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's robustness: vanishing noise preserves convergence to the ground truth, whereas persistent noise drives the system to a limiting law.</description>

      <title>QuadSync: Quadrifocal Tensor Synchronization via Tucker Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In structure from motion, quadrifocal tensors capture more information than their pairwise counterparts (essential matrices), yet they have often been thought of as impractical and only of theoretical interest. In this work, we challenge such beliefs by providing a new framework to recover $n$ cameras from the corresponding collection of quadrifocal tensors. We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares. We further establish relationships between the block quadrifocal, trifocal, and bifocal tensors, and introduce an algorithm that jointly synchronizes these three entities. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on modern datasets, indicating the potential and importance of using higher-order information in synchronization.</description>

      <title>Steady State Covariance Steering via Sparse Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the steady state covariance steering for linear dynamical systems via structural intervention on the system matrix. We formulate the covariance steering problem as the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the steady state and target Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem, we develop a solution method, hereafter referred to as the proximal gradient-based algorithm, of promoting sparsity in the structural intervention by integrating the objective into a proximal gradient framework with L1 regularization. The main contribution of this paper lies in the analytical expression of the KL divergence gradient with respect to the intervention matrix: the gradient is characterized by the solutions to two Lyapunov equations related to the state covariance equation and its adjoint. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proximal gradient-based algorithm effectively identifies sparse, structurally-constrained interventions to achieve precise covariance steering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.23144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate variational problems in quantum thermodynamics at positive temperature, in which admissible states are constrained by prescribed outcomes of a finite set of measurements. We solve a problem raised by the recent work \cite[Section C]{MarkWilde} and develop a general mathematical setup which allows a broad class of possible regularizations. Employing methods inspired by non-commutative optimal transport, we analyze the dual formulation of the problem, study the existence and characterization of maximizers, and investigate the qualitative behavior of the model in the zero-temperature limit. In the second part, we tailor this framework to quantum state tomography and quantum optimal transport. Finally, we address computational aspects, with particular attention to the convergence of algorithms in selected cases.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Persistent Topological Features and Minimum Homological Cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent homology is a popular method for computing topological features of (metric) data. Standard approaches based on the \v{C}ech or Rips filtration are stable under small perturbations of the data, but highly sensitive to outliers. This lack of robustness has been frequently addressed in the literature. In this paper, we take a novel perspective by asking the following question: When can we guarantee that an observed persistent feature (a bar) is inherent to the underlying data in the presence of a limited number of unknown, arbitrary outliers. We formalize this question by introducing the notion of \emph{adversarial robustness}, and study the problem of deciding whether a given bar in the barcode of a filtered simplicial complex is adversarially robust. We show that this problem is essentially equivalent to a homological variant of the minimum cut problem in simplicial complexes, which we believe to be of independent interest. As our main technical contribution, we provide the first computational complexity results for this problem, consisting of an efficient algorithm in $0$-dimensional homology, NP-hardness for the general problem, and an efficient algorithm for codimension-$1$ in $n$-dimensional complexes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also analyze its natural linear programming relaxation, whose dual defines a homological analog of the max-flow problem in graphs. We show that a max-flow/min-cut theorem does not hold in our setting, implying that the LP relaxation is not tight in general. Finally, in the special case of the Rips filtration, we provide a global heuristic based on the Hausdorff distance that guarantees adversarial robustness of sufficiently long bars. This connects adversarial robustness to standard stability theorems in persistent homology.</description>

      <title>Partial Lagrange Multiplier Expressions and Disjunctive Decompositions for Bilevel Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies bilevel polynomial optimization in which lower-level constraint functions depend linearly on lower-level variables. We show that such bilevel program can be reformulated as a disjunctive program by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with a sparse type of Lagrange multipliers. This kind of Lagrange multipliers can be conveniently represented by polynomials, for which we call partial Lagrange multiplier expressions (PLMEs). By doing this, each branch problem of the disjunctive program can be solved efficiently by polynomial optimization techniques. Solving each branch problem either returns infeasibility or gives a candidate local or global optimizer for the original bilevel optimization. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for these candidates to be global optimizers, and sufficient conditions for the local optimality. Numerical experiments are also presented to show the efficiency of the method.</description>

      <title>Hessian-Free Distributed Bilevel Optimization via Penalization with Time-Scale Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers a class of distributed bilevel optimization (DBO) problems with a coupled inner-level subproblem. Existing approaches typically rely on hypergradient estimations involving computationally expensive Hessian evaluation. To address this, we approximate the DBO problem as a minimax problem by properly designing a penalty term that enforces both the constraint imposed by the inner-level subproblem and the consensus among the decision variables of agents. Moreover, we propose a loopless distributed algorithm, AHEAD, that employs multiple-timescale updates to solve the approximate problem asymptotically without requiring Hessian computation. Theoretically, we establish sharp convergence rates for nonconvex-strongly-convex settings and for distributed minimax problems as special cases. Our analysis reveals a clear dependence of convergence performance on node heterogeneity, penalty parameters, and network connectivity, with a weaker assumption on heterogeneity that only requires bounded gradients at the optimum. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Optimization with Multi-sourced Information and Unknown Reliability: A Distributionally Robust Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In problems that involve input parameter information gathered from multiple data sources with varying reliability, incorporating decision makers' trust on different sources in optimization models can potentially improve solution performance. In this work, we propose a novel multi-reference distributionally robust optimization (MR-DRO) framework, where the model inputs are uncertain and their probability distributions can be statistically inferred from multiple information sources. Via nonparametric data fusion, we construct a Wasserstein ambiguity set to minimize the worst-case expected cost of a stochastic objective function, accounting for both uncertainty and unknown reliability of several given information sources. We reformulate the MR-DRO model as a linear program given linear objective and constraints in the original problem. We also incorporate a dynamic trust update mechanism that adjusts the trust for each source based on its performance over time. In addition, we introduce the concept of probability dominance to identify sources with dominant trust. Via computational studies using resource allocation and portfolio optimization instances, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the MR-DRO approach compared to traditional optimization frameworks relying on a single data source. Our results highlight the significance of integrating (dynamic) decision maker's trust in optimization under uncertainty, particularly when given diverse and potentially conflicting input data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a stochastic linear quadratic control problem with partial observation. A near optimal control in the weak formulation is characterized. The main features of this paper are the presence of the control in the diffusion term of the state equation, the circular dependence between the control process and the filtration generated by the observation, and the observation process contains an unbounded drift term. We address these difficulties by first restricting the control to a smaller domain, which enables us to apply the Girsanov theorem using a conditional argument and thereby break the circular dependence. Subsequently, we study the restricted problem using a non-standard variation method. The desired near optimal control is then obtained by taking the limit of an approximating sequence.</description>

      <title>DeepMartingale: Duality of the Optimal Stopping Problem with Expressivity and High-Dimensional Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose \textit{DeepMartingale}, a deep-learning framework for the dual formulation of discrete-monitoring optimal stopping problems under continuous-time models. Leveraging a martingale representation, our method implements a \emph{pure-dual} procedure that directly optimizes over a parameterized class of martingales, producing computable and tight \emph{dual upper bounds} for the value function in high-dimensional settings without requiring any primal information or Snell-envelope approximation. We prove convergence of the resulting upper bounds under mild assumptions for both first- and second-moment losses. A key contribution is an expressivity theorem showing that \textit{DeepMartingale} can approximate the true value function to any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$ using neural networks of size at most $\tilde{c} d^{\tilde{q}}\varepsilon^{-\tilde{r}}$, with constants independent of the dimension $d$ and accuracy $\varepsilon$, thereby avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Since expressivity in this setting translates into scalability, our theory also motivates estimating the dimension scaling law to guide architecture design and the training setup in deep learning-based numerical computation and the choice of rebalancing frequency for the related hedging strategy. The learned martingale representation further yields a practical and dimension-scalable \emph{deep delta hedging strategy}. Numerical experiments on high-dimensional Bermudan option benchmarks confirm convergence, expressivity, scalable training, and the stability of the resulting upper bounds and hedging performance.</description>

Abstract: An energy community is modeled as a cooperative game, where a veto player is needed beyond the prosumers to manage the community, and the worth of a coalition is its benefit compared to the selfish behaviour of the prosumers. Properties of the game such as superadditivity, monotonicity, convexity and balancedness are analyzed both in the presence and absence of admission fees. Then, the least core and its value are studied in detail, underlying the differences between the cases where the game is balanced or not. In particular, an exact formula and computable bounds for the least core value are provided, and the maximum and minimum reward in the least core for the veto player are analyzed. Finally, a few computational approaches for the exact formula are developed and tested.</description>

      <title>Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for nonlinear constrained convex problems and applications to distributed resource allocation and constrained machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of structured convex optimization problems, which have a two-block separable objective and nonlinear functional constraints as well as affine constraints that couple the two block variables. Such problems naturally arise from distributed resource allocation and constrained machine learning. To achieve high communication efficiency for the distributed applications, we propose a nonlinear alternating direction method of multipliers (NL-ADMM) that preserves the classical splitting structure while accommodating general convex functional constraints. Unlike existing ADMM variants for nonconvex constrained problems, the proposed method does not require smoothness of the objective functions or differentiability of the constraint mapping, by leveraging convexity of the considered problem. We establish global convergence and an ergodic $O(1/k)$ convergence rate of NL-ADMM by assuming the existence of a KKT solution. The results extend those of ADMM for linearly constrained convex problems. Numerical experiments are conducted on two representative distributed tasks. The results on numerous instances demonstrate that NL-ADMM can achieve (in many cases) 100x higher communication efficiency than the classic augmented Lagrangian method and nearly 2x higher than the Douglas-Rachford operator splitting method, making the new method well suited for large-scale distributed learning systems.</description>

      <title>Inertial dynamical systems and accelerated algorithms with implicit Hessian-driven damping for nonconvex optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the investigation of inertial dynamical systems with implicit Hessian-driven damping for strongly quasiconvex optimization which is a specific class of nonconvex optimization problems. We first establish exponential convergence rate properties for this system without requiring Lipschitz continuity of the gradient on the function. Then, we obtain an inertial accelerated algorithm for minimizing strongly quasiconvex functions through natural explicit time discretization to the dynamical system. Meanwhile, we consider an exogenous additive perturbation term to this dynamical system and obtain the corresponding algorithm. By utilizing the Lyapunov method, we establish convergence rates of iterative sequences and their function values. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Reinterpreting EMML as Mirror Descent for Constrained Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Expectation--Maximization Maximum Likelihood (EMML) algorithm belongs to the Expectation--Maximization family and is widely used for image reconstruction problems under Poisson noise.In this paper, we reinterpret EMML as a mirror descent method applied to a reparametrized objective function. This perspective allows us to incorporate convex constraints into the algorithm through appropriately chosen Bregman projections, while preserving the multiplicative structure of the EMML updates to ensure computational efficiency. We then establish the convergence of the resulting algorithm toward a solution of the constrained maximum-likelihood problem. Numerical experiments on hyperspectral unmixing problems demonstrate that the constrained EMML converges in fewer iterations than the classical EMML.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Games on Large Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for stochastic games on large sparse graphs, covering continuous-time and discrete-time dynamic games as well as static games. Players are indexed by the vertices of simple, locally finite graphs, allowing both finite and countably infinite populations, with asymptotics described through local weak convergence of marked graphs. The framework allows path-dependent utility functionals that may be heterogeneous across players. Under a contraction condition, we prove existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria and establish exponential decay of correlations with graph distance. We further show that global equilibria can be approximated by truncated local games, and can even be reconstructed exactly on subgraphs given information on their boundary. Finally, we prove convergence of Nash equilibria along locally weakly convergent graph sequences, including sequences sampled from hyperfinite unimodular random graphs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Control Problems with Infinite Horizon and Regime Switching Arising in Optimal Liquidation with Semimartingale Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an optimal control problem on infinite time horizon with semimartingale strategies, random coefficients and regime switching. The value function and the optimal strategy can be characterized in terms of three systems of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) with infinite horizon. One of them is a system of linear BSDEs with unbounded coefficients and infinite horizon, which seems to be new in literature. We establish the existence of the solutions to these BSDEs by BMO analysis and comparison theorem for multi-dimensional BSDEs. Next, we establish that the optimal control problem is well posed, in the sense that the value function is finite and the optimal strategy-when it exists-is unique. This is achieved by reformulating the cost functional as the sum of a quadratic functional and the candidate value function. The reformulation crucially relies on the well-established well-posedness results for systems of BSDEs. Finally, under additional assumptions, we obtain the unique optimal strategy.</description>

      <title>Implicit Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20793v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision Diagrams (DDs) have emerged as a powerful tool for discrete optimization, with rapidly growing adoption. DDs are directed acyclic layered graphs; restricted DDs are a generalized greedy heuristic for finding feasible solutions, and relaxed DDs compute combinatorial relaxed bounds. There is substantial theory that leverages DD-based bounding, yet the complexity of constructing the DDs themselves has received little attention. Standard restricted DD construction requires $O(w \log(w))$ per layer; standard relaxed DD construction requires $O(w^2)$, where $w$ is the width of the DD. Increasing $w$ improves bound quality at the cost of more time and memory.
  We introduce implicit Decision Diagrams, storing arcs implicitly rather than explicitly, and reducing per-layer complexity to $O(w)$ for restricted and relaxed DDs. We prove this is optimal: any framework treating state-update and merge operations as black boxes cannot do better.
  Optimal complexity shifts the challenge from algorithmic overhead to low-level engineering. We show how implicit DDs can drive a MIP solver, and release ImplicitDDs, an open-source Julia solver exploiting the implementation refinements our theory enables. Experiments demonstrate the solver outperforms Gurobi on Subset Sum.

      <title>A spherical amplitude-phase formulation for 3-D adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) guidance with USGES stability guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recently proposed 3-D adaptive line-of-sight (ALOS) path-following algorithm addressed coupled motion dynamics of marine craft, aircraft and uncrewed vehicles under environmental disturbances such as wind, waves and ocean currents. Stability analysis established uniform semi-global exponential stability (USGES) using a body-velocity-based amplitude-phase representation of the North-East-Down kinematic differential equations. However, the analysis is limited to straight-line paths, and restrictive assumptions are needed to ensure convergence of the vertical crab angle estimation error to zero. In this paper, we revisit the ALOS framework and introduce a novel spherical amplitude-phase design model that uses an alternative definition of the vertical crab angle. Our proposed formulation enables a significantly simplified stability proof, while retaining the USGES property for straight-line paths, removing restrictive assumptions on constant altitude/depth or zero horizontal crab angle, and remaining valid for general 3-D motion with nonzero roll, pitch and flight-path angles. We also show that the USGES result extends to a class of curved 3-D paths.</description>
