      <title>The green transition of firms: The role of evolutionary competition, adjustment costs, transition risk, and green technology progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an evolutionary competition model to investigate the green transition of firms, highlighting the role of adjustment costs, dynamically adjusted transition risk, and green technology progress in this process. Firms base their decisions to adopt either green or brown technologies on relative performance. To incorporate the costs of switching to another technology into their decision-making process, we generalize the classical exponential replicator dynamics. Our global analysis reveals that increasing transition risk, e.g., by threatening to impose stricter environmental regulations, effectively incentivizes the green transition. Economic policy recommendations derived from our model further suggest maintaining high transition risk regardless of the industry's level of greenness. Subsidizing the costs of adopting green technologies can reduce the risk of a failed green transition. While advances in green technologies can amplify the effects of green policies, they do not completely eliminate the possibility of a failed green transition. Finally, evolutionary pressures favor the green transition when green technologies are profitable.</description>

      <title>Voting with Random Proposers: Two Rounds Suffice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces Voting with Random Proposers (VRP) procedure to address the challenges of agenda manipulation in voting. In each round of VRP, a randomly selected proposer suggests an alternative that is voted on against the previous round's winner. In a framework with single-peaked preferences, we show that the VRP procedure guarantees that the Condorcet winner is implemented in a few rounds with truthful voting, and in just two rounds under sufficiently symmetric preference distributions or if status quo positions are not extreme. The results have applications for committee decisions, legislative decision-making, and the organization of citizens' assemblies and decentralized autonomous organizations.</description>

      <title>Motivated Reasoning and the Political Economy of Climate Change Inaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two office-driven politicians compete in an election by proposing policies. There are two possible states of the world: climate change is either mild, with no lasting effect on welfare if addressed properly, or severe, leading to reduced welfare even with appropriate measures. Voters receive signals about the state but may interpret them in a non-Bayesian way, holding motivated beliefs. An equilibrium always exists where voters ignore signals suggesting severe consequences, causing politicians to propose policies for mild climate change -- even when they know otherwise. If severe climate change leads to only moderate welfare losses, another efficient equilibrium exists. In this equilibrium, voters trust politicians to choose the optimal policies, implying voters choose to trust their signals, which in turn encourages optimal policy choices by politicians. The model highlights the role of political rhetoric and trust in government, and a first glance at the data reveals patterns consistent with the models predictions.</description>

      <title>On the limits of informationally efficient stock markets: New insights from a chartist-fundamentalist model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize a chartist-fundamentalist model to examine the limits of informationally efficient stock markets. In our model, chartists are permanently active in the stock market, while fundamentalists trade only when their mispricing-dependent trading signals are strong. Our findings indicate the possible coexistence of two distinct regimes. Depending on the initial conditions, the stock market may exhibit either constant or oscillatory mispricing. Constant mispricing occurs when chartists remain the sole active speculators, causing the stock price to converge toward a nonfundamental value. Conversely, the stock price oscillates around its fundamental value when fundamentalists repeatedly enter and exit the market. Exogenous shocks result in intricate regime-switching dynamics.</description>

      <title>Beveridgean Phillips Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new, Beveridgean model of the Phillips curve. While the New Keynesian Phillips Curve is based on monopolistic pricing under price-adjustment costs, the Beveridgean Phillips curve is based on directed-search pricing under price-adjustment costs. Under directed-search pricing, prices respond to slack instead of marginal costs. The Beveridgean Phillips curve links the inflation gap to the unemployment gap, with the following properties. First, it produces the divine coincidence: it guarantees that the rate of inflation is on target whenever the rate of unemployment is efficient. Second, whenever the Beveridge curve shifts, the Phillips curve shifts if it is formulated with inflation and unemployment, but it remains unaffected if it is formulated with inflation and labor-market tightness. Third, the Phillips curve displays a kink at the point of divine coincidence if we assume that wage decreases -- which reduce workers' morale -- are more costly to producers than price increases -- which upset customers. These three properties describe recent US data well.</description>

      <title>Relying on the Metrics of Evaluated Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online platforms and regulators face a continuing problem of designing effective evaluation metrics. While tools for collecting and processing data continue to progress, this has not addressed the problem of "unknown unknowns", or fundamental informational limitations on part of the evaluator. To guide the choice of metrics in the face of this informational problem, we turn to the evaluated agents themselves, who may have more information about how to measure their own outcomes. We model this interaction as an agency game, where we ask: "When does an agent have an incentive to reveal the observability of a metric to their evaluator?" We show that an agent will prefer to reveal metrics that differentiate the most difficult tasks from the rest, and conceal metrics that differentiate the easiest. We further show that the agent can prefer to reveal a metric "garbled" with noise over both fully concealing and fully revealing. This indicates an economic value to privacy that yields Pareto improvement for both the agent and evaluator. We demonstrate these findings on data from online rideshare platforms.</description>

      <title>FACT or Fiction: Can Truthful Mechanisms Eliminate Federated Free Riding?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard federated learning (FL) approaches are vulnerable to the free-rider dilemma: participating agents can contribute little to nothing yet receive a well-trained aggregated model. While prior mechanisms attempt to solve the free-rider dilemma, none have addressed the issue of truthfulness. In practice, adversarial agents can provide false information to the server in order to cheat its way out of contributing to federated training. In an effort to make free-riding-averse federated mechanisms truthful, and consequently less prone to breaking down in practice, we propose FACT. FACT is the first federated mechanism that: (1) eliminates federated free riding by using a penalty system, (2) ensures agents provide truthful information by creating a competitive environment, and (3) encourages agent participation by offering better performance than training alone. Empirically, FACT avoids free-riding when agents are untruthful, and reduces agent loss by over 4x.</description>
