      <title>A modified DFC method based on full state and periodic gain for stabilization and chaos control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel delayed feedback control based on full state is proposed. The designed scheme combines the difference between two delayed states and a periodic control gain. System stabilization is achieved in any hyperbolic unstable equilibrium point. The procedure to build the control is systematic and, the set of the stabilizing control parameters is rigorously featured by analytical arguments. An ad-hoc strategy based on the proposed scheme is implemented for control of chaos by stabilizing equilibrium points embedded in chaotic attractors. Simulated examples illustrate this strategy performance.</description>

      <title>The structure of periodic point free distal homeomorphisms on the annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an annulus in the plane $\mathbb R^2$ and $g:A\rightarrow A$ be a boundary components preserving homeomorphism which is distal and has no periodic points. Then there is a continuous decomposition of $A$ into $g$-invariant circles such that all the restrictions of $g$ on them share a common irrational rotation number and all these circles are linearly ordered by the inclusion relation on the sets of bounded components of their complements in $\mathbb R^2$.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal cooperative behaviour, psychological effects, and collective decision-making: an exemplification with predator-prey models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bio-social models, cooperative behaviour has evolved as an adaptive strategy, playing multi-functional roles. One of such roles in populations is to increase the success of survival and reproduction of individuals and their families or social groups. Moreover, collective decision-making in cooperative behaviour is an aspect that is used to study the dynamic behaviour of individuals within a social group. In this paper, we have focused on population dynamics by considering a predator-prey model as our main exemplification, where the generalist predator has adopted a cooperative hunting strategy while consuming their prey. In particular, we have analyzed the dynamic nature of the system when a nonlocal term is introduced in the cooperation. First, the Turing instability condition has been studied for the local model around the coexisting steady-state, followed by the Turing and non-Turing patterns in the presence of the nonlocal interaction term. This work is also concerned with the existence of travelling wave solutions for predator-prey interaction with the nonlocal cooperative hunting strategy. Such solutions are reported for local as well as for nonlocal models. We have characterized the invading speed of the predator with the help of the minimal wave speed of travelling wave solutions connecting the predator-free state to the co-existence state. The travelling waves are found to be non-monotonic in this system. The formation of wave trains has been demonstrated for an extended range of nonlocal interactions. Finally, the importance of psychological effects in shaping the dynamics of nonlocal collective behaviour is demonstrated with several representative examples.</description>

      <title>On boundary points of minimal continuously Hutchinson invariant sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear differential operator $T=Q(z)\frac{d}{dz}+P(z)$ with polynomial coefficients defines a continuous family of Hutchinson operators when acting on the space of positive powers of linear forms. In this context, $T$ has a unique minimal Hutchinson-invariant set $M_{CH}^{T}$ in the complex plane. Using a geometric interpretation of its boundary in terms of envelops of certain families of rays, we subdivide this boundary into local and global arcs (the former being portions of integral curves of the rational vector field $\frac{Q(z)}{P(z)}\partial_{z}$), and singular points of different types which we classify below. The latter decomposition of the boundary of $M_{CH}^{T}$ is largely determined by its intersection with the plane algebraic curve formed by the inflection points of trajectories of the field $\frac{Q(z)}{P(z)}\partial_{z}$. We provide an upper bound for the number of local arcs in terms of degrees of $P$ and $Q$. As an application of our classification, we obtain a number of global geometric properties of minimal Hutchinson-invariant sets.</description>

      <title>Multistability of Small Zero-One Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-one reaction networks play key roles in cell signaling such as signalling pathways regulated by protein phosphorylation. Multistability of zero-one networks is a key dynamics feature enabling decision-making in cells. Since multistability (or, nondegenerate multistationarity) can be lifted from a smaller subnetwork (low-dimensional networks with less species and fewer reactions) to large networks, we aim to explore the multistability problem of small zero-one networks. We prove that any zero-one network with a one-dimensional stoichiometric subspace admits at most one (stable) positive steady state (this steady state is also called a structural attractor), and we completely classify all the one-dimensional zero-one networks according to if they indeed admits a (stable) positive steady state or not. Also, we prove that any two-dimensional zero-one network with up to three species either admits only degenerate positive steady states, or admits at most one (stable) positive steady state. In these proofs, we apply the theorem based on the Brouwer degree theory and the theory of real algebraic geometry. Moreover, using the tools of computational algebraic geometry, we provide a systematical way for detecting the smallest zero-one networks that admit nondegenerate multistationarity/multistability. We show that the smallest zero-one networks that admit nondegenerate multistationarity contain three species and five reactions, and the smallest zero-one networks that admit multistability contain three species and six reactions.</description>

      <title>Exact quadratic growth for the derivatives of iterates of interval diffeomorphisms with only parabolic fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider $C^2$ diffeomorphisms of a closed interval with only parabolic fixed points. We show that the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates of such a diffeomorphism is exactly quadratic provided it has a non quadratically tangency to the identity at a fixed point that is topologically repelling on one side. Moreover, in absence of such fixed points, the maximal growth of the derivatives of the iterates is subquadratic.</description>

Abstract: A brief introduction of the technical approach to model FTUs as an aggregate of cells, whose state transition dynamics are mathematically represented as port-hamiltonians or Differential Algebraic equations is presented. A python library and browser based tool to enable modellers to compose the FTU graph, specify the cellular equations and the interconnection between the cells at the level of physical quantities they exchange consistent with the technical approach is discussed.</description>

      <title>Explain the Black Box for the Sake of Science: Revisiting the Scientific Method in the Era of Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scientific method is the cornerstone of human progress across all branches of the natural and applied sciences, from understanding the human body to explaining how the universe works. The scientific method is based on identifying systematic rules or principles that describe the phenomenon of interest in a reproducible way that can be validated through experimental evidence. In the era of artificial intelligence (AI), there are discussions on how AI systems may discover new knowledge. We argue that, before the advent of artificial general intelligence, human complex reasoning for scientific discovery remains of vital importance. Yet, AI can be leveraged for scientific discovery via explainable AI. More specifically, knowing what data AI systems used to make decisions can be a point of contact with domain experts and scientists, that can lead to divergent or convergent views on a given scientific problem. Divergent views may spark further scientific investigations leading to new scientific knowledge. Convergent views may instead reassure that the AI system is operating within bounds deemed reasonable to humans. The latter point addresses the trustworthiness requirement that is indispensable for critical applications in the applied sciences, such as medicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate parametric resonance in oscillator networks subjected to periodically time-varying oscillations in the edge strengths. Such models are inspired by the well-known parametric resonance phenomena for single oscillators, as well as the potential rich phenomenology when such parametric excitations are present in a variety of applications like deep brain stimulation, AC power transmission networks, as well as vehicular flocking formations. We consider cases where a single edge, a subgraph, or the entire network is subjected to forcing, and in each case, we characterize an interesting interplay between the parametric resonance modes and the eigenvalues/vectors of the graph Laplacian. Our analysis is based on a novel treatment of multiple-scale perturbation analysis that we develop for the underlying high-dimensional dynamic equations.</description>

      <title>An Internal Model Principle For Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When designing a robot's internal system, one often makes assumptions about the structure of the intended environment of the robot. One may even assign meaning to various internal components of the robot in terms of expected environmental correlates. In this paper we want to make the distinction between robot's internal and external worlds clear-cut. Can the robot learn about its environment, relying only on internally available information, including the sensor data? Are there mathematical conditions on the internal robot system which can be internally verified and make the robot's internal system mirror the structure of the environment? We prove that sufficiency is such a mathematical principle, and mathematically describe the emergence of the robot's internal structure isomorphic or bisimulation equivalent to that of the environment. A connection to the free-energy principle is established, when sufficiency is interpreted as a limit case of surprise minimization. As such, we show that surprise minimization leads to having an internal model isomorphic to the environment. This also parallels the Good Regulator Principle which states that controlling a system sufficiently well means having a model of it. Unlike the mentioned theories, ours is discrete, and non-probabilistic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that two automorphisms of an affine surface with dynamical degree strictly larger than 1 share a Zariski dense set of periodic points if and only if they have the same periodic points. We construct canonical heights for these automorphisms and use arithmetic equidistribution for adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties following the work of Yuan and Zhang. Finally, we extend the local arithmetic Hodge index theorem to a certain class of vertical adelic line bundles over quasiprojective varieties to conclude the proof.</description>

      <title>Score-fPINN: Fractional Score-Based Physics-Informed Neural Networks for High-Dimensional Fokker-Planck-Levy Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an innovative approach for solving high-dimensional Fokker-Planck-L\'evy (FPL) equations in modeling non-Brownian processes across disciplines such as physics, finance, and ecology. We utilize a fractional score function and Physical-informed neural networks (PINN) to lift the curse of dimensionality (CoD) and alleviate numerical overflow from exponentially decaying solutions with dimensions. The introduction of a fractional score function allows us to transform the FPL equation into a second-order partial differential equation without fractional Laplacian and thus can be readily solved with standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). We propose two methods to obtain a fractional score function: fractional score matching (FSM) and score-fPINN for fitting the fractional score function. While FSM is more cost-effective, it relies on known conditional distributions. On the other hand, score-fPINN is independent of specific stochastic differential equations (SDEs) but requires evaluating the PINN model's derivatives, which may be more costly. We conduct our experiments on various SDEs and demonstrate numerical stability and effectiveness of our method in dealing with high-dimensional problems, marking a significant advancement in addressing the CoD in FPL equations.</description>

Abstract: In order to investigate the emergence of periodic oscillations of rimming flows, we study analytically the stability of steady states for the model of (Benilov, Kopteva, O'Brien, 2005), which describes the dynamics of a thin fluid film coating the inner wall of a rotating cylinder and includes effects of surface tension, gravity, and hydrostatic pressure. We apply multi-parameter perturbation methods to eigenvalues of Fr\'echet derivatives and prove the transition of a pair of conjugate eigenvalues from the stable to the unstable complex half-plane under appropriate variations of parameters. In order to prove rigorously the corresponding branching of periodic solutions from critical equilibria, we extend the multi-parameter Hopf-bifurcation theory to the case of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Curse of Dimensionality in Fractional and Tempered Fractional PDEs with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional and tempered fractional partial differential equations (PDEs) are effective models of long-range interactions, anomalous diffusion, and non-local effects. Traditional numerical methods for these problems are mesh-based, thus struggling with the curse of dimensionality (CoD). Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) offer a promising solution due to their universal approximation, generalization ability, and mesh-free training. In principle, Monte Carlo fractional PINN (MC-fPINN) estimates fractional derivatives using Monte Carlo methods and thus could lift CoD. However, this may cause significant variance and errors, hence affecting convergence; in addition, MC-fPINN is sensitive to hyperparameters. In general, numerical methods and specifically PINNs for tempered fractional PDEs are under-developed. Herein, we extend MC-fPINN to tempered fractional PDEs to address these issues, resulting in the Monte Carlo tempered fractional PINN (MC-tfPINN). To reduce possible high variance and errors from Monte Carlo sampling, we replace the one-dimensional (1D) Monte Carlo with 1D Gaussian quadrature, applicable to both MC-fPINN and MC-tfPINN. We validate our methods on various forward and inverse problems of fractional and tempered fractional PDEs, scaling up to 100,000 dimensions. Our improved MC-fPINN/MC-tfPINN using quadrature consistently outperforms the original versions in accuracy and convergence speed in very high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Separating measurable recurrence from strong recurrence via rigidity sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:1808.05609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $G$ is an abelian group, we say $S\subset G$ is a set of recurrence if for every probability measure preserving $G$-system $(X,\mu,T)$ and every $D\subset X$ having $\mu(D)&gt;0$, there is a $g\in S$ such that $\mu(D\cap T^{g}D)&gt;0$. We say $S$ is a set of strong recurrence if for every set $D$ having $\mu(D)&gt;0$ there is a $c&gt;0$ such that $\mu(D\cap T^{g}D)&gt;c$ for infinitely many $g\in S$. We call $S$ measure expanding if for all $g\in G$, the translate $S+g$ is a set of recurrence. A rigidity sequence for $(X,\mu,T)$ is a sequence of elements $s_n\in G$ satisfying $\lim_{n\to\infty} \mu(D\triangle T^{s_n}D)=0$ for all measurable $D\subset X$.
  For all but countably many countable abelian groups $G$, we prove that if $S$ is measure expanding, there is a sequence of elements $s_n\in S$ such that $\{s_n:n\in \mathbb N\}$ is also measure expanding and every translate of $(s_n)$ is a rigidity sequence for some free weak mixing measure preserving $G$-system. The special case where $S=G$ proves a conjecture of Ackelsberg.
  As a consequence, we prove that for every countably infinite abelian group $G$ and every measure expanding set $S\subset G$ there is a subset $S'\subset S$ such that $S'$ is measure expanding and no translate of $S'$ is a set of strong recurrence.</description>

Abstract: We investigate roaming in the photodissociation of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), providing insight into the contrasting roaming dynamics observed for this molecule compared to formaldehyde. We carry out trajectory studies for full-dimensional acetaldehyde, supplemented with an analysis of a two degree-of-freedom restricted model and obtain evidence for two distinct roaming pathways. Trajectories exhibit roaming at both shorter (9-11.5 au) and larger (14.5-22.9 au) maximum CH$_3$-HCO separations, characterized by differing amounts of HCO rotation. No roaming trajectories were found in the intervening gap region. The roaming dynamics near 14.5-22.9 au are well-reproduced by the restricted model and involve passage through a centrifugal barrier, analogous to formaldehyde roaming. However, the shorter-range 9-11.5 au roaming appears unique to acetaldehyde, and is likely facilitated by repulsive interactions absent in the simplified models. Phase space analysis reveals that this additional roaming pathway is inaccessible in the reduced dimensionality system. The findings suggest acetaldehyde's increased propensity for roaming compared to formaldehyde may arise from the presence of multiple distinct roaming mechanisms rather than solely the higher roaming fragment mass.</description>

      <title>On positive Lyapunov exponents along $E^{cu}$ and non-uniformly expanding for partially hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider $C^{1}$ diffeomorphisms on compact Riemannian manifolds of any dimension that admit a dominated splitting $E^{cs} \oplus E^{cu}.$ We prove that if the Lyapunov exponents along $E^{cu}$ are positive for Lebesgue almost every point, then a map $f$ is non-uniformly expanding along $E^{cu}$ under the assumption that the cocycle $Df_{|E^{cu}(f)}^{-1}$ has a dominated splitting with index 1 on the support of an ergodic Lyapunov maximizing observable measure. As a result, there exists a physical SRB measure for a $C^{1+\alpha}$ diffeomorphism map $f$ that admits a dominated splitting $E^{s} \oplus E^{cu}$ under assumptions that $f$ has non-zero Lyapunov exponents for Lebesgue almost every point and that the cocycle $Df_{|E^{cu}(f)}^{-1}$ has a dominated splitting with index 1 on the support of an ergodic Lyapunov maximizing observable measure.</description>

      <title>Conditions implying annular chaos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates topological chaos for homeomorphisms of the open annulus, introducing a new set of sufficient conditions based on points with distinct rotation numbers and their topological relation to invariant continua. These conditions allow us to formulate classic methods for verifying annular chaos in a finitely verifiable version supported on basic properties of the map. The results pave the way for simple computer-assisted proofs of chaos in a wide range of annular maps, including many well known examples, and we present these proofs for some analytic families, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. On the theoretical side, one of the consequences of the established conditions permits the proof of a folkloric conjecture about the relation between topological entropy and rotation sets.</description>

      <title>On the algorithmic descriptive complexity of attractors in topological dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the computational problem of rigorously describing the asymptotic behaviour of topological dynamical systems up to a finite but arbitrarily small pre-specified error. More precisely, we consider the limit set of a typical orbit, both as a spatial object (attractor set) and as a statistical distribution (physical measure), and prove upper bounds on the computational resources of computing descriptions of these objects with arbitrary accuracy. We also study how these bounds are affected by different dynamical constrains and provide several examples showing that our bounds are sharp in general. In particular, we exhibit a computable interval map having a unique transitive attractor with Cantor set structure supporting a unique physical measure such that both the attractor and the measure are non computable.</description>

Abstract: A question of F. Kwakkel and V. Markovic on existence of C^1-diffeomorphisms of closed surfaces that permute a dense collection of domains with bounded geometry is answered in the negative. In fact, it is proved that for closed surfaces of genus at least one such diffeomorphisms do not exist regardless of whether they have positive or zero topological entropy.</description>

Abstract: We obtain large deviations for a class of dependent random variables in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law, $\alpha\in (0, 1)\cup (1, 2]$.

      <title>The analysis of the impact of fear in the presence of additional food and prey refuge with nonlocal predator-prey models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a predator-prey interaction, many factors are present that affect the growth of the species, either positively or negatively. Fear of predation is such a factor that causes psychological stress in a prey species, so their overall growth starts to decline. In this work, a predator-prey model is proposed where the prey species faces a reduction in their growth out of fear, and the predator is also provided with an alternative food source that helps the prey to hide in a safer place. The dynamics produce a wide range of interesting results, including the significance of the presence of a certain amount of fear or even prey refuge for population coexistence. The analysis is extended later to the nonlocal model to analyze how the non-equilibrium phenomena influence the dynamical behaviour. It is observed through numerical simulations that the scope of pattern formation reduces with the increase of fear level in the spatio-temporal model, whereas the incorporation of nonlocal interaction further increases the chance of species colonization.</description>

      <title>Non-archimedean topological monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a topological monoid $S$ is left non-archimedean (in short: l-NA) if the left action of $S$ on itself admits a proper $S$-compactification $\nu \colon S \hookrightarrow Y$ such that $Y$ is a Stone space. This provides a natural generalization of the well known concept of NA topological groups. The Stone and Pontryagin dualities play major role in achieving useful characterizations of NA monoids. We discuss universal NA monoids and show that many naturally defined topological monoids are NA. We show that many naturally defined topological monoids are NA and present universal NA monoids. Among others, we prove that the Polish monoid $C(2^{\omega},2^{\omega})$ is a universal separable metrizable l-NA monoid and the Polish monoid ${\mathbb N}^{\mathbb N}$ is universal for separable metrizable r-NA monoids.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamical social and political prediction algorithm for city planning and public participation using the Impulse Pattern Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear-dynamical algorithm for city planning is proposed as an Impulse Pattern Formulation (IPF) for predicting relevant parameters like health, artistic freedom, or financial developments of different social or political stakeholders over the cause of a planning process. The IPF has already shown high predictive precision at low computational cost in musical instrument simulations, brain dynamics, and human-human interactions. The social and political IPF consists of three basic equations of system state developments, self-adaptation of stakeholders, two adaptive interactions, and external impact terms suitable for respective planning situations. Typical scenarios of stakeholder interactions and developments are modeled by adjusting a set of system parameters. These include stakeholder reaction to external input, enhanced system stability through self-adaptation, stakeholder convergence due to adaptive interaction, as well as complex dynamics in terms of fixed stakeholder impacts. A workflow for implementing the algorithm in real city planning scenarios is outlined. This workflow includes machine learning of a suitable set of parameters suggesting best-practice planning to aim at the desired development of the planning process and its output.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A geometric study is given for the 4-dimensional Garnier system. By the resolution of indeterminacy, the group of its B\"aklund transformations is lifted to a group of pseudo-isomorphisms between rational varieties obtained from ${\mathbb P}^2 \times {\mathbb P}^2$ by 10 or 21 blow-ups. The root basis is discussed in the N\'eron-Severi bilattices for the space with 10 blow-ups.</description>

      <title>On Rational Recursion for Holonomic Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently conjectured that every component of a discrete-time rational dynamical system is a solution to an algebraic difference equation that is linear in its highest-shift term (a quasi-linear equation). We prove that the conjecture holds in the special case of holonomic sequences, which can straightforwardly be represented by rational dynamical systems. We propose two algorithms for converting holonomic recurrence equations into such quasi-linear equations. The two algorithms differ in their efficiency and the minimality of orders in their outputs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the set of cubic Hamiltonian vector fields for which their associated Kahan-Hirota-Kimura maps preserve the original Hamiltonian function. We analyze these fields in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^4$. We also study a family of fields in $\mathbb{R}^6$. Additionally, we explore several properties like the existence of additional first integrals of specific type, the possibility that the initial Hamiltonian vector field is a Lie symmetry of the corresponding map, or the symplecticity of the considered maps.</description>
