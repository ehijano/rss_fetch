      <title>Symplectic cuts and open/closed strings II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In arXiv:2306.07329 we established a connection between symplectic cuts of Calabi-Yau threefolds and open topological strings, and used this to introduce an equivariant deformation of the disk potential of toric branes. In this paper we establish a connection to higher-dimensional Calabi-Yau geometries by showing that the equivariant disk potential arises as an equivariant period of certain Calabi-Yau fourfolds and fivefolds, which encode moduli spaces of one and two symplectic cuts (the maximal case) by a construction of Braverman arXiv:alg-geom/9712024. Extended Picard-Fuchs equations for toric branes, capturing dependence on both open and closed string moduli, are derived from a suitable limit of the equivariant quantum cohomology rings of the higher Calabi-Yau geometries.</description>

      <title>Spinning fields on S$^d$ and dS$_d$, UIRs and Ladder operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct, for spin $0,1,2$ tensor fields on S$^d$, a set of ladder operators that connect the distinct UIRs of SO$(d+1)$. This is achieved by relying on the conformal Killing vectors of S$^d$. For the case of spinning fields, the ladder operators generalize previous expressions with a compensating transformation necessary to preserve the transversality condition. We then extend the results to the Exceptional/Discrete UIRs of SO$(d,1)$, again relying on the conformal Killing vectors of de Sitter space. Our construction recovers the conventional conformal primary transformations for the scalar fields when the mass term leads to conformal coupling. A similar approach for the spin-2 field leads to the conformal-like operators found recently.</description>

      <title>The Moduli Space Curvature and the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unveil a remarkable interplay between rigid field theories (RFTs), charge-to-mass ratios $\gamma$ and scalar curvature divergences $\mathsf{R}_{\rm div}$ in the vector multiplet moduli space of 4d ${\cal N}=2$ supergravities, obtained upon compactifying type II string theory on Calabi--Yau threefolds. We show that the condition to obtain an RFT that decouples from gravity implies a divergence in the $\gamma$ of (would-be) BPS particles charged under the rigid theory, and vice-versa. For weak coupling limits, where the scalar curvature diverges, we argue that such BPS particles exist and that $\mathsf{R}_{\rm div} \lesssim \gamma^2$, implying that all these divergences are a consequence of RFT limits. More precisely, along geodesics we find that $\mathsf{R}_{\rm div} \sim (\Lambda_{\rm wgc}/\Lambda_g)^2$, where $\Lambda_{\rm wgc} \equiv g_{\rm rigid} M_{\rm Pl}$ is the RFT cut-off estimate of the Weak Gravity Conjecture and $\Lambda_g = g_{\rm rigid}^{-2} \Lambda_{\rm RFT}$ the electrostatic energy integrated up to its actual cut-off $\Lambda_{\rm RFT}$.</description>

      <title>Framing fermionic Wilson loops in ABJ(M)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Framing plays a central role in the evaluation of Wilson loops in theories with Chern-Simons actions. In pure Chern-Simons theory, it guarantees topological invariance, while in theories with matter like ABJ(M), our theory of interest, it is essential to enforce the cohomological equivalence of different BPS Wilson loops. This is the case for the 1/6 BPS bosonic and the 1/2 BPS fermionic Wilson loops, which have the same expectation value when computed as matrix model averages from localization. This equivalence holds at framing $\mathfrak{f}=1$, which has so far been a challenge to implement in perturbative evaluations. In this paper, we compute the expectation value of the 1/2 BPS fermionic circle of ABJ(M) theory up to two loops in perturbation theory at generic framing. This is achieved by a careful analysis of fermionic Feynman diagrams, isolating their framing dependent contributions and evaluating them in point-splitting regularization using framed contours. Specializing our result to $\mathfrak{f}=1$ we recover exactly the matrix model prediction, thus realizing for the first time a direct perturbative check of localization for this operator. We also generalize our computation to the case of a multiply wound circle, again matching the corresponding matrix model prediction.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity: Infrared causality and detectability of GW observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate time delays of gravitational wave and scalar wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet effective field theories of gravity. By requiring infrared causality, we impose a lower bound on the cutoff scale of the theories. With this bound, we further discuss the detectability of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Comparing with the gravitational effective field theories that only contain the two tensor modes, adding a scalar degree of freedom opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <title>Relational Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common feature of the extended phase space of gauge theory, the crossed product of quantum theory, and quantum reference frames (QRFs) is the adjoining of degrees of freedom followed by a constraining procedure for the resulting total system. Building on previous work, we identify non-commutative or quantum geometry as a mathematical framework which unifies these three objects. We first provide a rigorous account of the extended phase space, and demonstrate that it can be regarded as a classical principal bundle with a Poisson manifold base. We then show that the crossed product is a trivial quantum principal bundle which both substantiates a conjecture on the quantization of the extended phase space and facilitates a relational interpretation. Combining several crossed products with possibly distinct structure groups into a single object, we arrive at a novel definition of a quantum orbifold. We demonstrate that change of frame maps within the quantum orbifold correspond to quantum gauge transformations, which are QRF preserving maps between crossed product algebras. Finally, we conclude that the quantum orbifold is equivalent to the G-framed algebra proposed in prior work, thereby placing systems containing multiple QRFs squarely in the context of quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory and its Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and solve the $\text{U(1)}$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, with an emphasis on the chirality of the theory. Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Nonextensive Black Hole Thermodynamics from Generalized Euclidean Path Integral and Wick's Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the Euclidean path integral formalism to account for nonextensive statistical mechanics. Concretely, we introduce a generalized Wick's rotation from real time $t$ to imaginary time $\tau$ such that, $t\rightarrow-i f_\alpha(\tau)$, where $f_\alpha$ a differentiable function and $\alpha$ is a parameter related to nonextensivity. The standard extensive formalism is recovered in the limit $\alpha\rightarrow0$ and $f_0(\tau)=\tau$. Furthermore, we apply this generalized Euclidean path integral to black hole thermodynamics and derive the generalized Wick's rotations given the nonextensive statistics. The proposed formulation enables the treatment of nonextensive statistics on the same footing as extensive Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics. Moreover, we define a universal measure, $\eta$, for the nonextensivity character of statistics. Lastly, based on the present formalism, we strengthen the equivalence between the AdS-Schwarzschild black hole in Gibbs-Boltzmann statistics and the flat-Schwarzschild black hole within R\'enyi statistics and suggest a potential reformulation of the $AdS_5$/$CFT_4$ duality.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Axio-dilaton Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories it is the two-derivative sigma-model interactions that like to compete at low energies with the two-derivative interactions of General Relativity (GR) $\unicode{x2014}$ at least once the dangerous zero-derivative terms of the scalar potential are suppressed (such as by a shift symmetry). But nontrivial two-derivative interactions require at least two scalars to exist and so never arise in the single-scalar models most commonly explored. Axio-dilaton models provide a well-motivated minimal class of models for which these self-interactions can be explored. We review this class of models and investigate whether these minimal two fields can suffice to describe both Dark Matter and Dark Energy. We find that they can $\unicode{x2014}$ the axion is the Dark Matter and the dilaton is the Dark Energy $\unicode{x2014}$ and that they robustly predict several new phenomena for the CMB and structure formation that can be sought in observations. These include specific types of Dark Energy evolution and small space- and time-dependent changes to particle masses post-recombination that alter the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, cause small changes to structure growth and more.</description>

      <title>Strings and membranes from $\mathcal{A}$-theory five brane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\mathcal{A}$-theory takes U-duality symmetry as a guiding principle, with the SL(5) U-duality symmetry being described as the world-volume theory of a 5-brane. Furthermore, by unifying the 6-dimensional world-volume Lorentz symmetry with the SL(5) spacetime symmetry, it extends to SL(6) U-duality symmetry. The SL(5) spacetime vielbein fields and the 5-brane world-volume vielbein fields are mixed under the SL(6) U-duality transformation. We demonstrate that consistent sectionings of the SL(6) $\mathcal{A}$5-brane world-volume Lagrangian yield Lagrangians of the $\mathcal{T}$-string with O(D,D) T-duality symmetry, the conventional string, the ${\cal M}$5-brane with GL(4) duality symmetry, and the non-perturbative M2-brane in supergravity theory. The GL(4) covariant Lagrangian of the ${\cal M}$5-brane derived in this manner is a new, perturbatively quantizable theory.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in the framework of parity-even metric-affine gravity, we investigate the particle spectrum of a deformed theory in the large-$N$ limit. In a simple Higgs inflation model in metric-affine gravity, it is known that its UV cutoff is much smaller than the Planck scale. While it calls for UV completion, a concrete example has not yet been found, even with the large-$N$ limit known as a successful technique to complete an original Higgs inflation defined on the Riemannian geometry. This motivates us to study how small deformation of the simple Higgs inflation affects the emergence and properties of dynamical fields particularly in the large-$N$ limit. As a UV theory has to be free of ghosts or tachyons at least around Minkowski space, we perform the parameter search and find the healthy parameter region where a new heavy particle can propagate without these pathologies.</description>

      <title>Calabi-Yau metrics through Grassmannian learning and Donaldson's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in the problem of numerical K\"ahler metrics, we survey machine learning techniques in this area, discussing both advantages and drawbacks. We then revisit the algebraic ansatz pioneered by Donaldson. Inspired by his work, we present a novel approach to obtaining Ricci-flat approximations to K\"ahler metrics, applying machine learning within a `principled' framework. In particular, we use gradient descent on the Grassmannian manifold to identify an efficient subspace of sections for calculation of the metric. We combine this approach with both Donaldson's algorithm and learning on the $h$-matrix itself (the latter method being equivalent to gradient descent on the fibre bundle of Hermitian metrics on the tautological bundle over the Grassmannian). We implement our methods on the Dwork family of threefolds, commenting on the behaviour at different points in moduli space. In particular, we observe the emergence of nontrivial local minima as the moduli parameter is increased.</description>

      <title>Pure geometric $f(R)$ branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate pure geometric $f(R)$ cosmology branes embedded in five-dimensional spacetime. The form of $f(R)$ is chosen as a polynomial. The Five-dimensional scalar curvature $R$ is assumed to be constant. Based on the value of the four-dimensional cosmological constant $\lambda_4$, the branes can be classified into Minkowski, de Sitter, and de anti-de Sitter cases. Solutions for each case can be calculated. These solutions are stable against linear tensor perturbations in all cases. In the Minkowski brane case, the zero mode of gravity can be localized on the brane. In the de Sitter brane case, the zero mode and one massive Kaluza-Klein mode can be localized on the brane. In the anti-de Sitter brane case, all massive Kaluza-Klein modes can be localized on the brane. The results of the analysis of tensor fluctuations are the same in both the Einstein frame and the Jordan frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the strong-field limit of a theory involving a quantum scalar field coupled to a vector background, which can be either an electromagnetic field or a non-gauge field coupled through the first derivative term. Our approach consists in obtaining resummed expressions for the associated heat kernels, from which we derive the corresponding resummed effective actions. These results allow us to discuss the effect of pair creation. Finally, we conjecture that resummations for more general theories should be possible.</description>

      <title>Landau-based Schubert analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the conjectural method called Schubert analysis for generating the alphabet of symbol letters for Feynman integrals, which was based on geometries of intersecting lines associated with corresponding cut diagrams. We explain the effectiveness of this somewhat mysterious method by relating such geometries to the corresponding Landau singularities, which also amounts to ``uplifting" Landau singularities of a Feynman integral to its symbol letters. We illustrate this {\it Landau-based Schubert analysis} using various multi-loop Feynman integrals in four dimensions and present an automated {\ttfamily Mathematica} notebook for it. We then apply the method to a simplified problem of studying alphabets of physical quantities such as scattering amplitudes and form factors in planar ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills. By focusing on a small set of Landau diagrams (as opposed to all relevant Feynman integrals), we show how this method nicely produces the two-loop alphabet of $n$-point MHV amplitudes and that of the $n=4$ MHV form factors.

      <title>Positivity properties of five-point two-loop Wilson loops with Lagrangian insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the geometric integrand expansion of the five-point Wilson loop with one Lagrangian insertion in maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We construct the integrand corresponding to an all-loop class of ladder-type geometries. We then investigate the known two-loop observable from this geometric viewpoint. To do so, we evaluate analytically the new two-loop integrals corresponding to the negative geometry contribution, using the canonical differential equations method. Inspecting the analytic result, we present numerical evidence that in this decomposition, each piece has uniform sign properties, when evaluated in the Amplituhedron region. Finally, we present an alternative bootstrap approach for the ladder-type geometries. We find that certain minimal bootstrap assumptions can be satisfied at two loops, but lead to a contradiction at three loops. This suggests to us that novel alphabet letters are required at this loop order. Indeed studying planar three-loop Feynman integrals, we do identify novel pentagon alphabet letters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to Holographic Strange Metal at Low Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The holographic approach to the strange metal phase relies on near-extremal asymptotically AdS$_4$ electrically charged black branes with important input from their AdS$_2$ near-horizon throat geometry. Motivated by the current understanding of the role of quantum fluctuations in the throat of near-extremal black holes, we revisit some transport properties. We model quantum gravitational and gauge fluctuations in the throat region by adopting results in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, effectively leading to quantum corrections for the dual CFT$_1$ Green's function in the near-horizon infrared region. We use the quantum-corrected Green's function to compute the conductivity for (2+1)-dimensional holographic strange metals and obtain corrections for the DC resistivity and the optical conductivity. We also compare the quantum-corrected holographic approach with results from the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and point out qualitative differences. Although experimental detection for the quantum-corrected holographic approach to the DC resistivity requires higher precision than current experimental accuracy, future experiments with improved technologies could detect these quantum corrections. Interestingly, including quantum corrections to the optical conductivity does provide a plausible explanation for the experimental anomalous power-law behavior detected in various strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The loop-Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(L)}_{n}$ is a semialgebraic set in the product of Grassmannians $\mathrm{Gr}_{\mathbb{R}}(2,4)^L$. Recently, many aspects of this geometry for the case of $L=1$ have been elucidated, such as its algebraic and face stratification, the residual arrangement and the existence and uniqueness of the adjoint. This paper extends this analysis to the simplest higher loop case given by the two-loop four-point Amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}^{(2)}_4$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a reducible ${\cal N}=4$, $d=1$ multiplet described by a real superfield as a coupling of the mirror ${\bf (1, 4, 3)}$ and ordinary ${\bf (3, 4, 1)}$ multiplets. Employing this so-called "long multiplet", we construct a coupled system of dynamical and semi-dynamical multiplets. We show that the corresponding {\it on-shell} model reproduces the model of Fedoruk, Ivanov and Lechtenfeld presented in 2012. Furthermore, there is a hidden supersymmetry acting on the long multiplet that extends the full world-line supersymmetry to SU(2$|$2). In other words, the ${\cal N}=4$ long multiplet can be derived from an irreducible SU(2$|$2) multiplet.</description>

      <title>Strings as Hyper-Fractons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</description>

      <title>Ginzburg-Landau description of a class of non-unitary minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that the Ginzburg-Landau description of the non-unitary conformal minimal model $M(3,8)$ is provided by the Euclidean theory of two real scalar fields with third-order interactions that have imaginary coefficients. The same lagrangian describes the non-unitary model $M(3,10)$, which is a product of two Yang-Lee theories $M(2,5)$, and the Renormalization Group flow from it to $M(3,8)$. This proposal has recently passed an important consistency check, due to T. Tanaka and Y. Nakayama, based on the anomaly matching for non-invertible topological lines. In this paper, we elaborate the earlier proposal and argue that the two-field theory describes the $D$ series modular invariants of both $M(3,8)$ and $M(3,10)$. We further propose the Ginzburg-Landau descriptions of the entire class of $D$ series minimal models $M(q, 3q-1)$ and $M(q, 3q+1)$, with odd integer $q$. They involve $PT$ symmetric theories of two scalar fields with interactions of order $q$ multiplied by imaginary coupling constants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two dimensional conformal field theories with the extended $\mathcal{W}_3$ symmetry algebra have an infinite number of mutually commuting conserved charges, which are referred to as the quantum Boussinesq charges. In this work we construct local operators whose zero modes are precisely these conserved charges. For this purpose we study the higher spin conformal field theory on the torus and compute thermal correlators involving the stress tensor and the spin-3 current in a higher spin module of the W3 algebra. In addition we independently obtain the excited state eigenvalues of the quantum Boussinesq charges within the higher spin module via the ODE/IM correspondence. A judicious combination of these data allows us to derive the local operators, whose integrals are the conserved charges of the integrable hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Implications of Tarski's Undefinability Theorem on the Theory of Everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Theory of Everything ($S_{\text{ToE}}$) seeks to unify all fundamental forces of nature, including quantum gravity, into a single theoretical framework. This theory would be defined internally using a set of axioms, and this paper proposes a set of axioms for any such theory. Furthermore, for such a theory, all scientific truth would be defined internally as consequences derivable from the rules of such a theory. This paper then examines the implications of Tarski's undefinability theorem on scientific truths derived from such axioms. We demonstrate that Tarski's theorem imposes limitations on any such formal system $S_{\text{ToE}}$. However, we also argue that the Lucas-Penrose argument suggests that non-algorithmic understanding can transcend these formal limitations.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that all static Love number couplings of operators involving only parity-even fields vanish to all orders, a conclusion that holds even for non-axisymmetric configurations. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Multi-Metric Gravity II: Hairy Solutions and Linear Stability of the Non- and Partially Proportional Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10976v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Owing to our work in part I of this series of papers, it is understood that the analytically known black hole solutions in the theory of ghost free multi-metric gravity can be split into three distinct classes, and that one of these classes - the proportional branch - exhibits the Gregory-Laflamme instability at linear level in the metric perturbations, whenever the black hole horizon size is smaller than (roughly) the Compton wavelength of the theory's lightest massive graviton. In this first of two sequels, we determine the linear stability of the two remaining classes of black hole solutions - the non-proportional and partially proportional branches - and discuss how our results likely differ at nonlinear level. We also give a general prescription to construct multi-metric solutions describing black holes endowed with massive graviton hair, which may constitute the end state of the instability in the proportional branch. We utilise a tractable example model involving 3 metrics to see how this works in practice, and determine the asymptotic form of its corresponding hairy solutions at infinity, where one can clearly see the individual contributions from each of the graviton mass modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze all possible symmetry reductions of Lagrangians that yield fully equivalent field equations for any 4-dimensional metric theory of gravity. Specifically, we present a complete list of infinitesimal group actions obeying the principle of symmetric criticality, identify the corresponding invariant metrics (and $l$-chains), discuss relations among them, and analyze simplifications allowed by the residual diffeomorphism group and Noether identities before and after variation of the reduced Lagrangian. We employ rigorous treatment of the symmetry reduction by Fels and Torre and use the Hicks classification of infinitesimal group actions by means of Lie algebras pairs of isometries and their isotropy subalgebras. The classification is recast in the coordinates in which the well-known symmetries and geometries are easily recognizable and relatable to each other. The paper is accompanied by a code for the symmetry reduction of Lagrangians that we developed in \texttt{xAct} package of \textsc{Mathematica}.</description>

      <title>Symmetries from outer automorphisms and unorthodox group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetries play an essential role in the construction and phenomenology of quantum field theories (QFTs). We discuss how to construct symmetries of QFTs by extending minimal "seed" symmetry groups to larger groups that contain the seed(s) as subgroup(s). On the one hand, there are so-called "normal" extensions, which are given by outer automorphisms of the original symmetry group (including the trivial one) and contain the seed as a normal subgroup. On the other hand, there can be "unorthodox extensions" which do not have this property. We demonstrate our logic on the most general scalar potentials of the two- and three-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM and 3HDM). For the 2HDM, we show that all symmetry groups, including the different possible classes of CP and continuous symmetry groups, can be obtained from extensions of the smallest possible symmetry CP1 by consecutive outer automorphisms. Scanning over normal and unorthodox group extensions might be the easiest way to "machine learn" the possible symmetries of a QFT. However, many of the groups constructible in this way may not be realizable in a concrete model, in the sense that they lead to additional accidental symmetries. Hence, we also comment on a different, "top-down" way to obtain the possible realizable symmetry groups of a QFT based on the covariant transformation of couplings under the most general basis changes.</description>

      <title>Thermogeometric Optimization of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a natural finite-time geometric optimization method designed to analyze thermal fluctuations in black holes. Our approach leverages geodesics in the macro state space to pinpoint optimal processes within thermal systems. We propose a straightforward algorithm for developing these optimal protocols by applying the concept of thermodynamic length to determine the shortest paths between states in the relevant thermodynamic framework. Importantly, since thermodynamic metrics do not need to be positive definite, our method requires only maintaining a positive thermodynamic length through the inclusion of a simple scale factor in the metric. We demonstrate that the thermodynamic length can be positive by appropriately selecting the sign of this scale, which in turn is sensitive to the location of Davies phase transition curves. This addresses a significant gap in Hessian thermodynamic geometry. Furthermore, we can tie this scale to the sign of the thermodynamic curvature and thus to the type of the information geometry allowing the existence of the optimal processes. Finally, we show that the optimal fluctuations can ultimately lead to the complete evaporation of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes over time, yielding realistic estimates for their lifespans in comparison to evaporation via Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Rotating Quantum-Corrected Black Holes: Insights and Constraints from EHT Observations of M87* and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational lensing in the strong-field limit using the rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) with an additional parameter $\alpha$ besides mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$. We discover a decrease in the deflection angle $\alpha_D$, the photon sphere radius $x_{ps}$, and the angular position $\theta_{\infty}$. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent images, $r_{mag}$, decreases rapidly as $\alpha$ increases. We compare RQCBH observables with those of Kerr black holes, using Sgr A* and M87* as lenses to observe the effect of the quantum-corrected parameter $\alpha$. For Sgr A*, the angular position $\theta_\infty$ in $\in~(14.8-26.3)~\mu as$, while for M87* $\in~(11.12-19.78)~\mu as$. The angular separation $s$, for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) SgrA* and M87*, differs significantly, with values ranging $\in~(0.033-0.79)~\mu as$ for Sgr A* and $\in~(0.033-0.59)~\mu as$ for M87*. The deviations of the lensing observables $|\Delta\theta_\infty|$ and $|\Delta s|$ for RQCBH ($a=0.8,\alpha=0.4$) from Kerr black holes can reach up to $1.6~\mu as$ and $0.41~\mu as$ for Sgr A*, and $1.2~\mu as$ and $0.31~\mu as$ for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{mag}$ $\in~(1.81-6.82)~\mu as$. We also compared the time delays between the relativistic images in the 22 SMBHs at the center of various galaxies. We found that RQCBH can be quantitatively distinguished from Kerr black holes. Interestingly, the time delay for Sgr A* and M87* can reach approximately 24.95 min and 308.15 hrs, respectively. Our analysis concludes that, within the 1$\sigma$ region, a significant portion of the parameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that the textbook formula for the pressure of free massless fermions leads to negative values of the probability mass function of the distribution of the system of free massless fermions in the fermion number. The ways to resolve this paradox are proposed. A detailed analysis of the corresponding partition function indicates the presence of a Roberge-Weiss transition in the absence of strong interactions.</description>

      <title>Truncation-Free Quantum Simulation of Pure-Gauge Compact QED Using Josephson Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the methods that have been proposed and used in practice to bypass computational challenges in the investigation of lattice gauge theories. While most of the proposals rely on truncating the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces that these models feature, we propose a truncation-free method based on the exact analogy between the local Hilbert space of lattice QED and that of a Josephson junction. We provide several proposals, mostly semi-analog, arranged according to experimental difficulty. Our method can simulate a quasi-2D system of up to $2\times N$ plaquettes, and we present an approximate method that can simulate the fully-2D theory, but is more demanding experimentally and not immediately feasible. This sets the ground for analog quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories with superconducting circuits, in a completely Hilbert space truncation-free procedure, for continuous gauge groups.</description>

      <title>Square-Root Gauge Theory and Modified Gravity -- Gravity-Assisted Confinement/Deconfinement and Emergent Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present contribution to the proceedings of MG17, the main aim is to elucidate the physically important effects of a special nonlinear gauge field with a square-root of the standard Maxwell Lagrangian in its action, interacting with a specific non-canonical modified $f(R)= R + R^2$ gravity formulated in terms of metric-independent spacetime volume elements and in addition coupled to the bosonic fields of the standard electroweak particle model. When applied in the context of cosmological evolution, the above theory consistently describes absence (suppression) of charge confinement and electroweak (Higgs) spontaneous breakdown in the ``early'' Universe, whereas in the post-inflationary ``late'' universe primarily the presence of the ``square-root'' nonlinear gauge field dynamically triggers both the appearance of QCD-like confinement and dynamical generation of the Higgs effect, as well as dynamical generation of non-zero cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: We review the calculation of suppression of Chiral Separational and Chiral Vortical Effects for strange quarks (which allegedly yield spin polarization of $\Lambda/\bar\Lambda$-hyperons in peripheral Heavy-Ion Collisions) by the non-perturbative interactions in hot deconfined QCD with the Field Correlator Method.

      <title>Black holes, photon sphere, and cosmology in ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The improved version of ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity introduced in Phys.~Lett.~B \textbf{631} (2005), 1-6 is proposed and investigated. It is demonstrated that improved ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity may be consistently applied to describe the expanding universe (with horizon) as well as the static spacetime like black holes. Interestingly, such a theory looks like a close avatar of scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with the only difference that the scalar field is not a dynamical one so that many predictions of ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity are very similar to that of sEGB gravity.
  We discuss the gravitational wave in the improved model with the condition that the propagating speed of the gravitational wave is identical to that of the propagation speed of light. A model that describes inflation in the early universe and could satisfy the observational constraints is also constructed. The solution of ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity realising the given static spacetime with spherical symmetry is proposed. Some of such solutions realise explicitly the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole or the Hayward black hole, which is a regular black hole without curvature singularity, We also construct a black hole in our theory which contains the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, the horizon radius, and the radius of the photon sphere as independent parameters. The radius of the black hole shadow in this model as well as photon sphere radius are estimated. It is shown that there exists a parameter region which satisfies the constraints coming from Event Horizon Telescope observations. Furthermore, we construct model where the radius of the black hole shadow or photon orbit is smaller than the horizon radius supposed from the ADM mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore some aspects of the spectral instability of back hole quasi-normal modes, using a specific model as an example. The model is that of a small bump perturbation to the effective potential of linear axial gravitational waves on a Schwarzschild background, and our focus is on three different aspects of the instability: identifying and distinguishing between the two different types of instabilities studied previously in the literature, quantifying the size of the perturbations applied to the system and testing the validity of the pseudospectral numerical method in providing a convergent result for this measure, and finally, relating the size and other features of the perturbation to the degree of destabilisation of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifts induced by light scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</description>

Abstract: A recurring task in particle physics and statistics is to compute the complex critical points of a product of powers of affine-linear functions. The logarithmic discriminant characterizes exponents for which such a function has a degenerate critical point in the corresponding hyperplane arrangement complement. We study properties of this discriminant, exploiting its connection with the Hurwitz form of a reciprocal linear space.</description>

      <title>Breaking Parity: the case of the Trispectrum from Chiral Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, possible hints of parity violation have been observed in the connected galaxy four-point correlation function. Although the true origin of the signal from the analysis has been debated, should they have a physical origin, they might point to primordial non-Gaussianity and would be evidence of new physics. In this work, we examine the single-field slow-roll model of inflation within chiral scalar-tensor theories of modified gravity. These theories extend the Chern-Simons one by including parity-violating operators containing first and second derivatives of the non-minimally coupled scalar (inflaton) field. This model is capable of imprinting parity-violating signatures in late-time observables, such as the galaxy four-point correlation function. We perform an analysis of the graviton-mediated scalar trispectrum of the gauge-invariant curvature perturbation $\zeta(t,\mathbf{x})$. We estimate that for a set of parameters of the theory it is possible to produce a signal-to-noise ratio for the parity-violating part of the trispectrum of order one without introducing modifications to the single-field slow-roll setup. Even if the signal found in the analysis turns out to be spurious or if no parity violation is ever detected in the galaxy four-point correlation function, our analysis can be used to constrain the free parameters of these theories.</description>

      <title>Squeezed vacua and primordial features in effective theories of inflation at N2LO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite duration of cosmic inflation can result in features $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}(k)=|\alpha_k-\beta_k\,\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\delta_k}|^2 \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}^{(0)}(k)$ in the primordial power spectrum that carry information about a quantum gravity phase before inflation. While the almost-scale-invariant power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}^{(0)}$ for the quasi-Bunch-Davies vacuum is fully determined by the inflationary background dynamics, the Bogoliubov coefficients $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ for the squeezed vacuum depend on new physics beyond inflation and have been used to produce phenomenological templates for the features. In this paper, we consider a large class of effective theories of inflation and compute the relative phase $\delta_k$. While this phase vanishes in de Sitter space, here we show that it is fully determined by the inflationary background dynamics and we compute it up to the next-to-next-leading order (N2LO) in a Hubble-flow expansion. In particular, for the Starobinsky model of inflation we find that this relative phase can be expressed in terms of the scalar tilt $n_\mathrm{s}$ as $\delta_k=\frac{\pi}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)-\frac{\pi}{4}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2\,\ln(k/k_*)$. The relative phase results in a negative shift and a running frequency that have been considered in the most studied phenomenological templates for primordial features, thus providing precise theoretical predictions for upcoming cosmological observations.</description>

Abstract: Minimal BCOV theory is a classical field theory which describes a subclass of deformations of the category of perfect complexes on a Calabi-Yau variety. We compute minimal models for $L_\infty$-algebras describing minimal BCOV theory and its variants on flat space and find that they give certain $L_\infty$-extensions of the infinite-dimensional simple Lie superalgebra $\operatorname{SHO}(d|d)$. We apply this computation to compare an $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ action on an odd two-dimensional central extension of $\operatorname{SHO}(3|3)$ first discovered by Kac to an action of $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ on a variant of minimal BCOV theory previously found by the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the equations of motion in combination with crossing symmetry to constrain the properties of interacting fermionic boundary conformal field theories. This combination is an efficient way of determining operator product expansion coefficients and anomalous dimensions at the first few orders of the $\epsilon$ expansion. Two necessary ingredients for this procedure are knowledge of the boundary and bulk spinor conformal blocks. The bulk spinor conformal blocks are derived here for the first time. We then consider a number of examples. For $\phi$ a scalar field and $\psi$ a fermionic field, we study the effects of a $\phi \bar \psi \psi$ coupling in $4- \epsilon$ dimensions, a $\phi^2 \bar \psi \psi$ coupling in $3 -\epsilon$ dimensions, and a $(\bar \psi \psi)^2$ coupling in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions. We are able to compute some new anomalous dimensions for operators in these theories. Finally, we relate the anomalous dimension of a surface operator to the behavior of the charge density near the surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we entertain a Machian setting where local physics is non-locally affected by the whole Universe, taking the liberty to identify the local (``Newton's bucket'') with our visible Universe, and the whole Universe (Mach's ``fixed stars'') with the global Universe beyond our horizon. Crucially, we allow for the two to have different properties, so that we are beyond the traditional FRW setting. For definiteness we focus on theories where non-locality arises from evolution in the laws of physics in terms of spatially global time variables dual to the constants of Nature. Since non-local theories are foliation-dependent, the {\it local} (but not the global) Hamiltonian constraint is lost. This is true not only while non-locality is taking place, but also after it ceases: the local Hamiltonian constraint is only recovered up to a constant in time, keeping a memory of the integrated past non-locality. We show that this integration constant is equivalent to preserving the local Hamiltonian constraint and adding an extra fluid with the same cosmological properties as conventional pressureless dark matter. The equivalence breaks down in terms of clustering properties, with the new component attracting other matter, but not budging from its location. This is the ultimate ``painted-on'' dark matter, attracting but not being attracted, and nailing down a preferred frame.</description>

Abstract: We continue our study of gaugings the maximal $N=(2,2)$ supergravity in six dimensions with gauge groups obtained from decomposing the embedding tensor under $\mathbb{R}^+\times SO(4,4)$ subgroup of the global symmetry $SO(5,5)$. Supersymmetry requires the embedding tensor to transform in $\mathbf{144}_c$ representation of $SO(5,5)$. Under $\mathbb{R}^+\times SO(4,4)$ subgroup, this leads to the embedding tensor in $(\mathbf{8}^{\pm 3}$, $\mathbf{8}^{\pm 1},\mathbf{56}^{\pm 1})$ representations. Gaugings in $\mathbf{8}^{\pm 3}$ representations lead to a translational gauge group $\mathbb{R}^8$ while gaugings in $\mathbf{8}^{\pm 1}$ representations give rise to gauge groups related to the scaling symmetry $\mathbb{R}^+$. On the other hand, the embedding tensor in $\mathbf{56}^{\pm 1}$ representations gives $CSO(4-p,p,1)\sim SO(4-p,p)\ltimes \mathbb{R}^4\subset SO(4,4)$ gauge groups with $p=0,1,2$. More interesting gauge groups can be obtained by turning on more than one representation of the embedding tensor subject to the quadratic constraints. In particular, we consider gaugings in both $\mathbf{56}^{-1}$ and $\mathbf{8}^{+3}$ representations giving rise to larger $SO(5-p,p)$ and $SO(4-p,p+1)$ gauge groups for $p=0,1,2$. In this case, we also give a number of half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions preserving different residual symmetries. The solutions for gaugings obtained only from $\mathbf{56}^{-1}$ representation are also included in these results when the $\mathbf{8}^{+3}$ part is accordingly turned off.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07707v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In analogy to null electromagnetic fields we define null YM fields. We show that the null non-abelian $SU(N)$ gauge fields admit a set of $2 N^2$ conserved "helicities". We derive null YM solutions that carry finite helicities by uplifting the abelian Hopfion solution and their generalizations. Another method that we implement is to deform YM solutions which do not carry helicities into ones that have nontrivial helicities. A nontrivial non-Abelian solution with helicities is found as a wave of infinite energy. We also discuss non-abelian generalizations of the Bateman parameterization for null abelian gauge fields.</description>

      <title>New supersymmetric AdS$_6$ black holes from matter-coupled F(4) gauged supergravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01746v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric $AdS_6$ black holes from matter-coupled $N=(1,1)$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets and $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. This gauged supergravity admits two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua preserving all supersymmetries with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetries. By considering a truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\subset SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ invariant sector, we find a number of new supersymmetric $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ solutions by performing a topological twist along $\mathcal{M}_4$. For $\mathcal{M}_4$ being a product of two Riemann surfaces $\Sigma\times \widetilde{\Sigma}$ and a Kahler four-cycle, the twist is implemented by $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}$ gauge field while, for $\mathcal{M}_4$ given by a Cayley four-cycle, the twist is performed by turning on $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ gauge fields. We give numerical black hole solutions interpolating between $AdS_2\times \mathcal{M}_4$ near horizon geometries and asymptotically locally $AdS_6$ vacua. Among these solutions, there are solutions interpolating between both of the supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua and near horizon geometries. The solutions can also be interpreted as holographic RG flows from five-dimensional SCFTs to superconformal quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19562v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In JT gravity coupled to a CFT, I argue without using the path integral that the entanglement wedge of a boundary region is bounded by a quantum extremal surface (QES). For any candidate not bounded by a QES, a unitary in the complement can make reconstruction within the candidate inconsistent with boundary causality. The case without islands is a direct consequence of subregion duality, and the case with islands can also be dealt with with a stronger assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the flavored elliptic genus of the N=2 superconformal cigar model and generalize the analysis of the path integral result to the case of real central charge. It gives rise to a non-holomorphic modular covariant function generalizing completed mock modular forms. We also compute the genus for angular orbifolds of the cigar and Liouville theory and decompose it in terms of discrete and continuous contributions. The orbifolded elliptic genus at fractional level is a completed mock modular form with a shadow related to U$(1)$ modular invariants at rational radius squared. We take the limit of the orbifolded genera towards a weighted ground state index and carefully interpret the contributions. We stress that the orbifold cigar and Liouville theories have a maximal and a minimal radius, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two dimensional systems with extended conformal symmetry generated by the ${\mathcal W}_3$ algebra. These are expected to have an infinite number of commuting conserved charges, which we refer to as the quantum Boussinesq charges. We compute the eigenvalues of the quantum Boussinesq charges in both the vacuum and first excited states of the higher spin module through the ODE/IM correspondence. By studying the higher spin conformal field theory on the torus, we also calculate thermal correlators involving the energy-momentum tensor and the spin-3 current by making use of the Zhu recursion relations. By combining these results, we show that it is possible to derive the current densities, whose integrals are the quantum Boussinesq charges. We also evaluate the thermal expectation values of the conserved charges, and show that these are quasi-modular differential operators acting on the character of the higher spin module.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft hairs are an intrinsic infrared feature of a black hole, which may also affect near-horizon physics. In this work, we study some of the subtleties surrounding one of the primary observables with which we can study their effects in the context of Einstein's gravity: the black hole shadow. First, we clarify the singular pathology associated with black holes with soft hairs and demonstrate the metrics of linearly superrotated black holes are free of near-zone pathologies due to appropriate asymptotic falloff conditions imposed on the event horizon. We then analytically construct the photon orbits around such black holes and derive the shadow equation, and find that the linear superrotation hairs will deform the circular shadow of a bald Schwarzchild black hole into ellipses. This is in sharp contrast to their supertranslated counterparts, which only shift the position of the center of the circular shadow but do not change its shape. Our results suggest a richness to the observable effects due to the infrared structures of Einstein's gravity and demand their observations by future black hole imaging projects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ``Swampland Program'' aims to discriminate consistent-looking effective field theories that do not admit a UV completion in quantum gravity from those that do. While most often developed under the umbrella of string theory, several swampland criteria have been explored also in other contexts, especially asymptotically safe gravity. A comparison between different approaches can help to clarify the dependence of low-energy constraints on UV physics and thereby shed light on the universality of quantum gravity itself. In this short review we summarise what is known about three important swampland conjectures in string theory and in asymptotic safety. We point out future lines of research that can help to understand to what extent swampland conjectures are absolute, i.e. hold in quantum gravity in general, or relative, i.e. belong only to a specific UV framework.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation from Lorentzian inversion in 1d CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the Lorentzian inversion formula, we derive a dispersion relation which computes a four-point function in 1d CFTs as an integral over its double discontinuity. The crossing symmetric kernel of the integral is given explicitly for the case of identical operators with integer or half-integer scaling dimension. This derivation complements the one that uses analytic functionals. We use the dispersion relation to evaluate holographic correlators defined on the half-BPS Wilson line of planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills, reproducing results up to fourth order in an expansion at large t'Hooft coupling.</description>

      <title>The physical moduli of heterotic G_2 string compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous works, an operator was developed for heterotic compactifications on $\mathbb{R}^{2,1}\times G_2$ and $AdS_3 \times G_2$, which preserves $N=1$ $d=3$ supersymmetry and whose kernel is related to the moduli of the compactification. The operator is described in terms of non-physical spurious degrees of freedom, specifically, deformations of a connection on the tangent bundle. In this paper, we eliminate these spurious degrees of freedom by linking deformations of the spin connection to the moduli of the $G_2$ manifold $Y$. This results in an operator $\check D$ that captures the physical moduli space of the $G_2$ heterotic string theory. When $Y=X\times S^1$, with $X$ an $SU(3)$ manifold, we show $\check D$ produces results that align with existing literature. This allows us to propose a $G_2$ moduli space metric. We check that this metric reduces to the $SU(3)$ moduli metric constructed in the literature. We then define an adjoint operator ${\check D}^\dag$. We show the $G_2$ moduli correspond to the intersection of the kernels of $\check D$ and ${\check D}^\dag$. These kernels reduce to the $SU(3)$ F-terms and D-terms respectively on $X\times S^1$. This gives two non-trivial consistency checks of our proposed moduli space metric. Working perturbatively in $\alpha'$, we also demonstrate that the heterotic $G_2$ moduli problem can be characterised in terms of a double extension of ordinary bundles, just like in the $SU(3)$ case.</description>

Abstract: We show that various dynamical gauge theories in two, three and four dimensions, which are obtained as Manin deformations of topological Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky theories, are equivalent to gravitational theories. Since gravity is topological in two and three dimension, this equivalence requires a diffeomorphism breaking background source term. In four dimensions, however, the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant is obtained identically via the Manin deformation of a particular Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky theory.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity breaking and deviation from Eigenstate Thermalisation in relativistic QFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The validity of the ergodic hypothesis in quantum systems can be rephrased in the form of the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH), a set of statistical properties for the matrix elements of local observables in energy eigenstates, which is expected to hold in any ergodic system. We test the ETH in a nonintegrable model of relativistic quantum field theory (QFT) using the numerical method of Hamiltonian truncation in combination with analytical arguments based on Lorentz symmetry and renormalisation group theory. We find that there is an infinite sequence of eigenstates with the characteristics of quantum many-body scars, that is, exceptional eigenstates with observable expectation values that lie far from thermal values, and we show that these states are one-quasiparticle states. We argue that in the thermodynamic limit the eigenstates cover the entire area between two diverging lines: the line of one-quasiparticle states, whose direction is dictated by relativistic kinematics, and the thermal average line. Our results suggest that the strong version of the ETH is violated in any relativistic QFT whose spectrum admits a quasiparticle description.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study interaction between dark energy and dark matter, where dark energy is described by a massive vector field, and dark matter is modelled as a fluid. We present a new interaction term, which affects only perturbations and can give interesting phenomenology. Then we present a general Lagrangian for the interacting vector dark energy with dark matter. For the dark energy, we choose Proca theory with $G_{3}$ term to study its phenomenological consequence. For this model, we explore both background and perturbation dynamics. We also present the no-ghost condition for tensor modes, vector modes and scalar modes. Subsequently, we also study the evolution of the overdensities of both baryon and cold dark matter in the high$-k$ limit. We show that the effective gravitational coupling is modified for cold dark matter and baryon. We also choose a simple concrete model and numerically show a suppression of the effective gravitational coupling for cold dark matter. However, in this simple model, the suppression of the effective gravitational coupling does not result in a suppression of the matter overdensity compared to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model due to the modified background expansion.</description>

      <title>Vector-like Quark Stabilised Higgs Inflation: Implications for Particle Phenomenology, Primordial Gravitational Waves and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02399v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) Higgs potential is likely to be metastable, in which case Higgs Inflation requires an extension of the SM to sufficiently stabilise the Higgs potential. Here we consider stabilisation by adding $n_{Q} \leq 3$ Vector-Like Quarks (VLQs) of mass $m_{Q}$. We consider isosinglet $T$ and $B$ vector quarks. Requiring stability of the finite temperature effective potential, we find that the upper bounds on $m_{Q}$ for $T$ quarks are 5.8 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 2$) and 55 TeV (for $n_{Q} = 3$). The upper bounds are generally smaller for $B$ vector quarks and are sensitive to the $t$-quark mass. The inflation predictions depend upon the conformal frame in which the model is renormalised. For renormalisation in the Einstein frame (Prescription I) the predictions are almost indistinguishable from the classical values: $n_s = 0.966$ and $r = 3.3 \times 10^{-3}$. Renormalisation in the Jordan frame (Prescription II) predicts larger values of $n_{s}$ and $r$, with $n_{s}$ generally in the range 0.980 to 0.990 and $r$ of the order of 0.01. The predicted range of $n_{s}$ is consistent with the CMB range obtained in Hubble tension solutions which modify the sound horizon at decoupling, whilst the predicted values of $r$ will be easily observable by forthcoming CMB experiments. The observational upper bound on $r$ generally imposes a stronger upper bound on $m_{Q}$ in Prescription II than the requirement of stability. We conclude that VLQ-stabilised Higgs Inflation with Prescription II renormalisation favours 1-10 TeV vector-like quarks that will be accessible to future colliders, and predicts a tensor-to-scalar ratio that will be observable in forthcoming CMB experiments and values of $n_{s}$ that favour an early-time solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the Casimir-Lifshitz effect associated with the electromagnetic field in the presence of a rectangular waveguide consisting of two distinct dielectric materials in a $(3+1)$-dimensional spacetime. We employ the surface mode technique to derive a generalized Lifshitz formula for this specific geometry. Our formulation accounts for the unique dielectric properties of the materials composing the waveguide, leading to a precise calculation of the Casimir-Lifshitz energy. In the asymptotic limit, our results recover the classical expressions for perfect reflecting boundaries. This work extends the applicability of the Lifshitz formula to more complex systems and provides valuable insights into the influence of dielectric materials on the electromagnetic Casimir effect.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Warp Drives, and Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

      <title>Unitary Designs from Random Symmetric Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study distributions of unitaries generated by random quantum circuits containing only symmetry-respecting gates. We develop a unified approach applicable to all symmetry groups and obtain an equation that determines the exact design properties of such distributions. It has been recently shown that the locality of gates imposes various constraints on realizable unitaries, which in general, significantly depend on the symmetry under consideration. These constraints typically include restrictions on the relative phases between sectors with inequivalent irreducible representations of the symmetry. We call a set of symmetric gates semi-universal if they realize all unitaries that respect the symmetry, up to such restrictions. For instance, while 2-qubit gates are semi-universal for $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries in qubit systems, SU(d) symmetry with $d\ge 3$ requires 3-qudit gates for semi-universality. Failure of semi-universality precludes the distribution generated by the random circuits from being even a 2-design for the Haar distribution over symmetry-respecting unitaries. On the other hand, when semi-universality holds, under mild conditions, satisfied by U(1) and SU(2) for example, the distribution becomes a $t$-design for $t$ growing polynomially with the number of qudits, where the degree is determined by the locality of gates. More generally, we present a simple linear equation that determines the maximum integer $t_{\max}$ for which the uniform distribution of unitaries generated by the circuits is a $t$-design for all $t\leq t_{\max}$. Notably, for U(1), SU(2) and cyclic groups, we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ as a function of the number of qubits and locality of the gates, and for SU(d), we determine the exact value of $t_{\max}$ for up to $4$-qudit gates.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion crystal phase on a magnetic domain wall in chiral magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a magnetic domain wall in the ferromagnetic phase in chiral magnets in two dimensions with an in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and an out-of-plane Zeeman magnetic field, and find a chiral soliton lattice (spiral) phase beside a ferromegnetic phase inside the domain line, where the former represents a domain-wall skyrmion crystal from the bulk point of view. We first determine the phase diagram on the domain wall by numerically constructing domain wall solutions. We then analytically reproduce the phase diagram in a domain-wall theory (a chiral double sine-Gordon model) that we construct within the moduli approximation by treating the Zeeman magnetic field perturbatively. While we find good agreements between the phase diagrams of the numerical and effective theory methods, the numerical solution exhibits a decomposition of the topological charge into a bimeron which cannot be captured by the effective theory.</description>

      <title>STEGR in Internal-Space Formulation: Formalisms, Primary Constraints, and Possible Internal Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate that in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Influence of GUP corrected Casimir energy on zero tidal force wormholes in modified teleparallel gravity with matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05348v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent times, the study of the Casimir effect in quantum field theory has garnered increasing attention because of its potential to be an ideal source of exotic matter needed for stabilizing traversable wormholes. It has been confirmed through experimental evidence that this phenomenon involves fluctuations in the vacuum field, leading to a negative energy density. Motivated by the above, we have investigated Casimir wormholes with corrections from the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of matter-coupled teleparallel gravity. Our analysis includes three well-known GUP models: the Kempf, Mangano, and Mann (KMM) model, the Detournay, Gabriel, and Spindel (DGS) model, and a third model called Model II. For a broader analysis, we have considered two well-known model functions for the teleparallel theory: a linear $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha T+\beta\mathcal{T}$ and a quadratic model $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\eta T^2+\chi\mathcal{T}$. The shape function solutions corresponding to both models are examined in the absence of tidal forces in spacetime. We also demonstrate the crucial role played by the parameters of the $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ models in the violation of the energy conditions. With the increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical objects, we have thoroughly discussed the perturbation of the wormhole solutions in the scalar, electromagnetic, axial gravitational, and Dirac field backgrounds. We employ the $3^{rd}$ order WKB expansion to find the complex frequencies associated with the quasinormal modes of energy dissipation. Additionally, we also calculate the active mass and total gravitational energy for the wormhole geometry. The amount of exotic matter involved in sustaining these wormholes is also found in this paper. Furthermore, the physical stability of such Casimir wormholes is examined using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.</description>

      <title>Quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the problem of canonical quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown that a consistent procedure of canonical quantization of the field can be carried out without taking into account the internal region of the black hole. We prove that there exists a unitary gauge, which can be viewed as a combination of the Coulomb and Poincare gauges and is compatible with the field equations. The solutions corresponding to the stationary one-particle states of the electromagnetic field are studied, the canonical commutation relations and the Hamiltonian of the quantized electromagnetic field are obtained.</description>
