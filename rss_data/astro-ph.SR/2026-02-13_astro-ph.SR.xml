      <title>Tidal triggers and the predictability of solar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magneto-Rossby waves in the solar tachocline are currently considered to be one of the main determinants of solar activity. In particular, they can give rise to the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The latter was recently shown to be dominated by a phase-stable period of around 1.7 years. By analyzing 72 ground-level enhancement (GLE) events and 37 S-flares, we determine that this period is close to 1.723 years. This, in turn, is the dominant beat between the periods of the spring tides of the tidally dominant planets Venus, Earth, and Jupiter, which are suspected to synchronize not only the QBO, but also the 11.07-year Schwabe cycle. We demonstrate that recent events, such as the solar storm of 2024 May 10 and the strong X-flare of 2026 February 1, align well with maxima of the tidal forcing. By contrast, the Carrington event (1959 September 1) does not fit this pattern.</description>

      <title>Filling The Pockets: The Spherical Nature of 3D Deflagration in Thermonuclear Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate thermonuclear explosions within the delayed detonation framework. While spherical delayed detonation models generally reproduce key observational features, a fundamental inconsistency emerges in three dimensions: 3D hydrodynamic simulations exhibit insufficient white dwarf expansion during the deflagration phase. We identify the early deflagration stage, when the burning is dominated by the laminar speed, as a critical phase and explore potential solutions using three dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations performed with the FLASH code. In hydrodynamical simulations, the early deflagration phase produces large pockets of unburned C/O, leading to inefficient burning. Much of the released energy is deposited into buoyantly rising plumes rather than into the global pre-expansion of the white dwarf, which is required to produce the partially burned layers characteristic of SNe Ia. In contrast, when preexisting turbulent velocity fields and strong magnetic fields, on scales expected from the smoldering phase, are included, the effective burning approaches that in spherical models. Both turbulence and magnetic fields promote the entrainment of burned material into unburned pockets, addressing a long-standing problem in multi-dimensional deflagration models. The resulting streaks of burned material enable the conductive ignition of the surrounding unburned fuel. The dominant effect is not a change in the small-scale flame physics (~10^{-3} cm), but rather enhanced mixing between burned and unburned material. As expected, this mechanism is most efficient when the turbulent length scales are smaller than those of the unburned plumes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic modeling of coronal abundances during flares on M-dwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar atmospheric elemental abundances are now known to vary both in space and time. Dynamic modeling of these changes is therefore necessary to improve the accuracy of radiative hydrodynamic simulations. Recent studies have shown that including spatio-temporal variations in coronal abundances during solar flares leads to the formation of coronal condensations (rain), which are otherwise difficult to create in impulsively heated field aligned hydrodynamic flare models. These simulations start with a solar corona dominated by the first ionization potential (FIP) effect, and evaporate photospheric material into the post-flare loops. We here explore perhaps the most extreme non-solar starting condition for the coronal composition in these simulations: an initial corona dominated by the inverse FIP (iFIP) effect, such as is observed on active M-dwarf stars. We show that a flaring event in a corona enriched with high FIP elements leads to a solution similar to the solar case. Coronal rain is harder to form by this method during flares on M-dwarfs, however, if the corona is depleted of low FIP elements.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional mapping of coronal magnetic field and plasma parameters in a solar flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnosing solar flare conditions is essential for understanding coronal energy release. Using combined microwave and X-ray data, we reconstruct three-dimensional maps of the magnetic field and plasma parameters in the SOL2021-05-07 flare.
  We use imaging spectroscopy from the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) to derive spatial maps of the magnetic field strength, thermal and nonthermal electron densities, and the power-law index of nonthermal electrons through gyrosynchrotron modeling. Simultaneous X-ray observations from Hinode/XRT and Solar Orbiter/STIX, obtained from different vantage points, enable a stereoscopic reconstruction of the flaring loop. By correlating the positions of microwave and thermal X-ray sources, we associate the three-dimensional coordinates with the microwave-derived plasma parameters.
  We derive observational three-dimensional maps of magnetic field strength, Alfv\'en speed, and plasma beta in the flaring volume, revealing a magnetically dominated environment. These spatially resolved diagnostics provide valuable constraints for models of magnetic reconnection and flare dynamics and represent a step toward a realistic three-dimensional characterization of energy release in solar eruptive events.</description>

      <title>Selecting Optimal Stellar Calibration Fields for the CSST Imaging Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST) will perform a decade-long high-precision wide-field imaging survey that relies on rigorous on-orbit calibration. This necessitates stable celestial benchmark fields to maintain photometric and astrometric consistency throughout the mission lifetime. We establish comprehensive selection criteria including observational visibility, stellar number density, bright-star contamination, and interstellar dust extinction. Using the CSST Observation Strategy Analysis Tool (COSAT) and all-sky dust maps from Planck and SFD, we constrain eligible regions to the ranges of ecliptic latitude $ |\beta| &gt; 50^\circ$ and galactic latitude $|b| &gt; 15^\circ$. From an initial sample of 29 candidate clusters meeting these spatial constraints, six globular clusters (M13, M92, NGC 104, NGC 362, NGC 1261, and NGC 1851) are identified as optimal calibration fields, fulfilling all the critical criteria. These selected clusters are recommended as optimal calibration field candidates for CSST's on-orbit calibration program, and are fundamental to achieving unprecedented photometric precision in CSST's space-based survey.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Damping Nonlinear Oscillations by KHI-induced Turbulence in Synthetic Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-amplitude decaying kink oscillations of coronal loops are strongly influenced by nonlinear processes, such as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and turbulence, though comprehensive theory and observational confirmation remain limited. Building on the recently developed theory on nonlinear damping by KHI-induced turbulence in impulsively driven transverse loop oscillations, we investigate its observational signatures using 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations and forward-modelled EUV images. The simulated oscillations exhibit time-varying frequency shifts and damping rates, which are broadly consistent with nonlinear turbulence-damping theory. Additionally, they exhibit excitation of higher-order modes, slightly increased periods relative to the linear kink period, and reduced displacement amplitudes. These features are generally preserved in synthetic observations, though resolving higher-order modes requires higher spatial resolution than currently available. For loops embedded in a hotter background, hotter channels (e.g., 193 Angstroms) are more sensitive to boundary dynamics, thus their oscillations decay faster with smaller displacements and larger phase shifts than those in cooler channels (e.g., 171 Angstroms). Comparisons of simulated and synthetic oscillations show close agreement at the early stage. At later times, synthetic oscillations exhibit smaller displacements and larger phase shifts, due to turbulence-induced asymmetry in the loop cross-section. Bayesian fitting shows that the initial oscillation amplitude and kink period are robustly constrained, whereas parameters controlling the damping profile are degenerate, indicating that additional observables would aid reliable seismological inference. These results provide a quantitative basis for identifying nonlinear damping and detecting KHI-driven turbulence in transverse loop oscillations.</description>

      <title>Surface brightness-colour relations of Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds classical Cepheids based on Gaia magnitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: We derive SBCRs for classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and in the Magellanic Clouds using the photometric data available in the Gaia database, and we quantify the metallicity effect. Methods: We first selected the data on the basis of a number of quality criteria and chose the best photometric data and the best parallaxes available in Gaia for Milky Way classical Cepheids. Secondly, we compiled an extensive list of period-radius (PR) relations available in the literature, and we also provide a new PR relation based on interferometric data in our previous work. Thirdly, combining the radius of classical Cepheids with distance estimates (based on Gaia parallaxes for the Milky Way and on eclipsing binaries for the Magellanic Clouds), we derived the surface brightness and colour of about 1700 classical Cepheids. Results: We first derived a new PR relation based on interferometric data and distances from the literature of seven classical Cepheids: $\mathrm{\log(R/R_{\odot}) = 1.133_{\pm 0.019} + 0.688_{\pm 0.016} log(P)}$. The metallicity does not affect the PR relations. Secondly, we calculated three different SBCRs for the Milky Way and Large and Small Magellanic Cloud classical Cepheids based on this new PR relation that clearly show the dependence of the metallicity on the SBCR based on Gaia magnitudes alone. Finally, we derived relations between the slopes, the zero points (ZP), and the metallicity ([Fe/H]) of these three SBCRs: $\mathrm{Slope_{SBCR}=-0.0663_{\pm 0.0121} [Fe/H] - 0.3010_{\pm 0.0030}}$ and $\mathrm{ZP_{SBCR}=-0.1016_{\pm 0.0091} [Fe/H] + 3.9988_{\pm 0.0029}}$. Conclusions: These new SBCRs, dedicated to classical Cepheids in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds, are of particular importance to apply the inverse Baade-Wesselink method to classical Cepheids observed by Gaia in a forthcoming study.</description>

      <title>The Outflow of the B335 Protostar II: After the Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The B335 protostar has undergone a major outburst detected in the scattered light of its outflow cavity that has not yet ended. B335 therefore offers the rare opportunity to study its effect on the jet of a protostellar object. Photometry of background stars behind B335 is used to map visual continuum extinction and H$_2$O ice absorption and demonstrates that the outflow has carved out a cavity. Precise proper motions of the shock fronts emerging from the B335 protostar were obtained. The kinematic age of the most prominent shock front (3E) corresponds to the early phases of the ongoing outburst of the B335 protostar. Shock 3E shows strong CO gas emission, as well as H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}] emission. Older shock fronts show diminished CO emission and are dominated by H$_2$ and [\ion{Fe}{2}]. The emission feature 0E, closest to the protostar, is distinct in proper motion and radial velocity from the other shock fronts in the jet. In the span of 4\arcsec\ closest to the protostar, the continuum extinction in front of the outflow cavity increases by A$_V$~$\approx$~200 mag. The CO-line-removed spectra close to the protostar show the unsaturated absorption features of $^{13}$CO$_2$, OCN$^-$, and OCS have strongly increasing column densities toward the protostar. The ice characteristics are overall similar to those found in lines of sight with less extinction. The central regions of the bipolar nebula show CO gas emission, but at distances of a few arcsec from the protostar, absorption by CO gas is also detected.</description>

      <title>Measurement prospects for the pair-instability mass cutoff with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.</description>

      <title>ALMA Band1 observations of the rhoOphW filament I. Enhanced power from excess microwave emission at high spatial frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rhoOphW photo-dissociation region (PDR) is an example source of bright excess microwave emission (EME), over synchrotron, free-free, and the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the sub-millimetre (sub-mm) dust continuum. Its filamentary morphology follows roughly that of the IR poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAHs) bands. The EME signal in rhoOphW drops abruptly above ~30GHz and its spectrum can be interpreted in terms of electric-dipole radiation from spinning dust grains, or ``spinning dust''. Deep and high-fidelity imaging and spectroscopy of rhoOphW may reveal the detailed morphology of the EME signal, free from imaging priors, while also enabling a search for fine structure in its spectrum. The same observations may constrain the spectral index of the high-frequency drop. An ALMA Band1 mosaic yields a deep deconvolved image of the filament at 36-44GHz, which we use as template for the extraction of a spectrum via cross-correlation in the uv-plane. Simulations and cross-correlations on near-infrared ancillary data yield estimates of flux-loss and biases. The spectrum is a power law, with no detectable fine structure. It follows a spectral index alpha=-0.78+-0.05, in frequency, with some variations along the filament. Interestingly, the Band1 power at high spatial frequencies increases relative to that of the IR signal, with a factor of two more power in Band1 at ~20'' than at ~100'' (relative to IRAC3.6um). An extreme of such radio-only structures is a compact EME source, without IR counterpart. It is embedded in strong and filamentary Band1 signal, while the IRAC maps are smooth in the same region. We provide multi-frequency intensity estimates for spectral modelling.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS Survey: Discovery of Dusty Fibrils inside Massive Star-forming Clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of more than 323 superfine dusty filamentary structures (fibrils) inside 121 massive star forming clumps that are located in widely different Galactic environments (Galactocentric distances of $\sim$0.5-12.7 kpc). These fibrils are identified from the 1.3~mm continuum emission in the ALMA-QUARKS survey, which has a linear resolution of $\sim900$ AU for a source at $\sim$3 kpc, using the \textit{FilFinder} software. Using \textit{RadFil} software, we find that the typical width of these fibrils is $\sim$0.01 pc, which is about ten times narrower than that of dusty filaments in nearby clouds identified by the \textit{Herschel} Space Observatory. The mass ($M$) versus length ($L$) relation for these fibrils follows $M\propto L^{2}$, similar to that of Galactic filaments identified in space (e.g., \textit{Herschel}) and ground-based single-dish (e.g., \textit{APEX}) surveys. However, these fibrils are significantly denser ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{23}-10^{24}\ cm^{-2}}$) than the filaments found in previous \textit{Herschel} surveys ($\mathrm{N_{H_2} = 10^{20}-10^{23}\ cm^{-2}}$). This work contributes a large sample of superfine fibrils in massive clumps, following the identification of large 0.1-pc wide filaments and associated internal velocity coherent fibers in nearby molecular clouds, further emphasizing the crucial role played by filamentary structures in star formation at various physical scales.</description>

Abstract: Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) have to travel through the heliosphere before they interact with the Earth's atmosphere. During this, they are deflected by the Sun's magnetic field, causing variations in this field to imprint on the flux, spectrum and angular distribution of GCRs detected at or near Earth. Studies of these variations over the past several decades have revealed the impact of both transient phenomena such as solar flares, coronal holes, sunspot activity and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as well as their effects such as Forbush Decreases (FDs), precursors and Ground-Level Enhancements (GLEs). Periodic variations, such as due to the solar diurnal modulation, the 27-day solar rotation, the 11-year solar cycle, and the 22-year solar magnetic cycle have also been characterized. These Sun-induced phenomena are most prominent in GCR intensity variations up to $\sim$30 GeV/nuc, beyond which the influence of solar modulation decreases rapidly as the gyro-radii of GCRs exceed the characteristic size of the heliosphere ($\sim$100 AU).</description>

      <title>The Radius Cliff is a Waterfall: Explaining Sub-Neptune Exoplanets with Steam Worlds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The demographics of Kepler planets provide a key testbed for models of planet formation and evolution, particularly for explaining the radius valley separating super-Earths and sub-Neptunes. A primordial interpretation based on differences in bulk densities -- where rocky and water-rich planets form via migration pathways -- offers an alternative to atmospheric loss scenarios. Updated interior structure models of water worlds with adiabatic steam atmospheres reproduce the observed valley near $\sim2~R_\oplus$ more accurately. Furthermore, migration models from our Genesis library suggest that these formation pathways can also account for the distinct period distributions of super-Earths and sub-Neptunes, as well as the emergence of the hot Neptune desert. Motivated by this, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical mixture model for close-in Kepler planets ($P&lt;100$ days), combining rocky planets and water worlds without H/He envelopes. The inferred mass distributions of rocky and water-rich planets peak at $\sim2.6~M_\oplus$ and $\sim7~M_\oplus$, respectively, with the water mass fraction of water worlds peaking at $\sim41\%$. Water worlds provide a good representation of the Kepler sub-Neptune population, with the radius cliff emerging as a ``waterfall" -- a sharp decline in their occurrence. However, our mass-radius analysis shows that water worlds alone cannot explain planets with $R \gtrsim 3~R_\oplus$, implying that at least $\sim20\%$ of sub-Neptunes in the sample are enriched in H/He gas.</description>

      <title>Velocities of Free Floaters in a Sea of Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the velocity evolution of free-floating planets and interstellar objects (``free floaters'') through gravitational scatterings by field stars (with the stellar mass $m$ much larger than the mass of the floater, $m_p$). We show that the equilibrium velocity -- where dynamical friction balances stochastic acceleration -- is given by $\sigma \sqrt{2\ln(m/m_p)}$ (where $\sigma$ is the velocity disperson of the field stars), diverging from the standard energy equipartition scaling. While the timescale to reach this equilibrium is prohibitively long, we find that slow floaters ($v \lesssim \sigma$) undergo mass-independent acceleration, doubling their velocities within a few relaxation times. Consequently, free floaters initially following the Maxwellian distribution of their parent stars develop distinctly non-Maxwellian velocity distributions on a relaxation timescale. Since the relaxation time of the Galactic disk is longer than the age, our results suggest that the kinematics of low-mass free floaters in the disk may preserve signatures of their parent stars and ejection history.</description>

      <title>Full non-LTE multi-level radiative transfer I. An atom with three bound infinitely sharp levels</title>

Abstract: The standard nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) multi-level radiative transfer problem only takes into account the deviation of the radiation field and atomic populations from their equilibrium distribution. We aim to show how to solve for the full non-LTE (FNLTE) multi-level radiative transfer problem, also accounting for deviation of the velocity distribution of the massive particles from Maxwellian. We considered, as a first step, a three-level atom with zero natural broadening. In this work, we present a new numerical scheme. Its initialisation relies on the classic, multi-level approximate Lambda-iteration (MALI) method for the standard non-LTE problem. The radiative transfer equations, the kinetic equilibrium equations for atomic populations, and the Boltzmann equations for the velocity distribution functions were simultaneously iterated in order to obtain self-consistent particle distributions. During the process, the observer's frame absorption and emission profiles were re-computed at every iterative step by convolving the atomic frame quantities with the relevant velocity distribution function. We validate our numerical strategy by comparing our results with the standard non-LTE solutions in the limit of a two-level atom with Hummer's partial redistribution in frequency, and with a three-level atom with complete redistribution. In this work, we considered the so-called cross-redistribution problem. We then show new FNLTE results for a simple three-level atom while evaluating the assumptions made for the emission and absorption profiles of the standard non-LTE problem with partial and cross-redistribution.</description>

      <title>The Timescales of Embedded Star Formation as Observed in STARFORGE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Star formation occurs within dusty molecular clouds that are then disrupted by stellar feedback. However, the timing and physical mechanisms that govern the transition from deeply embedded to exposed stars remain uncertain. Using the STARFORGE simulations, we analyze the evolution of ``embeddedness'', identifying what drives emergence. We find the transition from embedded to exposed is fast for individual stars, within 1.3 Myr after the star reaches its maximum mass. This rapid transition is dominated by massive stars, which accrete while remaining highly obscured until their feedback eventually balances, then overcomes, the local accretion. For these massive stars, their maximum mass is reached simultaneously with their emergence. Once these stars are revealed, their localized, pre-supernova feedback then impacts the cloud, driving gas clearance. Because massive stars dominate the luminosity, their fast, local evolution dominates the light emergence from the dust. We calculate the dependence of these processes on the mass of the cloud and find that emergence always depends on when massive stars form, which scales with the cloud's free-fall time. We also measure the evolution of dust and H$\alpha$ luminosities, where for $\sim$2 Myr, these tracers outshine the emerging stellar continuum, reaching their peak when gas and dust remain tightly coupled to the massive stars. These results closely resemble observationally observed lifetimes, tying the observable dust and line emission directly to the same localized processes that drive stellar emergence, evidence that our simulated de-embedding physics is representative of real star-forming regions. Thus, because the initial embedding of the most luminous stars is highly local, the emergence of stars is a faster, earlier, more local event than the overall disruption of the cloud by gas expulsion.</description>

      <title>The collision and merger products of stars do not look alike: A magnetohydrodynamics comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A significant fraction of stars experience close interactions, including collisions resulting from gravitational encounters and mergers within close binary systems. These processes can produce more massive stars that may give rise to relatively rare objects such as blue stragglers. Distinguishing the outcomes of collisions and mergers is challenging yet essential for interpreting observations. This study utilizes the magnetohydrodynamics code AREPO to simulate collisions and mergers of $5$ to $10 \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ main-sequence stars, systematically comparing the properties of the resulting products. Both collisions and mergers yield more massive, strongly magnetized, rapidly and differentially rotating stars with cores enriched in hydrogen, but notable quantitative differences emerge. Merger products exhibit core hydrogen fractions up to $10\%$ higher than those of collision products. In both scenarios, turbulent mixing amplifies magnetic field energies by $9$ to $12$ orders of magnitude. However, magnetic fields in small-impact-parameter collision products display small-scale reversals that may dissipate over time, whereas merger products and large-impact-parameter collision products develop large-scale ordered, potentially long-lived magnetic fields. Additionally, only merger products display magnetically driven, bipolar outflows with radial velocities exceeding $300$ to $400 \,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. These distinctions may result in different long-term evolutionary outcomes, which warrant further investigation in future studies.</description>

      <title>The nature of ASASSN-24fw's occultation: modelling the event as dimming by optically thick rings around a sub-stellar companion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ASASSN-24fw is a main-sequence F-type star that experienced a rapid and long-lasting dimming event beginning in late 2024 and continuing until mid 2025. Its pre-dimming spectral energy distribution shows a persistent infrared excess with a fractional luminosity of approximately 0.5 percent. We model this excess using a two-component blackbody fit and find dust components with temperatures of about 1070 K and 390 K. Archival light curves indicate that ASASSN-24fw was photometrically stable prior to the event, suggesting that the dimming is caused by an external occulting body rather than intrinsic stellar variability. The event lasted about 275 days and exhibits a distinctive flat-bottomed profile of nearly 200 days, unlike most long-duration occultation events reported in the last decade. We analyze the light curve and spectra obtained during dimming to study the properties of both the star and the occulting material. A parametric light-curve model reveals multiple ingress phases, consistent with variations in the density and structure of the obscuring material. A second transit model favors an occulting body consistent with a gas giant or brown dwarf with a minimum mass of about 3.4 Jupiter masses and surrounded by an extended circumplanetary disk or rings of radius roughly 0.17 au. Near-infrared spectra taken during dimming show enhanced infrared excess and spectral features consistent with a late-type companion, approximately M8. We also detect variable H-alpha emission, suggesting evolving gas and dust in the occulting structure. Imaging from LCOGT identifies a nearby object within 3 arcsec, likely a bound companion at a projected separation of about 3000 au. Systems like ASASSN-24fw appear rare, and continued follow-up will help constrain the nature of the occulting body and the circumstellar environment.</description>

      <title>Simulated Operational Testing of the Prototype Implementation of the SOFIE Model: The 2025 Space Weather Prediction Testbed Exercise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CLEAR Space Weather Center of Excellence's solar energetic particle (SEP) model, SOlar wind with FIeld lines and Energetic particles (SOFIE), was run and evaluated on-site during the Space Weather Prediction Testbed (SWPT) exercise at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (NOAA/SWPC) in May 2025. As a physics-based SEP model, SOFIE simulates the acceleration and transport of energetic particles by the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock in the solar corona and inner heliosphere, and has been validated against historical events. However, questions remain regarding whether a physics-based model, traditionally considered computationally expensive, could meet operational needs. The SWPT exercise offered a valuable opportunity to evaluate SOFIE under simulated operational conditions. On-site interactive feedback from SWPC forecasters, Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG) console operators, Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) personnel, and Moon-to-Mars Space Weather Analysis Office (M2M SWAO) analysts led to significant strategic improvements in the model configuration. The simulation grid was optimized by combining a coarser background grid with higher-resolution regions along the CME path and toward Earth, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. In this work, we present the simulated operational performance of SOFIE and its capability to predict SEP fluxes significantly faster than real time. During the SWPT exercise, SOFIE completed a 4-day SEP simulation within 5 hours using 1,000 central processing unit cores, although the earliest SEP forecast was obtained a few hours after CME onset. This marks a milestone in demonstrating SOFIE's operational usefulness and robustness to support future human space exploration.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Post-Red Supergiant binary system AFGL 4106 and its complex nebula with SPHERE/VLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: We aim to characterize the physical and morphological properties of the binary system AFGL 4106, composed of two evolved massive stars. Understanding its mass-loss processes and circumstellar environment offers insight into the late stages of stellar evolution in massive binary systems. Methods: We obtained high-angular--resolution, high-contrast imaging using VLT/SPHERE with ZIMPOL (optical) and IRDIS (near-infrared) across multiple filters. We used aperture photometry to extract the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of each star, and applied radiative transfer modelling to study the system and its surrounding dusty environment. Results: The observations resolve both components of the binary and unveil a complex, dusty nebula featuring asymmetric structures and cavities. SED fitting yields stellar temperatures of T$_1 = 6723\pm196$ K and T$_2 = 3394\pm264$ K, along with bolometric luminosities of L$_1 = (7.9 \pm 0.18) \times 10^4$ L$_\odot$ and L$_2 = (3.8 \pm 0.11) \times 10^4$ L$_\odot$. These values support the classification of the primary as being in a post-red supergiant (post-RSG) phase and the secondary as an active red supergiant (RSG). The luminosity ratio, combined with the inferred radii, indicates that both stars are at close yet distinct stages of their evolution. The binary is surrounded by an extended shell whose asymmetric morphology and large-scale features suggest interaction with the stellar winds and interstellar medium (ISM), and possibly the presence of a third, undetected companion. Conclusions: These observations provide the first resolved view of AFGL 4106's system and its dusty envelope. Our analysis sets constraints on the physical properties and evolutionary status of the system. This work contributes to understanding mass-loss processes in massive binaries and the shaping of nebulae around evolved stars.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of the Initiation of a Coronal Mass Ejection with Multiple Stages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the primary drivers of adverse space-weather events, yet their initiation and onset prediction remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the magnetic topology and physical processes in real solar source regions. Here, based on fully observational-data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we successfully reproduce the initiation of a CME originating from the super active region AR 13663, with only a one-minute time lag between the flare peak in observations and the velocity peak of the rising flux rope in the simulation. Moreover, the eruptive structure exhibits a multi-stage kinematic evolution: an initial slow acceleration, a plateau at a nearly stationary height, and a subsequent impulsive acceleration. These stages correspond to torus instability, the downward tension force exerted by the overlying toroidal field, and fast magnetic reconnection, respectively. Our results highlight the inherently multistage nature of CME initiation in real events. In configurations with strong overlying toroidal fields, the downward toroidal-field-induced tension force can suppress the rise of the flux rope and produce a plateau phase at a nearly stable height, even when torus instability occurs. In contrast, the subsequent fast magnetic reconnection beneath the flux rope can drive the impulsive eruption more effectively. The close agreement between the observed and simulated peak times over one minute demonstrates the strong potential of our data-driven model for predicting CME onset.</description>

      <title>Disappearance of a massive star in the Andromeda Galaxy due to formation of a black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When a massive star reaches the end of its lifetime, its core collapses and releases neutrinos that drive a shock into the outer layers (stellar envelope). A sufficiently strong shock ejects the envelope, producing a supernova. If the shock fails to eject it, the envelope is predicted to fall back onto the collapsing core, producing a stellar-mass black hole (BH) and causing the star to disappear. We report observations of M31-2014-DS1, a hydrogen-depleted supergiant in the Andromeda Galaxy. In 2014 it brightened in the mid-infrared. From 2017 to 2022 it faded by factors of $\gtrsim10^4$ in optical light, becoming undetectable, and $\gtrsim10$ in total light. We interpret these observations, and those of a previous event in NGC 6946, as evidence for failed supernovae forming stellar-mass BHs.</description>

      <title>The democratic detrender: Ensemble-Based Removal of the Nuisance Signal in Stellar Time-Series Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, precise, and computationally efficient removal of unwanted activity that exists as a combination of periodic, quasi-periodic, and non-periodic systematic trends in time-series photometric data is a critical step in exoplanet transit analysis. Throughout the years, many different modeling methods have been used for this process, often called "detrending." However, there is no community-wide consensus regarding the favored approach. In order to mitigate model dependency, we present an ensemble-based approach to detrending via community-of-models and the democratic detrender: a modular and scalable open-source coding package that implements ensemble detrending. The democratic detrender allows users to select from a number of packaged detrending methods (including cosine filtering, Gaussian processes, and polynomial fits) or provide their own set of detrended light curves via methods of their choosing. It then combines the individually detrended light curves into a single method marginalized light curve. Additionally, the democratic detrender inflates each data point's uncertainty based on the scatter between detrenders, thereby propagating model-selection uncertainty into the final light curve. This ensemble strategy does not guarantee improvement over the single best-performing detrending method, but it substantially reduces the risk of selecting a detrending solution that is poorly calibrated or overfit to noise.</description>

      <title>Sufficient and Necessary Conditions for Collective Neutrino Instability: Fast, Slow, and Mixed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino oscillations exhibit instabilities that induce appreciable flavor conversion, with crucial astrophysical implications. While the importance of initial phase-space distributions is well-established, a general instability criterion for distributions dependent on both energy and emission angle has been lacking. We identify and analyze the sufficient (and necessary) conditions for a generic collective neutrino flavor instability.</description>

      <title>Supernovae drive large-scale, incompressible turbulence through small-scale instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sources of turbulence in our Galaxy may be diverse, but core-collapse supernovae (SNe) alone provide enough energy to sustain a steady-state galactic turbulence cascade at the observed velocity dispersion. By localizing and analyzing supernova remnants (SNRs) in high-resolution SN-driven galactic disk cut-out simulations from Beattie et al. 2025, I show that isolated SNRs source incompressible turbulence through baroclinic vorticity generation localized at the unstable contact discontinuity. Through the spherical harmonic power spectrum of the corrugations, I provide evidence that this process is seeded by surface instabilities and 2D turbulence on the shell, which corrugates and folds the interface, becoming the strongest source of baroclinicity in the simulations. I present an analytical relation for a baroclinicity-fed incompressible mode (co)spectrum, which matches that observed in the simulated SNRs, and reveals a $\propto k^{3/4}$ spectrum that drives the turbulence. I show that vortex stretching allows for modes to be shed from the contact discontinuity into the surrounding medium and derive a timescale criterion for this process, revealing that young SNRs with radii close to the cooling radius are efficient at radiating turbulence. The unstable layer produces a spectrum of incompressible modes $\propto k^{-3/2}$ locally within the SNRs. Through the inverse cascade mechanism revealed in Beattie et al. 2025, this opens the possibility that the $k^{-3/2}$ spectrum, arising from corrugated folds in the unstable layer, imprints itself on kiloparsec scales, thereby connecting small-scale structure in the layer to the large-scale incompressible turbulence cascade.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Kinematic Structure in the Young Association Serpens OB2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Serpens OB2 association (l ~ 18.5 deg, b ~ 1.9 deg, d = 1950 +/- 30 pc) is a large star-forming complex ~65 pc above the Galactic midplane, with a clumpy, elongated structure extending ~50 pc parallel to the plane. We analyse probable association members, including OB stars and low-to-intermediate-mass young stellar objects (YSOs) from the SPICY catalogue. We use 13CO MWISP data to trace the molecular clouds. The OB stars are concentrated toward the centre of the association, coincident with a gap in the molecular clouds, and toward the side nearest the Galactic plane. The YSOs are distributed throughout the association, but cluster around molecular-cloud clumps. Using Gaia DR3 proper motions to probe the association's internal kinematics, we find aligned stellar velocities on length scales &lt;2 pc, two-point statistics that show increasing velocity differences and predominantly divergent motions at larger separations, and distinct velocities for star clusters within the association. Finally, the association exhibits gradual but statistically significant global expansion perpendicular to the Galactic plane, with a spatial gradient of 0.10 +/- 0.02 km/s/pc. The clumpy stellar distribution, correlated velocities on small scales, and increasingly divergent motions on larger scales are consistent with an initial velocity field inherited from a turbulent molecular cloud modified by stellar feedback. The global vertical expansion may arise from large-scale turbulence or feedback-driven shell expansion, with the H II region Sh 2-54 preferentially pushing the molecular gas away from the Galactic plane. Ser OB2 demonstrates that the multi-scale expansion of an OB association can begin even while star formation is still ongoing throughout the complex.</description>
