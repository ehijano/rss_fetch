      <title>Risk-Prone and Risk-Averse Behavior in Natural Emergencies: An Appraisal Theory Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper examines social media content to measure and model risk behavior in natural emergencies from an appraisal theory perspective. We calculate individual risk behavior quotients and relate them to individual and peer emotional and actionable cognitive responses for 774 individual Twitter users affected by the Sandy hurricane landfall. We employ vector analysis to compute risk behavior quotients. By utilizing geographic information associated with the tweets, both implicitly and explicitly, we track each user's path and determine the average vector of their movement. The risk quotient is obtained by comparing risk exposure at the origin and destination of the average vector. We assess risk exposure for each zone in the study area by combining pre-hurricane evacuation plans with post-event flooding data, as reported by the National Weather Service. By using the emotional and actionable content of the tweets as predictors for risk, we found that sharing actionable information relates to slightly higher risk exposure. At the same time, overall, the subjects tended to move away from the riskiest areas of the storm. Finally, individuals surrounded by more peers are less likely to be affected, while those surrounded by more tweeting activity are more likely to be affected risk-prone.</description>

      <title>Limiting Disease Spreading in Human Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outbreak of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, causes major health crises worldwide. Typical measures to contain the rapid spread usually include effective vaccination and strict interventions (Nature Human Behaviour, 2021). Motivated by such circumstances, we study the problem of limiting the spread of a disease over a social network system.
  In their seminal work (KDD 2003), Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos introduced two fundamental diffusion models, the linear threshold and independent cascade, for the influence maximization problem. In this work, we adopt these models in the context of disease spreading and study effective vaccination mechanisms. Our broad goal is to limit the spread of a disease in human networks using only a limited number of vaccines. However, unlike the influence maximization problem, which typically does not require spatial awareness, disease spreading occurs in spatially structured population networks. Thus, standard Erdos-Renyi graphs do not adequately capture such networks. To address this, we study networks modeled as generalized random geometric graphs, introduced in the seminal work of Waxman (IEEE J. Sel. Areas Commun. 1988).
  We show that for disease spreading, the optimization function is neither submodular nor supermodular, in contrast to influence maximization, where the function is submodular. Despite this intractability, we develop novel algorithms leveraging local search and greedy techniques, which perform exceptionally well in practice. We compare them against an exact ILP-based approach to further demonstrate their robustness. Moreover, we introduce an iterative rounding mechanism for the relaxed LP formulation. Overall, our methods establish tight trade-offs between efficiency and approximation loss.</description>

      <title>A Perspective on the Ubiquity of Interaction Streams in Human Realm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typically, for analysing and modelling social phenomena, networks are a convenient framework that allows for the representation of the interconnectivity of individuals. These networks are often considered transmission structures for processes that happen in society, e.g. diffusion of information, epidemics, and spread of influence. However, constructing a network can be challenging, as one needs to choose its type and parameters accurately. As a result, the outcomes of analysing dynamic processes often heavily depend on whether this step was done correctly. In this work, we advocate that it might be more beneficial to step down from the tedious process of building a network and base it on the level of the interactions instead. By taking this perspective, we can be closer to reality, and from the cognitive perspective, human beings are directly exposed to events, not networks. However, we can also draw a parallel to stream data mining, which brings a valuable apparatus for stream processing. Apart from taking the interaction stream perspective as a typical way in which we should study social phenomena, this work advocates that it is possible to map the concepts embodied in human nature and cognitive processes to the ones that occur in interaction streams. Exploiting this mapping can help reduce the diversity of problems that one can find in data stream processing for machine learning problems. Finally, we demonstrate one of the use cases in which the interaction stream perspective can be applied, namely, the social learning process.</description>

      <title>Do Researchers Benefit Career-wise from Involvement in International Policy Guideline Development?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers are no longer limited to producing knowledge; in today's complex world, they also address societal challenges by engaging in policymaking. Although involvement in policymaking has expanded, direct empirical evidence of its career benefits remains underexplored. Prior survey-based studies suggest potential advantages-such as broader professional networks and enhanced opportunities-yet raise concerns about insufficient institutional support. Here, we examine the 2021 WHO global air quality guideline-a science-based regulatory guideline-as a case study. To evaluate the impact of guideline development on research outcomes, we match guideline researchers with a control group of peers sharing similar research topics and prior performance. Our analysis reveals that guideline researchers attain higher future citation counts in both academic and policy domains. New collaborations formed during development yield publications with higher citation impact and the disruptive index. Moreover, about half the guideline's references are derived from guideline researchers' papers, highlighting their central role in shaping the evidence base. These results provide empirical support for the career benefits of policy engagement. Our findings indicate that engaging in international guideline development offers tangible career incentives for researchers, and that institutions can enhance research impact and promote innovative scientific progress by actively supporting their researchers' participation in such initiatives.</description>

      <title>Learning to Lie: Reinforcement Learning Attacks Damage Human-AI Teams and Teams of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) assistants become more widely adopted in safety-critical domains, it becomes important to develop safeguards against potential failures or adversarial attacks. A key prerequisite to developing these safeguards is understanding the ability of these AI assistants to mislead human teammates. We investigate this attack problem within the context of an intellective strategy game where a team of three humans and one AI assistant collaborate to answer a series of trivia questions. Unbeknownst to the humans, the AI assistant is adversarial. Leveraging techniques from Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL), the AI assistant learns a model of the humans' trust evolution and uses that model to manipulate the group decision-making process to harm the team. We evaluate two models -- one inspired by literature and the other data-driven -- and find that both can effectively harm the human team. Moreover, we find that in this setting our data-driven model is capable of accurately predicting how human agents appraise their teammates given limited information on prior interactions. Finally, we compare the performance of state-of-the-art LLM models to human agents on our influence allocation task to evaluate whether the LLMs allocate influence similarly to humans or if they are more robust to our attack. These results enhance our understanding of decision-making dynamics in small human-AI teams and lay the foundation for defense strategies.</description>

      <title>HyperMAN: Hypergraph-enhanced Meta-learning Adaptive Network for Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation aims to predict users' next locations by leveraging historical check-in sequences. Although existing methods have shown promising results, they often struggle to capture complex high-order relationships and effectively adapt to diverse user behaviors, particularly when addressing the cold-start issue. To address these challenges, we propose Hypergraph-enhanced Meta-learning Adaptive Network (HyperMAN), a novel framework that integrates heterogeneous hypergraph modeling with a difficulty-aware meta-learning mechanism for next POI recommendation. Specifically, three types of heterogeneous hyperedges are designed to capture high-order relationships: user visit behaviors at specific times (Temporal behavioral hyperedge), spatial correlations among POIs (spatial functional hyperedge), and user long-term preferences (user preference hyperedge). Furthermore, a diversity-aware meta-learning mechanism is introduced to dynamically adjust learning strategies, considering users behavioral diversity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HyperMAN achieves superior performance, effectively addressing cold start challenges and significantly enhancing recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Reflection on Code Contributor Demographics and Collaboration Patterns in the Rust Communit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-source software communities thrive on global collaboration and contributions from diverse participants. This study explores the Rust programming language ecosystem to understand its contributors' demographic composition and interaction patterns. Our objective is to investigate the phenomenon of participation inequality in key Rust projects and the presence of diversity among them. We studied GitHub pull request data from the year leading up to the release of the latest completed Rust community annual survey in 2023. Specifically, we extracted information from three leading repositories: Rust, Rust Analyzer, and Cargo, and used social network graphs to visualize the interactions and identify central contributors and sub-communities. Social network analysis has shown concerning disparities in gender and geographic representation among contributors who play pivotal roles in collaboration networks and the presence of varying diversity levels in the sub-communities formed. These results suggest that while the Rust community is globally active, the contributor base does not fully reflect the diversity of the wider user community. We conclude that there is a need for more inclusive practices to encourage broader participation and ensure that the contributor base aligns more closely with the diverse global community that utilizes Rust.</description>

      <title>Large Engagement Networks for Classifying Coordinated Campaigns and Organic Twitter Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media users and inauthentic accounts, such as bots, may coordinate in promoting their topics. Such topics may give the impression that they are organically popular among the public, even though they are astroturfing campaigns that are centrally managed. It is challenging to predict if a topic is organic or a coordinated campaign due to the lack of reliable ground truth. In this paper, we create such ground truth by detecting the campaigns promoted by ephemeral astroturfing attacks. These attacks push any topic to Twitter's (X) trends list by employing bots that tweet in a coordinated manner in a short period and then immediately delete their tweets. We manually curate a dataset of organic Twitter trends. We then create engagement networks out of these datasets which can serve as a challenging testbed for graph classification task to distinguish between campaigns and organic trends. Engagement networks consist of users as nodes and engagements as edges (retweets, replies, and quotes) between users. We release the engagement networks for 179 campaigns and 135 non-campaigns, and also provide finer-grain labels to characterize the type of the campaigns and non-campaigns. Our dataset, LEN (Large Engagement Networks), is available in the URL below. In comparison to traditional graph classification datasets, which are small with tens of nodes and hundreds of edges at most, graphs in LEN are larger. The average graph in LEN has ~11K nodes and ~23K edges. We show that state-of-the-art GNN methods give only mediocre results for campaign vs. non-campaign and campaign type classification on LEN. LEN offers a unique and challenging playfield for the graph classification problem. We believe that LEN will help advance the frontiers of graph classification techniques on large networks and also provide an interesting use case in terms of distinguishing coordinated campaigns and organic trends.</description>

      <title>A Social Dynamical System for Twitter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of public opinion is crucial for informed decision-making in various domains, particularly public affairs. The rapid growth of social networks, such as Twitter (now rebranded as X), provides an unprecedented opportunity to analyze public opinion at scale without relying on traditional surveys. With the rise of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling online opinion dynamics. Notably, classical opinion dynamics models, such as DeGroot, can be reformulated within a GNN framework.
  We introduce Latent Social Dynamical System (LSDS), a novel framework for modeling the latent dynamics of social media users' opinions based on textual content. Since expressed opinions may not fully reflect underlying beliefs, LSDS first encodes post content into latent representations. It then leverages a GraphODE framework, using a GNN-based ODE function to predict future opinions. A decoder subsequently utilizes these predicted latent opinions to perform downstream tasks, such as interaction prediction, which serve as benchmarks for model evaluation. Our framework is highly flexible, supporting various opinion dynamic models as ODE functions, provided they can be adapted into a GNN-based form. It also accommodates different encoder architectures and is compatible with diverse downstream tasks.
  To validate our approach, we constructed dynamic datasets from Twitter data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LSDS, highlighting its potential for future applications. We plan to publicly release our dataset and code upon the publication of this paper.</description>

      <title>LLMs generate structurally realistic social networks but overestimate political homophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating social networks is essential for many applications, such as epidemic modeling and social simulations. The emergence of generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), offers new possibilities for social network generation: LLMs can generate networks without additional training or need to define network parameters, and users can flexibly define individuals in the network using natural language. However, this potential raises two critical questions: 1) are the social networks generated by LLMs realistic, and 2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to a suite of real social networks. We find that more realistic networks are generated with "local" methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to "global" methods that construct the entire network at once. We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, connectivity, and degree distribution. However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and significantly overestimate political homophily compared to real social networks.</description>
