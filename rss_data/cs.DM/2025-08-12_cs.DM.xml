      <title>Optimal Representation for Right-to-Left Parallel Scalar Point Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an optimal representation for a right-to-left parallel elliptic curve scalar point multiplication. The right-to-left approach is easier to parallelize than the conventional left-to-right approach. However, unlike the left-to-right approach, there is still no work considering number representations for the right-to-left parallel calculation. By simplifying the implementation by Robert, we devise a mathematical model to capture the computation time of the calculation. Then, for any arbitrary amount of doubling time and addition time, we propose algorithms to generate representations which minimize the time in that model. As a result, we can show a negative result that a conventional representation like NAF is almost optimal. The parallel computation time obtained from any representation cannot be better than NAF by more than 1%.</description>

      <title>GDBA Revisited: Unleashing the Power of Guided Local Search for Distributed Constraint Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local search is an important class of incomplete algorithms for solving Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) but it often converges to poor local optima. While GDBA provides a comprehensive rule set to escape premature convergence, its empirical benefits remain marginal on general-valued problems. In this work, we systematically examine GDBA and identify three factors that potentially lead to its inferior performance, i.e., over-aggressive constraint violation conditions, unbounded penalty accumulation, and uncoordinated penalty updates. To address these issues, we propose Distributed Guided Local Search (DGLS), a novel GLS framework for DCOPs that incorporates an adaptive violation condition to selectively penalize constraints with high cost, a penalty evaporation mechanism to control the magnitude of penalization, and a synchronization scheme for coordinated penalty updates. We theoretically show that the penalty values are bounded, and agents play a potential game in our DGLS. Our extensive empirical results on various standard benchmarks demonstrate the great superiority of DGLS over state-of-the-art baselines. Particularly, compared to Damped Max-sum with high damping factors (e.g., 0.7 or 0.9), our DGLS achieves competitive performance on general-valued problems, and outperforms it by significant margins (\textbf{3.77\%--66.3\%}) on structured problems in terms of anytime results.</description>

      <title>Convergence Sans Synchronization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We currently see a steady rise in the usage and size of multiprocessor systems, and so the community is evermore interested in developing fast parallel processing algorithms. However, most algorithms require a synchronization mechanism, which is costly in terms of computational resources and time. If an algorithm can be executed in asynchrony, then it can use all the available computation power, and the nodes can execute without being scheduled or locked. However, to show that an algorithm guarantees convergence in asynchrony, we need to generate the entire global state transition graph and check for the absence of cycles. This takes time exponential in the size of the global state space. In this dissertation, we present a theory that explains the necessary and sufficient properties of a multiprocessor algorithm that guarantees convergence even without synchronization. We develop algorithms for various problems that do not require synchronization. Additionally, we show for several existing algorithms that they can be executed without any synchronization mechanism. A significant theoretical benefit of our work is in proving that an algorithm can converge even in asynchrony. Our theory implies that we can make such conclusions about an algorithm, by only showing that the local state transition graph of a computing node forms a partial order, rather than generating the entire global state space and determining the absence of cycles in it. Thus, the complexity of rendering such proofs, formal or social, is phenomenally reduced. Experiments show a significant reduction in time taken to converge, when we compare the execution time of algorithms in the literature versus the algorithms that we design. We get similar results when we run an algorithm, that guarantees convergence in asynchrony, under a scheduler versus in asynchrony.</description>

      <title>Block encoding the 3D heterogeneous Poisson equation with application to fracture flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum linear system (QLS) algorithms offer the potential to solve large-scale linear systems exponentially faster than classical methods. However, applying QLS algorithms to real-world problems remains challenging due to issues such as state preparation, data loading, and efficient information extraction. In this work, we study the feasibility of applying QLS algorithms to solve discretized three-dimensional heterogeneous Poisson equations, with specific examples relating to groundwater flow through geologic fracture networks. We explicitly construct a block encoding for the 3D heterogeneous Poisson matrix by leveraging the sparse local structure of the discretized operator. While classical solvers benefit from preconditioning, we show that block encoding the system matrix and preconditioner separately does not improve the effective condition number that dominates the QLS runtime. This differs from classical approaches where the preconditioner and the system matrix can often be implemented independently. Nevertheless, due to the structure of the problem in three dimensions, the quantum algorithm achieves a runtime of $O(N^{2/3} \ \text{polylog } N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$, outperforming the best classical methods (with runtimes of $O(N \log N \cdot \log(1/\epsilon))$) and offering exponential memory savings. These results highlight both the promise and limitations of QLS algorithms for practical scientific computing, and point to effective condition number reduction as a key barrier in achieving quantum advantages.</description>

      <title>A Globally Optimal Analytic Solution for Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization with Nonnegative or Mixed Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (semi-NMF) extends classical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) by allowing the basis matrix to contain both positive and negative entries, making it suitable for decomposing data with mixed signs. However, most existing semi-NMF algorithms are iterative, non-convex, and prone to local minima. In this paper, we propose a novel method that yields a globally optimal solution to the semi-NMF problem under the Frobenius norm, through an orthogonal decomposition derived from the scatter matrix of the input data. We rigorously prove that our solution attains the global minimum of the reconstruction error. Furthermore, we demonstrate that when the input matrix is nonnegative, our method often achieves lower reconstruction error than standard NMF algorithms, although unfortunately the basis matrix may not satisfy nonnegativity. In particular, in low-rank cases such as rank 1 or 2, our solution reduces exactly to a nonnegative factorization, recovering the NMF structure. We validate our approach through experiments on both synthetic data and the UCI Wine dataset, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing NMF and semi-NMF methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. These results confirm that our globally optimal, non-iterative formulation offers both theoretical guarantees and empirical advantages, providing a new perspective on matrix factorization in optimization and data analysis.</description>

      <title>IP Models for Minimum Zero Forcing Sets, Forts, and Related Graph Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero forcing is a binary coloring game on a graph where a set of filled vertices can force non-filled vertices to become filled following a color change rule. In 2008, the zero forcing number of a graph was shown to be an upper bound on its maximum nullity. In addition, the combinatorial optimization problem for the zero forcing number was shown to be NP-hard. Since then, the study of zero forcing and its related parameters has received considerable attention. In 2018, the forts of a graph were defined as non-empty subsets of vertices where no vertex outside the set has exactly one neighbor in the set. Forts have been used to model zero forcing as an integer program and provide lower bounds on the zero forcing number. To date, three integer programming models have been developed for the zero forcing number of a graph: the Infection Model, Time Step Model, and Fort Cover Model. In this article, we present variations of these models for computing the zero forcing number and related graph parameters, such as the minimum and maximum propagation times, throttling number, and fractional zero forcing number. In addition, we present several new models for computing the realized propagation time interval, all minimal forts of a graph, and the fort number of a graph. We conclude with several numerical experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our models when applied to small and medium order graphs. Moreover, we provide experimental evidence for several open conjectures regarding the propagation time interval, the number of minimal forts, the fort number, and the fractional zero forcing number of a graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brouwer conjecture (BC) in spectral graph theory claims that the sum of the largest k Kirchhoff eigenvalues of a graph are bounded above by the number m of edges plus k(k+1)/2. We show that (BC) holds for all graphs with n vertices if n is larger or equal than 4 times the square of the maximal vertex degree. We also note that the weaker upper bound m+k(k+1) holds unconditionally. We also note that (BC) for graphs implies (BC) for quivers.</description>

      <title>Coloring Graphs with no Totally Odd Clique Immersion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that graphs that do not contain a totally odd immersion of $K_t$ are $\mathcal{O}(t)$-colorable. In particular, we show that any graph with no totally odd immersion of $K_t$ is the union of a bipartite graph and a graph which forbids an immersion of $K_{\mathcal{O}(t)}$. Our results are algorithmic, and we give a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm (in $t$) to find such a decomposition.</description>

      <title>Homomorphisms of (n,m)-graphs with respect to generalised switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of homomorphisms of $(n,m)$-graphs, that is, adjacency preserving vertex mappings of graphs with $n$ types of arcs and $m$ types of edges was initiated by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Raspaud in 2000. Later, some attempts were made to generalize the switch operation that is popularly used in the study of signed graphs, and study its effect on the above mentioned homomorphism.
  In this article, we too provide a generalization of the switch operation on $(n,m)$-graphs, which to the best of our knowledge, encapsulates all the previously known generalizations as special cases. We approach the study of homomorphisms with respect to the switch operation axiomatically. We prove some fundamental results that are essential tools in the further study of this topic. In the process of proving the fundamental results, we have provided yet another solution to an open problem posed by Klostermeyer and MacGillivray in 2004. We also prove the existence of a categorical product for $(n,m)$-graphs with respect to a particular class of generalized switch which implicitly uses category theory. This is a counter intuitive solution as the number of vertices in the Categorical product of two $(n,m)$-graphs on $p$ and $q$ vertices has a multiple of $pq$ many vertices, where the multiple depends on the switch. This solves an open question asked by Brewster in the PEPS 2012 workshop as a corollary. We also provide a way to calculate the product explicitly, and prove general properties of the product. We define the analog of chromatic number for $(n,m)$-graphs with respect to generalized switch and explore the interrelations between chromatic numbers with respect to different switch operations. We find the value of this chromatic number for the family of forests using group theoretic notions.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Parameterized Algorithms for Chemical Descriptors based on Molecular Graph Sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present efficient combinatorial parameterized algorithms for several classical graph-based counting problems in computational chemistry, including (i) Kekule structures, (ii) the Hosoya index, (iii) the Merrifield-Simmons index, and (iv) Graph entropy based on matchings and independent sets. All these problems were known to be #P-complete. Building on the intuition that molecular graphs are often sparse and tree-like, we provide fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms using treewidth as our parameter. We also provide extensive experimental results over the entire PubChem database of chemical compounds, containing more than 113 million real-world molecules. In our experiments, we observe that the molecules are indeed sparse and tree-like, with more than 99.9% of them having a treewidth of at most 5. This justifies our choice of parameter. Our experiments also illustrate considerable improvements over the previous approaches. Based on these results, we argue that parameterized algorithms, especially based on treewidth, should be adopted as the default approach for problems in computational chemistry that are defined over molecular graphs.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Majority Dynamics on Binomial Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study information aggregation in networks when agents interact to learn a binary state of the world. Initially each agent privately observes an independent signal which is "correct" with probability $\frac{1}{2}+\delta$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$. At each round, a node is selected uniformly at random to update their public opinion to match the majority of their neighbours (breaking ties in favour of their initial private signal). Our main result shows that for sparse and connected binomial random graphs $\mathcal G(n,p)$ the process stabilizes in a "correct" consensus in $\mathcal O(n\log^2 n/\log\log n)$ steps with high probability. In fact, when $\log n/n \ll p = o(1)$ the process terminates at time $\hat T = (1+o(1))n\log n$, where $\hat T$ is the first time when all nodes have been selected at least once. However, in dense binomial random graphs with $p=\Omega(1)$, there is an information cascade where the process terminates in the "incorrect" consensus with probability bounded away from zero.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Transforming DAGs within the I-LCA Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the connections between clusters and least common ancestors (LCAs) in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), focusing on the interplay between so-called $I$-lca-relevant DAGs and DAGs with the $I$-lca-property. Here, $I$ denotes a set of integers. In $I$-lca-relevant DAGs, each vertex is the unique LCA for some subset $A$ of leaves of size $|A|\in I$, whereas in a DAG with the $I$-lca-property there exists a unique LCA for every subset $A$ of leaves satisfying $|A|\in I$. We elaborate on the difference between these two properties and establish their close relationship to pre-$I$-ary and $I$-ary set systems. This, in turn, generalizes results established for (pre-)binary and $k$-ary set systems. Moreover, we build upon recently established results that use a simple operator $\ominus$, enabling the transformation of arbitrary DAGs into $I$-lca-relevant DAGs. This process reduces unnecessary complexity while preserving key structural properties of the original DAG. The set $C_G$ consists of all clusters in a DAG $G$, where clusters correspond to the descendant leaves of vertices. While in some cases $C_H = C_G$ when transforming $G$ into an $I$-lca-relevant DAG $H$, it often happens that certain clusters in $C_G$ do not appear as clusters in $H$. To understand this phenomenon in detail, we characterize the subset of clusters in $C_G$ that remain in $H$ for DAGs $G$ with the $I$-lca-property. Furthermore, we show that the set $W$ of vertices required to transform $G$ into $H = G \ominus W$ is uniquely determined for such DAGs. This, in turn, allows us to show that the ``shortcut-free'' version of the transformed DAG $H$ is always a tree or a galled-tree whenever $C_G$ represents the clustering system of a tree or galled-tree and $G$ has the $I$-lca-property. In the latter case $C_H = C_G$ always holds.</description>

      <title>A Direct Proof of the Short-Side Advantage in Random Matching Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stable matching problem under the random matching model where the preferences of the doctors and hospitals are sampled uniformly and independently at random. In a balanced market with $n$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm gives doctors an expected rank of order $\log n$ for their partners and hospitals an expected rank of order $\frac{n}{\log n}$ for their partners. This situation is reversed in an unbalanced market with $n+1$ doctors and $n$ hospitals, a phenomenon known as the short-side advantage. The current proofs of this fact are indirect, counter-intuitively being based upon analyzing the hospital-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. In this paper we provide a direct proof of the short-side advantage, explicitly analyzing the doctor-proposal deferred-acceptance algorithm. Our proof sheds light on how and why the phenomenon arises.</description>
